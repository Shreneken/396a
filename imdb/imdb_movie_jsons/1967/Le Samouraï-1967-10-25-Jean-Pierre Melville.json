            "content": "For once, a bad guy who really acts like a bad guy should! This hit-man is one cold, non-descript and calculating man who plans and executes his hit with the utmost precision. About the only character I remember who did a more thorough job was the hit-man in Day of the Jackal. The police also seem very bright and competent--and repeatedly nearly trip up the baddie (Jef). Because of all this realism, I strongly commend this movie. On top of the realism, I really liked the ending. All in all, a fine film and there are no negatives that I can think of--except that this type of film is probably NOT everyone's cup of tea, so to speak. There really isn't any romance and no one is particularly likable, but what do you expect in a film like this?",

            "content": "To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \nHis only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.",

            "review_title": "May be my favorite Melville film with a style that has inspired some, but is hard to match",
            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.",

            "content": "Melville's masterpiece about a contract killer, a modern day samura\u00ef. He makes brilliant use of the city he loved so much, Paris. The feel, the sounds, the streets, the noise, it's all hauntingly cold and distant but at the same time he makes Paris seem like the coolest city in the world. In the beginning of the film Melville uses a beautiful static shot of over 4 minutes to establish the audience with a seemingly empty room, then we see smoke circling upwards. There must be someone in the room but it's practically impossible to determine where the smoke is coming from. Finally Jeff Costello gets up from his bed, which wasn't recognizable as such in the first place, and appears on screen. The whole set-up is more reminiscent of a moving replica of a painting by the surrealist Paul Delvaux than anything else in modern cinema. Another surreal set piece is when after his first hit, all possible suspects are brought in at a police station, including Delon himself. Not one by one but all of 'em at the same time. In the next scene we see at least a hundred \"gangsters\", all wearing trench coats and hats, in a large hall, where they will be interrogated \"en plein public\". Genuinely strange procedures but handled with such care and stylishness that it becomes completely believable. It gives the somewhat humorous suggestion that the streets of Paris are populated by hundreds, even thousands, of trenchcoat-wearing gangsters, all loners, only seeing each other at card games and occasions like this.Alain Delon is the perfect embodiment of gangster coolness in this career-defining role as a hit-man in Paris, a modern-day samura\u00ef. \"Le Gangster\", as the French lovingly call them. Off course, these gangsters don't exist anymore and they probably never existed at all. French Gangsters must have been redefining their look after seeing Delon in this film. His association in real life with French criminal circles, in particular the Marseille underworld, has always given his performances a very strange aura.As a kid, I regularly visited my grandmother who lived near the city of Marseille and on French television I saw lots of French gangster movies (well, my parents let me watch with them). Alain Delon was in quite a few of them. When I grew older and could identify most of the French screen legends, Delon as no other came to represent the ultimate gangster. An stylized icon of urban cool. I'm also convinced that his character Jef Costello in Le Samoura\u00ef was the inspiration for the hissing and whispering fellow in the trench coat in Sesame Street (did he have a name?), something like a gangster, a criminal. A mysterious strange man you should avoid as a kid. I'll be damned if I'm wrong, but I still see Alain Delon in Sesame Street!",

I have to say though, the only thing samurai about the film was its title, and it's telling that even the quote from the Bushido at the beginning is fake.",

            "review_title": "An Iconically Silky French Cocktail",
            "content": "Alain Delon has had it. It's 1967, he's sitting on the hot seat of France's famed movie series, Monsieur Cin\u00e9ma, and he's promoting Le Samoura\u00ef. \"We have the great pleasure of welcoming Alain Delon to our show,\" the host says, looking in his guest's direction. \"Alain Delon is in the spotlight because 'Le Samoura\u00ef' is opening this week.\" But the ambiance doesn't feel like a respected Inside the Actors Studio precursor; it feels more like a talk show, and Delon isn't in a good mood. He's been better known for his looks than his talents for his entire career. He's proud of the work he has done in acclaimed works like Purple Noon and The Leopard, but he finds himself taken less seriously than he'd like to be simply because he resembles a suave Dolce & Gabbana model. The Male Bardot, they call him. But he's 32. He doesn't want to be labeled as a pretty boy who somehow gets enviable parts any longer. So instead of saying thank you to his host's polite but slightly condescending introduction, he elaborates on the date of the film's opening. \"It's this Wednesday,\" he smirks. Aware of his guest's snarky mood, the host tries to pick himself back up. \"The posters are all over Paris, and they're very striking. 'Le Samoura\u00ef', in big, black letters.\"\"Red,\" Delon interrupts before his interviewer can even say \"letters.\" He's seen it all before: the host who actually knows nothing about the film but pretends to love it, the host who puts on a grin in order to appease disinterested viewers. Maybe he would have let this fly in the past, but Le Samoura\u00ef is far too important to him. He believes it to be a turning point in his undermined career. This isn't just some fluffy movie audiences hear about on a television program like it's Dean Martin's newest vehicle; this is \"a work of art,\" he puts it. \"A true auteur film in every aspect.\"He goes on to discuss the ins-and-outs of the film with the watchful eye of an obsessed movie buff, and it's unlike anything we've seen Delon do before, personally or professionally. He's always been the confident kid that whisks by with a hint of danger, an exotic woman by his side. This image, along with the entire introduction of this review, may or may not be dramatized speculation on my part, but when I picture Delon, I picture him as the guy from L'Eclisse, fiendishly charismatic but in a tug-of-war between boyhood and the idea of an adulthood in which being taken seriously is everything.Jean-Pierre Melville uses Delon in a way most directors would be afraid to attempt. Before, Delon's charm was his selling point, but in Le Samoura\u00ef, his allure is snatched from him. Melville takes away any ounce of precious dialogue in favor of a more nuanced approach, forcing Delon to embody a particularly cryptic character mostly through body language. In the past, actors in gangster films have been able to mangle the script and somehow spike their delivery to sound more menacing than usual. But Delon has to do something even harder, having to exude invincibility all the while keeping an icy exterior. People turn towards scenery-chewing performances when thinking about characterizations that \"moved\" them; in contrast Delon has done something masterful with subtlety, undoubtedly more impressive than the booming Shakespearian actors that began to creep out during the 1960s.We see Costello go through his daily rituals, putting on his trench coat and fedora with strange precision, keying a car to get some extra loot, later pulling a job at a nightclub. Throughout the film, he doesn't show the slightest smidgen of a feeling. Is he numb? In denial? Truthfully, it doesn't matter. Though the storyline sees his normally smooth routine being interrupted by an investigation, he doesn't seem worried about the government closing in on his every move. He is so far into a life of crime that dying for his cause doesn't seem all that bad.This is probably why the film is called Le Samoura\u00ef, as the samurais in all those Asian epics were more than willing to lose their lives in order to appease their reputations and their peers. Unlike Melville's earlier projects, Le Samoura\u00ef doesn't have the same blatant criminal romanticism. It's slick and crystalline, yes, but every frame carries enough tension to suggest that Dolph Lundgren might come out of the shadows and Machine Gun Kelly everyone to death. A tragic ending is a given. Silence is cherished in the film; along with Delon's moodless characterization, the facsimile of scenic solitude is furthered. The greyed-out style, Melville's intricate direction, and, of course, Delon's performance, work together with astonishing virtuosity.The only complaint I ever find myself having with Melville films is how untouchable they are. They feel miles apart from us, detached, so stylish that we grow to be more appreciative than adoring. But there is no denying how great a filmmaker Melville is. \"He's the greatest director I've had the good fortune, pleasure, and honor to work with up to this point,\" Delon dryly gushes later on in the Monsieur Cin\u00e9ma interview. It sounds dramatic, but sometimes, melodrama can be true. Melville is not just a guy with a dream; he's a visionary, a poet of style. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Melville's masterpiece is pure seduction...",
            "content": "This film starts off with the same sound like Sergio Leone's 'C'era un volta il west', but it's just that here the sound is made not by a plate, but a canary, the cold-blooded killer's canary.This film was made in 1967, the French nouveau vague already apparent all over the place, but with much more subtle undertones than, say, a work by Truffaut.No, Melville's films were old-school, but at the same time revolutionary, in a delicate way. Take for example the 'chase' scene through the Metro. Practically nothing happens: there are no gunfights, no combat sequences, perhaps just a small chase. But it is Melville's camera and Delon's inimitable performance that keep the audience mesmerized all the way.The camera practically flirts with the audience throughout the whole movie, picking the most interesting angles and achieving so much practically without any effort. Delon's character changes his expression only once or twice during the movie, shoots faster than even Leone's gunslingers and never forgets to feed his canary. To me, one of the most accomplished antiheroes of the whole genre.The dialogue is barely there, but when it is, then it's something you'd probably wish you would have come up with yourself. It is a minimalist work that achieves the absolute maximum. Simply put: one of the best crime noirs ever made.",

            "review_title": "'Style over substance' fanatics, brand Le Samourai a 'masterpiece', and you won't be able to convince them otherwise",
            "content": "With perhaps no other film do we see such marked lines of demarcation--a veritable clash of opinion divided into opposing critical camps--than in Jean-Pierre Melville's 'Le Samourai'. What it really comes down to is a civil war between film aficionados who set a sharp dividing line between style and substance. From the outset I must confess I am firmly ensconced in the 'substance' camp and for me, Le Samourai, in the end, fails precisely because it's practically all 'style' and of little 'substance'. Today we have Tarantino, who like Melville, is a film buff and draws upon his vast knowledge of Hollywood films of yesteryear, to create his own new brand of films, a creative amalgam of past and present styles. Both Melville and Tarantino have made films where they are devoted to paying tribute to past classics, particularly in the gangster genre.Melville perhaps is strongest when he puts his quirky, original imprint on what on the surface appears to be an ordinary gangster picture. I'm thinking about the early scene where he has his protagonist, Jef Costello, go through the assortment of keys, one of which will start the car he has stolen; or (as it's pointed out in the DVD extras), how Melville cleverly suggests that Jef has outdrawn the nightclub owner, by immediately cutting from the owner drawing the pistol, to Jef firing his gun, with no footage in between; the struggle at the train station, shot from the odd angle, gazing through the bridge grills and of course the excellent closing scene, so nicely choreographed, with Melville detailing how his hero accomplishes his pre-planned 'suicide by cop'.While I'm perfectly willing to concede Melville has his stylistic 'moments', I part company with the style camp, on a number of fronts. While the 'stylistas' argue that the languid pacing of the movie adds to the overall impact of the narrative, I would argue the opposite. Why must we sit through minutes of the static opening shot of Jef's apartment? Why do 12 minutes go by before anything of any import actually happens (Jef stealing the car)? Why all the mundane shots of Jef walking through the streets and driving his car? Having his license plates switched (twice!)? An enormously long scene of police interrogations and line-up? An unnecessarily long scene of inept cops planting a bug in Jef's apartment? It goes on and on. Perhaps with some judicious editing, Le Samourai could have moved quicker and hence not put some of us to sleep.Le Samourai fails on a much deeper level in that its characters lack depth. Deleon's 'Jef' is perhaps the best example of this lack of character development. His grim countenance becomes tedious throughout the film and we really find out next to nothing about him. I'm not surprised that Madonna wrote a song about Deleon ('Beautiful Killer') and his performance; undoubtedly many women were attracted to Deleon's 'pretty boy' looks (please look at pictures of him now\u2014time has not been kind to once heralded media darling). Jef's death does conform to the Hollywood code: to atone for their sins, a person who has committed evil acts, must sacrifice himself, before the audience can look at him in a good light.The 'Le Samourai' has little to recommend in terms of plot. It's a simple story about a contract killer who murders a man with no back story. The men who are behind the murder, are also complete ciphers. Only the chief detective, played by noted stage actor Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier, proves to have a role of some substance, as he actually comes off as a real police detective. I also liked the late Cathy Rosier, the pianist, who brings grace to a limited part. At a certain point near the end of the story, Jef allows the man who initially attempted to kill him off the hook, after accepting payment of another large amount of money for another contract killing. Why didn't Jef, a contract killer, kill this man? Again, an improbable code of honor posited by Mr. Melville. Of course if Jef is a somnambulist (as one internet poster has suggested), and the whole story is a fantastic dream, then how can anybody have the audacity to question the character's verisimilitude? For those hypnotized by the film's style, it is certain that you will never convince them otherwise, that 'Le Samourai', is a certified masterpiece.",

            "content": "I'm going to go ahead and suggest, in my meager way, some reasons as to why Jean-Pierre Melville's *Le Samourai* is one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's far, far better for you to experience the film for yourself. You now have no more excuses: Criterion has just released it on DVD -- though, puzzlingly, this film doesn't get the deluxe double-disc treatment that the somewhat inferior *Le Cercle Rouge* received. Whatever -- I'll take it.Simply put, *Le Samourai* justifies -- beyond argument -- the auteur theory in cinema, which states, more or less, that the most artistically rich movies are \"authored\" by their directors. And how much more enjoyable it is for the viewer that the author in this case, Melville, is mostly concerned with entertaining you! Those who dread the prospect of a French film from the Sixties can rest assured: no Godardian slap-dash cross-cutting, here; no lolling around in bed with a girl, smoking cigarettes and spouting tough-guy Marxism; no confusing back-and-forth displacement of narrative time, a la Resnais. Oh, Melville was a New Wave director, to be sure, but he was NEVER an experimentalist in terms of narrative. Take a film by Godard, even his most famous film, *Breathless*: you have to meet Godard on his own terms, or get left behind (your loss!) But Melville pours his stories into your glass neat, no ice, no intellectual mixer. *Le Samourai* is about a gun-for-hire named Jef Costello (Alain Delon). His job is to eliminate a nightclub owner. He does so, but is witnessed leaving the scene of the crime by the club's piano player (Cathy Rosier). Later that night, during the police round-up, he's taken in as one of 400 or more potential suspects. The cops can't make it stick to Costello, but the superintendent (Francois Perier) isn't fooled by Costello or his airtight alibi. And thus Costello finds himself under police surveillance, and meanwhile, his criminal bosses want to rub him out in case he squeals to \"le flics\". In other words, the actual story is simplicity itself, and is frankly ripped off from all the B-movie American noirs that Melville loved so much.But none of this explains the stark originality of the movie. Of course, Melville gets some help. Let it be said that Delon is so good as the hunted hit-man that it almost defies description, let alone praise. Reportedly, he took the part after Melville had read to him the first 7 or 8 pages of the script. \"I have no dialog for the first 10 minutes. I love it -- when can we start?\" Delon is supposed to have said. Luckily for Melville, he found a kindred spirit in Delon, who, in any case, must have recognized the potentially iconic performance he could pull off if sympathetically directed. And boy, did he pull it off: NO ONE, in ANY movie, has ever been cooler than Delon's Costello. The movie was released in 1967 -- the Summer of Love -- but here's Delon anachronistically dressed in a single-breasted suit and a fedora, and getting away with it. (Well, okay, everyone else is wearing a hat, too, but this IS a Melville picture.) As for the performance itself, it bears comparison to Dirk Bogarde's Aschenbach in Visconti's *Death in Venice*: both roles are virtually silent yet must convey multitudes in a glance, in a movement, in a slight widening of the eyes. This is acting at its most meticulous, most physical, and most compact. Costello hardly ever says anything, but we're totally compelled by him, thanks to Delon's tight control. The influence of this character and Delon's performance has been nothing less than torrential: Pacino's Michael in *The Godfather* may serve as an obvious example.But much of this owes to Melville's original conception, as well. If Shakespeare needs good actors to carry his plays over, then good actors need Shakespearean-level material to reach their best performances. Melville, as always, flavors his pulpy stews with his own fevered artistic ingredients, the foremost of which is own idea of masculinity taken to the insane extreme. Tainted with Japanese samurai films, American gangster films, and westerns as well, Melville concocts a character whose every act is an expression of pure existentialism. The ultimate result is that frisson of sublime strangeness we as an audience encounter whenever we come face-to-face with a deeply considered and unique artistic vision. The best art is really weird, yet recognizable and unforgettable. *Le Samourai* is among the best art.10 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "I'm intrigued by the number of reviews for this film that declare it perfect and the epitome of cool. For a cold, methodical assassin, I thought Jef Costello (Alain Delon) made at least three unforced errors that brought about his eventual downfall. The first and most obvious was when he established his identity with the night club's pianist (Cathy Rosier) by staring her down following the murder of owner Martey. Then, when he was asked by the police to accompany them out of the private card game, Jef automatically went for his coat and hat, which would have been identifying characteristics during the police line-up. Why not just leave them there? And finally, he dumped the bag containing his bloody bandages right out in the street, by this time cognizant of the fact that he was under surveillance by the French police as a murder suspect. So where does this idea come from that he was a consummate professional who was a dozen moves ahead of his adversaries, and never made any mistakes? While I'm at it, I might as well castigate the police for their lack of professionalism in pursuing their case. The detective who picked up Jef's discarded bag did so with his bare hands, thereby contaminating potential evidence with his own prints. Even worse, another detective did the same thing when handling Costello's gun at the night club at the finale of the story, Again, no safeguard against putting another set of fingerprints on a potential murder weapon. The bigger puzzle of course, and one we have no answer for, is why Jef emptied his weapon prior to entering Martey's for a final confrontation with the witness who lied. One must likely consider Costello's mental status as on the verge of melting down, contrary to everything we knew and felt about the guy as the story progressed. But even with my criticisms, the film has a way of engaging the viewer in Jef Costello's nourish existence and the police procedural that runs through it's paces to track down a killer. A frightening aspect of that investigation occurred when the Commissioner (Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier) stated his intent to snare Jef by threatening on and off again girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon, Alain Delon's wife at the time) with \"The truth is not what you say. It's what I say\". By the story's conclusion, the Commissioner does have his way with the truth, but considering my earlier observations, it didn't come as much of a surprise.",

            "content": "This film has concerns other than mere narrative, and there is an influence that other critics never seem to have mentioned, but which struck me right away, and that is in the visual style of the film. No, the film's cinematography, by Henri Deca\u00eb, is not influenced so much by other films- even the aforementioned 1930s gangster films, but by the paintings of Edward Hopper. The film is rife with images of lonely people staring offscreen, or gazing out of windows, or into the darkness. Even more so, is that Hopper's character's zombie-like eyes (often sans pupils) is mirrored by the ubiquitous vacancies most of Melville's characters furnish (especially Delon's robotic steel blue eyes), even when brandishing weapons, or engaged with each other. It is almost like a shadow play, a Platonic Cave entertainment. And this is only further enhanced by the sparse dialogue throughout the film. And, then there is the fact that Japanese samurai were not assassins for hire, but warriors who fought for honor, which suggests that, not only is this film a shadow play, but perhaps a looking glass one, as well. Kudos must be doled out to Melville, for the adapted screenplay, though, because, despite the film's miss at greatness, it achieves what it does, which is considerable (a nice twist on a very tired genre) with aplomb. As the film was adapted from a Joan McLeod novel called The Ronin, but I do not know how much of the book made it into the final film.The Criterion Collection DVD unfortunately lacks an audio commentary, but has two visual essays/interviews with Melville scholars Rui Nogueira and Ginette Vincendeau. There is the requisite fellatio, of course, but also some valuable insights into the film Then, there is arcvhival footage of interviews with Melville, Delon, and others in the cast, as well as the original theatrical trailer. The booklet has selections about Melville, and pieces by filmmaker John Woo and film critic David Thomson. The transfer is fine, in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, but there is no English language track, only the usual standard Criterion white subtitles. As the film is in color, this presents none of the problems such subtitles do with black and white films. All in all, not the best extras package from Criterion, but far from their worst.Le Samourai is not a masterpiece- a term too often bandied about by enthusiasts of any work of art, but it is an interesting experiment that works far more than it fails. It also reminded me of Jim Jarmusch's 1999 film, Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai. The major difference between the films is that Ghost Dog contains some of the most realistic depictions of gangsters on screen (stylized realism, granted)- not romanticized ala Francis Ford Coppola, not glorified ala Martin Scorsese, but real. One need not have a working knowledge of the 1960s era French Underworld to know that Le Samourai is in no way realistic. All the situations are too phony, all the characters too dumb, and all the action to contrived, telegraphed, and choreographed for that to be claimed. But, as a violent ballet, it is a marvelous entertainment, and I have spent many a worse hour and forty-five minutes of my existence, for sure. While Melville's film does not rise to the existential and intellectual levels of the best I've seen from Clouzot, it does transcend most of that offered by Hitchcock, while retaining the technical grace and alacrity that the 'Master Of Suspense' developed. Melville's film, thus, scores somewhere in between the two, and, if one's work is to be so sandwiched, there certainly is worse bread to be buttered. Trust me, they were many of the worse hour and forty-five minutes of my existence.",

This film can be summed up with a single word: minimalism.This is a work of true cinema. Hollywood tends to forget that cinema is first and foremost a visual art. Le Samurai is a film that could've been made as a silent movie. The director establishes meaning not with dialog but with the best tools available to a director; editing, mise en scenes, cinematography and composition. There is a constant feeling of solitude and isolation. Even when the protagonist finds himself in large groups, his face is pale, his eyes are cast downward and he is still a constant outsider.On another note, the film looks surprisingly modern. There's none of the graininess of many other 60s and 70s films. Rather, the lighting and the whole visual aesthetic is pitch perfect, from the black and white nightclub (dualism) to the sparse gray apartment to the subterranean eeriness of the Paris subway.Personally, I would not recommend this film to people not interested in real cinema, people who like 'movies' rather than 'film', simply because there's a strong possibility it will seem extremely annoying and boring to you. On the other hand, if you're a fan of serious cinema, do yourself a favor and watch this film.",

And who can blame them? I'm afraid this is one of those movies that's all about \"mood\" and \"atmosphere\" and an intangible sense of \"cool\" - it certainly isn't about characters, and it doesn't feature much of a story to speak of. The only interesting person in the film, in my view, is the police inspector, but even he doesn't have much by way of character development or interior life.Mainly, the film consists of Alain Delon wandering around various urban settings in his \"cool\" hat and \"cool\" trenchcoat. The pacing is purely glacial, and oftentimes I really didn't care about where he was going or what he was up to. To make matters worse, he's a singularly incompetent hit-man who's about as subtle and stealthy as the Kool-Aid Man.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this film because I don't normally like movies about criminals. It sort of offends me, to be honest, that so many films glamorize gangsters, hit-men, and other forms of gutter life. What's so intrinsically fascinating about crooks, anyway? Are we all so repressed and violent that we need to get vicarious jollies by rooting for on-screen killers? And yet, I do like some movies about criminals. In \"Get Carter,\" the central character at least has a strong motivation and a personality to go with it. \"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\" meanwhile, features a killer who's quite smart and witty. \"Le Samourai,\" on the other hand, is about a killer with no real motivation, personality, smarts or wit. I can't find anything to admire about him, anything to latch on to.At best, this movie can be judged a cold masterpiece. But, in my perhaps crass view, it's a cold turkey. Some foreign films are masterpieces that put Hollywood to shame, while others are just plain dull and pretentious. I think this falls into the latter camp.",

            "content": "Le Samourai (1967) **** The film opens to the semi-annoying sound of a small birds chirp in a dull, grey room that appears to be empty. After a moment we realize the room is not empty - a man lights a cigarette lying on his bed. Meet Jef Costello, played by french pretty boy Alain Delon. The opening shot sets the pace for the rest of movie. There are no high speed chases or wild action sequences, and the star barely speaks a word. Costello is one of the coolest characters in film history. Delon plays his character to perfection. If one did not know anything about him it was likely you would not realize he was a pretty boy. His face is expressionless throughout almost the entire movie - it is a tribute to Delon that he can express emotion on only a couple occasions while still remaining facially expressionless.Costello is a hit-man, loyal to his boss: himself. The title of the film, Le Samourai, suggests of course that Costello is a student of the Samourai code. But is he really? The movie also opens with a quote \"There is no solitude greater than the Samurai's, except for that of a tiger in the jungle. Unless perhaps it be that of the tiger in the jungle.\" This supposedly comes from the Book of the Samurai, which as it turns out was an invention of director Jean-Pierre Melville.The story plays out as Jef completes a hit on night club owner, after setting up an almost too perfect alibi, but on his way out the door is seen by a the beautiful piano player. The police round up a number of people who look fit the description; Costello happens to be rounded up while at a card game. His alibi is strong, and mysteriously the piano player claims that this is definitely not the man she saw; another man who watched Costello walk out of the club also said with certainty that this is not the man. Another club patron claims that he saw this man at the club at the time of the murder and claims this is the culprit. The remaining two witnesses aren't sure, but don't think this was the killer. We know its Costello, the third man believes it is him, but why do the two who had the best look claim that this is not the man they saw? The plot evolves from here: The police believe Costello is lying and follow him everywhere; the men who gave Jef the hit will betray him and come after him as well.Melville is meticulous in his direction, just as Costello is in his actions. There is great detail paid to the actions of Costello leading up to the hit, from stealing a car while trying a number of keys, placing those that do not work in a perfect line on the seat beside him, to his alibi with a woman (played by Delon's real life wife) who says she does not love him to the police, but we get the feeling she does indeed. There are moments of silent comedy that you could almost miss: The men riding with Costello on the way to the police station, none of whom look anything like the description, some old and decrepit; there is a scene in which Jef opens his cupboard and we see on the top of it bottles of water and packs of cigarettes lined up perfectly. None of this is laugh out loud funny, but incredibly clever and lets you know that Melville knows exactly how Costello should be.As stated, the film is not full of action. It is a film where almost nothing happens. But no other film in which nothing happens has ever been so riveting. There is a famous metro chase scene that moves at probably the slowest pace of any chase scene in cinematic history, but it is enthralling. The pace sets up more importantly the themes of the movie. What are they? Its been debated widely. Searching for home? Mental Breakdowns? Morality, and loneliness? I would argue that it is not one, but likely all of these. The title reflects Jef's solitude and loneliness more than his code of honor. The final scene reflects many things about what we just witnessed, and has left some confused about what happens. Costello does a number of things in the latter half of the movie we do not understand, and that Melville gives us no answers to. Costello returns to the night club for example, buys a whiskey, pays for it, and then promptly leaves without drinking it. Why? Who knows.Le Samourai is a classic, filled with pitch perfect performances and is the inspiration for a number of modern day films. John Woo has called it an absolutely perfect film, and he is likely right. It is a meticulously developed project, with virtually no flaws. It's probably the best film about hit men ever made, which is a narrow classification of this film, because it is more than just the story of a hit-man.

Perhaps a smart killer would have changed clothes or even chosen a better location with fewer witnesses. Even if that was the best chance for the killing, it's not clear why Costello is known to the police, because a reliable gun for hire should be anonymous and untraceable.Muddled killing aside, another silly feature is the astronomical number of cops assigned to follow Costello. Is no other crime being committed in Paris? Since when did the police of a major city have over fifty cops to spare?

The movie stars Alain Delon as a hit-man named Jef Costello in a performance that reminded me so much of Tom Cruise's Vincent in \"Collateral\" because both characters in the two different films. Costello is also a contract killer like Vincent who is one of the suspects in the murder of a guy who works for a nightclub (of which he was paid to do), then the movie entangles itself into a whodunit type of movie with the investigation scenes. His girlfriend named Jane Lagrange (Nathalie Delon, who was Alain Delon's wife during the making of this movie) who is threatened of being charged of the same crime as being an accessory to murder. During the investigation scenes Melville makes us question what really happened even though we saw what happened before our very eyes. After Costello is let loose of the investigation he meets one of the men who paid him to commit the crime and Costello is almost killed during the encounter, and then gets spied on for the rest of the movie and seeks revenge. The only witness to the murder was a black woman who also happens to be a pianist at the same nightclub named Valerie (Cathy Rosier) who then gets questioned about who committed the murder by Le commissaire (Francois Perier).

With a movie like this Melville has proved himself to me to be one of the great European filmmakers like Francois Truffaut, Michael Haneke, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini. Also when it comes to the screenplay for this movie co- written by Melville and Georges Pellegrin has practically no dialogue at all like there wasn't that much in Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) even though those are two very different films.

I rewound this tape and watched certain key scenes again just to see if I could make any more sense of the at times nonsensical story (I couldn't).  Many scenes seem to be mindless padding (e.g., the police take up 5 minutes of running time just bugging the killer's room with an absurdly conspicuous listening device that seems to be designed to be found in about two minutes).  All-in-all, borrrring!",

            "content": "The film starts with a silent (almost) ten minute sequence showing a man getting out of bed, stealing another man's car, getting the license plates removed, going to a woman's house and finally, killing a man.What we find out is that this is all a meticulous plan by Jef Costello, a hit-man. This isn't an evil person, however, just one who's personality (or lack there of) makes it so that being a hit-man is the only thing he CAN do. Jef is cold and clinical not only because he has to be, but because that's simply the way he is. He seems emotionally detached and distant, seemingly using people simply as tools to get through the incredibly lonely life he has become a part of. In fact in many scenes where we believe he has some genuine emotion, we seem to be proved wrong, such as when we find out he is not just keeping his pet bird as a pet, but an alarm to warn him of invaders. However, throughout the whole film we see this side of him, but we sense he is not an evil person. He doesn't kill for the joy of killing, but because he is a hit-man and that is what he does. It seems to be the only possible path he could've taken in life. Later, in a scene involving a man invading Jef's house for reasons I won't get into right now, he ends up with a gun pointed at his face. But when he reverses the situation and ends up with the gun in his hand, once he gets the information he needs he doesn't kill the man, although he has no reason not to. It is at this moment when we first begin to see emotion in him. Later when he is fumbling to find the right key for a stolen car in a VERY intense scene, we see genuine fear in his face. In fact, we even find out through clever editing that Jef never kills a man before the other man is about to shoot him. We even find out that Jef actually cares deeply about a woman that he only seemed to be using for an alibi earlier in the film when he shows up at her house for no other reason than to tell her \"everything will be OK\" as a sort of goodbye before he goes off to kill the man that has been trying to kill him. Once he is done with that, the cops are still on his tail and he knows that he has no hope, so he goes back to the bar where he killed the man in the first scene of the movie. He overtly puts on white gloves, walks up to the woman that betrayed him earlier in the film and pulls out a handgun only to be shot down. However, it is revealed this handgun was unloaded, showing he had no intention of killing her because he can't bring himself to kill a person that is not threatening him, while also showing this was a passive suicide not only to stop the police and criminals from harassing the only woman he cares about, but also showing the woman at the bar what she'd done to him by betraying him.I rambled a lot in this one and I didn't even have time to touch on everything, but the point is this: fantastic character study, incredibly tense thriller, amazingly directed, acted, edited, etc..., and perfect soundtrack. Has the meticulous care of the main character. Pretty much perfect in general.",

            "content": "Glance across the reviews on these pages and you'll read an awful lot of them that celebrate Le Samourai as the pinnacle of 'cool.' Quite how they got this impression is beyond me, as having sat through 105 minutes of utter tedium, I can honestly say this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Come to think of it, maybe that's why it's so celebrated, high brow movie critics seem to worship anything that moves painfully slowly and would be dismissed by the rest of us as little more than a cure for insomnia.The story, what little of it there is, follows Alain Delon's hit-man, Jeff Costello over the course of two days as he carries out a successful hit on a club owner, only to be arrested by the police force afterwards. Thanks to the unreliable witnesses however they cannot convict him, so set him loose with the intention of trailing his every move. The mob panics and decide to remove Jeff in the most final way you can imagine rather than pay him, backing the man into a corner and setting him on a collision course with both the authorities and his former employers.If this sounds familiar then it's not surprising, as it was a significant influence on John Woo's seminal movie; The Killer. But where the Hong Kong film was a balls out action melodrama that moved with the frantic pace of a Gazelle with an adrenaline implant, Le Samourai moves slowly. Painfully slowly. There are lots of shots of characters doing mundane activities for what feels like an eternity, plenty of scenes where the lead simply walks up and down streets along with lots of lingering close ups of Delon's expressionless face.To make matters worse, there is zero characterisation whatsoever. Delon has one facial expression for the whole movie. He never indicates any sign of emotion and rarely speaks and come the end of the movie, hasn't developed one iota since we first saw him. Everybody else moves about with blank expressions and where there should be feeling and connection, there is just a void. The police pursuit of Jeff seems not so much half-assed as quarter-assed and when people stare down the barrels of guns, they do so with nothing more than a \"ho hum\" look about them.You can prattle on about psychology, paeans to loneliness, ethics and existentialism all you like. This is a boring movie filled with blank spaces where there should be characters and saddled with a pace that moves slower than a Tortoise with some very heavy shopping. And as for it being 'cool?' Forget about it. Unless you wear a beret, I'd avoid it at all costs.",

Perhaps. - Scenes and impressions from a piece of film history that spells cool, en fran\u00e7ais. The part of the eponymous \"Samourai\" is played by Alain Delon, born with stoicism in his blood, directed and written by Jean-Pierre Melville, who sucked in American film noir to live and breathe it as a person and to be creative with it as a true auteur. He shot noirs in color in French that made the archetype look old. A loner, a man with a mission, a samurai in a way.One could describe \"Le Samourai\", a 1967 picture, perhaps as the exact antithesis of the films we are used to see from video generation directors that emerged in full in the late eighties. What you won't experience here is adrenaline pumping fast pace, flashy quick cuts, slow motion sequences, car chases, spectacular stunts, explosions, yes, even blood is rather scarce in a film about a hit-man. Frankly, all of that is superfluous if the filmmaker knows his craft on how to get the viewer involved in his picture. Contrary to the constant pay-offs as part of a kaleidoscopic spectacle of action that dominate the screens at the latest from the nineties, the secrets of \"Le Samourai\" are simple, but effective: Delon's iconic screen presence, a uniquely created mood based on existential fatalism, a lot of build-up and perfect timing to release tension. In short: What we have here is an epitome of minimalistic suspense cinema. The assassin himself, Jef Costello, despite the fact that Delon plays him straight and stone-faced is no invulnerable killer machine, quite the opposite. And that's also where the story lies - that something goes terribly wrong, but somehow someone helps. Quite unexpectedly actually.

The film is extremely understated, slow moving and, at times, almost surreal in its minimalism, so don't expect an action film or even a slow but elaborate 'analytical' game of cat and mouse between a brilliant cop and an equally brilliant criminal. Similar to 2010's 'The American' (a film with a similar review polarity), Le Samoura\u00ef, is about the killer, not the killing, and the 'plot' is secondary, simplistic and not (IMHO) particularly satisfying. Delon's character, despite being an established professional hit-man, walks in to a crowded bar in full view of staff and patrons, shoots a man in an office with a non-suppressed revolver, gets picked up in a dragnet but then gets off the hook because the key witness lies to the police. He then spends much the rest of the movie being pursued around Paris but never makes any attempt to alter his appearance (or even change his clothes). Overall, I liked Le Samoura\u00ef as a stylistic Gallic ode to American gangster movies, but acknowledge that it is not a movie that seems to work at a lot of levels \u2013 deep: yes; superficially: disappointing. Too bad Melville and Delon never collaborated on a remake of the Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep or some other tightly-plotted potboiler \u2013 the combination of Euro-style and Yankee-story might have been outstanding.",

But Jef Costello, the title character, is a contract killer, but we see right away that he has no life out of doing his jobs, smoking cigarettes, living in a shabby apartment with a caged bird, not even having any social life. He even keeps a stony face, except in several moments of the movie where he lets emotions leak through. He is a lone wolf in more ways than one.He is hired to murder a nightclub owner in his office, and in doing so, is seen by a number of people, including a black woman whom he meets in a hallway. Yet when he and dozens of other possible suspects are arrested (the Parisian police would do all that for one homicide?), a couple of witnesses identify him, but others do not-including the black woman who clearly saw him. He is released, but when he meets his employers for payment, they try and fail to assassinate him. (They later admit to Jef that they mistakenly had thought he was about to betray them.) Jef even returns to the nightclub...the idea being that the witnesses there deliberately turned a blind eye to his action. The police try to press potential witnesses to no avail, probably because the police are not entirely sympathetic themselves. (This movie was made just before the 1968 Paris riots after all.) This is meant to be an existentialist, artistic movie, and it is not entirely clear why Jef does as he does. The abrupt ending only serves to add to the confusion.",

He is vocally inert, a modern day samurai who emulates the intensity and devotion of an old school samurai. Costello finds himself arrested for a murder that he is guilty of. He is taken to a line-up and identified by a select few who saw him leave the scene of the crime. Amazingly he gets away with it, this might be the only niggling thing in the movie, you feel it is impossible for a man to come so close with the law and not get charged. Alas, he is a free man. The rest of the film focuses on the police trying to bring him down, to crack his alibis, to catch him in the act. The final scene I can not comment on without spoiling. Melville certainly delivers on his statement that he likes to leave the audience confused. However you interpret the ending is the true meaning to you. It may frustrate some, but personally I think it is the most well executed ending I have seen in a long time.This film radiates that dark brooding look that only European movies portray well. The simplistic yet striking sets make streets and the most mundane objects look like works of art. The audacious use of pop culture in the form of art and artifacts adds to the overall tone of the film. The mash up of elements, the sassy colors of the 60's, the sophisticated noir qualities and the undercurrent of Japanese cinema makes this film so remarkable. It sounds as if it would clash violently, and it does, but it works. You feel very detached watching this movie, free to interpret it how you want; there is little dialog which I would like to see more in movies. It is so suggestive; this film caters to those who do not like condescending films that spell out what is going on, as if you are watching an episode of Sesame Street. This film is simply epic. One that I am going to insist upon watching monthly.Further more, Criterion really know who to spoil connoisseurs of film. I recommend you invest in buying the criterion collection edition of Le Samourai.

            "content": "Alain Delon has always been one of my favorite actors and this is probably his most accomplished performance as Jef, not least because it is so minimal - and yet there is a character there, a loner who cares for his caged sparrow. The latter is a reflection of Jef, who is trapped and unable to venture out of the world of crime. Like him, the sparrow is constantly on guard against intruders into this closed world, doubling up as watchdog that shrieks to warn Jef of an unwanted presence in the apartment. That relationship alone takes Le Samourai into a different dimension of perception and awareness.The film opens with a reportedly false quote comparing a samurai to a tiger in the jungle. Jef is on his bed, hardly visible, detectable only through a puff of cigarette smoke. This sets the mood for the rest of the film: silence, introspection, and no desire to communicate, let alone explain one's motives. It is a code and Jef abides by it.The sequence that sees Jef steal a Citroen DS is made memorable by Delon's deadpan acting, reflecting both vulnerability and commitment to his samurai-like code, all to an eerie silence. As he drives along, he gets an inviting glance from a beautiful woman driving another vehicle, but ignores her completely. Jef has no interest in distractions like sex, but has two women in his life, one white and blonde (his wife at the time, Nathalie Delon) and the other black, who function like angels of good and bad, life and death, and it is with them mainly that Delon shows touches of humanity and concern.The way he builds his alibi to avoid being charged for the execution of a bar/dance hall owner is highly professional and riveting, brilliantly done throughout, and followed by a subtly comic identification sequence at the police precinct where the witness only does not recognize his face, but remembers all he wore. Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier is superb as the police captain determined to catch him, and he is perhaps the character who has most lines in the film, but all parts are extremely well acted. The barman is particularly effective in a very short role, looking surprised when he sees Jef act uncharacteristically, and unprofessionally, when he returns to the scene of his crime, thereby breaking his code.Le Samourai is punctuated by quite a few wonderful sequences, action is credible, photography very good and yet economical, and director Jean-Pierre Melville is probably in his best form ever. Given that he made some six or seven films of the highest order, that is no minor feat.This is a much imitated, but never equalled, work. It also has the advantage of no computer tricks, no bombs exploding, no unnecessary violence - just an assassin doing his job. He goes about it zealously, seemingly unflinchingly, but his conscience becomes increasingly present.Le Samourai does not moralize but you come away knowing that, however stylish Delon is, however seductive reclusiveness might seem, and however enticing such professionalism might be, ultimately you cannot run away from yourself.John Woo rated it the most perfect film he ever saw, and I endorse that rating, with a caveat that there are three or four films that I would place on a similar perch. Pity 10/10 is the highest mark I can give, Le Samourai deserves more.",

Having only just caught it for the first time, I'm not sure what more I can say about a film that has been discussed, dissected, praised and pored over for nearly five decades now. Plot is simplicity, hit-man Jef Costello (Alain Delon) enacts a hit but he is witnessed fleeing the scene and spends the rest of the film trying to make sure his alibi holds up. His employers want him erased so as to avoid detection themselves, the head detective on the case knows Jef did it but can't quite close the noose around his neck, and Jef is mysteriously drawn to a sultry piano player who happens to be the chief witness against him! Sparse of dialogue, this is a masterstroke decision by director Jean-Pierre Melville, because what chat there is makes us hang on every word being spoken. It also re-enforces the loneliness essence of the hit-man's life. Jef's apartment is so bland and devoid of personality, the only thing of beauty there is a bird in a cage, the metaphor of such is hard to ignore. Jef himself is beautiful, he also is perpetually in an emotionally frozen cage. Attired in trench coat and fedora hat (or is it a trilby?), it's obvious that Delon and Melville are homaging with great respect the American film noir classic cycle. It's also quite amazing that although the film is technically filmed in colour, it still feels like one of those black and white noirs of the 40s and 50s. There's a coldness to Henri Deca\u00eb's (Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud/Elevator to the Gallows) photography that so befits the story, the interiors are stripped of life, the exteriors almost always gloomy. And with the brilliant Delon as cool as an Eskimo's wedding tackle, icy veneers are all the rage here. Hugely influential, Le Samoura\u00ef deserves every plaudit that has come its way. Best thing about it is that it actually gets better on a repeat viewing, because the surreal edge disappears the next time and in its place is an awareness of what the director is doing, and with that comes an appreciation of great film noir film making. Hell! Even the finale is pure noir of heart. 9/10",

Costello begins his new assignment stealing a car, obtaining new license plates and a gun from his associate. He then drives to a nightclub at night and shoots the owner, accidentally being seen by the club pianist Valerie (Cathy Rosier). The police pick up Costello and with the investigation led by a determined Police Inspector (Francois Perier), subject him and many others to a line up. Costello is released because he has set up an alibi with Jan Lagrange (Natalie Delon), and also because Valerie lies and states that she did not see him. When Costello goes to collect his money for killing the club owner, his employer attempts to kill him. Police Inspector (Francois Perier) puts together a team of undercover cops to trail Costello through the Paris Metro, an underground labyrinth where Costello escapes. Costello thus seeks to get paid for his killing job and get revenge on the shadowy businessman who hired him, and stay one step ahead of the police Inspector but makes a decision that brings about surprising results.This beautiful 103-minute feature from 1967, re-issued print from Criterion features a fine interview with director Jean-Pierre Melville, and a real insight to his view of cinema. The DVD also has interviews with Alain Delon, Natalie Delon, Francois Perier, and Cathy Rosier and their feelings about the film.The outstanding element to this film is the level of pure cinema, wherein the cinematography and editing tell so much about the main character without dialogue. Alain Delon in the lead role tells us volumes about his character's needs, and given this use of his method is particular to this European interpretation of the American film Noir genre, he is a perfect fit for this role.Director Melville utilized his studio for nearly all of the interior shots, and many of the set windows clearly reveal a processed backdrop. With the staged production values the film works because this reminds the audience that the theme of isolation is a key element in this French interpretation of the American Noir genre.The key metaphor of the caged bird, singing all the while, is a traditional touch that I feel most film theory dispenses with today. When Le Samourai was made film was still considered part of a literate culture, especially in France, where even today the Cannes Film Festival heralds the work of director such as the Coen Brothers for Miller's Crossing.The film is ostensibly a philosophical thesis beginning with the long static shot of a reclining assassin, Jeff Costello (Alain Delon) smoking in bed with the light of day coming in his cheap hotel room windows. As the rain seems to be falling even through the sunlight, a caged bird chirps away as a motto comes across the screen about the solitary mission of Le Samourai.The film stays with Costello for nearly all of the action. Much of what we learn from the film is through purely visual information. Director Melville relies on the sophistication of the viewer to follow the editing and fill in all the open spots.Consider the way Delon's Costello relates to his caged bird, a symbol of the protagonist's own captured soul. Melville utilizes classic cinematic structure to build his theme. We see Costello look at the bird as the creature chirps away, then we see the bird, and then we cut back to Costello as he makes a decision to take action.Costello seems to communicate with the bird in other ways. After henchmen bug his apartment Costello seems to understand from his chirping partner where to locate the microphone. It is the sort of touch that creates a deeper dynamic with the audience and allows them an entryway into other possible levels of the film.It is significant that one of the major showdowns happens in this hotel room with the blond businessman who hired Costello. The even lighting of the scene allows the viewer to see clearly the relationships in the story and why the message of the film so potent. There is no doubt about where Costello stands and his employer who is willing to kill the assassin to eliminate any collateral damage.This is different from the American Noir style which utilizes a good deal of shadow to obscure the actors and obliterate meaning. In Le Samourai the characters actions are plain to see. Melville's direction shows us all the details and by doing so emphasizes the ulterior motives of the characters.The ending is another static shot of the emptiness of a night club, punctuated by the director as he pulls out to reveal the edges of his own film set. It is Melville's way of creating distance both physically and intellectually for the viewer to perceive a greater understanding of the Noir film genre.Michael Mann may have gotten some inspiration from Melville for his film Collateral, in which the Tom Cruse character constantly reminds Jamie Fox that he kills people for a living. This sense of professional expertise in Le Samourai is contrasted against the piano professionalism of Valerie the pianist, and the expert detection of the police detective Francois Perier.It is the isolation and loneliness of the Delon character that burns the images of Le Samourai into our understanding of an activity and process involved with any profession, but especially professional killing for money.Reportedly released in the US under the title The Godson, in a cut-to-fit format and overdubbed (I can't imagine the voices they used for the overdub!), it was overlooked until its re-released version in 1967.",

I remember having seen Le Samoura\u00ef as a teenager 50 years ago, during the short few years of ideological and artistic de-icing of the Romanian communist regime between 1964 and 1968, when some of the world cinema crossed the Iron Curtain and hopes to re-connect Romania and Eastern Europe with the rest of the world were growing high. These hopes were cut short by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the melting of the Iron Curtain postponed by more than 20 years. Yet, in that period, a few fine movies were allowed to be seen in the East (some of them 'shortened' the scissors of censorship) and this lot included this fine gangster movie, a capitalist product with no moral message, not one that could be explained to the revolutionary masses in any case.Half a century later I had the feeling to live again some of the sensations at the first screening. I remembered the dark room, the smoke of the cigarette, the tweets of the bird, the raincoat and the hat. Alain Delon's look. Nathalie Delon's sex appeal. Cathy Rosier's mystery. The Citroen car and the garage where number plates were switched. The streets of Paris which for me at that time looked like a city from another planet, a place I will never be able to put the feet in.Of course, I have learned a few things about cinema in this period of time. I can now trace the predecessors of Le Samoura\u00ef in the American gangster movies of the 30s and I know that the raincoat was inherited from Humphrey Bogart. I can also identify countless successors that were inspired by this film. Jean-Pierre Melville's work aged beautifully and this is due to the minimalist approach that reduces details to the exact amount necessary to create the suspense and describe the situations, to a story which is smart, complex and makes sense from all angles you analyze it, to the magnetic power of the principal actors and to the cool chemistry constructed between them. A film noir for eternity.",

            "content": "Le Samourai is directed by Jean-Pierre Melville and stars Alain Delon as Jef Costello, an assassin working for criminal elements in Paris, France. Jef is a lone wolf and a perfectionist, calm and cool in any situation. As the title suggests, Costello places unsaid faith into Bushido, which advocates self-control and mastery, honour and obedience.The film itself revolves around Costello's lonely existence. He spends most of his time alone with a small bird in a rundown and empty apartment as he waits for his next assignment. When it arrives, he meticulously and ruthlessly pulls off the job, trying to remain hidden and anonymous while carrying out his task.The plot of the film develops when Costello bumps into a young singer at a club, directly after he pulls off a job. Things begin to unravel for him as the police tighten their net, his employers become suspicious, and his meticulous plans start to fray. Costello himself seems to develop as the plot does. His warriors mask begins to crack and he shows more strain, more fear and panic, albeit very subtly.Le Samourai is quite masterful. Carefully and meticulously shot itself, the film has little in the way of downsides. The plot is brooding and atmospheric as Costello navigates the streets and metros of Paris to evade his pursuers. The score is haunting and appropriate. The acting is superb. The plot is deep and defined. Le Samourai was a blast. It is a neo-noir film of the highest order, and well encompasses film-noir aspects from Frances cinematic history. It is an excellent film to watch, and I can't wait to watch it again.",

Basically in Paris, Jef Costello (Rocco and His Brothers' Alain Delon) is a professional hit-man, a perfectionist who works under contract who always carefully plans his murders and never gets caught, while his personal life is solitary and lonely, he has no friends whatsoever. Costello's latest assignment is to assassinate the owner of a nightclub, he is successful in killing his target, but is accidentally seen by club pianist Valerie (Cathy Rosier). The police only have a description of what the culprit was wearing, a hat and a trench coat, to work with, Costello is picked up by the police and onstage as part of a lineup, among other men wearing the same clothing, the investigation is led by determined Police Inspector (The Nights of Cabiria's Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier). The witnesses dismiss the other suspects, only Val\u00e9rie recognises Costello in the lineup, but she lies that she did not see him, Costello is released also because he has set up an alibi with Jan Lagrange (Natalie Delon). Costello collects the money for killing the club owner, but his employer attempts t kill him for his mistake in getting caught, the Police Inspector puts together a team of undercover agents to follow Costello, as he believes him to be the culprit, the men follow him through the Paris Metro, but the underground labyrinth allows Costello to escape. Costello is determined to be paid for his killing job, and get revenge on the shadowy businessman who hired him, he is also careful to stay one step ahead of the Police Inspector. In the end the decision Costello makes bring him surprising results, he turns up at the nightclub, making no effort to hide himself, he confronts Val\u00e9rie and points a gun at her, but gunshots are heard, and Costello collapses dead, it is revealed that Costello had emptied his gun before entering the club. Also starring Jacques Leroy as the Gunman, Jean-Pierre Posier as Olivier Rey, Michel Boisrond as Wiener and Robert Favart as the Barman. Delon gives a fantastic performance as the ultimate professional in his preparation and craftsmanship, this works as a great stylish character-study, it is kind of like a classic film noir, there is very little dialogue, only in the necessary scenes, and the acting is subtle, this adds to the nervy atmosphere, it is a most worthwhile thriller.

            "content": "After the self-indulgence of Le Deuxieme Souffle, Jean-Pierre Melville actually pulled back a fair bit in his next film, Le Samourai, creating a smaller, more focused telling of the French underworld, centered around the extremely subdued performance by Alain Delon. What becomes obvious is that Melville was concerned mostly with describing process in his films at this point. That can feel mundane, but he was a smart enough filmmaker to give us a grounding and obstacles that move beyond just documentation but enter into drama. Much like Le Doulos, this film's ending snuck up on me and gave the whole film a certain character and emotion I wasn't quite expecting.Jef Costello (Delon) is an isolated assassin for the underworld with some obvious OCD tendencies. His bare apartment is monochromatically black and white, down to his choice of pet bird in a cage, and he seems to have no life other than waiting for the time to execute his next contract. That contract takes him to a nightclub where he dons his traditional white gloves and shoots the owner without a second thought. His escape from the club is witnessed by the piano player Valerie (Caty Rosier), and all of his efforts to establish his alibi, mostly by telling his girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon) to say he was at her place all night. Still, he goes through his process of discarding the evidence and showing up at a poker game where the police find him as part of a dragnet on suspects and take him in.After a few hours of questioning and insight from witnesses from the nightclub, the police superintendent (Francois Perier) is convinced that Jef is the one who did it. However, when Valerie insists that Jef isn't the man who did it, the superintendent decides to let Jef go, keeping a tight tail on him to try and gather up any incriminating evidence they can. This is essentially the first half of the film, and large swaths of it are mostly silent. The focus is on process, and the filmmaking style is rather cold and distant. It fits really well with the subject matter of the film, giving us our introduction to the world and how it works for Jef. It's exacting, precise, and objective, just like Jef.Things move in an unexpected direction when Jef's contact (Jacques Leroy) tries to kill him upon their meet for payment. Along with Jef's mistaken assumption that he had shaken the police tail on him (he had lost them, but they found where he lived) Jef's save little world is collapsing in around him.I think it's easy to see how this film would be such a groundbreaking thing for film students of the era. This is a 1930s gangster film without any sentiment, melodrama, and with an exacting eye for detail. The lack of any feel of exploitation encourages attention, and the focus on process ends up being a rather sneaky source of tension, especially as Jef feels the net closing in around him, first in the form of a large police operation designed to track him through the metro of Paris and followed by the reappearance of the intermediary with a gun and another contract.Process takes over again, but there's a different subtext to it all. The first third of the film was the introduction to Jef's world. The final third is the complete destruction of it. Like in most of Melville's work, the destruction is brought on by women. The women in his films tend to be ornamentation more than characters. Jane is the loyal and steadfast companion who is unwilling to give him up even in the face of some rather strong pressure from the superintendent despite not really understanding why she would be loyal to him in the first place. Valerie, though, ends up the focus of the finale, and her insistence on not identifying Jef to the police, despite the fact that she saw him face to face right after the murder, seems to confuse Jef. Little is said between them directly, though they do have a pair of conversations, and Jef's theories on her motives are the product of his own thinking rather than hers. He can't see the perfectly human motive why a woman working for a man in a nightclub might not care that he was killed.Jef lives in a cold world without any real emotion. His only real human contact is Jane, and it's pretty clear that he sees her as little more than a source of alibis. She is just another thing in the world for him to use towards his own ends. The human reaction of Valerie seems to confuse him to the point that he willfully enters a point of self-destruction.It's sad, really. Here's a man who has survived with his own quirks in a bubble of his own making, and when it gets penetrated it's not the threats of violence from the men who hired him or the threat of imprisonment by the police that breaks him. He can deal with that easily enough. It's the humanity of a single woman who extends him a kindness for reasons he doesn't understand.I do enjoy Le Deuxieme Souffle, but this is a leap above that. This is a return to form after the two lesser (though still good) works that preceded it for Melville. This is Melville telling an interesting story in his own way and finding ways to affect the audience in unexpected direction like the attention to detail in processes that creates tension and the lack of connection between characters that creates an emotional connection with the audience.Melville marched to the beat of his own drum, and I have to say that I like to march along with him. He's exacting and precise while still finding ways to move beyond his cool exterior.",

If there is much of a difference it seems Melville cares not and presents this duality as 'normal' and indeed alongside most else in the film we believe more in Delon and his 'role'. There are marvellous sequences, almost end to end. A great opening in his room, the hit and his journey to collect for it.

            "content": "Director Jean-Pierre Melville was smitten with American culture. He adopted the name of an American author, wore a.big white cowboy hat, and drove a gas guzzling Camaro through the narrow streets of Paris. It's no surprise that Melville's gangster film \"Le Samoura\u00ef\" would be drenched in American clich\u00e9s of early Hollywood, such as emotionlessly masculine characters, equally emotionless and sultry females, grimy hotel rooms and of course so many trenchcoats you'd think Humphrey Bogart's wardrobe closet just exploded. And yet, here I present to you Melville's triumphant failure at making an \"American\" film.The opening scene begins with a meticulously symmetrical shot of a musty hotel room so cluttered with shadows that it takes us a minute to realize a man is lying on the bed smoking a cigarette. The man gives us absolutely no clues as to what he's feeling, who he is, or why he's there. This continues for nearly 3 minutes with no dialogue or movement other than the reflections of passing cars on the ceiling and a small caged bird in the center of the room. Instant American fail, right? Because one defining characteristic of early American films was that the audience isn't left hanging; even though the characters may be tight lipped and emotionless, the audience is almost always aware of their motivations.It's this sublime lack of audience awareness that defines this Melville film, and indeed most of his work. And thus, this film presents a 4th wall mystery. By that I mean the audience is the most clueless character in the drama, and we must work to keep up with the characters who, themselves, aren't divulging a thing.With that in mind, I won't say much about the plot except that this is a tense crime drama with a really stylish cat-and-mouse relationship between all the characters involved. We never quite know who's the cat and who's the mouse. And that's the part that goes against all the rules of early American cinema. While Melville certainly pulled stylistic & visual tricks straight out of Hollywood's film noir closet, his storytelling approach was completely French, and that's what made \"Le samoura\u00ef\" a true original--so much that it would, in turn, influence the next crop of American directors such as William Friedkin (\"The French Connection\", \"The Exorcist\") and Jim Jarmusch (\"Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai\").So dim the lights, turn up the collar on your trenchcoat and settle in for a thick movie watching experience. And if anyone asks you what you're watching, just stare at them with icy blue eyes and say \"I never talk to a man who's holding a gun\" (even if it's your wife and she's holding a bowl of popcorn).",

            "content": "Films following assassins are -for the most part- underwhelming or at least have been for the last thirty-odd years. The vast majority of so-called \"hitmen\" films usually turn out to be gun-ho extravaganzas (lacking any value) and are regularly created for money and cheap thrills. However, there are occasionally films where an assassin is the key character, and the film stops itself from becoming a gawky, formulaic actioner. It is not that Le Samoura\u00ef even follows the archetype of an action film; instead, it has influenced many directors who have adored Jean-Pierre Melville's sumptuous take on the hit-gone-bad of a professional, contract killer. Most of these directors are known for crafting action cinema (e.g. John Woo and Johnny To, two action directors I hold respect for), but it is not just the action genre that has been effected by the film, rather cinema as a whole has been stimulated by many of Jean-Pierre Melville's work.Le Samoura\u00ef opens with a man lying on a bed smoking, the camera remains distantly fixated on the gaunt and mysterious figure. Shortly after the credits have rolled a quote appears, which reads \"there is no solitude greater than the samurai's, unless perhaps it be that of a tiger in the jungle.\" It is from this moment that you have become introduced to Jef Costello (played by French actor, Alain Delon). It is not until the moment when he walks out of his apartment, masked by his infamous grey raincoat that the viewer starts to sense a feeling of threat. This is the just start of Jef Costello's trip to a nightclub, where he has been sent \u0096for unknown reasons- to kill the owner of the club for an extortionate amount of money. Even though he has carefully premeditated his pitiless act of crime he manages to attract a dangerous number of witnesses at the scene. Not too long after the killing does Jef Costello become a key suspect to the murder, and due to suspicions he is placed under close surveillance from the police, while being hunted down by his deceitful employers.Built on tones of film-noir and hard-boiled menace, Le Samoura\u00ef remains a film which has refused to age. To think that it was made in 1967 is stunning, considering everything about the picture was considerably ahead of its time. Oozing with stylish grit and an undeniably \"cool\" ambiance, the work succeeds in every possible element. Moments such as the \"principle/habit\" sequence (the film's ultimate moment of cool) is the kind that directors like Quentin Tarantino can only dream of writing. Nevertheless, Le Samoura\u00ef is not about being cool, since it does not even have to try and do so.Shrouded by what resembles \"a cloak of intrigue\", Le Samoura\u00ef never fails to fascinate its viewer. It is a work which conveys male arrogance, existential psyche and dominative stance over women. It is the mannerisms of the camera, the closely-knitted story, the tight acting and the glorious intellectualism of the picture which lets it stand alone in the crowd. Rendering a dreamlike haze of an inescapably hopeless fate, the film crafts a circumspectly precise implication of failure through its character motifs. As a character, Jef Costello is open to much interpretation. For one, his motivation for being an assassin is that of a mystery, or at least it is never visibly stated within the picture at any given time. In contrast to the cold cinematography, the characters are unforgiving, but retain from becoming inhumanely merciless. Elements of film-noir are littered throughout the work. Take for example the \"femme fatale\" tendencies echoed through the angel-like (possibly symbolism for a guardian or saviour?) pianist, the low-key lighting and camera positioning. Le Samoura\u00ef resembles a film-noir in numerous ways, yet at the same time it foreshadows (pre-implications are strewn across the film) many surrealistic themes. With this I am most notably referring to the film's inevitable conclusion. The depth of the work is so evident, though, to such an extent that it can even be resonated through Alain Delon's ravishingly mysterious eyes.Le Samoura\u00ef is a film which is more than just an essential for the lovers of celluloid, but a crucial viewing experience for anybody who understands what bona fide art really is. The work does require a certain amount of patience, for there will be viewers who may turn on the film to expect a rip-roaring adventure; those are most likely to be the kind of people who will come away from the film with what might be a bitter resentment. But for those who are addicted to the copycat Gen-X filmmakers of the '90s, they might want to see Le Samoura\u00ef to find out what \"cool\" cinema really is, and to validate that the work is the 100% opposed to being a case mindless masochism. Le Samoura\u00ef will forever remain one of the categorical examples of what cinema is all about.",

This is my third Melville's film after LE CERCLE ROUGE (1970, a 7/10) and ARMY OF SHADOWS (1969, a 9/10), and it's the zenith of French-noir, which has masterfully engaged its core spirit in the Japanese samurai cachet.The film wholeheartedly steeps itself into the steel blue palette and thus a kind of unprecedented filmic magic happens, with a neat and self-disciplined camera-work, a French assassin's point-of-no-return karma has seductively reveled its viewers into an astonishing rapture through the engaging 105 minute, accompanying by the mind-blowing score from Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix. The film carries on a restrained, or even abstract approach to its narrative arch and the dialogue-scarce execution is the ace in the hole, till a samurai-esque self-sacrifice as the finale. Indisputably this is Alain Delon's most significant role although he is barely an adroit thespian, but Melville has excavated Delon's deadly mesmerizing allure out of his soul as Jef Costello, the taciturn and grim assassin, whose reticent way of acting impeccably magnifies his panache and which would later on become a token of his screen image. Delon's first wife Nathalie Delon was a perfect foil in the film and her interplay with the detective (a stern and astute Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier) manifests that with regard to acting skills, she might be superior to her hubby. But after all, the film is a director's gem, Melville didn't earn his deserved stature at his time both domestically and internationally (particularly since his untimely pass away in 1973), but his canon has survived equally well (if not better) than his compatriot auteur, and what's more precious, is that his films have a psychiatric sway not only over his peers but the generations after as well, also a distinctive cinematic aesthetics must be attributed to him, which has been spread further on by numerous prot\u00e9g\u00e9s all around the world.",

These include Bob le Flambeur, Le Cercle Rouge, Un Flic, Le Doulos and the best of them all- Le Samourai. This landmark film would go on to influence a galaxy of famous directors- Jim Jarmusch, Scorsese, Takeshi Kitano, John Woo, Michael Mann and Nicholas Winding Refn, among others.\nLe Samourai tells the story of relentless hitman Jef Costello ( a suave Alain Delon). Dressed in his trademark trench coat and fedora, he executes his missions with ruthless efficiency. He has never been caught. One night he kills a nightclub owner but as he is leaving he is seen by the club's piano player Valerie (Cathy Rosier). From then on, his neat, ordered existence is thrown out of joint as he is pursued both by the police and his employers, who think he has become a liability. The police superior leaves no stone unturned to destroy his alibi. This is easier said than done and Melville treats us to some delicious set pieces as Costello finds himself tailed and shakes off dozens of plainclothes policemen in the Paris subway stations.\nShot in bleak grey tones by the great Henri Decae, the film is essentially a reflection on solitude, and the values of honour, loyalty and betrayal. Jef is a modern samurai, a gun-for-hire, who executes the missions he undertakes, no questions asked. He has no friends except a bullfinch in a cage in his spare, ascetic residence. He is a man who lives only for his work. But after that fateful encounter at the club, and later, after the pianist refuses to identify him at a police line-up, his iron facade crumbles, and we see the raw, human emotion seep through- that leads him to his downfall.",

            "content": "A contract killing gone wrong is only existential Destiny for an enigmatic hit-man... Jean Pierre Melville's LE SAMOURAI (1967), is American gangster folklore skillfully blended with Japanese warrior legend in a mesmerizing display of seeming \"style over substance\". The film is rife with tableaux but there's calculated complexity under the vivid composition -especially in the imagining of Jef Costello, hit-man par excellence. A great deal of empathy -even sympathy- is generated for a cold-blooded killer and although his tale may be a simple one, rarely has so much been said with so little. With no back story and minimal dialogue, Melville conveys textured motivation beneath an emotionless exterior and Alain Delon's Jef, the epitome of iconic cool, is part Alan Ladd in THIS GUN FOR HIRE and part James Dean -but without all the bittersweet explanation for alienation. The Melville-ism, \"There is no solitude greater than the Samurai's, except for that of a tiger in the jungle ...perhaps\" is perfectly illustrated but when hunter becomes prey, \"One who is Samurai must, before all things, keep constantly in mind, by day and by night, the fact that he has to die\". The hit-man's embrace of inevitable Fate is similar to Lulu's in G.W. Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX (1929) but all the nuances of Germanic Film Noir fatalism wrapped in French Nouvelle Vague are impossible to fully absorb in a single viewing. Random thoughts: One similarity between Alain Delon's Jef Costello and Alan Ladd's Raven proves to be anything but: Raven's affection for a cat isn't mirrored in Jef's caged bird. Jef's pet is kept to alert the tiger to possible danger when he's either sleeping or away from the lair. The two women in the film (pianist Valerie and alibi Jane) are literally black and white and merely extensions of Jef, representing life and death. Melville cast Nathalie Delon because she looked more like Alain's sister than his wife -indicating she's a \"mirror image\" reflection of life -and any potential good it may offer Jef- while the pianist symbolizes his darkness and inevitable death. Jef silently kisses the one goodbye before going to meet the other, fully knowing what must happen. How Jef accepts his pre-ordained Fate using only his eyes is heart-breaking. Melville felt the tale was timeless (the reason he eschewed 1967 fashion) but Jef isn't ...even though he's not the only one in the Parisian underworld wearing American 40s gangster garb. Standing out in the urban jungle the way an animal would, the anti-hero isn't \"of his time\" and there's a comical aspect to the anachronism that's reminiscent of a silent Bugs Bunny as Sam Spade. The pianist's question \"What kind of man are you?\" naturally goes unanswered.",

            "content": "Tarantino, Jarmusch, Luc Besson and John Woo cite Jean Pierre Melville's \"Le Samourai\" as being a major influence on their careers, so right away you know exactly what type of film you're dealing with.Jim Jarmusch would use \"Le Samourai\" as the basis for \"Ghost Dog\" whilst Luc Besson would steal from both \"Le Samourai\" and George Lautner's \"Le Professionnel\" (1981), when making \"Leon\". Several scenes in Lautner's film, particularly the ending, are visually and thematically similar to \"Leon\". The American title of Besson's film is also identical to Lautner's.Likewise, John Woo's \"The Killer\" would draw thematically from \"Le Samourai\", though it stylistically threads new ground, with its frenetic gun ballet and huge squib orgies. John Woo would later go on to very loosely remake Melville's own, \"The Good Thief\".Stylistically, Melville's influences are American noirs of the 40s and 50s, whilst thematically, he cites Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" as an influence. The film owes most of it's ideas to \"Blast of Silence\", though, a little known 1961 hit-man movie that has also come to be known as the last of the classical film noirs.The point of me mentioning all these hit-man films is to show that cinema is almost entirely referential. Most films are about other films, and few exist entirely in a vacuum.Melville's \"Le Samourai\" isn't as offencive as anything by Woo or Besson, but its main claim to fame is simply its detached, ice-cold style, rather than its actual content. It's about a hit-man who kills a man, is hunted by the police and finds himself having to outwit both the cops and his contractors. Standard stuff, though it's done with very little dialogue, and an extremely cool, detached camera.The film has 2 particularly great scenes. The first is an extended sequence in which the hit-man is taken to a police station. It's a long procedural in which he's interviewed and jostled from one police room to another. There's an ice cold sense of tension. Will he get caught? Will he keep his cool?The second great scene occurs when the hit-man enters his apartment and stares at his bird. His bird whistles and seems to communicate to the hit-man that the cops have entered the place whilst he was away and planted a bug. The hit-man nods wordlessly at the bird and leaves the apartment. Either the guy is a avian mind-reader, or he's just damned skilled. Luc Besson would use a similar device, changing the bird to a potted plant in his \"Leon\".8/10 - A minor classic, the film's existential musings a bit shallow when compared to similar fare.",

The copy on the back of the DVD would have me believe that this is the COOLEST MOVIE EVER. So the backs of DVDs wax hyperbolic sometimes, OK, I get that. But never have my expectations for a movie been so excruciatingly disproportionate with the movie that I ended up watching.The assassin is not even that cool. Let's start there. He goofs the only assignment we ever see him do, and spends the next half hour of the movie in a police station, switching coats and hats with some of the other 400 suspects police have rounded up (apparently this is the only crime happening in Paris), entangled in all manner of bureaucratic nonsense. What kind of ultra-cool assassin gets entangled in such bureaucratic nonsense? What I mean to say is that the pacing, inasmuch as it exists, is totally wonky. I realize that this is not a \"traditional Hollywood movie.\" I realize that. And I like films like The Master or Eyes Wide Shut or The Exterminating Angel just as much as the next critic or snobbish cinephile. I liked the other flick I saw by Jean-Pierre Melville too, Army of Shadows. That one was slow, but its scenes each built to something, it had something definite underneath its style. I don't mind if a movie isn't going to entertain me in the manner that I've been conditioned by Hollywood to expect, but I'd like it to at least given something worth contemplating while I fail to be entertained. Le Samourai gives me nothing. It gives me a half-assed assassin, some half-assed gangsters, a half-assed police department, and nowhere near enough style to make it all worth watching.The only way I knew that this guy was a master assassin was because the back of the DVD told me so. In the movie, we get nothing to draw this conclusion from. He botches the job and gets arrested. If the movie were really so stylish, it might have started by showing us the assassin doing right by a job, killing a guy ice cold, leaving without a trace, then flubbing the next job. Instead the movie gives us, right from the start, the worst, lamest assassin ever. And then later, the most boring chase scene ever. Also, the police go to bug his apartment, and they put in the worst bug ever. It's not even a bug. It's more like the size of a mouse. Jesus Christ.I don't normally write reviews, or comment on the internet, but in this case I felt morally obligated to, given how much praise I've seen lavished on this movie. Where is this praise coming from? Why, why, why? The movie is a waste of time. It's not a good movie, and it's not a good bad movie either. It's nothing but a tedious bore.",

He brings a quiet intensity to the role that honestly is refreshing. Normally for these types of characters they play it larger than life. But Alain Delon is restrained and never lets show his anger or fear even when brought in for questioning and as part of a lineup. To say anything more would just ruin the movie. It really needs to be experienced first hand through a fresh set of eyes to be truly appreciated.Like other masters of the French New Wave, Melville manages to weave a tapestry of intrigue, action and psychological thrills that few have managed to achieve.

            "content": "\"There's not a greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps \u0085\" these lines are among the most memorable of the film, although they're not spoken. But when the talking starts after ten minutes, Melville let you all the time to meditate on it, while you discover one of the most fascinating French characters: Jef Costello, aka The Samurai, Alain Delon, as enigmatic and fascinating as ever.The first shot of the film sets the tone; a man is lying in bed, his presence marked by the clouds of smoke vanishing in the air. The shadowy atmosphere, invaded by the sunlight, reveals a monkish room with in the middle, a caged bird, whose repetitive and melancholic chirps are a beautiful parabola of Costello's situation, a man confined in a closed space, a close state of mind, a code of honor.Honor, isn't it the word that comes immediately to mind when we think of a Samurai? Delon's stone-faced and constant emotionless expression almost suggests some Asiatic affiliation, but we realize very soon, that the Samurai is indeed a metaphor for bravery and solitude. This solitude is driven by a fatalist view on life, that would almost be nihilistic if there wasn't a purpose motivating the actions: the job. Without the job, the Samurai is more lucid about the futility of life, hence the disturbingly dizzying image at the start as to suggest, that this is time to get up, to do the job.And the job is simply a tribute to Jean-Pierre Melville's meticulous and incredibly well-crafted directing. During the first quarter of a film, we literally witness the building of an alibi, in the following twenty minutes, the efficacy of the alibi. But not quite, in fact he was lucky to be released, because the only witness who could clearly identify him, didn't. Why? did the bar pianist love that the idea that he could rely on her, like the blonde girl who confirmed the alibi? and why did the guys who hired him decide to eliminate him. He's too Cartesian not to be tortured by these interrogations, the enigmatic guy has an enigma to solve. But for the viewer, it's clear; this is the story of a botched job.Basically, we all got the idea that this is a failure story. And all the fastidiousness portrayed in the film was to show that the professional is doing his last job. The parallel with the Samurai is strongest as ever, we feel a redemption coming, the man is too extraordinary to end with the blonde girl or the beautiful pianist. It's his last job, and this is confirmed by the cat-and-mouse subplot, from both the police and the criminals, the law and the underworld. He became the tiger in the jungle ...This fatality is foreseen through some details, the melancholic music, a kind of trademark in Melville's films, the similarity between the first and the last act, one ends in a twist, the second as the apotheosis of whatever this character defined ... and of course, there's the bird. This caged creature, like the Samurai's alter ego, the only friend he could trust. And the bird does help him by indirectly signaling any intrusion, by losing feathers and showing signs of excitement The bird is not just a vulgar metaphor, he's an informer ... and how ironic, that he starts being the informer of the cops. Because in a genius plot device, the incessant chirp sound was also the indication that the bug the cops placed in Costello's house was working.Other characters share the same helpful behavior: women. They help the cops when in fact, they protect Costello. The Samurai seems to inspire a sort of magnetic charisma with girls, a detail we spotted in the early scene when a pretty female driver glanced at him. And he has a soft spot for women too, a reason for which he tries to protect the pianist. This is both an acknowledgment of his manhood and a light of hope, as if Costello could indeed imagine his future with a woman who loves him. He has the money, he has the looks but we already sensed a cloud of tragedy reflecting on in the film. This won't be a happy ending, because it's lost for The Samurai and escaping would be a disobedience to his own moral ethics .... so if he has to go, he will and on his own.So he repeats the same actions and at the end, even the guy who replaced the plates tells him : \"This is the last time\". \"All right\" replies Costello in his laconic voice. The end is coming, and despite all the efforts to trail him, from the police and the criminals. He will choose the way to go. It's not nihilism, it's an existentialist film like only Melville could have made. It's a movie about a man, a movie defining manhood. In his tacit farewell with the blonde girl, he reassures her: \"Don't worry. I'll handle this\" and there's an obvious look of disappointment as she knows, he doesn't want her help, he doesn't need her anymore. He has a job to do, killing the pianist.But the pianist only gets the gun, the bullets went for the hirer ... and for Costello, killed by the police as he's pointing the gun on her. I thought the ending ruined the film until I saw the empty gun. An empty gun, as to illustrate the meaningless of a life where you rely on others. His code of honor ordered him to protect the only girls who saved him, by killing one's enemy and sparing further troubles for the other. He was finished anyway, but he choose the way he would go, like a true Samurai.",

After fulfilling a job he runs from the law outwitting the fuzz as the clock of justice ticks steadily against him. The film is as much a look as a tale with half the flick showing the striking Delon pacing back and forth in the streets of the city of light with the dim colorful film of the time enhancing each and every take. Despite its languid, slow-paced Euroness the movie is a watchable action yarn with the French capital as background a la mode. A fascinating relic from the Swinging '60s.",

Whatever your reasoning for seeing it there's really nothing I can do to stop you. So here's some encouragement: this movie is sublime. The image of Jef Costello under the gun in one scene resides now as my wall paper, day by day burning a hole into my consciousness. It is now clear, as a matter of certainty I was no more prepared for death as I was this film. John Woo was right (though probably for the wrong reasons) and \"Alice\" is still on Cloud Nine to be sure.My recommendation on the film is this: don't go expecting anything. It would not surprise me in the least to learn everyone else hates this film and therefore this review (er) because the fact of the matter is that if you compare it to any random myriad flicks, cop shows, crap shoot rentals, obscure noirs then Le Samourai (to any reasonable person) would as a mathematical certainty end up on bottom. Melville abysmally snubs the criteria by which most films are judged; right from the beginning the quote is erroneous, there seem to be problems with the cameras focus, the mise-en-scene appears accidental and static. Also there is almost no urgency in the plot, the mind of the subject is utterly impenetrable sans pathos, dialogue is sparse and again accidental, random facts (why does he have a bird in his apartment?!), shots are held too long (we follow Jef down a street for what seems like an eternity), not to mention this 'professional assassin' makes retarded mistakes (takes off his gloves to open a door when leaving the scene of the crime), clich\u00e9s abound, characters' motives confound, and at the end (I can imagine) one is left with a feeling of pointlessness. But this is only if you compare it to any other film. This is not a film; it is a series of images that represent a series of actions or circumstances that are in sum, symbolize a manner of BEING unlike anything hitherto considered.....living, filming, whatever.But I would have to concur with the treatment above by Miss? \"Alice Liddel\" in substance (though not in style). Jef Costello is indeed \"a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death.\" The rest of it I'm afraid really makes you 'wonder.' Melville is here far outside the box, as his character in a film superimposed upon our world under the guise of fiction (in a coat and fedora). Melville's own opinion: \"an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).\" Yeah, sure. Any image from this film seen on a daily basis is bound to have some serious side effects. For me it's baffled me into a trance midway through and by the end I was reviewing the film.",

            "content": "Alain Delon is Le Samoura\u00ef - hitman Jef Costello - cold yet elegant and graceful. The ever badass Delon could be identified by a silhouette of his figure. While he has those Humphrey Bogart vibes with his grey trench coat and fedora, he possesses a demeanour that's strictly his - this is a man who knows how to wear clothes. Moreover, there is an ethereal beauty to Delon which straddles that fine line between masculine and feminine beauty with a face that conveys so much without the uttering of a single word.Jean-Pierre Meville's Le Samoura\u00ef is a master class in how to make a film with long stretches featuring no dialogue with little-to-no music. When music is used, however, the haunting score by Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix with its use of hammond organs mixed in with some sections of mellow jazz is the perfect match for the grey, rainy streets of Paris (this is the kind of music you need to play when walking down an empty city street in the early hours of the morning). There is a real hypnotic quality to watching Alain Delon making his way through this urban jungle. The Paris featured in Le Samoura\u00ef is not the Paris as would be portrayed in an American film in which the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe is included in the background of every shot. Rather this is a Paris of grimy, urban locales - a real-time capsule of the city circa 1967. The locales and interiors featured in Le Samoura\u00ef make it a film that oozes class. I've never seen a classier looking nightclub than that featured in the film with its silver and glass d\u00e9cor while even the interior of the cold and sterile police station has an art deco appearance to it.I've read many of my fellow film reviews heavily critique Jef's decision making in his criminal activity as a major dent in the believability of Le Samoura\u00ef. When carrying out his hit, Jef enters Martey's nightclub wearing a distinct outfit, he returns to the scene of the crime the following night (despite his arrest from the previous night) and even disposes a set of blood-soaked bandages on the ground outside his apartment, knowing that the police are surveilling him. Yet, such clumsy actions strike me as being a sign of Jef's overconfidence rather than a mark of poor writing.Le Samoura\u00ef can rank as one of the best police-procedural films. It makes for fascinating viewing to watch the techniques deployed by the police for identifying and questioning suspects, as well as their methods for tracking Jef through the Paris subways with a cat & mouse chase in a pre-internet, pre-mobile phone, pre-CCTV world. Le Samoura\u00ef also shows how the French citizenry is required to carry identity papers, an anathema to viewers in the anglosphere (the requirement to carry identity papers is a holdover from Roman law, unlike English common law where no such requirement exists). Within the film there are no Miranda rights as seen in American films but more worryingly, the police stalk Jef and put him under 24/7 surveillance, break into his apartment to install a bug as well as breaking into the apartment of his girlfriend and attempting to coerce her (also take note of how the commissioner turns a picture of a baby on his desk away from sight after questioning a suspect). There are however objections raised by suspects throughout the film when the police begin asking questions about their personal lives. If Le Samoura\u00ef is conveying a negative portrayal of the police, it may to conveyed most harshly but subtly with a blink and you miss it moment with a cut ? Minutes into the film in which a crime boss walks from right to left and then cuts to the police inspector continuing to walk in the same direction in perfect motion. Both bodies have the same aim of wanting to catch Costello but is the film also trying to say they both are as morally and ethically bankrupt?Throughout Le Samoura\u00ef as Jef returns to his apartment, the sound of a caged chirping bird plays repeatedly without the aid of any music. As would be heard the proceeding year in Once Upon A Time In The West, the use of a recurring sound is shown to be as memorable and effective as a great score (I can also attain that every time I have watched Le Samoura\u00ef, the chirping bird has garnered the attention of my cat). The bird even serves the plot as Jef shares an almost telepathic relationship with the avian, as when Jef has returned to the apartment to find the bird traumatized and shedding feathers, he starts exploring his apartment only to find he has been bugged.Le Samoura\u00ef opens with a quotation from the book Bushido: The Soul of Japan - \"There is no solitude greater than a samurai's, unless perhaps it is that of a tiger in the jungle.\" However, this quote is entirely a creation of the film and not taken from said book. How much of actual samurai mythology is present in Le Samoura\u00ef or is the film just trying to look a bit cooler with a westernized interpretation of what a samurai is? Regardless, the film earns its merits in so many other regards I can easily look past such a thing.",

However, as it turns out that he's an inept assassin without the first idea of how to go about it - apart, maybe, from wearing white gloves - you start to think your intelligence is being insulted.There is a lot of coat and hat donning and removal in this movie; a lot of multiple key-testing in car and door locks, and a lot of manic jazz-lounge piano. What there isn't is a lot of sense. From my limited knowledge of hit men they tend not to return to the scene of the crime the next night for a drink, dressed in the same trench coat and (ill-fitting) trilby hat they wore when the shot the owner.There's also a long, long sequence of Alain Delon riding on the Paris Metro, outwitting the many thousands of auxiliary policewomen with magic transmitters that work (in 1967) underground. As for that bug placed behind the curtain in his room, I'm amazed the battery lasted long enough for the guy to cross the road.The opening shot of Alain smoking on his bed is atmospheric, evocative, iconic, even; but that's all The Samurai has got. It will keep your attention because Alain Delon is so nice to look at when well photographed, but the attempted shock ending is too simplistic. It's more of a relief.",

Not a second of this film is wasted with such trifles, the story is instead told through character actions and not through words (the first 10 minutes of the film are actually wordless).Our protagonist is Jef Costello (Alain Delon), a killer for hire, who has got wearing a fedora down to almost an exact science. He is hard as nails, cool as ice and suave as hell. The story follows him as he judiciously establishes himself an alibi, kills a club owner, is then taken in by the police, slips through a lineup, gets betrayed by his employers and is then stalked through a dreary Paris by the police and his employers alike, all the while realizing his own plan to take revenge.Melville's Paris always looks like it's either about to rain or it just did (when it's not actually raining). Both interiors and exteriors are perpetually drenched in grays and blues. Melville drains the entire film of color much in the same way that he drains his characters of words, that way both Paris and Jef feel cold, solitary and distant.Le Samourai is expertly crafted, effortlessly stylish and, I think, definitely worth seeing.",

Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.  Although samurai may still enjoy a hokey stylishness, movies, even thrillers, that wish to be serious rather than silly might be well advised to follow that example.",

            "content": "I liked it. Even as a student of philosophy I didn't really see all of the existential commentary that some people seem to read into Jef's changing mental state. Clearly he does start to come apart: his expressions when he steals the second DS stand in stark contrast to his icy coolness the first time he stole the other DS. I took the bleak apartment as simply a reflection of Jef's rather bleak character. He seems to be a rather isolated and depressed individual, capable of brilliance but also of surprising absentmindedness. But the camera shots were very pretty. Some of them did linger on a particular situation, but that is part of the beauty. I think that cinematography is all about how a shot is first a well-composed photograph that then slides into motion; this motion should ideally then continue through a series of equally well- proportioned pictures that the character moves through and interacts with. Melville did this very well; just look at the opening scene with the smoke rising and the bird. Thus, all in all, it was a very pretty film; Jef turns out not to be quite as detached as he appears and actually does care about some of the people he interacts with, the cameras were all very well set up and the way the shots were framed was very pretty. If you want to read a whole lot of existentialism into it, I suppose you can do that too.",

That it is a masterpiece goes without saying, that it is the epitome of 'cool' goes without saying, that it offers arguably Alain Delon's finest performance goes without saying so what IS left to say without sounding like an echo? We might put in a word for veteran Francois Perier as the Javert-like cop intent on pursuing Delon's Jef Costello until he nails him. Perier would play a cop again - this time not quite so upright - in Alain Corneau's Police Python 357 but here his performance hits just the right note.

Or sometimes a movie can manage to impress, with all of its simplicity. This movie is such a humble, little, quiet movie, that takes a realistic approach to a genre that normally brings you a whole different kind of entertainment. In essence this movie is still really featuring a very genre-typical type of story in it, about an assassin, who is trying not to get killed or caught after a job. The approach to the story however is not being very typical. It's not necessarily being a fast paced movie, or one with any spectacular thrilling moments in it but it still is a very exciting and tense movie to watch.The movie manages to become a really tense one through its approach. Because the movie is often such a quiet one, without any dialog and it takes it time at times, the movie manages to create a very sensible, almost constantly present, underlying tension. While watching this movie you feel that things could go very wrong at any moment for the main character. Because of this, the movie constantly puts you onto the edge of your seat, even when there isn't an awful lot happening at all.The main character of the movie is also one great and intriguing one. The fact that he hardly talks makes him all the more fascinating and also makes him believable as a cold and calculated killer. Definitely another great role from Alain Delon.It's a greatly directed movie from Jean-Pierre Melville. Not just because of its approach to its story but also the way the entire movie got shot. It has some beautiful shot moments in it, that you might not even notice the first time watching. It's a movie made with an eye for attention to detail. The movie is in color but it does still feel like a classy black & white production, from the '50's.The more realistic approach of this movie also definitely prevent this movie from being one for just 'everybody'. However if the premise and approach do sound interesting for you, by all means go and watch this movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

He's dressed in a classic trench-coat and hat, and wears that classic film-noir mug on his face the whole film: impassible, unchanging and emotionless. The film also does a good job at playing into the more technical details of the action: the detective work and the strategies and intricacies employed by the many various parties involved to get what they want.Stylistically the film has a somewhat romantic feel to it, with a surprisingly novel and modern soundtrack for that time: superbly composed mixing modern organ tones with an older and grander baroque style; while visually the film is very grim, and intentionally very silent: the entire opening chunk is deliberately scriptless for a good portion, as to set a terribly sober film-noir atmosphere. The film leaves a visual impression of monochromatic vistas, strongly grey-ish and a discreet pale.The dialog is very good as well and properly conducted in key-scenes requiring a strong onscreen presence from its actors: Delon, P\u00e9rier, Delon's wife...all do well and put in a very believable shift. It should also be noted there's a lot of implied, unsaid language at work: long eye contact between characters, lengthy wordless scenes showing a character on his own...all of which convey meaning, that bit more subtly.The problem though is it's a film that works for about an hour and fifteen, but then struggles to gather enough momentum to keep the enthusiasm going. We're sold what the story is about and what the film is in its essence well before the end, so why go on that much longer when all the goods have been exposed ? It seems to lag and drag its plot to the very last scene, which really does seem far from reach. They surely could've helped it with the pacing past that hour mark, and they certainly could've added more elements to strengthen the plot (another character ? another subplot ? less linear predictable development...) and give the viewer incentive for his full attention. Considering its legendary/cult status, it's certainly overrated - for despite its obvious qualities, it bears obvious faults that aren't negligible as a whole. It's good, but certainly not anywhere near transcendent, and ultimately it's too long and hollow for its own good: the plot is just too bare and simple - stretches out too long.6/10.",

He is extremely concerned how his hat sits and acts like a whimp when getting a gazing shot into his arms (you want to scream at the screen: \"go watch Rambo to see how a proper tough guy treats his wounds\";-)))To add to this nonsense, the movie shows long shots of people doing basically nothing, so the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter whithou losing anything.The cheesy reference at the beginning to samurai lifestyle which is not even true (I guess the director was referring to the \"ronin\" not \"samurai\") makes it even more look like a piece that someone wrote who had no idea about the subject he wrote.This movie did not age well.

            "content": "\"He is a master at cinema\", said Alain Delon, the main actor in Jean Pierre-Melville's meticulous masterpiece, \"Le Samourai\". Being one of my favorite french directors of all time, I agree with Delon. Before the hard-boiled, World War II classic Army of Shadows, came \"Le Samourai\", the 105 minute film about Jef Costello and his assassinations. I must admit that the time went my faster than it seemed; getting lost through Melville's great story telling not only makes you sweat, but also pauses time.In the rapturously beautiful city that we call Paris, Jef Costello ceaselessly works his but off for constant money, and even for the pleasure of it. His Job?: An Assassin. The beginning of the film shows Jef getting dressed and also getting ready for a kill. There is no dialouge for at least six minutes; just the scene of Jef's rain coat, his iconic hat, and the masterful musical score are shown to the viewer. In an instance, the film changes from the tranquility of Jef's apartment, to the stunning images of a casino, where Jef gets his salary by killing the owner. He rushes out, but he is seen by the pianist playing at the bar. The Cops come, and so advances \"Le Samourai\". After a midnight at the cops station and still no guilty conscience, Jef leaves, and is ultimately followed by cops. The chase goes through buildings, through subways, and all of Paris. The rectifying Mis-en-scene of \"Le Samourai\" hypnotizes. It all fits in. The chase through a partly rainy/sunny day, to the kills at night. It is all masterful. The cops want Jef Costello dead. Jef wants his money. We later learn that Jef is assigned to kill the pianist that once spotted him, so he goes, obviously followed by cops. The ending is typical Melville. The unaltered climax of the film, followed by the whimsical taste of the musical score. Jef is killed.Thanks to the Criterion Collection, Melville has exposed the variety of his films. There are some striking similarities in between Army of Shadows and \"Le Samourai\", but both-in every sense of the word-are masterpieces. There is a very memorable scene of the film in my head: Jef has finally escaped the cops, and meets a blond man who will pay him. It is shot on a bridge to cross the railroad underneath him. The sound, along with their bright faces in the sun, is clear. Nothing but the sound of the trains passing underneath. The scene is perfect. Jef receives his pay, but along with that, he gets a wound to the arm. The viewer knows he isn't dead. Jef runs back to his apartment, and with the sound of the musical score accompanying him, the viewer will solemnly find out that Melville isn't done with us yet. He never will be.",

In the end, the bird has more dialogue than anyone else.Unfortunately, his hit doesn't go off as planned. He kills the owner of a night club, but the club's pianist, Valerie (Rosier) gets more than a brief look at him. The two stare at each other as Jef leaves the owner's office. As a result, Jef is one of the men picked up by the police and questioned. The head of the investigation (Perier) is positive that Jef is the killer, in spite of the fact that Valerie swears it isn't him, and Jef has fixed himself up with alibis: one with a group of card players, and another with Jan (Nathalie Delon).When Jef tries to collect for the hit, the man sent to pay him tries to kill him.Jef thinks Valerie was paid not to identify him, so perhaps she knows who hired him; Jef wants revenge. The detective wants Jef and is watching him pretty much all the time. The man who paid him wants him dead.There is very little dialogue in this film, as mentioned, and Delon's beautiful face is expressionless for the most part; his eyes are cold; one never knows what he's thinking and he seems to have no emotion. His character is unflappable, even when being questioned by the police. However, though injured, he makes sure his parakeet has food. I didn't find this the easiest film to watch; the atmosphere is depressing, and it's one of those movies leading up to a conclusion, but not much happens during the journey. In a way it's almost like watching a silent film. It has some fascinating French neighborhood locations, an good score, and you can't go wrong with the charismatic Delon. There's no question that Melville's take is both different and interesting.As a bit of trivia, the Delons, long divorced now, have a son, Anthony Delon, who is a busy working actor in France.",

            "content": "A man lies on the bed in his shabby, absurdly spartan apartment, smoking listlessly, as the intermittent rush of cars outside, and the incessant chirping of a small bird within are the only noises disturbing the silence. After a while, he gets up, places an undeniably out-of-style, but still incredibly debonair trenchcoat and fedora upon himself, stopping to adjust it perfectly in a mirror before he walks out, exiting to descent down the building's stairs to the rain-soaked streets of a grey, mid-century Paris. Outside, a gendarme patrols amongst the parked vehicles, the man watching him warily, before pulling a ridiculously outsized chain of keys from his pocket, and covertly steals one of the cars, as a strangely carnival-like piece of music begins playing on the soundtrack, as if it's serving to transport us into his world, one that appears to be identical to our own on the surface, but is still an undeniably different reality of its own. Who is this mysterious man in question? His name is Jef Costello, and he serves as the \"hero\" of Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai, a film whose sleek aesthetics and tale of a lone, elite criminal have made it one of those most iconic and influential works of modern crime cinema, but one that still stands apart as a surreal, stylish classic in its own right.It's a film as sparse and cold as the lifestyle of its titular \"samourai\" Jef, played in a career-defining turn from Alain Delon, as a Parisian hitman who lives in about as much solitude as a human being possibly can, with nothing to keep him company in his grotesquely underfurnished apartment besides his impeccable retro fashion sense, the ever-present chirping of his pet bird flitting about in its cage, and the occasional outside visit to his lover (and professional alibi) Jane, the only hint of companionship or human warmth in his life. Of course, that's the way he likes things, as it keeps unnecessary entanglements from complicating his line of work, that is, until he accidentally crosses paths with a beautiful pianist in the process of completing an \"assignment\", a complication that leads to Jef finding himself in the crosshairs of both the police and his murderous employers, even though both of them prove unable to meet the mettle of this modern samurai in the end.It's a simple plot, granted, but the story is definitely not the star here, and to be honest, there are times where if feels like even Delon isn't the star of the film; rather, the real stand-out here is Melville's style, which somehow feels both incredibly minimal and undeniably vivid at the same time, with its emphasis on long, dialogue-free stretches of near-total silence, camerawork that mixes groundbreaking, guerilla-style handheld work during chase scenes with more subtly active cinematography during calmer moments, and its sleek, stylish, modernistic production design that's often stark and monochrome to the point of slight unreality, as Melville takes the world as we know it and alters it as he sees fit, in order to tailor it to the film as perfectly as Costello's 40's-style trenchcoat.Speaking of whom, Delon is no slouch here either, as the unshakably calm, placid professionalism of Jef's demeanor is as cold as the constant, icy-blue stare of his eyes from underneath his ever-present hat, and his underlying, personal code of conduct shines through his characterization despite his lack of dialogue here, as he's a man who's defined by actions rather than words, as is almost everyone else in the film for that matter, as characters often operate in complete, no-nonsense silence, and Melville trusts us not to get antsy with a lack of chatter, rather, letting us just observe events and luxriate in his rich sense of aesthetics as we do so, as, while we observe Jef and watch one master at work, we're doing the same for Melville himself. The entire film has this fascinating sense of solitude about it, as, since Jef never talks unnecessarily, we never learn all that much concrete about his personal ethos, rather, Melville leaves that up to our interpretation, giving us just enough clues to hint at a deeper sense of fatalism beneath the facade of the cold-blooded hitman, as Jef lives by a cryptic, but undeniable code of honor, and, at the end of the film, dies with the honor of a true samurai, but not without leaving an indelible mark on the people around him, much like the one Le Samourai has left behind on generations of filmmakers ever since.",

Deckard must convince the man that he's human, or the guy is going to kill him. Had director \"Melville\" and his star Alain Delon tackled the book, this scene would've gone down (no doubt about it) as one of the greatest in the history of sci-fi cinema.

LE SAMOURAI, with its almost Art Deco Direction (everything is precise and perfectly symmetrical) and film noir trappings, transcends the bounds of traditional film-making. The sets are sparse but hardly Spartan, like the minimalist sets in a Japanese period piece. Delon is as restrained yet as deadly in his own right as a samurai swordsman. His weapon of choice may be a handgun, but in his drive and determination, he is samurai to the core: nothing will stand in his way.

This leaves him free to extricate himself from a mess, as his employers decide that he is now a liability and should be eliminated.

His relationship with his girl (Nathalie Delon) is not a very loving one, but she still is compelled to be loyal to him, even if it means perjuring herself. Overall, \"Le Samourai\" is a potent mix of 1960s French pop culture, and influences including American film noir and Japanese mythology. Co-written by director Jean-Pierre Melville, from the novel \"The Ronin\" by Joan McLeod, it tells a very engrossing story - part crime thriller, part police procedural, and part character study, with an atmospheric soundtrack (by Francois de Roubaix) and a deliberate pace. Starting off with a riveting dialogue-free opening, it gets a lot of juice from the central performance by Delon, who shows us what screen presence is all about.Jef is indeed an extremely cool customer, unflappable in the face of threats, and not prone to panicking. He also never misses a trick, always getting wise when he is under surveillance or being tailed. And Delon receives strong support from Nathalie D. (to whom he was subsequently married for a few years), Rosier, and especially Perier as the lawman.Top entertainment, right until the smashing climax.Eight out of 10.",

            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville's camera work displays the rigor of the classic masters. He knows how to choose the most exciting angle, when to let the images speak, how to contrast bright colors with shadows. Visually, even aurally, speaking, this movie is amazing. I really need to emphasize this aspect because I find little else worthy of praise in this confused (not confusing) thriller.Alain Delon plays Jef Costello, a hit-man who must have seen too many American noir movies because he dressed up like every anti-hero from this type of cinema. it's not a poor fashion choice: trench coat and hat always look cool on a killer, and let's not forget this movie is striving to look visually amazing.But Melville portrays him like a professional, cold-blooded, intelligent killer; and this is where the movie starts falling apart. Viewers who aren't distracted by the cool visuals will notice that Jef is a rather inept hit-man who makes poor choices throughout the movie. Some include: after a hit, he decides to hide in a place he knows will be looking for usual suspects; not getting rid of the aforementioned cool coat and hat that will be the first thing eyewitnesses mention; yes, because there are lots of eyewitnesses: you see, he entered and left the murder scene through the front door in plain sight of everyone.If such behavior doesn't affect your pleasure while viewing a movie whose premise is a professional hit-man, you'll probably love this movie. I couldn't. Things get worse as the movie progresses, until it reaches a point I think Jef is so dumb he deserves to be caught by the police. But enough about spoilers.Thinking about this movie I'm reminded of horror director Dario Argento's Suspiria. Both movies have a lot in common. Both are celebrated in their respective genres. Both are pretty inept at their respective genres. But more importantly, both try to distill the essence of their respective genres. Watching Le Samourai is watching the thriller before you, with all that it signifies: the cool killers, the dames, the chases, the silences, the suspense. This movie should be compulsory watching for directors who want to make thrillers. It should definitely not be studied by screenwriters, though. Cinema doesn't need characters like Jef Costello. It could do with more Jean-Pierre Melvilles, though, which is the only reason I think anyone should watch Le Samourai.",

The film is a study in urban isolation and paranoia and in that regard struck me as a precursor to a whole slew of tonally similar movies that would come out over the succeeding decade, films like \"The Conversation,\" \"Klute,\" and \"Rosemary's Baby.\" Director Jean-Pierre Melville is a master at creating atmosphere, but if I'm being honest I feel like he's let down a bit by his leading man. Delon's character barely speaks a word of dialogue, so it's really important that the actor playing him be able to convey heaps through facial expressions and body language, and Delon just isn't quite a good enough actor to put it over. As it is it's a solid exercise in bleak fatalism, but with an actor who could really hint at a richer inner life for this lonely character, it could have had the gut punch of a tragedy as well.Grade: A-",

I liked it enough the first time I saw it many years ago that when I saw it recently on the shelf in my local video store, I wanted to see it again. The film has a lot of style, good use of sound and music and the presence of Alain Delon. After seeing this film for a second time recently, just as another commentator in the forum noticed, I was impressed how this film must have been very influential on American film makers in the seventies. Many thrillers of the seventies feature a loner hero much like Jef Costello.\nHowever, is this a great film? I don't think so. Roger Ebert and many high brow critics (you know, the ones who like to use words like \"Kafkaesque\", \"existential\" and \"archetypal\") consider this to be one of  the most perfect films ever made. But the film is far from perfect. The film at times slows down a lot. There is (mentioned previously by another commentator in this forum) the overly long and pointless scene where the cops bug Costello's apartment. Then there is an overly long scene of Costello tending to a gun shot wound. It always annoys me when I see critics (American ones) heap praises on European made films and then totally ignore or dismiss similar American films that are just as good or better than their European counterparts. Perhaps its just Paris envy.",

Le Samourai belongs to him, it is one of those films that cannot be re-imagined with another lead. I was so captivated by his performance that I found myself rewinding certain areas of the film, watching his facial expressions twice, just because. His performance is complimented by tremendous camera-work, some of the best I've ever seen, work that highlights the more degraded and seedy locales found in Parisian suburbs.. These choices for locations give the film a great texture, along with the use of decrepit wallpaper, rain and mirrors (and mirrors and mirrors!)..

And an aesthetic simplicity in the manner its events unfold in front of the viewers. It tells the story of an extremely methodical assassin named Jef Costello, who meticulously plans each of his murders plus never leaves behind any trace & has a strong alibi as a back-up just in case anything goes wrong. And this whole film is concerned with that one kill only which goes wrong.The film opens with the introduction of Jef Costello about to execute one of his carefully planned murders & from then on it maintains a level of sophistication in its narration that's pure mastery. Having heard nothing but only praise about this film from almost everyone for past many months resulted in me going into it with sky-high expectations which in the end were met but weren't exceeded, Le Samoura\u00ef turned out to be a gem of a cinema but it didn't blow me away like I was expecting it to. As I said, the fault is mine this time.Anyway, coming back to the movie, the direction by Jean-Pierre Melville is slick & stylish, the camera-work makes steady use of controlled movements that aren't rushed at any given time, editing provides its story a fine tuned pace & the use of music is minimal. Plus, this film also highlights the importance of casting the right actors for the right roles & what a big difference this one factor can make to its fortunes. And although the casting of supporting roles can be argued here but Alain Delon was born to play Jef Costello & that's simply indisputable.With his cold eyes, calm composure, minimal conversations, unmatched screen presence & being aware of his surroundings at all times, Delon turns out to be the very embodiment of everything Jef Costello was suppose to be & delivers a performance he'll always be remembered for. On an overall scale, Le Samoura\u00ef is as smart, suave & impressive as the assassin it depicts & although greater expectations may have slightly dented my first experience of this influential classic, the future revisits kind of assures only one direction on its rating scale & that's north.",

After stealing a Citroen DS, Costello drives into a garage. The license plates are changed and Costello is given a gun. He drives away. This is all done without dialog. This is how Jean-Pierre Melville films the first 30 minutes of his 1967 masterpiece The Samurai. Costello is a killer for hire. He never makes a mistake and never gets caught. But life becomes a game of cat and mouse when he is seen by several witnesses. Soon he finds himself running from the police, and the mobsters who hired him. The cinematography is excellent. There are long periods of dialog as Melville uses the camera angles and views to tell his story. Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"In a great film, the sound could be muted and the audience would know exactly what is going on.\" This seems to be true in this film. The little things like Costello's bird, how he walks, how he reacts, and just the smallest things about the film, make it seem all the more beneficial on the film's behalf. What makes this film a masterpiece is not only the story but how it is told. As I've already said, Melville uses expert cinematography to film Delon as he goes from place to place. Every frame of the film looks cool. That is the entire mood of the film. This film is to cool, what Bill Murray is to sarcastic. This film is probably the coolest looking film I've ever seen.

            "content": "Of the films that I have seen of Melville I have enjoyed two, BOB THE GAMBLER, which I saw twice in the theaters in the early 1980's, and the one he made with Jean Paul Belmondo, English translation THE STOOL PIDGEON. Both films are in black and white, and for the source of material that he was doing, they seemed more effective in black and white. His other films that I have seen, for me leave a lot to be desired. ARMY OF SHADOWS is a good film, but so downbeat that after trying to watch it I found it more interesting to watching with the Audio Commentary on the Criterion DVD. LE CERCLE ROUGE starts out very promising, but what hurts that film is that there is no chemistry between Alain Delon and Gian Maria Volente. Even Melville himself felt that the film was hurt by Vollente, and their relationship on this film was not very good, with Melville I believe saying he would never want to work with him again.Melville made three films with Delon, and I believe that having Delon in these films helped make financing possible. Delon was a huge star in France and some other countries. Personally for me why some people consider him a good actor, and why he would have become a star is beyond me. Except for PURPLE NOON, the best film I have seen with Delon, and the film he did with Antonioni, I have found him rather boring. Perhaps French speaking audiences can more appreciate him then this Yank. When he did try to make American films, they always bombed, and he did not become a Hollywood star as he apparently thought he was destined for.If SAMOURAI had been made in black and white, it might have worked for this viewer a little better. When originally released in the US, in a cut a dubbed version, and titled THE GODSON (captializing on the then upcoming film THE GODFATHER), it was panned. I think that just because it is now seen uncut and it is in French does not make a great film. I first saw the film at the Pacific Film Archives in Berkeley California when I was 25, and to be honest, the film put me to sleep. I had so much hope for it after having seen BOB THE GAMBLER. I watched the film again on DVD, and while I did not fall asleep, I felt the film is cold, uninteresting with all style, very little substance, and for me 0 entertainment value. Delon I feel looks ridiculous with his hat. The idea of this man being somewhat the equivalent of a samurai in either his code of thinking, or how he acts is pretentious and did not work for me.It can't be denied that the film has influenced a generation of other film makers. THE DRIVER with Ryan Oneal is a direct take off, and a far more interesting film and enjoyable crime film. Chou Yun Fat somewhat was influenced by Delon when he did THE KILLER, and minus the gun shooting, his performance carries much more weight, and he is an interesting character. In both of those films, Oneal and Fat have interesting counterparts in the detectives who are trying to catch them, in SAMOURAI, I do not see that interesting counterpart. A film that I believe was made in France at the time to solely make money is mistakenly called a perfect film. Is perfection than just some void?",

The fact that Le Samoura\u00ef is the DVD #306 of the marvelous Criterion Collection was just another reason to look out for it since in my personal experience I have seen only great films from that collection (the last one I watched I think was the French Jeux interdits aka Forbidden Games. It is a gem, a beautiful piece of work). The last Thursday I finally got that DVD, via a present, and I started to read more about the film now from the box and booklet. \"director Jean- Pierre Melville's masterpiece Le Samoura\u00ef defines cool\", that's the way the little synopsis from the box ends but it was one of the first phrases from the essay that John Woo (director of The Killer, Hard-Boiled and Face/Off, and of course others, if you don't know who Woo is) wrote, that is part of the great booklet and that originally appeared in the French journal Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma in its edition of November of 1996. \"Melville is god to me\", is what John Woo wrote and when I read that I just put away the booklet, it was enough to me of reading extremely positive stuff about this film, it was time to finally watch it. Am I somewhat disappointed after watching it? Absolutely not, I was basically fascinated with the film. It is the type of film that you want to love and I'm glad to report with this comment that I loved it. Since the first minutes of it you are interested in the main character, in Jef Costello (Alain Delon). The modern French samurai who works as a contract killer and who during the first minutes steals an amazing Citro\u00ebn DS (look the amazing old models of cars) and who starts to give us a little \"tour\" in his home city Paris, France. There is not a single dialog, those unforgettable images are more than enough. And is unique because the introduction to our main character is the introduction to his work, how professional he is, so how cold he is, and his precautions. As soon as you see him in troubles you know that he has everything under control. One of the scenes that can easily define this character and his pals (if they are his pals) is when the police arrives to their meeting point where they are playing cards, smoking, etc. Jef has already done his job, which means that he just killed a man and the police enter searching for suspects. Jef and his pals are asked about when do they get there and the police only takes Jef with them but the interesting thing is that no one of his pals says a word, s soon as the police is out, with Jef, they continue with their game just like if nothing happened. And not to say the reaction of Jef, a thing called nervousness is a thing that Jef doesn't really know. He is a memorable character with that particular style (see how he put on his hat). John Woo was not more a hippie after watching this film; he left behind his long hair and started to wear suits and hats. But Jef is a contract killer, a cold lonely wolf, with that particular way to do his job, basically he had everything under control however later on the same night in which he committed a murder he is at a police station, there are some witnesses trying to clear their minds to recognize that man who killed in the nightclub. We know that one of those witnesses clearly saw the face of Jef, that black girl who plays the piano (and who is portrayed by Caty Rosier). She will be the only one that did practically an unexpected move. This entire problem at that police station was only another introduction on how Jef works. But here we are introduced to another important and very interesting character, the police Superintendent (Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier). Jef played his cards in a perfect way, the police Superintendent can't really do anything against that however he always knew that something was wrong with that suspect, he knew who was being honest and who was lying and basically he will not stop since we all know that he was always right. And the entire story is simple but really great and very well structured. Basically we saw what Jef did and upon that we are watching the movements of the people who want Jef with them, we may be thinking that this time they finally could get a little closer to the lonely wolf but is clear that they need something more. It is a quite exciting crime picture with a great Alain Delon. By reading some of the reviews from this site one can see that many claims that this was a very boring picture. I'm sure those who are claiming that are the ones who thinks that Quentin Tarantino is god and please don't get me wrong and my comments won't lend me lie I really like QT work. Definitely I couldn't have a better introduction to the work of Jean- Pierre Melville with this film. Maybe I'm exited however I just have seen this film twice (one by myself and other time with my cousins, by the way) and it is a great and unforgettable picture, a masterpiece, simply that. 10 out of 10Criterion DVD: the quality of the image is great as usual. Some of the extras are video interviews of Rui Nogueira and Ginette Vincendeau, theatrical trailer and a 29-page booklet featuring film scholar David Thomson, filmmaker John Woo, and selections from Melville on Melville.\" It is a single disc edition with a normal package but it is absolutely great.",

Honestly, for a good deal of its runtime, it feels purely like an exercise in being cool, as if it's trying to be as sleek and detached and stylish as a film could possibly be. A good deal of that comes from the pacing, as the main plot takes half the movie to really kick off, and it's not until the final scenes where you can sort of \"get\" what the movie is about.Also helping the film be cool is Alain Delon in the lead role. I don't know if this his very best performance, but it's surely up there (and it might be his most iconic role). I think a lot of actors would seem like they're trying too hard, when playing a distant, emotionless, and effortlessly cool character, but Delon pulls it off perfectly. And when there's a need to hint at what's going on beneath his icy exterior, Delon's got the acting chops to do so.The pacing and drawn-out scenes are occasionally challenging, but I still find this to be a very rewarding watch, and it clicked a little more on a second viewing. The way it looks is pretty great, music is used sparsely but effectively, and the structure of the film ends up being quite satisfying... you just have to have the patience to see the film take form, because it takes pride in really taking its time.Ultimately, French crime-thrillers from the 1950s and 60s probably represent the peak of the genre. Le Samourai is an example of why and how those movies from this time we so good, and it earns its status as a classic gangster movie.8.5/10.",

Mr. Mellville has added several popular details from Japanese culture into a fictitious gangster story. The protagonists, costumes, nightclubs, streets and murders have all the characteristics of the noir genre.Jef Costello lives in a single-room Paris apartment whose spartan furnishings include a little bird in a cage. He is a professional Parisian assassin-for-hire who, by nature of his work's solitary demands, has no friends. Although he is loved by Jane, Costello knows that she already has a lover. After he successfully wipes out a nightclub owner at the behest of his boss, he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses, including piano player Val\u00e9rie. Although he survives a police lineup thanks to a lie offered up by the fearless Valerie, Costello's alibi disintegrates rapidly and his shadowy employer takes out a contract on him. He seeks revenge...This is a sort of moral value test in rough circumstances. Namely, the main protagonist is in conflict with the law, his boss and himself. He does not make the difference between human shades. He does what he is paid for, and that, of course, will lead him to his seppuku.This film contains very little dialogue, characterization could have been better, but, the atmosphere is great.Alain Delon as Jef Costello is an attractive man and a cold-blooded killer at the same time. His selfish nature makes him incompetent to life, but unswerving when it comes to his work. Mr. Delon has offered a very good performance.His support are Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier as a persistent investigating officer, Nathalie Delon (Jane) as a devoted \"fianc\u00e9\", who provides almost perfect alibi, and Cathy Rosier (Val\u00e9rie) as a brave and enigmatic piano player.The direction is certainly impeccable, however, the plot is a frozen and the romance is improperly superficial.",

And the brilliant thing is you can sense this difference and admire it quite gallantly by watching both \"Le Samourai\" and Jarmusch's \"Ghost Dog\".Some may argue it is slow paced, but the reality is that it wouldn't be as good if it weren't paced this way, mainly because that's what makes the whole film as superior as it is. Alain Delon is absorbing and delivers an impeccable performance, which fits so ideally into the whole perspective of the film, that it conjures a strange feeling of eeriness. The well contrived plot is not a point of discussion, merely due to the fact that it's so good you can't go wrong with a \"helmer\" like Melville - subtle and yet imposing. Moreover, the music simply defines the situations, it renders the images clearer than I've ever seen/heard it done before. They work perfectly together.However, in this specific set of circumstances, despite this flawlessly portrayed destiny of the assassin, there is no room for excellency. By saying this I'm referring to the relationships which go beyond the cinematic realm (very clearly defined), so helplessly lost in this essence of noir. It may be a defining trait, but that doesn't imply I have to enjoy it. Actually, enjoying this genre is one of the most complex things to do, no matter how good a movie is.

Alain Delon plays Jef Costello, a killer who becomes a suspect after killing someone he doesn't know and his boss wants to get rid of him because he thinks he might be a threat due to the police. The visual storytelling in this film is remarkable, there are several scenes in this film where there is no dialogue for a few minutes and the viewer still perfectly understands what is going on. The opening scene in particular stands out in that regard. The music is great and the acting is pretty solid too. The camerawork is also fantastic and the cinematography is mostly good aswell (although the interiors are definetely way too dark at times). So, what's so \"not great\" about this film?I don't find the story compelling or gripping at all. A lot of scenes are unnecessarily drawn out and serve very little purpose. There's a scene where 2 policemen install a bugging device in Jef's bedroom and for some reason, this scene feels like it's 15 minutes long. What makes things worse it that Jef finds the bugging device right away, which means the previous scene, while it was still beautifully shot and made, served no purpose, since it doesn't change the outcome of anything. There's also a scene where the police officer (forgot his name) goes to Ms. Lagrange's home and asks her if she still says that Jef was at her house in the night of the murder. She replies \"Yes\" and the officer leaves her house. What was this scene for? Everyone knows as much as they knew before. The officer even says that he doesn't quite believe her and that he will talk with her again, but he never does that in the film, which also creates a loose end in that regard. There's also Michel Boisrond's character, who supposedly \"saw\" Jef while arriving at Ms. Lagrange's house and then he is asked to identify him in a group of several men. He is able to identify him, but how is he able to do that? The film made me believe that he didn't know Jef at all and if he did the film should have said that. There's another weird scene: After the police officer lets Jef leave the police station, Jef goes to the Jazz Club where he murdered that guy. Now WHY would anybody go back to the place where he killed someone? Isn't he in danger of being spotted or recognized by someone in the club? So many scenes in this film have very little credibility to me and I don't find the characters interesting at all either.So, while Melville is technically definetely a great director, I don't quite know his skills at creating good stories (because I haven't seen any of his other films) but I still have very mixed feelings about Le Samourai.",

After some time the person rises from his bed (fully dressed), put on his raincoat and fedora and leaves the room. Not a single word is spoken, and this goes on for a couple of minutes. The only other intro I can think of that is silent for so long is \"There will be blood\" (2007, Paul Thomas Anderson).The person in question is Jef Costello (Alain Delon), hitman. He not only is a person of few words but also a person of no emotions. He therefore almost becomes a cartoon like character.One possible interpretation about the end is that the film is all about the contraposition between being a professional and allowing emotions. Once Jef Costello falls in love with a woman he loses his professionalism.Jean Pierre Melville is a French director who was obviously inspired by American cinema. \"Le samourai\" is modeled after the genre of the \"film noir\".On his turn Melville enspired countless directors after him. We see the theme of the professional hitman in films such as \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann) and \"Leon\" (1994, Luc Besson). Maybe even more important are mechanisms to create the right ambiance. The very cold blue that permeates \"Le samourai\" is for example als used by David Fincher in \"Zodiac\" (2007).One peculiair element about \"Le samourai\" is its title. Samourai were Japanese warriors bound to a strict code of honor. They would never kill with the sole purpose of earning money, which is the essence of a hitman.",

From the moment we first see him adjusting his coat and straightening his hat in the mirror, he gives of an unmistakable aura of mystery and danger. This impression is confirmed within the next few minutes. He effortlessly steals a car without being noticed. In a nearby garage, the license plate is replaced, a gun is received, and a fistful of bills changes hands without a word from either party. At the club, he walks confidently past the bar and dance floor, and into the manager's office. When asked who he is, he replies simply \"It doesn't matter. As to his business, he is equally direct. \"I'm here to kill you.\" And then he does, with a single shot to the head, before escaping into the night.This man is more than dangerous. He is fearless, ruthless, utterly professional, and one of the very best at what he does. He also lives by a personal code of honor. Killing is obviously not a problem, but he doesn't kill indiscriminately. There's no collateral damage the club, and later he spares a man he has good reason to kill. And more importantly, if he's agreed to kill someone, he'll see it through to the end. For him, nothing is more important than the contract.But even Jeff Costello is not untouchable. From the moment he kills the club leader, the police have reason to suspect him. He avoids charges thanks to an alibi prepared with his girlfriend Valerie, plus a witness who lies for reasons of her own, but detectives continue to follow his every step. Worse, his panicked employer decides he's become a liability, and that he must be killed. Costello must now kill his former backer- whose identity he doesn't know- while staying one step ahead of police surveillance.As hinted at earlier, one of this film's great strengths is its ability to tell so much about Costello with so little dialogue. His actions speak volumes, and when he speaks, there is not a single unnecessary word. A short exchange with the piano player from the club sums up the nature of his day to day existence.\"Why did you kill Marty?\" \"I was told I'd be paid.\" \"What did he ever do to you?\" \"Nothing at all. I didn't even know him.\" \"What kind of man are you?\"What kind of man is he? That is the question. For all that we know about Costello, there is still so much we don't know. Where does he come from? What led him to become a hit man? Payment is of great importance to him, but is that his only motivation? Or does he live for the thrill and challenge of the carrying out a hit? And what of his relation to Valerie? Are they really lovers, or is she just a handy alibi? And the ending, with its unexpected revelations, brings only more questions. But in the end, what we don't know about Jeff Costello is as important as what we do. He remains a man of mystery; a man with no past; a hard-nosed killer, yet somehow noble. It is these unknowns which make him loom larger in the viewers mind, and which make Le Samourai a truly great film. Four Stars",

It must, it demands, to be experienced as only film can be. The opening shot says it all, a master shot that establishes the tone, atmosphere and volume level for the rest of the story. The man, the anti-hero, the protagonist of sorts is Jef Costello, a French man with an American name (much like the director) who goes about his business in the most business-like and professional of manners. He never smiles and barely cracks any other type of emotion: he is the most detached hit-man ever to grace the screen, which makes him all the more difficult to relate to.Jean-Pierre Melville is a master director of the minute, the minimal. Every tiny detail of Costello's life (and there are many) is perfectly arranged and placed in just the place it should. Perhaps the best way Melville was able to present to the audience Costello's perfectionist, simplistic and determined philosophy of life is through incredibly crisp and fluid editing. This is one of the few films I have seen where every single shot serves a specific purpose to the overall feel and goal of the film. It is beyond words to describe or 'rate' such a film. It is, in few words, the type of film that cannot even be summed up in one phrase or word. It is a film that demands to be seen multiple times, showcasing the perfect looks and actions of Jef Costello and the director so similar to his (anti)hero.",

            "content": "Melville is one of my favorites, and not just Herman. A director like Jean-Pierre Melville, who can give us the wry humanity of Bob le Flambeur and the austere fatalism of Army of Shadows, is a man to be reckoned with. Le Samourai, on the other hand, left me unsure whether I was watching an homage to American gangster movies or a comedy routine. Whenever Jef Costello went walking quickly down the street or through a crowded nightclub, shoulders slightly hunched, hat pulled low over his face, hands thrust deep into the pockets of his trench-coat, collar pulled up, all I could think of was Bugs Bunny doing his cartoon take on Sam Spade. When Jef barges into the office of the owner of Martey's, I expected him to ask \"What's up, doc?\" before plugging the guy. Don't get me wrong. There is much to admire in Le Samourai, not the least of which is the clarity and style of the film and the carefully constructed persona of Jef Costello (Alan Delon). Melville reportedly told Delon that Delon didn't need to act in the film, just be photographed. Delon scarcely moves a facial muscle throughout the film. In my view, this pushes the movie awfully close to film caricature...and would tip it right over if it weren't for the counter- balancing performances of Francois Perier, as the police superintendent determined to catch Costello, and Cathy Rosier, as the nightclub piano player. Perier just about steals the movie for me and Rosier is used to develop layers of ambiguity and possible betrayal. Delon gives us what Melville wanted, an artifice of movement, posture and expression, fascinating as time passes but with no more depth than a carefully dressed manikin in the window of an expensive shop. The gangster with a code of honor? That really is a Hollywood fairy tale, which Melville gives us without blinking an eye. Le Samourai, for me, is a movie well worth watching, but is best enjoyed by those intrigued by style over substance. It's a sad day, however, when praise from such \"stylists\" as John Woo and Quentin Tarantino can be taken as proof of Melville's stature as a director. Woo and Tarantino are as different from Melville as Morton's table salt is from fleur de sel. Neither has shown himself capable of producing films such as Army of Shadows or Bob le Flambeur. Melville might be a stylist, but he used serious content on which to build style, and style almost always served content. Melville's curse, partly due to his own statements, is that he is the kind of director some cineastes love to natter about. \"Creative art,\" Melville said, \"is based on lies -- which can only be exploited properly, in my opinion, if one is not a liar in real life.\" This is a statement pregnant with apparent truth but which makes no sense at all...except to passionate film students. Melville is the sort of director cineastes can talk to death. Fortunately, we have his films to judge for ourselves. By all means buy and watch Le Samourai. But, please, also buy and watch Army of Shadows. In the Criterion DVD edition there is a substantial booklet which, among other articles, includes a John Woo piece, \"The Melville Style.\" It first appeared in, what else, Cahiers du Cinema.",

He is subsequently picked up by the police and everything links him to the murder, except none of those called to bear witness do so and a false alibi from the lovely femme fatale, Jane, who it seems was played by Delon's wife, as her character is accredited to Nathalie Delon and according to IMDb have had a son, Anthony.As we subtly learn, the witnesses in the Club are all in on the crime but of course, an assassin that might expose those who commissioned it, by being no. 1 suspect, are susceptible to a taste of their own medicine, shall we say? I'll leave the plot there, as it's enough for one to imagine the story lines linking them without giving anything away.But, it's the cool complexity and smoothness of the direction, that's a textbook study of the routine police-work, which becomes riveting, in itself. Every frame counts, the angles, the backgrounds - not so much that it gets all too much or is flashy and never upstages the coolest hit-man since Humphrey Bogart. With the looks that even Paul Newman might envy, Delon eschews a steely fragility, he doesn't show it, but we sense it's there, at times. That's the quality of the acting for you.The music, in particular, has that haunting, 'man alone' sort of theme, by Francois de Roubaix. Very Gallic, very French - the music makes you more intent and fits perfectly.Now, the to the Korean DVD. Shop around, that's all I can say, really, except perhaps my copy was a lot less than what's currently on offer. Apart from the DVD's writing, there's almost no giving away its origins.

The killer with a heart of gold has been portrayed since Le Samourai in many different films, yet none have managed to match Delon's cold, detached performance.The opening scene in particular gives a palpable feel of how empty, how cold, and how lonely Jef's life is. He lies on a bed in near darkness and smokes a cigarette in a bleak looking apartment. the only movement in the scene is the plumes of smoke rising from the cigarette, and the only sounds are the cars outside, driving down the rain-soaked streets of Paris. Its such an effective scene, and in true Melville style, he is able to convey such feeling by using a minimalist approach.The movie continues on its way, with a narrative that is surely familiar to most cinephiles by now; killer for hire does a job and is double crossed by those who hired him. Naturally, he seeks revenge. Jef must also contend with a tenacious policeman who despite Jef's carefully crafted airtight alibi, instinctively knows he's the killer, and will follow him like a hawk hunting its prey. This leads to a wonderfully structured scene where Jef tries to lose various policemen and women through the Paris metro subway through various clever means.One of the most impressive aspects of Melville's film is how he is able to unfold a fairly complex plot despite the lack of dialogue and how he is able to keep the viewer mesmerised despite the lack of action. And also credit must go to Delon who despite being almost robotic in his performance, never fails to be less than captivating.The look of the film is another huge element of its feel. the drab colour palette used is effective, the various shades of grey, black white, and the generally dim lighting and bleak weather, really reflect the loneliness and isolation of Jef, and almost seems to signify his inevitable path to death (which Jef seems fully aware of too).Its a truly individual film in its style and one that i cant wait to rewatch many times over the years.",

Not happy with the loose ends, Jef is ordered to kill the only witness to the crime, the woman at the club.Critique: A coolly ambivalent study into a modern-day 'Samourai' (an outcast who lives by his own set of rules). French director Jean-Pierre Melvilles' fascination with American 'hard-boiled' novellas of 1940s and 50s inspired his movie-making career. He liked the world of dangerous liaisons between criminals and the law, exploring their dual relationships. Melville's \"Samourai\" is a study into minimalist storytelling, concentrating on establishing a menacing mood devoid of feelings, almost nihilistic in nature (watch for the stunning opening shot). Inhabited by rain and darkness (which are classic 'film-noir' motifs), and a sense of encroaching doom. At the center is Melville's hero 'Le Samourai', played with easy detachment by Alain Delon. One of the cinema's most charismatic actors, Delon brings a stoic, beautiful presence to create a memorably unique character.

His intended victim for this particular job is the owner of a popular club.Quite debonair with his hat, trench coat, clean cut looks, and icy blue eyes, Costello is a man of keen intellect and possesses the emotions of a stone.

As he leaves the scene of the crime, Costello is spotted by the club's jazz pianist and is later brought into police headquarters and questioned repeatedly by the police, but his icy fa\u00e7ade does not break, and although the police are sure he killed the proprietor, the workers, including the jazz pianist of the club are unable to identify him as the killer.

This is in addition to each beautifully composed shot.Jeff carries out his hit, killing a night club owner, but is rounded up in an intense twenty minute sequence where the police, try to find the killer among the line. Of course it's too early in the film for Costello to be taken to prison, we realize as a viewer, but the suspense comes in knowing Jeff killed the man and going step by step as the police at first are only going through person by person, but begin to suspect Costello and use every tactic they can to try and implicate him. I won't spoil how he gets out, but trust me when I say even on repeat viewings, the tension of this entire part does not falter.Although let go, he is trailed by the police and sought after by former employer, who fear him getting caught and ratting them out to police. For much of the movie we are treated to a cat and mouse game where he evades both sides constantly, whether through a memorable sub way chase or an almost western style shoot out. Smooth editing and tight pacing combine with the great visuals to create a brisk thriller that despite often being free of dialogue, never gets dull and never overstays it's welcome. Melville is a master of detail, going through things step by step (whereas most would cut out many details), only piling on the suspense. There's also many little touches, such as how we almost never see Costello draw his gun, it just is suddenly in his hands (in most cases anyway).Now I could talk about the aesthetics of this movie for longer, but one common quip about this film is that it is style more than substance. Now I won't deny style is a big part of the appeal, but I don't feel the film is lacking. It's a simple story, but effective. Not just for the crime thriller aspects, but Jeff himself, played with cold calculation as well as subtle intimidation by Alan Demoine. He talks very little, and his motivations are ambiguous. It's comically common for a movie to be called existential simply because it's arty, but in this case it applies. Jeff's motives are never made entirely clear. We are left only to try and interpret what he's thinking at any given time, only knowing he is driven by some inner code of conduct. Ultimately this is what the movie is about, not the cops, not the double cross, but Jeff himself. He is a fascinating character and one could talk endlessly about what drives him and what the ending was about.If you can appreciate films driven more by suspense than action, more vague than explained, such as \"Bullit\", \"Point Blank\", \"The French Connection\", etc. than \"Le Samurai\" is up your alley.",

            "content": "This meticulously brilliant film by Jean-Pierre Melville follows French hit-man Jef (Alain Delon) through1960s Paris as he assassinates a man, goes in for questioning and later evades the police. He is cold, he is cool, yet strangely likable. I have yet to understand why I want him to get away with it. The movie is done to perfection. Sparse, cold, nothing more than what is necessary. There isn't any dialogue for the first 10 minutes and there are several other long blocks with no speaking, during which one is completely engaged and intent on the action. Throughout the film, every movement that Jef makes is perfectly planned, execution with exactness. He is calm, never ruffled or nervous and his face is completely emotionless with hardly a blink of the eye. He lives for honor, and perfection.This movie is like smooth, frozen vanilla custard. It is exquisitely smooth and the taste is clean and pure. It has just enough flavor to make it delicious without overwhelming and not a superfluous drop of topping or nut to crowd out the simple, intensity of the custard. 9/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",

Though there are some plot holes which can be found if studied deeply I feel that the film is meant to be a stylish take on a philosophy and in that capacity it works perfectly.

            "content": "Although the director, Melville, explained that his film can be analyzed from two perspectives - that of the existentialist contemplation of death or that of the psychoanalytical scope of schizophrenia - it is often best to take the film for what it seems to the layman: A wonderfully shot, minimalistic and a representation of what noir should really be.What makes this film most incredible is its minimalism. Despite being very simple in its story, there is something gripping about watching the events unfold - i.e. the execution - and to reiterate this use of minimalism, to be more specific it is in the use of camera, the choice of choosing a focus on action over dialogue, and colours that are (as Melville stated) an attempt to take the hitherto defining attribute of black-and-white noir into colour. He indeed pulled it off successfully, managing to focus on muted blues, greys, and other darker tones.To give important informative background: The way of the Samurai lay in death. There is a point in the story being entitled such, however, the depth behind exactly why does hold implications that are, fortunately, easy to understand. It is the whole \"schizophrenic\" interpretation that will be more than likely very difficult to construe. Noir, meaning \"dark,\" is an art movement and genre established by the French that is defined by an at-the-time revolutionary casting of an anti-hero as the protagonist, controversial subject matter - usually related to murder and mystery- and often filled with clever twists that lead to death or incarceration. The coined \"femme fatale\" (fatal woman) came from this genre, as well, the genre was defined by an emphasis on use of shadows and contrasting black and white.Last but not least, the actors are wonderful. The star, Alan Delon, is perfectly cast, as well as everyone else, however; Delon has this stage presence that is so overwhelming that it's no wonder he is seen as the pinnacle of \"cool\" by so many. It's neat too, because he is an actor that is quite capable of playing a range of emotions based on other films I have seen him in.This is my personal favorite movie of all time. I recommend it with immense passion to absolutely anyone who is even remotely interested in either noir or hit-man films. If you like this, I strongly suggest watching: The Killing *Following * Leon (The Professional) * The Postman Always Rings Twice",

The main character, even though he says almost nothing and almost never shows emotion, is both likable and memorable. Somehow I end up rooting for him throughout the whole film, even though he's an objectively bad person. The other actors are hit/miss; the mai detective is good, and the love interest too, but many of the smaller characters don't really seem like they're acting, more like reading lines. The plot does a good job of jumping from quiet/tension building scenes to short bursts of action and violence.

            "content": "If you're looking for a truly captivating and awe-inspiring thriller about a hit man, Le Samourai is definitely a film that won't let you down. It's a minimalistic movie, where nothing exciting really happens, but with all the magnificent cinematography, editing techniques, use of various camera angles, and wrapped up with a very original background sounds, Le Samourai comes as a defining picture in the crime genre. It's a well-developed mixture of a suspense film, inspired by the western crime scene, a bit of a neo-noir experiment, and an addition of European avant-garde directorial skills.The film starts with a shot at a nearly empty room, with a birdcage in the center. The bird is tweeting loudly, but nothing really happens inside the apartment. It's a purposely-melancholic moment that will abruptly change with the killer procedure that is about to performed.Jean-Pierre Melville made a great decision when he cast the young and handsome Alain Delon as Jeff Costello, an utterly calm, smooth, unemotional, scrupulous and ruthless contract killer operating in Paris. He absorbs the viewer's attention with the tranquil attitude and focus on every smallest detail.Jeff was always able to create a perfect alibi for himself, with a little help from a mysterious girlfriend named Jane (Nathalie Delon). However, this one time, something went wrong. The human aspect interfered. Even though his confession cleared up after the police interrogated him thoroughly, the inquisitive Superintendent still thought that Jeff was behind the cold-blooded murder that's been committed in an elegant Parisian nightclub. What's more, Jeff has been double crossed by his contractor and left with a bullet in the arm instead of promised money.The film presents an interesting insight into the assassin's mind, in the moments when he has to deal with both of the institutions that are trying to catch him. His face expression changes maybe twice, he says only a few words in the whole movie, but the viewer is still capable of evaluating his thoughts and character traits, not only through his actions. With all that he's been doing, going out mostly at night, he detached himself from reality and became lonelier than the loneliest creature - the samurai.In the process, the director shows a fine perspective on how the French police operate on a daily basis and how they routinely track the prime suspects.The greatness of the picture is presented in the memorable scene of a chase that takes place in the Parisian metro system. Not a sound can be heard, not a single fight takes place, but it's still as gripping as ever. The suspense is going through the roof, as Jeff tries to escape from the hands of the all-seeing eyes of the law. The storytelling abilities of the director are exemplified by his ability to create a picture where only a few words are said, but every one of them is quintessential to the whole.All in all, I wouldn't recommend the movie to fans of ultra-violent, gore crime movies that are often produced these days. But I would recommend it to anyone, who is able to appreciate the true beauty of a classic, which provides the cinematic experience of the highest sort. Through the emphasis on small details, where every sound, word, scene, or object is important, Melville created a movie as much about the journey of a contract killer, as it is about the overwhelming loneliness that is able to gradually consume a human being from within, often leading to an unexpected and sad end.",

            "content": "European films are known for the French New Wave style of filmmaking where they break the rules, especially in the editing room. The jump cuts originated from them, they cut their films without following the rules set upon by the Hollywood filmmakers which is suppose to be like this - establishing shot to know the location then medium to go closer to the characters, and then close-up for the dialogues. I have seen many old French films who disregards these techniques, but I was surprised to see this in Le Samourai a crime film starring Alain Delon about a professional hit man named Jeff Costello. Viewing this in the 21st century days of filmmaking I have to say it is beyond its time. It doesn't only have that Hollywood film-noir style, but it has the contemporary indie filmmaking of today which is slow-burn and edgy.Le Samourai is about Jeff Costello a hit man for hire who is tasked to kill an owner of a nightclub for the price of 2 million, but everything goes wrong when the nightclub's pianist played by Cathy Rosier sees him after the crime. The investigation happens after and Jeff Costello's alibi is strongly believed by the police because of the convincing statements of his lover who is also his accomplice, but the head of the investigation is not impressed, and after Costello's release the police still plots some investigations. The pianist who is the only witness of the crime denies the accusation that Jeff Costello is the murderer, and this leads to Jeff Costello wanting to know more about the pianist if she is hired to protect him or she has hidden affection to him. And then everything becomes a cat and mouse game.The mise-en-scene of the film is gloomy and dark it evokes the soulless act of killing. Jeff Costello's costume has a distinct trademark and character into it. He wears a fedora hat and brown trench coat, but inside of that he's wearing a dark suit which depicts who he is inside an empty and obscure person. Almost all of the character in the film is dressed in gray and dark tone which uplifts the edginess of the film. The cinematography isn't that impressive compared to some Hitchcock films which is also released in those decades. It losses it's suspense because the cinematography is not giving us hints or clues, but it releases actions abruptly. In terms of acting everyone is greatly directed especially the protagonist played by Alain Delon, he shows a nuance and silent approach to the character which reminds me of Ryan Gosling's acting in Drive or maybe that's Gosling's spirit animal that time. Cathy Rosier is elegant and mesmerizing with her role as a pianist she manages to attract my eyes every time she comes in the scene and her skin tone makes her more unique, and her last scene in the film is memorable.The structure of the story is very well-thought of by opening it slowly in a room apartment without nothing happening is an amusing approach making us viewers think what will be the journey of this story before it starts and it turns out to be unpredictable, and on the revelation scenes everyone will be on the edge of their seats. The denouement part of the film in the nightclub is a memorable scene and I think I will remember forever.Le Samourai is a thrilling experience, but it lacks big and explosive moments. I feel like the film is concentrating on the nuances of the characters rather than action scenes and I think that's not bad at all. I'm just waiting for snappier moments in the film that will make me jump off my chair.",

            "content": "Once upon a time, between 1945 and 1968 there was mutual esteem and admiration between the American and the French peoples and their popular cultures. This situation was broken when De Gaulle left the Government after the events of May 1968. In my opinion those events originated in San Francisco USA. The French are or were very keen on setting the trend for fashion on clothes and behavior. They tried to catch up with the hippies. Since then the Americans consider the French an unreliable ally and a pretentious competitor. I know this because I worked for an American Company that had his headquarters in Switzerland, but its training center in the outskirts of Paris. Stayed there a few months between 1966 and 1970..Pardon the lengthy introduction but \"Le Samourai\" is a 1967 film, and emulates very competently an American specialty, the crime Thriller. And it does it better than many contemporary Hollywood productions.This is certainly one of the most anti-Freudian crime thriller films. By plot and by Form. Everybody in the legal professions, namely Police and Justice knows that professional criminals commit crimes for profit. The other criminals are mere weaklings that kill for vengeance, jealousy or just plain stupidity, sometimes all together. Greed is the motive that stands in between. It is the \"leitmotif\" of such great movies as John Huston's Maltese Falcon. But there is still too much psychology in that one..I don't think psychology is a science. I believe that Freud invented it as a substitute for the Roman Catholic religion \"Confession\". Instead of confessing to a priest, for free, a person goes to tell his or her life to a \"doctor\". That's good business, and the Jews are business experts.\"Le Samoura\u00ef\" is a purely factual film. When the witnesses answer to the Police Inspector questions , they may be lying but they do so for an interest. Eventually sexual, as the beautiful colored piano player, but nevertheless an interest.It is very lean, stylized and cinematic. Dialogue is kept to an absolute minimum. Even Hitchcock never made a film with so few words.The authenticity of the locations, like streets, Metro stations in Paris is 100% real. The soundtrack carries the same realism. The bird's chirping in Delon's apartment is a supreme example.Only in 1974 Hollywood produced a thriller to match this : It was made by a Pole and called Chinatown, but is very different in style and objectives...",

He comes up with a strong alibi for the latest charges on him and the alibi holds true with other people confirming the alibi. The superintendent is however not convinced. He appoints officers to stake him out and even set up a bug at his place, which Jeff later locates and deactivates. His employers want him to be terminated so that their hands don't get dirty. Jeff escapes with a bullet shot in his hand and finds out his life was threatened. He manages to evade the police officers and auxiliaries in the metro and in the stations only to be shot from the back in the night-club when he points a gun at the night-club pianist; Jeff drops dead.I loved the background score of the movie and the movie was well-directed with some tense chases.

            "content": "Magnificent film that is worth especially for its visual style, with a wonderfull photography in cold tones, and a brilliant narrative mostly devoid of dialogue.Great first hour. But Melville is unable to sustain the miracle throughout the film, in part due to the need to divert it to more conventional terrain to cover the footage of a feature film. From there, the dialogue scenes, which begin to abound from the middle of the film, are out of tune, and we feel them as if somebody were throwing a jug of cold water in our faces.The first scene already shows us the strengths and weaknesses of the film.I remember that the first time I saw the film, I thought when I read the quote: are the Japanese classics capable of saying the same nonsense as the French directors of the nouvelle vague? It was strange, apart from comparing something as Japanese as a samurai with an animal that does not exist in the jungles of Japan. Later I found out that the quote was false, a double stupidity of Melville: inventing that bombastic phrase, and passing it off as a classic Japanese quote.This meaningless phrase advances us what can be called poetic licenses if someone wants to excuse them, but they are also plot holes and nonsense that continuously bother. Thus, we have Delon as a highly valued hit man, but in the 1960s he wears a trench coat and a hat. Okay, Melville wants his work to be timeless, but is it that a murderer instead of getting rid of his flashy clothes, would go to the police station and undergo an identification process where obviously the witnesses would refer to the hat and the trench coat ?We are therefore before a fantasy: but the fantasy works in silence, the dialogues, in their shocking realism, break the charm.The film is too long: it could be a magnificent medium-length film, but many of the scenes in the second half do not add anything, nor do they advance the plot. One of them, the pianist waiting for the phone call and wandering around her apartment, becomes important for its visual content.The ending is dark and open, but its plot twist does not disappoint.A very good movie, it's a shame not to have controlled more some extravagant aspects (it happens sometimes when is an auteur and is not going to listen to other sensible people) and above all not to have continued the narrative style of its first half.

There is a touch of both German expressionism and American noir all through out this film, and that makes it fun to watch and dissect. Turns out director Melville saw a lot of American noir films during the fifties, and sort of stylized his films toward that genre to get the messages out that most interested him.

            "review_title": "A samurai trapped in the modern day's cage",
            "content": "The movie begins with an empty room but after a few seconds, a lonely samurai lights a cigarette to show us that it's not quite empty. Then, after the opening credits, genius Melville gives us a clever quote: \"There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps...\", with only one line, Melville summarizes the whole movie. First scenes of the movie last about 10 minutes with no word spoken, this is a technique which Melville knows how to use so we can barely notice the silence, like in Le Cercle Rouge that has a heist scene which lasts 25 minutes without any dialog. Le Samoura\u00ef has many silent moments but they are very meaningful. We follow Jeff in his daily life with his special principles, we can guess that all of his days are the same and he obeys the same rules everyday. He seems to be loving a woman but he doesn't know how to show her his feelings. This character is played by Alain Delon who only uses one facial expression during the movie which is enough according to the nature of his character. Jeff's only friend is a small bird who has been trapped in a cage, too.They seem to have a supernatural connection with each other, they can't speak each other's languages but they have this ability to understand each other, they can empathize with each other. The bird knew how to warn him after two policemen had sneaked into his house.No wonder Martin Scorsese has pointed to Jean-Pierre Melville as a key influence, I imagine Le Samoura\u00ef could be a suitable movie to watch before making Taxi Driver.The movie has one of those endings that I can never forget. Jeff has 'been paid' to murder someone he cares for, a perfectionist hit-man goes to kill someone with an unloaded gun, he gives away his precious hat because he knows what's going to happen, he puts on his gloves in front of a bartender in order to gain his attention and make sure everything goes according to plan, he approaches to the target and takes out his gun in front of a crowd which is a strange thing for a hit-man to do, then, the thing which he was expecting happens. He chose his own destiny.We have two possibilities for Jeff's motions, either he was tired of his life and wanted to die in a way which he considered honorable, or he had gotten used to his way of living so much that he couldn't miss one single job, after all, you've got to stick to your principles.",

            "content": "I love the film stock and colors of this film. Similar to Blow-Up it's full of greys and browns, not green and blue like your average Hollywood commercial. A story well told in Visual language, the dialog is minimal so the subtitles from the french don't wear on the eyes and distract from what's going on. Probably inspiration for Jim Jarmusche's Ghost Dog, (though wholly different) this movie in many ways parallels the Samurai ethic, but in the modern (at the time) French & American style. I find it interesting, the difference between modern and older night shots. This movie was shot back when it was okay to have dark night shots. These days it's all about serious huge lighting rigs, burning carbon rods and simulating everything the exact way they want it. Not that that's bad, but it's a large contrast to working with highlights as the main focus in night shots. I always enjoy seeing movies that look more like what's doable with the light you can get with a few big lights or just natural light.Also, the minimal aesthetic and calm slowness of the film really felt like looking at a photograph,not an advertisement. I'd say this is a must see for anyone who's eyes could use a break from the glam of Hollywood.",

            "review_title": "The Psyche Of A Sociopath",
            "content": "Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 masterpiece Le Samoura\u00ef is a groundbreaking and brilliant film about the psychology and motto of a french assassin named Jef Costello and his struggle living in France, not understanding how to adapt to modern civilization. Melville's film is a prime example of the brilliance of the cinema produced within the French new wave and how to portray the psyche of a sociopath.Instead of exploring a more modern traditional assassin commonly explored in more modern cinema, Melville decides to examine a man born out of his time and into a world he doesn't fully understand. The film's protagonist Jef Costello played brilliantly by Alain Delon lives by the ancient forgotten code of the samurai. Costello is a stone-cold killer, he shows no remorse for his victims, no regret for his crimes and shows not an ounce of emotion throughout the film's runtime. Usually, a character like this would make for a fairly uninteresting protagonist, more classically trained filmmakers usually give characters an emotional arc, Melville still decides to do this but twists it. Through a layered performance, Delon portrays a man unable to connect with modern culture and incapable of connecting to the people around him, so much so Costello's only friend is a caged bird forced to be with him throughout the film's runtime.The first introduction we have of Costello is him laying on his bed smoking a cigarette observing his birds actions and listening to the sounds of France. The scene is shot in complete darkness, with Costello's body barley visible to the blind eye, the only thing somewhat visible is the smoke coming from his cigarette. This is a fascinating and unique way to introduce a character. The scene is remarkably empty of colour and visually uninspired and bland, more modern filmmakers usually give their protagonists grand, bright and flamboyant introductions, but Melville decides to introduce his character in the dark. What better way of introducing a man out of his time and without emotion than by showing him alone, confined in his home, in complete darkness, in his home, a room he uses to confine himself inside, imprisoning his thoughts and desires with him in complete darkness, in the one place he feels comfortable enough to smoke in peace.The way Melville decides to helm the film is what is most commendable about the picture. His direction and clear vision are conveyed throughout the runtime of the film. What Melville does understand is how to connect an audience member to a protagonist who in most cases they could never understand. Melville takes time to let the viewer watch Costello's private time alone in his home, his interactions with the general public and people, the way he completes daily tasks and the way he decides to murder people. It's a fascinating and unique portrayal of a man that general audiences wouldn't truly understand. Melville understands that while Costello's actions are wrong he isn't entirely evil.Costello's remaining humanity is explored with his relationship with Jane Lagrange played by Nathalie Delon, the former wife of the film's lead star. Melville uses Janes complex relationship with Jef as a way of exploring Costello's fleeting care for humanity. Jane is a prostitute, the lowest low in France. A woman the general public would view as scum, a woman who would be tossed over, used and forgotten. Like Jef, Jane has trouble connecting to the inhabitants of France and while Jef and Jane's relationship is mostly sexual, they share a bond in the fact that they both have a lack of understanding of how the world works.While made 53 years ago, Le Samoura\u00ef is a potent, powerful and meaningful piece of cinema created due to the vision of director Jean-Pierre Melville. Le Samoura\u00ef is a film that will stand the test of time and remain relevant forever.",
