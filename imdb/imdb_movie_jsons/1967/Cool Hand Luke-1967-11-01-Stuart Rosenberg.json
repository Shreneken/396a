            "content": "This film got me from the first frame to the last. It's not even because of the story (which I love, of course) - it's just so very well made. And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one. And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the \"New Hollywood\" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'. I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. Funny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film. What we've got here is NOT failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: \"What we have here is failure to communicate.\" No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.Based on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.There are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.George Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Watching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.The supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron's dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke's background.Often overlooked by film historians, \"Lucille\" putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.The score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.",

            "review_title": "Newman's Brilliance",
            "content": "Cool Hand Luke (1967) **** (out of 4) Paul Newman plays the title character, a man who just can't reform to the rules in life and can't reform to the rules when sent to a chain gang. This is certainly without question one of my favorite movies and it certainly had a large impact on my life when I watched it as a teenager. I hold this film very close to my heart and especially the character of Luke but even without the personal feelings this remains one of the better movies out there. Some have called it a prison movie but I think that's really an insult because the film is so much more than that including one of the best character studies out there. The film has so many laughs, so many painful moments and so many dramatic moments but I think the true heart of the film is in its honesty towards Newman's character. There are countless great scenes including the legendary egg eating contest but one of my favorites has always been the ending with Newman talking to God inside the church. Needless to say, Newman is brilliant in the role and while it's hard to say which one performance of his is his greatest this one here is awfully close. You can really see Newman sticking his heart and soul into the role and you really can't imagine anyone else playing the character. George Kennedy also deserved his Oscar and Strother Martin makes for one great villain.",

            "review_title": "Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it",
            "content": "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is \"Small Town, not much to do in the evening\", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds \"just settlin some old scores\".  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, \"calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.\"  In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, \"A man's got to go his own way\" or as he also puts it, \"I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room\". As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains, some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates, \"for your own good, you'll learn the rules\" A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story, and Luke as the focal point.\nBecause of his individuality, it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses, or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy).  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.  Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.   As Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career.  It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character.  As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.Cool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word.  It is a film that will long be remembered.My grade: A+",

            "review_title": "Prison classic with a career-best Newman",
            "content": "On the face of it, Cool Hand Luke tells a simplistic story about a guy who breaks the law and is sent to a rural prison, where he must earn status among the prisoners. This in turn sets him against the guards and governor, who want nothing better than to knock him down, and the plot goes from there.Where this film excels is in its depth. It can be read in a number of different ways, from example as a religious allegory and also in terms of status and power in the modern age. In essence there's a microcosm of society inside the prison with each character fulfilling a different role or tier. Paul Newman plays the classic rebellious character, a man unwilling to conform, ever, and he does it in such a brilliant way that I'm surprised he didn't win his Oscar.Newman's the perfect fit for the part: upbeat, funny, and incredibly sympathetic. I haven't seen all of his films, but I find it hard to imagine he could better his role here. Equalling him is George Kennedy, also at his best, and fully deserving his best supporting actor Oscar. His character is perfectly written and, indeed, this film is perfectly made, with great attention to visual detail throughout. It's also notable for featuring a number of classic sequences, from the egg eating to the 'Plastic Jesus' song and of course the escape attempts. A fantastic film indeed.",

            "review_title": "Sticking it to the Man",
            "content": "\"For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.\" - Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Stuart Rosenberg directs \"Cool Hand Luke\". The plot? Paul Newman plays Luke Jackson, a young drifter who returns home after WW2. Luke's been dealt one bad hand after the next, and, no matter how he plays his cards, always seems to lose. The film opens with Luke, drunk and shameless, knocking the heads off parking meters. The authorities try to cash in on our everyday movements, and this lack of freedom ticks Luke off. The poor guy just wants to be free, man.After being arrested, Luke is sent to a Florida prison. What then unfolds is one of the greatest existential movies of all time. Luke's experiences, his conversations with God, his isolation and alienation, and a pair of profound scenes, both involving his mother, elevate \"Cool Hand Luke\" above most prison-break movies.Of course this period saw a number of strong prison flicks (\"The Great Escape\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"King Rat\", \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", \"Papillon\", \"Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Hole\", \"Escape from Alcatraz\", \"A Man Escaped\", \"Riot in Cell Block 11\" etc), but \"Cool Hand Luke\" takes a far more mythical stance. We don't know much about Luke. He's held at a distance, never looks anyone in the eyes when speaking and always has a sly grin on his face. And yet behind his smile we sense deep pain, though its a pain matched by a dogged spirit to continue fighting. Interestingly, whilst a film like \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" had a system that despite its flaws genuinely tried to heal and help others, Luke's social institution is corrupt and in many aspects pointless. Still, for a while Luke abides by it. He goes about the state's business with a smile, cutting grass and paving roads. He only has 2 years in chains. He can make it. And like he says, he has no place else to go. No plans. He plays his cards with cool, detached ambivalence.In one beautiful scene, Luke's dying mother comes to visit. What follows is a touching conversation, she informing us that tried her best with Luke, giving him nothing but love. And yet, no amount of motherly affection has helped her family. Because of this, she says, she \"wishes mankind were like dogs\". She wishes she could abandon her children and forget about them, never having to worry or fret about how they are, what they'll do or where they'll go. Of course she loves Luke, but hates the agony he puts her through. And yet we sense that she understands him intimately. Perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt a life of bad hands.Luke's outlook changes when his mother dies and the prison warden locks him in a box for no particular reason. When the Boss says \"Just doing my job\", Luke replies \"That don't make it right.\" From here on Luke begins to fight back. He refuses to spend his life on his knees and refuses to submit. The film then becomes a tale of resistance and idolatry. The other inmates quickly begin to idolise Luke, worshipping his never-give-up spirit. But rather than fight themselves, they sit back and exalt Luke, relying him to personify their own desires. Luke begins to resent this. \"Step feeding off me!\" he yells. But they're content to sit on the sidelines. He's a one man revolution, and like many revolutionaries is praised for his stance from afar but never actively supported. Why do men have to die for causes before we take notice?The film ends on an ambiguous note, in which Luke may or may not be riddled with bullets. Does Luke smile? Does he die? Does he survive? If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, \"Cool Hand Luke\" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission. 9/10- An accidental masterpiece. The planets really lined up for this one. The only flaw is an overly silly (though iconic) car wash scene.Worth multiple viewings.",

Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination...

But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures\u0085 As the warden says, \"What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach.\" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes\u0085 Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape\u0085 But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: \"l never planned anything in my life.\" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse\u0085The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, \"You're gonna have to kill me.\"). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world\u0085 But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had \"that Luke smile\" to the very end\u0085 We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling\u0097the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal\u0085 Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism\u0085 As in \"Hombre,\" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, \"cool\" manner\u0085 He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation\u0085 There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him\u0085 Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way\u0085 But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance\u0085 Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him\u0085 The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure\u0085 Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal\u0085 There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in\u0097after which he realizes, \"l gotta find my own way,\" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair\u0097but Newman performs them with quiet conviction\u0085.

I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in \"The Hustler\" and Frank Galvin in \"The Verdict\"; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right.

This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'.  We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours.  It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

It was offered as such even on VHS.When I looked at this film sometime in the '90s, I was surprised that the famous line from it: \"What we have here is a failure to communicate,\" was only used twice, and the second time being the last sentence uttered by Newman. I had thought that Strother Martin had said it several times. Boy, Martin was one of the more effective villains in some 1960s film, a mean-talking sadistic guy.This movie was another of the pioneers in promoting a new thing on screen: the \"anti-hero,\" so it was popular in the protest decade of the '60s. Newman's character fit right into the period where the rebel is the hero and the authority figure is the bad guy. You've seen this repeatedly ever since, although filmmakers have always loved rebels.George Kennedy gives Newman memorable support as \"Dragline\" and was aptly awarded for his performance.

While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to \"get their mind right,\" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",

            "content": "Interesting flick about the deprivations and subhuman conditions of a chain gang and a rebel prisoner to whom wardens will attempt to break his free spirit . Based on a real story by Donn Pearce who wrote the novel on which the movie is based , he spent 2 years on a chain gang for safe-breaking ; Pearce makes a cameo appearance in the movie as a convict named Sailor . It deals with Luke (Paul Newman ) who is sent to a prison camp , where he gets a reputation as a hard man . He becomes a prisoner on a Southern chain gang , there the head of the gang hates him , and attempts to break him by beating him up . It doesn't work, and he gains respect and not even the deprivations of these wrong conditions will break his spirit . Irrepressible Luke even manages to win the admiration of his rival (George Kennedy) in the chain gang . Luke is visited by his ill mother (Jo Van Fleet was only 11 years older than Paul Newman , Bette Davis was first offered the role of Luke's mother, but refused the bit part) ; after that , Luke refuses to conform to life in a rural prison and he getaways , but is caught, but escapes again .Modern slant on chain gang sub-genre with one of Paul Newman's greatest interpretations from his prestigious and long career , here as an obstinate , stubborn prisoner . George Kennedy's acting was equally excellent and deservedly won him a supporting Academy Award . Rosenberg's magnificent direction that underlines the strength of personalities involved , undercutting the less pleasant aspects and putting the focus squarely on Newman's tough performance and including the memorably unforgettable egg-eating contest . Top-notch secondary cast who gives splendid performances as Strother Martin , Lou Antonio , Wayne Rogers , J. D. Cannon , Dennis Hooper , Harry Dean Stanton , Morgan Woodward , Joe Don Baker , and Ralph Waite , Anthony Zerbe's film debuts , among others . Good sets and fine scenarios , as a Southern prison camp was built just north of Stockton, California , a dozen buildings were constructed, including a barracks, mess hall, warden's quarters, guard shack, and dog kennels . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Conrad L. Hall . Atmospheric musical score by Lalo Schifrin in his usual style .Stuart Rosenberg was one of the best TV directors of the 50s and 60s and subsequently realized segment of crime and mystery series . In 1967 directed his first film , \u00a8Mystery Inc\u00a8 , and subsequently the successful \u00a8Cool Hand Luke\u00a8 with Paul Newman . Rosenberg and Newman attempted in vain to repeat the formula in three further movies together as \u00a8WUSA movie\u00a8, \u00a8Pocket money\u00a8 and \u00a8The drowning pool\u00a8 . However he achieved other two hit smashes , in the terror genre with \u00a8The Amityville horror\u00a8 and again with a prison film titled \u00a8Brubaker\u00a8. Since then Rosenberg's output has been unsatisfactory and sporadic as \u00a8The Pope of Greenwich village \u00a8 a Mickey Rourke vehicle . Rosenberg directed 5 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Peter Falk, Paul Newman, Lee Grant, Geraldine Page and of course George Kennedy with his top-drawer performance as Dragline . Rating : Above average , wholesome watching . Essential and indispensable seeing for the Paul Newman's fans .",

            "content": "'Cool Hand Luke (1967)' was and remains one of Paul Newman's most iconic performances, with the image of Luke Jackson \u0096 with his piercing blue eyes, blissfully carefree smile, dogged determination \u0096 forever entrenched in the minds of all who see the film. Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of \"disciples\" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of \"Cool Hand Luke\" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas.Influencing, in some way or another, just about every prison movie that followed, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),' the film's legacy has continued to stretch into the present, and the Captain's (Strother Martin) memorable line \"What we've got here is failure to communicate\" continues to be quoted often. Of course, it is Cool Hand Luke whom we shall always remember so vividly, his nickname representative of his independence, individualism and unwillingness to conform. Newman's superb performance was nominated for an Academy Award at the 1968 Oscars, but he was beaten by an equally-memorable Rod Steiger for 'In the Heat of the Night (1967).' Unthinkably, the film itself was denied a Best Picture nomination, presumably to make way for the epic musical 'Dr. Dolittle (1967),' a childhood favourite of mine that nonetheless should never have been nominated. The picture's single award went to George Kennedy, who is marvellous as Dragline, a tough, imposing but supportive inmate who strikes up a very close friendship with the prison's resident \"messiah.\"",

Picture James Dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.Newman plays his usual non-conformist rebel type, but he's really a rebel without a cause. He's in his early forties, a Korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. He gets himself busted for no great cause, just on a drunken spree in some Southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.That lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. He fights with, but later wins the respect and becomes friends with George Kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.The real tragedy of Cool Hand Luke is that Newman is a failure in life, it's why he's in prison. He gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways, but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. Can you picture James Dean as a forty something doing what Newman is doing? It would have been his kind of role for sure.Newman does a fine job playing the non-conformist Luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. George Kennedy got his Oscar winning career role as Dragline. Other men in Luke's barracks are Wayne Rogers, Robert Drivas, and J.D. Cannon and they fill their roles well.Strother Martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line, \"what we've got is failure to communicate.\" Martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.Cool Hand Luke may very well be the saddest role Newman ever undertook in his long career.",

When inside, he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody, be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon, though, he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.This anti-authoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals anti-heroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that, like Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarcerated-man-against-the-system movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). For me, it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work. It benefits from a good ensemble cast, with Paul Newman leading the picture very well, with impressive support in particular from George Kennedy who would go on to win an Oscar for his efforts.",

Additionally, the stars of the film (George Kennedy and especially Paul Newman) are great--and at the top of their game. Additionally, the writing and especially the dialog are great. But, the writing, while very, very good also left me a bit cold at the end with its vague ending. Additionally, the film is very episodic and seemed a bit disjoint.

            "content": "The many other reviews posted by the time of my writing discuss the plot and other aspects of \"Cool Hand Luke.\" So, I'll just comment on the source of the movie and what I think the aim was in making it. The film is based on a 1965 novel of the same title, by Donn Pearce. The premise for which Luke is jailed and then continues to try to buck the system, escape and then return is ludicrous. Unless one can see that Luke puts life and energy into the prison and his fellow inmates. He is a spark of hope that helps these men survive otherwise monotonous and endless days of drudgery. I don't know if it is that way in the book, but that seems to be the intended drive for the plot in the film. It shows how much difference one person can make \u2013 not just in prison, but in the life of other people wherever they are. Donn Pearce himself spent time in jail and prison. He ran away from home, a suburb of Philadelphia, when he was 15. He lied about his age to get into the Army in 1944, then went AWOL and then turned himself in. He spent 30 days in the stockade. Then, before he got shipped out, the Army learned of his true age (his mother had written a letter) and threw him out. But he was then old enough to join the Merchant Marine, which he did. He served on ships that took him to various European ports and to India. He was caught in France for counterfeiting American money and was imprisoned. He escaped and crossed the Italian border. From there he got forged papers so that he could sign on a ship going to Canada. From Canada, he crossed the U.S. border and revved up his criminal activity. He went into burglary and safe cracking. All of this was by the age of 20. In 1949, he was caught and sentenced to two years on chain gangs in Florida. Pearce began writing stories based on his experiences and the characters he met. His 1965 novel was the first of four. Between books he worked as a freelance journalist. He wrote the screenplay for this movie, and he has a cameo shot in the film as a prisoner named Sailor. In a 2008 bonus video that comes with the DVD of the movie, Pearce says that his character of Luke is partly autobiographical. He says one-third of the character is based on him \u2013 the eating parts and working hard. Another third was based on a real guy named Cool Hand Luke. And the remaining third was just general stuff to tie the two characters together. Director Stuart Rosenberg and Warner Brothers assembled a fantastic cast for the film. Paul Newman is excellent as Luke. George Kennedy is stellar as Dragline, a role that garnered him the Oscar for best supporting actor for 1967. Strother Martin is superb as the Captain of the prison road gang. Many notable stage actors fill the roles of fellow inmates and guards. Lou Antonio is Koko, J.D. Cannon is Society Red, Wayne Rogers is Gambler, Clifton James is floorwalker Carr, Luke Askew is Boss Paul, Robert Donner is Boss Shorty, Charles Tyner is Boss Higgins. This is a highly regarded film that most people should enjoy. Newman and a number of the crew said that this was one of their favorite films to have been in and worked on.",

I, like I assume many people of my generation are, am only familiar with Kennedy through his role as the police Captain Ed from the Naked Gun series, in which he was hilarious, and his stint selling breath mints on infomercials. I never expected that he ever won an Oscar! And it was entirely deserved. He created a very complex character in this film. Bravo!I loved Paul Newman, too, of course. I just looked at who else was nominated that year, and I have not seen either the winner of that year's best actor Oscar (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night) or one other nominee (Spencer Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), but of those I have seen (Warren Beatty, Bonnie and Clyde and Dustin Hoffman, The Graduate) I would personally have picked Warren Beatty, seeing as Bonnie and Clyde is one of my very favorite films, and I love Beatty in it.

            "review_title": "The Sin of the Angry Believer",
            "content": "This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system, part of a tradition going back to \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" and continuing more recently with \"Brubaker\" (also directed by Stuart Rosenberg) and the less successful \"The Last Castle\". The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. (It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour, or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers). There is a long list of petty regulations, breach of which is punished by \"a night in the box\", a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor (who prefers to be called \"the Captain\") is a particularly frightening figure, a little man with a grating, high-pitched voice who can even make a piece of bland management-speak like \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\" sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more, however, than a social-realist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties, the decade when the times they were a-changing and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies, \"Cool Hand Luke\" reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool, detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's \"Torn Curtain\"- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. (\"Hombre\" is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of \"Whistle Down the Wind\" or \"The Omega Man\". In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for \"Best Actor\" and George Kennedy won a well-deserved \"Best Supporting Actor\" for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as \"Best Picture\", especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as \"Dr Doolittle\". Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With \"I am a Fugitive\u0085.\" and \"The Birdman of Alcatraz\", it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles (\"Citizen Kane\"), Sidney Lumet (\"Twelve Angry Men\") and Bryan Forbes (\"Whistle Down the Wind\") he made a great film on his first attempt. 9/10",

He was outstanding as Hud, but he seems to have topped that performance in this 1967 classic.Newman plays a man named Luke. After cutting the heads off some parking meters, he is thrown into a prison system where he's forced to do some hard time tending to country roads. This character has to be one of the biggest enigmas in film history. Luke is likable enough. His mother points out to him that he's even had some good jobs. The viewer is left to ponder why in the heck he can't stay out of trouble.Not much is told about his past. We know he fought WWII, and even won some medals. He has no wife or children to care for. He has a mother who appears to be dying of lung cancer or some such ailment. His other family members seem to hold a grudge against him. We never really learn why he feels the need to cut the heads off the parking meters, but he's caught red-handed. The prison he's sent to makes its inmates work their tails off, but it looks like they'll treat you fairly if you follow their rules. Luke has no intentions of following any rules laid down by the warden or the \"bosses\" that watch over the road work, though.After taking a tremendous beating from the toughest inmate (Kennedy), Luke quickly begins to win the admiration of his fellow prisoners. His spirit catches on with the others, and they begin to get their work done more quickly and effectively than ever before. Things begin to go downhill for Luke once he learns of his mother's passing. He repeatedly tries to escape, and soon the warden and his cronies are out to break his spirit and make him conform. The film becomes a test of wills, and a fascinating character study.The biggest question the viewer is left with is \"why?\". Luke could have simply served out his time and then gone on to a more normal existence. That seems to be out of the realm of possibilities for the character, however. He isn't simply out to impress the other prisoners. At one point he even demands they stop trying to feed off of him for all their strength. Luke seems like a man who simply cannot allow others to tell him how to live. There are a few moments where he openly questions the existence of God, but that angle doesn't go very far. It merely makes the guards want to abuse him even more, but that's about it. It becomes almost frustrating to see this man keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for himself. At one point Luke is forced to literally do just that.What exactly is the film trying to tell us? It doesn't seem to be advocating disobedience. We cheer for Luke when he's causing trouble for the guards, but we feel his pain when they punish him. The film's conclusion is more somber than inspiring.Rosenberg's direction is outstanding, and the supporting cast shines. George Kennedy earned an Oscar for his performance. Overall this is an excellent film not to be missed! 10 of 10 stars from The Hound.",

We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. \"Luke\" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. \"Dragline\". The most unforgettable \"gentle giant\" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in \"Cool Hand Luke\" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, \"Cool Hand Luke\" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.",

            "content": "I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be \"helping\" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.It's also by turns an often funny movie, with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly, unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events, less a story, than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence, Newman is basically laid out on the table- and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional- in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film, as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins, and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy, even if its meant to be subtle, which I don't think it is, and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.Because really, aside from the allegory, this is just good old prison picture, and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisoner-escape angle, such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured, but leaves it at first on the prisoners- who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character, and getting them to fix a road like its some competition- and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, \"what we've got here is failure to communicate\" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent, with Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Luke Askew, and even a guitar strumming/singing Harry Dean Stanton! (Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me).And then finally there's Newman himself, definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a full-on total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison, even as he gets as far as Chicago. \"I never planned anything in my life\", he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character, ultimately, likable and strong, and fulfills such an anti-hero very believably, especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies- and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s (in a good way for the old-school fans)- it's worth it just to see what Newman does, alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later, which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg, probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career.",

It was a bad time, a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated, as a strong soul, casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way, to the emerging counterculture (what we thought was such, anyway).Twenty years ago, I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent, good man, often a war hero, sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblical-quality goodness, he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate, and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.It struck me how similar this was to that template, and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism. And the genre had to be hidden by setting it in the south, then as now evoking a backward people.But I just saw it again. Since the last time I have heard Paul Newman speak of it. He is annoyed because he can see himself obviously acting. His character works when the character is acting a role \u0097 and we see him do it. Its an unintentional fold, the sort of acting that Paul could pull off in later years, starting with \"The Verdict.\" But because the job is bigger than his chops at the time, you can see how poorly he does when his character isn't creating a self: when he comes back to the barracks beaten. When he speaks to God. Even when he says that famous last line. He is inadequate, and the idea that a lessor self could be so attractive kept him drunk for decades.Its really not a very good movie: a collection of templates put together at the right time and striking a nerve.A pretty remarkable phenomenon. Now, I wonder, where is the modern equivalent of this film, one that seems to be about charm, but which depends on dishonest politicians who destroy us? Will it be a jail movie, or does that reference not carry the same weight today?As I write this, Paul is ill.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

            "content": "Released in 1967 and directed by Stuart Rosenberg based on Donn Pearce' novel, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a prison drama starring Paul Newman in the eponymous role as a loner who disdains rules in the early 50s. He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward). Carr (Clifton James) the floorwalker, tells the rules to the new prisoners with violations resulting in spending the night in \"the box,\" a small square room with limited air and little room to move. George Kennedy and Dennis Hopper are on hand as fellow prisoners, amongst many others.I was wondering about the totally stoo-pid reason Luke gets 2 years in prison at the beginning of the film. He likely got a ticket for a \"violated\" parking meter while in town. So he has a few beers, gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter, and thought, \"I'm gonna show these jerks.\"\"Cool Hand Luke\" has a big reputation but, for me, it doesn't quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon, as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. It's a character study of a likable, impressive, but unruly person who doesn't seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee, maybe you shouldn't try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing. The movie is realistic and well-made, but generally tedious, although I'm sure that's the point \u2013 being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting, however; and I can understand how some grade it higher. The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares & Jacksonville, Florida; and San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, California, with studio work done in Burbank. GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)",

The rebel spirit of the lead character (played to perfection by the excellent Paul Newman) against that brutal and -most of the times- unfair \"establishment\" represented by the prison guards is a subject that remains as topical as ever. If this picture had been made today, it could also probably be good, but it would undoubtedly be much more unpleasant and filled with four-letter words. Besides, who could match the performances of Newman, George Kennedy (the deservedly Oscar-winner who has kept on making a brilliant career -do you remember him as \"The Blue Knight\"?), Strother Martin, J.D.Cannon, etc.? Jo Van Fleet\u00b4s character as Luke\u00b4s mother seems a sort of slightly-aged version of her role as James Dean\u00b4s mum in \"East Of Eden\", and it is really worthwhile. The scene of the hard-boiled eggs is a classic and a gem, but my favourite scene in the movie is that of the car-washing girl so wonderfully played by Joy Harmon (who is really a Joy for any man\u00b4s eyes); that character truly says a lot of things without speaking -her gorgeous body speaks for her! I must say that it\u00b4s not only one of the sexiest scenes I\u00b4ve ever seen in a film but also a very significative one: there is an enormous contrast between the image of the lass moving and shaking in complete and absolute freedom (even in her way of dressing) and the imprisoned men-at-work who watch her as something extremely desirable but, alas, completely out of reach.

            "content": "Highly rated film that I don't rate that highly, if truth be told. There's plenty to savour, particularly in the acting stakes but I was ultimately confused and disappointed by the resolution to the various themes at play here.The enigmatic opening, with Newman's Luke character casually vandalising the state's parking meters amusingly recalled to me the famous tag-line from Bob Dylan's near contemporaneous song \"Subterraneaen Homesick Blues\" - \"Don't follow leaders and watch the parking meters\", (both parts of the line are relevant - at one point he screams \"Stop feeding off me\" to his \"follower\" inmates) as Luke gets incarcerated in a brutally-run Southern prison work-house and becomes the unlikely and from his point of view, at times unwelcome talismanic figure representing to his fellow inmates a focal point of resistance to authority and in a wider sense, general conformity.And yet this self-effacing persona which Luke adopts more than once however doesn't square, with me, to the self-publicising acts he does elsewhere, most famously the fight scene with the prison's \"Big Daddy\" inmate, Dragline, played by Arthur Kennedy and of course the egg-scoffing scene, where he deliberately draws attention to himself. I also didn't get Kennedy's character's change (adapting Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\") from George to Lennie, when after punching Luke to a pulp and establishing one would think once and for all superiority over him, we see him by the end almost acting as his lackey. Add to that an admittedly revisionist minor revulsion at the blatantly sexist soft-porn episode of the tongues-out chain gang ogling a scantily-clad nymphet foaming up a car and you can tell I had some issues with the movie, although a minor counter-case against the latter could be made for the insertion of the very mild homo-erotic and played for laughs sub \"Jailhouse Rock\" scene of the prisoners dancing with each other, dressed only in their shorts, on the 4th of July.The ambiguities in the narrative however threw me off-kilter and while I can see that I was expected to cut Newman's character a lot of slack as a societal misfit whose \"different-ness\" is accentuated further after his beloved mother dies, ultimately, again to paraphrase Dylan, nothing has been proved. As to style, director Rosenberg certainly captures the heat and sweat of the workhouse but even then a lot of his imagery seems second-hand, lifting from the likes of Leone and Sturges. Lalo Schifrin delivers a satisfactory if occasionally blaring soundtrack.The acting is great though, yet I'm sure I can see Steve McQueen playing the Newman role better. Arthur Kennedy is robust enough until he's reduced to a simpering wimp by the conclusion. Strother Martin, with that enervating southern drawl gets most of the best lines (especially the well-known \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\") and his underlings similarly exude cruelty and inhumanity, especially when breaking Luke over the pointless digging of a ditch. Amongst the inmates, by the way, it's interesting to note emerging actors of the television screen like Wayne Rogers (\"M.A.S.H.\"), Ralph Waite (\"The Waltons\", \"Mississipi\") and Anthony Zerbe (everything else...) plus the young (Harry) Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper.Grandstanding scenes notwithstanding, by the conclusion, the film hadn't held me as it should have done and further weakened its case as an expose of the working methods of jail-masters of the recent past with a sentimental collage of Newman's smiling image set before us with all the integrity of an episode of the afore-mentioned \"The Waltons\".",

Once at the farm Luke refuses to be ground down by the system and its grinning warden (a brilliant Strother Martin).

Things are sure to come to a head as Luke rebels to the point of no return...Division of Corrections. Road Prison 36.The close examination of Cool Hand Luke over the years has rightly thrown up the fact that it's a Christ allegory. Which is just fine given that Stuart Rosenberg's film is one of the finest films that the 60s had to offer. It also boasts, arguably of course, the Paul Newman signature role (yes even better than The Hustler). As the title suggests, Cool Hand Luke, both the film and character, there is a great deal of cool here, in fact for a great deal of the first half of movie it's laced with comic touches as we warm easily to the \"rebel against the system\" machismo and charm that Newman provides as Lukas Jackson. Yet the film then shifts considerably at the mid-point to give us something far more potent and dramatic to alter any preconceptions the audience had of this just being a movie about a macho loner earning our sympathy.Calling it your job don't make it right Boss.Much in the film has been firmly ensconced in the memorable moments department, 50 eggs, tar that road quickly, the \"Kick a Buck\" poker game, \"still shaking boss\", a mountain of rice to be eaten, sneezing bloodhounds, the boxing match and one of the greatest and most iconic of tag-lines ever, \"what we got here is a failure to communicate\", all forming part of a truly great whole. However, revisiting the picture often brings the realisation that so much more is on offer than at first thought. Luke is a real war hero (this has been missed by both pro and amateur critics) whose crime is pretty tame for the sentence he finds himself faced with. The Dragline (George Kennedy kicking up a storm of acting quality) and Luke friendship that builds with grace and thunder, sexual frustration of the incarcerated male and a mother and son arc that attacks the soul and lets Newman show many of his acting peers just how grief should be acted out on screen...\"Well, I don't care if it rains or freezes, Long as I have my plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Through all trials and tribulations, We will travel every nation, With my plastic Jesus I'll go far\"With Newman, Kennedy and Martin holding court with every scene they are in, it would be easy at first glance to ignore the supporting roles, but Rosenberg ensures that supporting players make telling marks. It's a roll call of sweaty and twitchy character actors that features the likes of Anthony Zerbe, Joe Don Baker, Clifton James, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers and J.D. Cannon. Filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, Rosenberg and cinematographer Conrad Hall do an amazing job of making Stockton, California feel like the actual Deep South. Film unfolds to the backdrop of a sun drenched land inhabited by life's unfortunates and the supposed upstanding face of American officialdom...Iconography and martyrdom unbound, Cool Hand Luke is a slow-burn classic of deep thematic worth. 10/10",

It does have comic moments to talk about--egg eating among them--and it has an especially low point for the treatment of women, even though it is justified internally by the characters. Most of the time it's a well paced, well acted chain gang movie, with one getaway (that's no spoiler--all prison movies have getaways) that is an homage or ripoff of the 1932 LeRoy chain gang movie to beat all chain gang movies.Because the movie is clearly set in the past, it doesn't indict the prison system directly, but does critique the problem of authority, and of what exactly is a punishment suitable for petty crime. I don't know if the title character (played by Newman) is an anti-hero exactly (he lacks any true badness) but there is no doubt by halfway through who the true good guy is. And by the end, the Christian symbolism is overwhelming. If Cool Hand Luke the man isn't quite what you think of as messianic, he still does at least show what it means to be good in very ungood circumstances. It's a complicated thing to be a hero, and to survive those who are threatened by those better than them, and in the end, that's what the movie is about.

But give him the right part, engage his interest, catch him in the right mood, and he delivers a performance as good as anyone could provide. As good as Brando, Olivier, as good as anybody. In my estimation he has given at least four performances that reach asymptote: \"The Hustler,\" \"Hud,\" \"Cool Hand Luke,\" and \"The Verdict.\" Others may have been almost as good, \"Hombre\", maybe, or \"Harper\", but they restricted his acting to a stereotype or else the story wasn't worth much effort. Early in his career, he was socked solidly into a super-macho sort of position, his nasal, abrasive, Southern-tinted remarks dripping with synthetic testosterone. But beginning with \"The Hustler,\" he found his true m\u00e9tier. \"Luke\" was one of his finest. The plot is utterly believable. The locale -- near Bakersfield -- evocative. You can feel the shimmering heat. The entire cast is superb, and what a cast! Strother Martin is always good but here he outdoes himself. Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Anthony Zerbe, a veritable pantheon of fine character actors. There have been many movies about charismatic outlaw heroes. The kind of guy who says, as Robert E. Lee Pruitt did in \"From Here to Eternity,\" \"If a man don't go his own way, he's nothing'.\" Or the kind of guy who, wittingly or not, is enacting a nascent social movement, like Ghandi. The best of these stories don't build themselves a moral explanation around the essentially unknowable. Who knows why Ghandi or Cool Hand Luke did what they did? Who knows why any of us does what we do? We can justify our acts, but only through post-hoc reasoning. In sociology this is called \"accounting.\" I account for my acts by buffing logic in such a way that I come out on top . Sometimes underlying themes are necessary to hold an otherwise uneventful story together, as in Joyce's Ulysses. No such subtext belongs in \"Cool Hand Luke,\" because the events we witness can stand on their own two legs, but the subtext is there nonetheless. Not only is it there, but it's blatantly there. Luke addresses God as \"old man,\" from time to time, and has an extended conversation with him towards the end in an abandoned church. After eating his fifty eggs he is left sprawled on a table in an attitude of crucifixion. The very crossroads shown in a helicopter shot just before the closing credits is cruciform. The Christian symbolism is irrelevant and distracting in an otherwise memorable movie. Luke's conflict is not with God. For that to be true, there would have to BE a God. His conflict is more profane. He's at war with rules and regulations, which of course means society. Strother Martin's captain is right when he says about Luke's punishment, \"This is what he wants.\" And, by the way, this movie shows the corrections officers as at least semi-human, some of them, but also absolutely irresistible. You cannot win with these guys. They can't be outwitted. And they are unsubtle. They will beat the crap out of you until you yield, and we all eventually yield. Don Pierce's story was autobiographical. What a guy he must have been. In one of his articles he is sent to North Africa to interview Timothy Leary, then in exile. Refused an interview he climbs on top of the roof of Leary's hotel, half drunk, and leans over the edge trying to peek through a window, during which exertion and in this awkward posture, he releases a blast of intestinal gas. Would you reveal something like that about yourself? George Kennedy won the Oscar for supporting actor and deserved it. The only other time he displayed any energy in a part was in \"The Dirty Dozen,\" which didn't place nearly such demands on him as this role. You're not likely to forget this informative, wildly comical, and ultimately tragic movie once you've seen it.",

Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likable and \"cool.\" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that \"Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,\" and from then on is called \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it.

Often cited as one of Newman's finest performances, 'Cool Hand Luke' certainly provides him with one of his most complex and dynamic characters as he has to balance pretending to be subdued by the wardens and actually feeling subdued by their harsh treatment. It is also easy to relate to Luke's uncertainty with what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which surfaces in a touching scene in which he is visited by his mother who is shocked that he has no plans for the future. As the film progresses though, Luke becomes bent on escaping captivity, and the way he is treated, it is hard to blame him. On the same note though, his wanting to escape goes directly against his characterisation as a man with no plans for the future. It also never quite gels that he would escape given that he was serving a quite minimal sentence. Prison escape movies are almost always interesting though, and Luke's ingenuity is remarkable in itself. The entire film is also buoyed up by the genuine sense of camaraderie that radiates between the prisoners throughout; they are not out to attack one another, but rather share a strong bond similar to POW inmates. The film has several memorable scenes too beyond the famous \"failure to communicate\" exchanges and Lalo Schifrin's slowly swelling score is a blast, especially during a pivotal boxing match.",

Hell-raising ne'er-do-well with nothing to lose winds up on a prison chain-gang, setting a new pace for the guards and other inmates. Fairly straightforward crowd-pleaser, though with odd flickers of melodrama, heightened by Stuart Rosenberg's overeager direction and Lalo Schifrin's mercurial score. In its latter stages, the overlong film appears to aspire to loftier meanings, but for the most part it's Chain-Gang 101--though well-played by Paul Newman, Oscar winner George Kennedy, and a solid, sometimes funny and colorful supporting cast. The central character's sunny rebellion turns serious by the midway point, and director Rosenberg overdoses on inmate clich\u00e9s, but one is so apt to be drawn to Newman's characterization that the sour residue the movie leaves behind is not likely to catch up to viewers until later. *** from ****",

Admittedly I had for some reason imagined it was about gambling and not a prison film. Not that I'm keen on gambling films which always seem to go the same agonising way but prison films as well if they are serious and involve prolonged periods of guys testing themselves against each other in a closed environment. WIP are OK because the focus is inevitably not on male bonding or rivalry which is what seems to have no interest for me. So here I found the first fifty minutes or so rather tedious and uninteresting in the extreme, the middle section unpleasant and nasty and the end rather silly. Presumably what I don't like about this film is what some do and here I'm thinking particularly of protracted scenes of semi naked men sweating in the midday sun with bosses being bossy, a heavy overtone of religious symbolism and an overriding tendency towards glorifying sadistic behaviour. Thinking about it those three do fit quite nicely together and are epitomised by the fearsome boxing encounter and the well filmed but horrible egg eating sequence which culminates in Newman laid out as if crucified and abandoned. The only exception to all this is the rather exceptional sequence of the buxom and barely clad young lady supposedly cleaning the car but seemingly more like offering herself teasingly to the inmates digging their trench. Although even here there seems just as much attention on those bulging and sweating male chests as on the young girl's body parts. In conclusion, I would mention that any film with Harry Dean Stanton seems to get my hackles up and here it is all the worse in that it falls to him, in the main, to sing the spirituals, another element of the level of religiosity it was felt appropriate to lay over this peculiar little, yet overlong, film.",

That's it. I had no idea on the setting, plot, drive, other actors, year it was set in, nothing else.And yet, I still bought the Bluray because I've heard about it my whole life and thought: well, it's a classic I must see and it was on sale and\u0085\u0085at least I got it on sale.

I got where his arc was going and where it had to end. Unfortunately, since that was established early, at least for me, and I kept thinking he'd finally be \"cool,\" but wasn't, and hence, he also wasn't much interest to me. As a matter of fact, since I got Luke's storyline early on, I kept wondering about the rest of movie was about. Well, it's obvious, but not too interesting. Unrealistic, despite the year this was made. Reminded me of the musical South Pacific I saw live. Sadly, or at least not for me, I wanted to laugh out loud throughout the play\u0085but, thought better of it since that might be considered rude to others.I wanted to laugh (at both that play and here) because I didn't believe that's how men act, no matter the timeframe or book it's based on.Surprisingly, from all I wrote above, I didn't hate the movie, I just expected more.

But certainly, that of Cool Hand Luke would have to be a contender. In actuality, Newman speaks very little in the picture when you come right down to it, but he accomplishes more with his looks and attitude than a lot of actors do with a lot more dialog.The strength of the film lies in Newman's portrayal of Lucas Jackson, a non-conformist who under most circumstances wouldn't even be considered a criminal. But he's paying the price for a drunken jag resulting in some damaged parking meters, and without trying, ingratiates himself with fellow prisoners following a physical beating at the hands of fellow prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy). That confrontation sets up the story for Luke's repeated attempts at escaping not only from the work farm, but from his own restless sense of being a prisoner in his own skin. Director Stuart Rosenberg magnifies Luke's struggle for redemption in the strongly imaged fade out right after the egg eating contest, showing the prone Newman in a crucifixion pose with arms outstretched and legs akimbo.Newman's not the only standout in the picture though. George Kennedy earned a Best Supporting Actor trophy for his portrayal of Dragline, the nominal head of the prisoners who is so inspired by Luke's work ethic and integrity that he eventually comes around to calling him 'my boy'. Strother Martin also makes an impact as the prison captain, and I wonder now if his signature line in the picture, which is now a staple of middle managers and parents everywhere, was the first time it was ever used - \"What we have here, is failure to communicate\".To be sure, there are a lot of great scenes in \"Cool Hand Luke\" - the fight, the car wash, the egg eating contest, the escapes. I myself could watch Carr the floor walker (Clifton James) over and over again as he explains what it takes to earn a night in the box. But for all of it, it's Newman's performance that pulls the whole thing together, as he keeps on swinging and smiling, inspiring the viewer to root for the underdog while he's thumbing his nose at the face of authority.",

One important aspect is the guard wearing sunglasses: this character is the supreme representation of authority.

Also starring George Kennedy (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Strother Martin (who co-starred again with Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\") and Jo Van Fleet.

Was he always a rebel or did he get worse after fighting during the war? It's only two years for damaging property and he's in the same prison with someone convicted for murder. I had a hard time connecting with this universe but I am sure that seeing the nuances of Newman's acting probably meant more for a lot of young men during that era.

There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom.The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich\u00e9s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right.So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.",

            "content": "I never really thought much of Paul Newman's acting until he played Cool Hand Luke. When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,\" I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" I was impressed by his role in \"Hud,\" but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with \"Cool Hand Luke\" I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment. Without Newman this film would have gone nowhere, not even with the brilliant performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Strother Martin, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon, and Jo Van Fleet.Though Strother Martin is most remembered for what became a catchphrase in the counterculture movement, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate,\" I like the line he throws at Luke when they first encounter each other, \"Cuttin' heads off parking meters! Just where'd you think that was going to get you?\" because that line epitomizes the diametrically opposed personalities of a Hitler-type authoritarian monster who appears harmless to the naked eye and that of a rebel who is determined to crush tyranny in any form that threatens the freedom of mankind. This tension and antagonism is also central to another movie classic, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" based on a novel written during the same time period, where we discover it between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. This is indeed high drama and it takes the likes of Paul Newman and Jack Nicholson to pull it off.",

The sinewy script by Don Pearce and Frank Pierson not only offers plenty of sharp dialogue and bracing wit (the egg-eating contest is an absolute hoot!), but also provides a profound and provocative parable on mainstream society's gross intolerance of anybody who dares to march to the beat of their own drum instead of toeing the line and following the herd.The terrific acting by the bang-up cast warrants praise for sure: George Kennedy totally deserved his Oscar for his wonderfully robust portrayal of hearty top con Dragline, Strother Martin delivers a deliciously despicable turn as the serenely wicked warden, and Jo Van Fleet shines in a touching cameo as Luke's sickly mother Arletta. The inmates are vividly filled out by such familiar faces as Clifton James, J.D. Cannon, Anthony Zerbe (fine film debut as slimy trustee Dog Boy), Wayne Rogers, Harry Dean Stanton (who gets to sing several songs), a young and goofy Dennis Hopper, Ralph \"Pa Walton\" Waite, Robert Drivas, and Joe Don Baker. The guys portraying the guards are likewise excellent: Luke Askew (genuinely chilling), Robert Donner, and Charles Tyner amongst them, although it's Morgan Woodward who makes the strongest impression as the fearsome and reticent man with no eyes. Joy Harmon has a memorably sexy bit as a tasty blonde tease. Kudos are also in order for both Conrad Hall's crisp widescreen cinematography and Lalo Schifrin's harmonic score.

Set in the rural south classy Paul Newman plays Luke a southerner who's rebellious and a loner. So upon his arrest for another petty crime it's off to a camp that's rural just like a work style road prison. The work is harsh ranging from digging ditches, shoveling dirt, and cutting and chopping hay. Along the way for Luke learning to adapt is a struggle, yet help is provided from fellow prisoner Dragline(George Kennedy)I must say that George gives a fine and likable performance by showing his character could be such an anti establishment role model. Very memorable is the accent and performance of camp captain played by Strother Martin who chills Luke with one of the most memorable and famous lines in cinema history \"What we've got here is... failure to communicate\" Though the film is not a modern day prison film and seems outdated to some the film is with rich humor and clever in it's own way. Especially during the chase scene when Luke uses pepper to throw off the smell of the chasing dogs. And the storytelling is powerful with the scenes of the inmates communicating by folk music and hymns.

Luke's evolution is like peeling away the layers of an onion; one mistake begets another, then another and so on.  `Cool Hand Luke' also challenges the viewer to possibly question their own moral fiber; `Is what he did that bad?' `Does he deserve what he is getting?' `Cool Hand Luke' sports some pretty interesting shots (I never thought I would see an extreme close-up of Harry Dean Stanton's singing mouth, nor do I ever think I want to again), pretty great acting, (George Kennedy won an Oscar for convincingly playing a real cracker) and a veritable `who's who' of virtually as-yet-undiscovered young male actors.  I managed to spot Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, the aforementioned Harry Dean Stanton, and a couple of other actors that I was convinced I'd seen in subsequent films or television.  Probably the most obvious theme that I noticed in `Cool Hand Luke' is that it is definitely a `man's film'.  There are exactly two women in the film and they are each featured for less than five minutes each \u0096 one being Luke's dying mother who comes to visit him in prison, and the other is the oft-imitated (and completely objectified) woman washing her car and taunting the road gang.  `Cool Hand Luke' is a film that on the onset is a fairly straightforward film, but upon reflection, even during the course of the film itself, is quite layered and thought provoking.  In addition to being hailed as a film classic, there are several films that have obviously used it as an inspiration, the most obvious being `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Oh Brother Where Art Thou'.  Nothing is black and white in this film, which I think is one of the factors that make `Cool Hand Luke' a classic.--Shelly",

He doesn't believe in the establishment, doesn't believe in god, and served valorously in the army but not because of a devotion to a higher cause. He wins over other prisoners not by beating George Kennedy's character in a fight, but by getting up time and again, never surrendering. He seems to see right through people, and references the crass commercialism of religion in the song 'Plastic Jesus.' (The film has both Newman and Harry Dean Stanton singing, which was pretty cool). Luke is a classic counterculture icon, and even though he does dumb things without thinking them through, we get the sense that if he had been brought up right or gotten breaks in the world, he could have been successful.In one of the great early scenes, Luke's dying mother comes to visit him, which in an understated way reveals to us quite a bit about his past. He never knew his father, and while his mother professes love for him, it's clear they've been distant for a long time. She says she wishes that people were like dogs in the sense that the mother could forget she even had puppies after awhile, and meanwhile, he doesn't even call her 'mom,' addressing her as Arletta instead. It's an incredibly sad scene, and there is real pain in Newman's eyes.In another fantastic and gut-wrenching moment, the other convicts become disillusioned with him, and, beaten, he screams out \"Where are you now?\" evoking Christ and abandonment, another form of cruelty in people. There are some bits thrown in to lighten the tone - the poker game where Luke gets his nickname, the 50 eggs scene, and that silly bit where they ogle the big-chested woman teasing them while washing her car - so it's obviously not as real as it could have been.On the other hand, it plumbs the depths of man's brutality in how prisoners are treated, seemingly borne out of needing to dominate and humiliate, making for some gritty and tough moments to watch. The film references a couple of 1932 prison films, 'Hell's Highway,' in which a convict is put in a similar box (and dies, based on the real-life Arthur Maillefert case in Road Camp 36 that shocked the nation), and 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,' in which there is an escape sequence using a truck, so it's interesting to think of the film in a larger context. America is an incredibly punitive country - 35 years before this film was made the cruelties of the Maillefert case were all over the headlines, and 20-30 years later, with the wave of \"get tough on crime\" politics, excessive sentencing and the solitary confinement form of torture were reinstated, existing to this day. The film may thus seem like an anachronism with its chain gang in the deep South, but it's really not at all.",

Aside from Butch Cassidy & The Sting, the latter of which being one of my favorite 70's films, I have yet to explore Newman's filmography. I'd say Cool Hand Luke was as good of a start as any. Always engrossing & consistently funny, Cool Hand Luke strikes a nice balance of tones and presents one of the great understated performances of the last 50 years with Newman in the title role. I can't believe it took me this long.9.0/10",

            "content": "Powered by Paul Newman's charismatic performance & permeated with explicit religious imagery, Cool Hand Luke is a finely crafted, wonderfully layered & brilliantly performed character study that manages to be captivating for the most part and with its anti-establishment tone, it becomes much more than just another prison drama.Cool Hand Luke tells the story of a war veteran who's sentenced to 2 years in prison for destroying public property and refuses to be broken down by the harsh life behind the bars. As the days pass by, he earns the respect of all inmates but when a tragic incident compels him to escape from the facility, the next set of events put his seemingly unbreakable will to test.Directed by Stuart Rosenberg in what's his directorial debut, Cool Hand Luke keeps its eponymous character at the forefront at all times and keeps everything light & amusing during the first half, as we witness Luke's endeavours not only garnering him other inmates' respect & admiration but also providing them a sense of hope in what's usually a monotonous life in a confined environment.Rosenberg's direction is good but the screenplay is still better, for it packs a sufficiently fleshed & versatile set of characters while the plot itself follows an interesting trajectory, which the director is unable to make full use of. The story is quite engaging but few moments are either overdrawn or lack the desired emotional punch. It does, however, make good use of wit and religious elements are wisely applied.The sun-baked frames & bright colour palette beautifully reflect the scorching surrounding these prisoners are made to work in. Coming to the performances, Paul Newman delivers another stellar input in the leading role and he is excellently supported by George Kennedy who contributes with an impressive performance of his own, while Morgan Woodward steals his scenes without ever uttering a single word.On an overall scale, Cool Hand Luke is a fascinating study of a rebellious character who refuses to conform to the norm and, in his attempt to upset the established order, is idolised by his inmates and ultimately becomes a sort of messiah to them. It also has a thing or two to say about the brutal system that's much capable of breaking every spirit & crushing every hope to submit anyone who doesn't play by its rules. Cool, composed & compelling in more ways than one, Cool Hand Luke is definitely worth a shot.",

            "content": "The \"men in prison\" genre is one that has been done to death from \"The Big House\" on up to the premium cable series \"Oz\", but this entry has to rank as one of the all-time best. Newman plays the title character, a rather aimless ne'r do well who gets drunk one night and decapitates several parking meters. This lands him in a labor camp for two years (!) where he alternately aggravates and inspires the other inmates and the guards. His chief aggressor upon arrival is hulking, dim, loud-mouthed Kennedy who challenges him in several ways. However, in true movie fashion, they eventually become best buddies. The prison is populated by a huge array of other types such as sensitive Waite, meticulous Cannon, mentally-challenged Hopper and over-eager Antonio, to name a few. After a while, the authorities begin to resent the influence Newman has on the other inmates. When he attempts escape, he is given \"the treatment\" and is ground down to total subservience. Or is he? Newman gives a performance here that is nothing short of brilliant. His charm and charisma are on full throttle, but so are his sensitivity and insightfulness. He looks great and turns in a heavy-duty portrayal. Kennedy, who won an Oscar for this, is also very strong. His not-too-gentle giant is somewhat infectious and engaging. It's a fully realized characterization. Note how, even though it is never directly mentioned, he can't read. A better array of supporting actors from this time would be hard to find. The inmates are all good, but the guards and officials are even better. Martin is unforgettable in his fairly small role as the warden and spits out the iconic catch phrase, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate!\" Woodward is super-imposing as the rifle-toting (and wordless) chain gang boss. Best of all is a brief cameo by Van Fleet as Newman's chain-smoking, beaten-down mother. Bette Davis was foolish to turn the role down, but the film is better for the incredible authenticity and lack of obvious acting that Van Fleet brings to the part. It's interesting to note that Davalos, who beat out Newman for his role in \"East of Eden\" is now relegated to that of a virtual extra, barely getting an opportunity to say or do anything of note. The film boasts many memorable vignettes including the famous, nausea-inducing, egg-eating contest, a scene involving the pavement of a road and the classic one in which a scantily-clad, buxom lady teases the inmates by washing her car as they look on. It's interesting to watch this viewpoint of a southern prison/chain gang with the inmates mostly getting along very well, affectionately interacting, betting, dancing and so forth (Drivas' little go-go moves on the front porch are, perhaps, a bit much, though.) Of course, it's practically science fiction now as there is not one minority in sight within the prison camp and someone convicted of Newman's crime would be (un)lucky to serve any time at all nowadays! Fans of beefcake are in for a treat with the tan men spending huge amounts of time shirtless and in their underwear. Newman even does what is the closest he ever came to a nude scene - a dimly-lit glimpse of his bottom as he's changing into a nightshirt outside. (\"Pa Walton\" Waite goes even further, stripping down in broad daylight and showing a remarkably fit rear end for his age.) There's also a terrifically evocative and pleasing score by Lalo Schifrin. If this nicely-directed film has a flaw, it is probably that it's just the tiniest bit too long. However, the pleasures it yields make that seem like carping.",

Unfortunately, his stubbornness and unbreakable spite eventually destroy him.Technically, the movie is brilliantly done. Everything from acting, through the camera and directing, to music is at a really high level. But the story, although well developed, with excellent characterization and a healthy dose of humor, just does not work for me. I understand that this is a character study of a non-conformist and rebel and I get a message that the film conveys, but no one would be driven to death this absurdly and unnecessary. If our main character was a mental patient, sentenced to life, or if this was some surreal movie, it would be something else, but in a realistic drama, a capable, intelligent, charismatic man, sentenced to just two years... It just doesn't make any sense. This movie has the potential for a maximum rating, but for that, it needs a much more serious and compelling story and a more powerful emotion. It appealed to me, but it did not leave an essentially strong impression.8/10",

His performance, as well as that of George Kennedy, are striking. It could be the best he has done although he has so many other fine movies.

            "content": "Here's a thought: would \"The Shawshank Redemption\" have ever happened without \"Cool Hand Luke?\" Both films examine prison life in a tall-tale sort of way. Heroes of questionable morality perform valiant acts in defiance of cold and rigid prison wardens and life is at its most fragile, balancing between the joy needed to stay alive and rock-bottom depression.However you choose to compare the films, there's no doubt both are on greatest film lists. \"Cool Hand Luke\" simply has the distinction of being first.Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance is one of his very best, or at least one of my favorites to this point. I have not seen \"The Color of Money,\" but I have little doubt that Oscar was rewarded to him for having been screwed over so many times.As Dragline (George Kennedy, who won an Oscar) so perfectly points out in his ending monologue voiced over a montage of Luke, Newman's smile alone makes Luke such a magnetic character. There's always a sense that he knows something you don't, that he has mastered some secret of life that makes him impervious to hardship. His tacit contempt for authority makes him much more likable than your typical anti-hero (if he can even be considered one), and it also primes us for his few dramatic scenes, which are soft but moving.Lucas Jackson is an honored war vet who is thrown somewhat needlessly into a prison work camp in the south after beheading parking meters while drunk. Compared to the crimes of some of the others, it's a bad deal. Luke quickly falls out of favor with the prison guards with his subtle defiance, and it takes him some time before he's initiated with his fellow inmates.There are so many memorable scenes in the film because the most pivotal moments are also the most visually appealing. Director Stuart Rosenberg and writer Frank Pierson appear to be on the same page in really emphasizing scenes such as the \"Lucille\" scene in which a local woman erotically washes a car as the men look on from their work post, the subsequent boxing fight between Luke and Dragline and the egg-eating scene. Prior to Luke trying to escape after \"getting some rabbit in his blood\" when a personal tragedy befalls him, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of places to go, so the scenes become entirely about character development, which pays off for the rest of the film. The escape attempts have an underlying strength because of the entertaining first act or so.The sense of camaraderie amongst the inmates is another thing you can't help but take notice of. Sometimes scenes are designed that way, but even when the focus is elsewhere, the extras and supporting actors are enhancing the environment, creating a mood for the film, one that expresses how caught in a bubble they are and gives you the sense of how prisoners will insist on life even in rough conditions.\"Cool Hand Luke\" eventually evolves into a story of leadership, the qualities that make a man great, or \"an original\" as Dragline says. Luke becomes an inspiration for his inmates through his attitude and his actions, though more an ideal to aspire to as opposed to a role model to emulate. Newman's performance hammers that home as truth for the audience too, which makes \"Cool Hand Luke\" a classic.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "Nothing else in the Stuart Rosenberg canon quite prepares you for COOL HAND Luke. It was an instant classic and it hardly mattered who the director was, (though I guess a bad director could have messed things up). This was the great anti-establishment movie of its day, (a late sixties REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE), with that blue-eyed beauty and most iconic of anti-establishment actors, Paul Newman, cast in the title role. As Fast Eddie Felson and Hud Bannon, Newman had already held two fingers up to the establishment and in many ways this was the role that came to define him.The plot, by now, is familiar to generations of moviegoers. Newman is sentenced to two years on a chain gang for screwing the heads of parking metres, in itself something of a motiveless crime; he claims he was just settling old scores and you know from the second you see him he isn't going to stay put so it's a movie about a man who becomes a hero to his fellow prisoners for continually running away and for being continually brought back and it's full of classic scenes; the car-washing scene, the egg eating competition, the tar- rolling scene, the boxing match between Newman and George Kennedy.The casting, of course, was crucial. It was a movie full of identifiable character parts where the actors cast as prisoners, the warden and the screws all had their marks to make, (though no African-American or gay prisoners)? Kennedy got the Supporting Actor Oscar and Strother Martin was magnificent as the warden but it has one of he great supporting casts, all brilliant and too many to mention with the wonderful Jo Van Fleet taking the only significant female role as Newman's mother. It was adapted by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson from Pearce's novel, Lalo Schifrin did the score and Conrad Hall photographed it in Panavision so did it really matter who the director was or was this just one of those movies that was destined to become a classic from the pre-production phase?

            "content": "Paul Newman may have one of the silver screen's richest careers, but it's hard picking a single film of his that shows off his star power in better light than \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Co-star George Kennedy got the Oscar and Strother Martin delivered its most famous line, but this is a Newman film through and through, maybe his best one, and along with \"Lawrence Of Arabia\" maybe the most perfect movie of the 1960s.Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a decorated war veteran who has a hard time adjusting once back at home. After he is arrested for cutting the heads off a row of parking meters, perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan, he is sent to a prison work camp for two years to \"get your mind right,\" as the prison's Captain (Strother Martin) puts it. Only Luke has different ideas, after living his life the way the Man wanted only to be rewarded with violence, guilt and heartbreak.Luke has come through this crucible with breezy bravado and an indomitable spirit that gives the film much of its power. When he faces another inmate named Dragline (George Kennedy) in a boxing match, Luke quickly gets the tar beaten out of him so bad the other inmates lose their appetite for carnage and tell Luke to just stay down so Dragline will win. Luke won't quit, though: \"You're gonna have to kill me,\" he grunts.\"Let him draw some blood, maybe the guards will break it up,\" says one of the smarter inmates, a check-kiter named Society Red (J.D. Cannon).\"I wouldn't want to frighten him,\" Luke grunts back.The film actually works as something of a comedy for the first half, with Newman's lovable-loser persona on a par with his role in \"Slapshot\" years later. We sense a deeper pain, but Newman brilliantly keeps us at bay with his killer grin. Then as the film develops, Luke's uniquely unbending character and his popularity among the other inmates (\"You're a genuine original,\" Dragline notes) make him a target of the camp bosses, especially after Luke addresses the chief screw, Boss Godfrey a.k.a. \"No Eyes,\" with less than the requisite amount of humility after No Eyes shoots a snake Luke is holding. Luke winds up locked in a box, a ridiculously excessive punishment made worse still when the Captain announces it's being done because Luke's mother just died and they want to keep him from getting ideas about \"paying his respects.\" The only worse thing one can do than incarcerate a man wrongly is proclaim it is being done for his own good. After that, Luke really has no choice but to rebel, a role he seems reluctant to take, alternately blaming God and the other inmates for \"feeding off me\".Like another institutional inmate flick, \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" there is an interesting Christian subtext that runs through \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Luke becomes a figure of compassion and inspiration for the camp's other inmates, performing miraculous feats and challenging their spirits to believe in their own greater power. Actually, the message seems less orthodox than one you would get in church, rather more in line with the philosophy of Christian existentialism, where one is left to do what he feels best in a hostile environment and God comes in the form of a quiet voice inside rather than thunder from on high.You could make \"Cool Hand Luke\" today and it would be just as impressive, but something about the time the film was made adds to its relevance. Questioning authority became quite the thing to do by this time, but few films raised those questions as entertainingly and intelligently as Luke.And what a rich ensemble! Kennedy, Cannon, Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, Anthony Zerbe, Ralph Waite, Wayne Rogers and the other actors playing the inmates mesh superbly, as do the authority figures played by Martin, Luke Askew, and Clifton James as Carr the floorwalker, who sets down the rules of the camp in a terrific speech. Harry Dean Stanton shows off a fine singing voice, while two other actors give powerful performances without delivering a line; Morgan Woodward as No-Eyes and Joy Harmon as a girl who washes a car in one of the most memorable torture sequences ever put on screen.Make no mistake, this is Newman's film all the way. He laughs, he screams, he prays, he fights, he even sings and plays the banjo and shows some skin. And he earns our devotion every bit as much as Luke does his prison comrades, giving us a figure of inspiration to hold onto long after he's gone.",

            "content": "Cool Hand Luke is an engaging movie with symbolism, about one of the great characters of cinema. Throughout the whole film there is symbolism, which supports the things that have been said earlier by characters. I like the inventive and fitting camera work that supports the messages and lends more power to the film. I also like the sound design, which especially in the beginning often has a dazzling effect, in combination with the cinematography, like, when the camera closes in on the ventilator.It's the kind of film with symbolism that doesn't get much appreciation from the art-house crowd (you know you're one of them, don't lie to yourself), since it could be dangerous to acknowledge the symbolism in a film that is easy to understand for everyone, with characters that are emotionally engaging. People could falsely believe that you like it for those reasons, which could lead them to doubt your intellectualism.In the film things are often told twice in two different ways. Usually within a few minutes, in the same scene or in two successive scenes. Like in the scene when Luke bursts out: \"Get out there yourself. Stop feedin' off me. Get out of here. I can't breathe. Give me some air.\" Oh, how right Luke was when he yelled those words to his fellow inmates. A few minutes later they are literally feeding off of his plate when he has to clear his plate but apparently has no appetite, putting this line into a completely different (more positive) light.Notably, the initiator for him to yell those lines is that when they show him his picture with the two women, they don't want to believe him when he says it was staged. The movie closes with this very picture. To me this said that we, the audience, have fed off of him. We let the film be our catalyst for our wishes to have the guts to fight for a boundless world, our wishes to have enough of a will to shake the world. Oh, how right the film was with that.Some folks may wouldn't call this symbolism. Well, I do. Other than some of the art-house stuff it's symbolism with an intention behind it. It's not just thrown in there so that the audience can find some meaning in it, just so that we have something to think about, while the filmmaker failed to do so himself. No, this symbolism supported the story and our understanding of the characters.Needless to say that the Luke character spoke right out of our hearts. I love the fact that he essentially stayed a loner till his last breath, since films with a main character like that usually end with the guy being very social and as a functioning part of society. Sure, it's depressing that in this world there seems to be no place for good ol' Luke, but then again, I think there ain't a place for good ol' Perception de Ambiguity either.",

Well acted, excellently shot, it really helps to create this environment of heat and stagnation that it's so clearly going for.

An aimless man refusing to bend or be broken only to be worn down to nothing. This is a tough movie though. There's no real hope here, no great triumph or achievement and while that can be a depressing thought it's such a strangely refreshing change from the normally saccharine fare Hollywood mass produces now.This is a solid recommend from me.

Future stars Anthony Zerbe and Joe Don Baker have minor roles and the always entertaining Clifton James is a sympathetic prison guard.If there are criticisms, the Jesus Christ inference during the egg-eating contest is trite and unnecessary and the Kennedy character's lucidity occasionally belies the supposed lack of intellect on which his character is built, but these are fairly minor contentions.

What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned.But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the \"conversation\" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen.Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that.All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening.

But we each have a right to their favorites and this is mine. But why this one? I'm not particularly sympathetic to prisoners: if you can't do the time, don't' do the crime. But my favorite Tv is 'The Fugitive' and my favorite movie is 'Cool Hand Luke'. Go figure. Both reached their heights in 1967, when the TV series ended with the successful resolution of the problems of Dr. Richard Kimble and the movie ended with it's protagonist dead. It helped that Dr. Kimble was innocent. Luke Jackson was not but his crime, (drunk and disorderly) doesn't seem to deserve what he's put through here. Dr. Kimble is on the run constantly, Luke intermittently. Both stories produce great poignancy and identification with the protagonist. Dr. Kimble becomes a symbol of the unfairness of life, Luke of the dignity of the individual.For many people, their favorite movie is 'It's a Wonderful Life', in which the protagonist, under great stress, suggests that it would have been better if he'd never been born. An angel shows him how things would have been: his community would have been a cesspool of vice. His brother would have died and would have bene unable to save others. And his wife would have be condemned to loneliness without him and their unborn children. I agree that it's very powerful but somewhat under-cut by the fact that George Bailey is a pillar of the community: creating a case for his value as a human being is easy - there should have been a statue to the guy. I've previously contrasted that to the Billy Bigelow character in 'Carousel', a nere-do-well whom no one respects but is redeemed by his ability to love and inspire love in others. Luke is a similar character who is redeemed by his refusal to give up and that \"Cool Hand Luke smile of his\".It's the greatest role of my favorite modern actor. (I'm also an Errol Flynn fan but that's another story). He's supported by an incredible cast of 1960's talent: George Kennedy, the best supporting actor ever, Strother Martin, Morgan Woodward, JD cannon, Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, Clifton James, John McLiam, harry dean Stanton, Wayne Rogers of TV's MASH, Ralph Waite, (Papa Walton), Anthony Zerbe, Dick Davalos, who got the role in East of Eden, (1955) that Paul had auditioned for, acting with James Dean and Jo Van Fleet who would have played his mother in that film and does in this one.And I love the scene where the prisoners have gone from treating Luke with disdain to almost worshiping him because the picture he had placed in a magazine during one of his several escapes, only to see him captured again and delivered to them beaten up. They want him to tell tales of his exploits and he shouts at them \"Don't feed on me!\" I've bene feeding on Luke Jackson ever since.But it's Lalo Schifrin's incredible musical score that puts this one over the top for me. Schifrin is most famous for writing the iconic theme for TV's Mission Impossible, (who's first season ended in this same year of 1967). Whenever a see a movie so good that I wonder if it might become my favorite movie of all time, the Ballad of Cool hand Luke starts playing in my head and I know that it isn't.",

While CHL skewered authority, Mad skewered the iconic anti-hero sensibility of Paul Newman and his character. I'm not dissing Luke at all, but the writers at Mad must have been almost clairvoyant in their ability to see the cultural landmark that Stuart Rosenberg's movie would become.What a magnificent snapshot of what popular entertainment was in the late 1960s! Like MASH, the story takes place at another time, but the message fits the generation perfectly, and beyond. I have shown Luke to high schoolers in this decade, and there is a resonance, a \"getting it\" that works forty years after the fact.I can't think of a major flaw in this film. Cool Hand Luke isn't rocket surgery, but it is the simple story of a malcontent's pushing back at the powers that be. From Newman's hearty Luke, who quietly begins drawing his personal line in the sand at the start of the film, to George Kennedy's heartbroken bully, who decides to destroy Luke for his impertinence, then joins him when he can't be defeated, to the heartless automatons led by Strother Martin, who cannot be budged in their desire to make Luke kneel (and will not accept defeat), there is a raw, basic power here, a struggle between individualism and communitarianism.Probably the only problem with Cool Hand Luke is its commercial slickness. It plays out with just a bit too much glycerin for sweat; it's possible that the movie looks slick now because it has become such a cultural icon. Big, mirrored aviator sunglasses are an instant prompt for cruel authority figures, and ask yourself how many times you have heard, \"What we have har is . . . failure to communicate!\" Oh, well. I'm picking nits here and we all know how powerful the basic story of a Cool Hand Luke is in our culture. I tried to think of another character like Luke and, strangely enough, Ferris Bueller came to mind. Instead of Martin's \"Failure to communicate\" line, we get Ben Stein's \"Anyone, anyone, anyone?\" Not that similar, but raging against the machine sure does sell.And communicate.",

Amid constant threat of punishment, each building in cruelty, Luke continues his quest to escape. Surprising amount of emotional depth throughout.

Also, interesting enough are the small roles of Dennis Hopper and Harry Dean Stanton, before they were famous.

            "content": "Do you know (and do you care?) that this highly-praised, much-beloved, \"Rebel-Without-A-Cause\" prison picture is actually a bit of a Bible story in disguise? It's true! With deliberate intent, director Stuart Rosenberg saw to it that Newman's Lucas Jackson character was viewed as being something of a Christ figure. That's right. Throughout the story Lucas was portrayed as being an anti-hero saint who first wins over his fellow man and then is ultimately crucified.After Lucas wins the egg-eating bet this Christ-like persona is made even more apparent when he is left lying out on the table in the position of Christ at crucifixion. As well, Luke sings the little ditty \"Plastic Jesus\" after learning of his mother's death. And near the end of the film Luke \"talks\" to God. This moment was meant to evoke the conversation that supposedly took place between Christ & God at the Garden of Gethsemane.All-in-all - I found this whole religious angle to the story to be very unwelcome. To me, Lucas was nothing but an apathetic loser who deserved to go to prison for foolishly cutting the heads off of dozens of parking meters. And this religiousness just rendered this 1967, Florida, chain-gang picture as being even more of a dim-witted dud than it already was.As I understand it, Cool Hand Luke is considered by many to be a glowing, glittering gem of classic, American film-making. But, hey, that's certainly not how it struck me! Cool Hand Luke was, pretty much, just an over-long tale about an unlikable, smirking loser. Its underlying message was as pretentious as a frickin' plastic crucifix.Containing endless \"filler\" scenes that were clearly meant to showcase its big-name star, Paul Newman, this picture seemed to be more interested in giving the viewer endless opportunities to admire our star's baby-blue eyes, rather than anything else.Personally, I thought that, at 42, Newman was way too old for his part.It struck me as really peculiar that throughout the story it was repeatedly insinuated that Newman's character was a very complicated individual. But, time & again, I never learnt anything worthwhile about him, at all.I also found this film had a really annoying tendency to deliberately warp the rules of morality. This was particularly so when it came to the belligerent conduct of the prisoners and their clear defiance and disrespect of those in the position of authority.",

A group of prisoners work on a chain gang, one of whom (Luke, played by Paul Newman in what is not his greatest performance) refuses to bow down to the system. But at first, he is not especially defiant and his antics seem more like pranks, played to test his own character and to give him something to do, but there's never a sense that too much is riding on them; and the soundtrack seems to emphasise the comic over the grave. Then his mother dies, he attempts to escape, the guards turn nasty and eventually he is engaged in a fight for his life and integrity. The disconnected nature of the two halves of the film means that neither is especially effective; some scenes are entertaining but the whole does not cohere, and Luke seems too simplistically nice to really convince as a prison hard-man.

            "content": "There are some actors whose penchant for wanting to do challenging material is one of the most significant things that got them to where they were. Paul Newman was just such an actor. Known for his good looks, Newman, from the outset, wanted to be known even more, however, for being an actor who could stretch. This he did early and often, from the late 1950s onward, via such films as THE LONG HOT SUMMER, EXODUS, PARIS BLUES, THE HUSTLER, HUD, HARPER, and HOMBRE.And then in 1967, there was COOL HAND LUKE, in which he played the ultimate non-conformist, in one of the cruelest places one can be: on a prison gang in the post-war South.Newman is Lucas Jackson, who is arrested one night in a small Southern town for decapitating parking meters while under the influence. For this offense, he is sentenced to two years on a rough-and-tumble prison gang where there are rules, and if you break any, according to Carr The Floorwalker (Clifton James), you spend a night in \"The Box\"; and if you get \"rabbit in your blood\", you get a set of leg chains. Of course, Newman, not one to follow the rules, doesn't exactly comply; and after a few scrapes with the head prison gang leader Dragline (George Kennedy, in his Oscar-winning Supporting Actor role), he becomes a hero to Kennedy and the rest of the gang. But it also isn't too long before he gets the attention of the prison \"bosses\" (including Luke Askew, Morgan Woodward, Charles Tyner, and Robert Donner), and, of course, the inimitable Strother Martin as \"The Captain\" who, after Newman's first escape attempt, upbraids him with one of the great lines in Hollywood history: \"What we've got here is...failure to communicate\".Filmed primarily on location, especially in the San Joaquin River delta area outside of Stockton, in central California, as a stand-in for the unnamed Southern locales, COOL HAND LUKE is ably directed by Stuart Rosenberg, a veteran TV director who made his big-screen directing bow here. He gets a marvelous performance by Newman, who had insisted that the screenplay by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson (based on Pearce's book) not be changed merely to fit him. Kennedy, a ubiquitous actor throughout his career, does an equally fine job as the initially combative Dragline who comes to respect Newman after beating him almost to a pulp in a prison yard fight. The prison gang is made up of great up-and-coming actors, many of whom got their big break here: Dennis Hooper; Harry Dean Stanton; Wayne Rogers; J.D. Cannon; and Ralph Waite. And no one can forget Martin, one of the great character actors of all time, in his role as The Captain, not just for that aforementioned famous line, but one that he says from the beginning: \"I can be a good guy, or I can be one real mean man\".Topped off by Conrad Hall's clever cinematography and a genuine Americana score by Lalo Schifrin, COOL HAND LUKE was clearly one of the touchstone films of the late 1960s, and a true masterpiece. And it is all due to Paul Newman, a whole slew of great actors, veterans and up-and-comers alike, and a tight period prison story that does about as great a job as any other film of this genre.Newman says: \"Sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand.\" But in the \"Hard Case\" of COOL HAND LUKE, the hand here is a truly affirmative '10'.",

            "content": "A work prison serves as a setting for a showdown between rigid established authority and anarchic rebellion. By extension, this is a social metaphor for everything that happened in the 60s - Kent State, the Chicago 7, etc. The 60s were about rebelling against and trying to change the established order and having those in power strike back, usually with excessive force, and Cool Hand Luke is all of this in miniature. Here Paul Newman plays Luke, the essential rebel without a cause, butting heads with prison warden Strother Martin, who tells him, in a perfect encapsulation of the Establishment's attitude toward the youth of the 60s, \"Boy you need to get yourself right in the head...\" Martin gets the script's best material as the spokesman for Law and Order, warning the new cons, \"Man tries to run, he gets hisself a set of leg-irons. He runs twice, he gets two sets. Don't nobody get a third set.\" In his world, as in the button down world of LBJ and Nixon, the most the individual could hope for was to be ignored. To raise a fuss was to get slapped down. The supporting cast is superb, especially George Kennedy as a tough, none-too-bright convict who becomes a reluctant admirer of the cool, anarchic Luke, marveling how \"He just kept coming back with nothing.\" The script is a marvel, wonderfully memorable and full of ideas and attitudes about society, the value of and need for regulations, the place of the individual etc. and very entertaining, despite a bleakly existential message: there is no salvation or redemption, no reward for virtue, merely consequences for getting out of line. Also significant is the fact that the picture is firmly set in the humid, sun-scorched Deep South with its backward looking traditions and entrenched unwillingness to modernize. A rebel is not only slapped down, he is dragged backward in time against his will. So much here is watchable, meaningful and resonant that even 40 years later it deserves an audience.",

But up until the first time Luke tries to escape, it seems that, as a prison goes, this one is pretty mellow -- all the prisoners seem to get along, the guards (while clearly not nice guys) don't seem to bother anyone who follows the rules and, while you spend your days doing awful road work, everyone still seems to have lots of free time to play cards, strum the guitar, sing, have silly egg-eating bets (apparently it's no big deal to have the cook prepare 50 eggs to settle a bet) and chat. In many respects the place comes across as a really really strict summer camp. Even when Luke is put \"in the box\" after his mother dies, it seems unpleasant but not horrific.So all-in-all the prison feels a little too much like Stalag 17 on Hogan's Heroes -- where the camp seemed like a pretty mellow place to pass the war.Therefore, given that Luke seems to fit in well with his fellow prisoners and that he ONLY HAS A TWO YEAR SENTENCE, it seems a complete surprise when he makes a run for it. Part of the surprise is that Luke doesn't seem like an idiot (why run when you haven't got a lot of time left), nor are we shown or told of any frustration to get out that he's feeling.Now, of course, I don't believe that prisons were or are anywhere near resembling the relatively tolerable world we're shown here. And once Luke does start bucking the system, I believe what happens. But I find it hard to believe the central character's initial motives when there doesn't seem to be much to be running from and, from what we know of his backstory, he's got nothing in particular that he's running to.",

Brilliant performance by Paul Newman as the titular Luke who's put in prison and endears himself with the rest of the guys with his can-do, jokey attitude and willingness to do stupid stuff as well as his aloof and singular need to break the rules. The egg scene was really funny. Humour, drama and quite a lot of heart, and an interesting study in human behaviour and dog psychology. Really enjoyed it, didn't know what to expect but can see shades of every other jailhouse drama in this. Shows how a film can be honest and psychologically affecting without resorting to graphic violence and brutality. This is a clever film, and his character is intelligent and crazy - dangerous because he just doesn't care and is somewhat damaged and at odds with God. A young Dennis Hopper puts in an appearance. George Kennedy is good as the crazy using sycophantic \"big brother\" of the jailhouse, who's not so bright. Incredibly watchable.",

            "content": "There is very little one can say in a review of a classic film like Cool Hand Luke (CHL) that is both original and not repetitious. Perhaps the following observation might qualify as such a point. Over the years---I have increasingly reflected upon the perhaps novel idea that CHL and the movie version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ((OFOTCN) may have sufficient similarities so as to make it reasonable to compare and contrast them with each other.As presented in both films, the male lead characters are quite alike. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Luke (Paul Newman) are funny, irreverent, charismatic non-conformists who rebel against rules and regulations that stifle their creative individuality and free spirit. Under the confining environment of a rigidly cloistered life, each became the leader of a peer group and helped to change its ultimate destiny. But all this came at a terrible personal price each ultimately had to pay.While one was incarcerated in a mental hospital and the other in a prison farm, the particular problems they suffered with were substantially comparable. Each character somewhat resembled a Christ-like figure while achieving a victory over institutional oppression under the most difficult of circumstances. Their inherent integrity, decency and good humor helped each to succeed when a lesser person would likely have failed. In the end, McMurphy and Luke reached a sort of immortality by inspiring the lives of their peer groups---who then carried their memory forward to another (and possibly better) day.CHL and OFOTCN are great films because of how they depict the power of the human spirit---which against all odds can sometimes attain heights that defy rational explanation. When such stories are presented in a thoroughly entertaining way, they have the potential to accomplish lofty artistic and commercial success. That is exactly what has happened to these two wonderful movies.",

            "content": "The anti-hero is a term that is often misused. Here, it is perfected. In fact, Paul Newman during this brief period, perfected the anti-hero in this film and in HOMBRE.This film deals with a very shallow man, Paul Newman's Luke, who goes to prison for a very sill reason. He goes with the flow, and as he states later, never plans anything. He just does what he does.As soon as he is in prison, he is one of a group of new inmates who get the lecture from the warden, the one who gave us the famous line about \"failure to communicate\".The warden wonders if \"Luke\" will be a problem child. Luke instantly assures him he has no such intention. But he does become a \"working class hero\", not by planning, not by trying, but just by being.Luke never imagines he'll be the hero of the prison. The role just comes to him. He does nothing magnificent, but everything he does is magnified, chiefly by the hulking inmate portrayed by George Kennedy.And that is how the working class hero is in real life. I've been there. The center attraction doesn't try to do it. He just becomes it. The anti hero is one who is not the traditional demi god who bravely starts trouble. Luke just answers when trouble comes to him.This is the story of how legends are formed. In this case, it is a legend of a prison inmate.",

What the protagonist does is to continually resist, constantly destroy existing rules, and constantly destroy the existing system. At the beginning of the film, he destroyed public property; when he first entered prison, he rebelled against the bulk of the prison; in prison, he challenged the possibility of eating 50 eggs at a time; and even the final escape was expressing a postmodernism. The spirit of resistance and destruction. A bad card in his hand, but dare to clamor against power and authority. Such a cool hand luke is a spokesperson for the spirit of resistance.It can be seen vaguely in the film that Luke did not grow up in a typical happy family. A father who is exactly the opposite of a loving father has become the first authority in his life to be rebelled. Joining the army to join the army and winning wars repeatedly is another huge oppression for Luke, who hates murder. The source of this oppression is the entire society, the entire modern system. This is the reason that forced Luke to resist and break the ring.Everyone has such a spirit of rebellion in his heart. He may be an enemy of reason. He may be lurking in the depths of consciousness for a long time and we are not known. In this world, if rules and systems exist, there is a desire to destroy and deconstruct.",

It was nice seeing a very young Ralph Waite,Waltons patriarch, very young Dennis Hopper and of course Strother Martin, who teamed up with Newman in Slapshot. I digress. This movie was basically about an impish 30 something guy that got bored easily. Thus his antics that got him in jail also got him in trouble while he was in jail. Newman was a thrill seeker . The fact he was a military man further shows he is a man that likes to take challenges in life whether they are acceptable of society or not. He is not a sociopath ... more like a goof ball if you ask me. The fact that he had 2 year prison sentence is irrelevant. He tried to escape for the challenge more than anything else. He seemed to enjoy the camaraderie of the cell . The cell was more like an army barrack anyway where everyone slept in one big room. Thus the fact he kept fighting when he clearly lost , also he got involved in that lame egg eating challenge. Attempt escape of prison with year and half or so to go is on the surface a very stupid thing to do, most of us can agree. Especially in a prison that , truthfully , did not seem all that hardened to me. Again, Luke was a thrill seeker and had no choice in his mind. When they showed that picture of Luke with the debutantes looking completely different that was another example of that being the case. Luke was the type of guy that would sneak into a super bowl, attempt to do Evel Knievel type stunts or even Harry Houdini type stunts. The plot was that simple. The ending was awesome and always look for LUKES smile. That is telling . Great movie and great acting . If they do one thing to properly memorialize Mr. Paul Newman , I ask they do nothing... in other words , no remakes of this great piece of film writing.",

            "content": "Everyone knows the famous line: \"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\" It's been quoted and spoofed so often that when you finally watch the original in Cool Hand Luke, you'll probably burst out laughing.But Cool Hand Luke is actually a drama, so despite that one humorous line, you won't laugh at all. With many familiar shades of I Am a Fugitive from the Chain Gang, it's a prison movie completely geared towards a male audience. There's only two women in the film: Jo Van Fleet for five minutes as a classic long-suffering mom, and the famous \"car wash\" girl who teases all the men with her suggestive movements and skimpy dress. If Paul Newman wasn't such a cutie, I don't know why any woman would watch this movie.Which brings me to my one criticism: Paul shouldn't be such a cutie. Much of this movie is far too glossed over to be realistic. Prison movies are a very popular genre, and most of them are very \"Hollywood-ized\", and this is no exception. Despite looking perpetually sweaty, the men don't look like chain gang convicts. The five o'clock shadow on their faces indicate regular shaves, their clothes have only small smudges of dust and patches of sweat (which indicates either a regular laundry service or a hardly strenuous workday), and no haircut is overgrown. They joke and talk with each other all the time, get mail regularly, and are only punished if they deliberately disobey the rules. If it's supposed to be such an intolerable situation that Paul can't stand it, shouldn't it be portrayed that way? It comes across as a grown-up boys' camp, with a few hours a day working on the side of the road. When Paul starts breaking the rules, I couldn't help but wonder why he was doing it.But if you do love his sparkly blue eyes, you'll probably want to see this movie. It's very famous and has some iconic scenes, and who really tires of his bad boy attitude? He's too cool for school, and we all love him for it. You'll also get to see George Kennedy's Oscar-winning performance. He has great screen energy, and his reaction to the car wash is very funny.",

            "content": "Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same.This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called \"Let's be brutally realistic.\" But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work.Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else.The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies.There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons.Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit.Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared \"subconsciously\" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.",

To scotch Luke's rebelliousness, the guards try to break his will with abasements and random beatings.\"Cool Hand Luke\" works quite well as a metaphorically hedged political film, due to the seemingly naive screenplay, which, in principle, prostitutes the blatant worship of heroes. The inhuman rap system, which is established on dictatorial bedrocks, symbolizing any form of government in a way, tramples on every dignity of man, nips the free spirit in the bud and tolerates no protest. It begins immediately with the prologue, when we watch the drunk and incapable Luke demolishing parking meters. For that, he gets sentenced to two years. Being questioned on his motivations, he utters, that he comes from a small town and has \"not much to do in the evenin'\". Later he becomes a rebel with a cause, idolized by his jailbirds, who entrench themselves behind their own lethargy.Rosenberg's film also has some of that spurious adventure theme. Everyone remembers the egg scene, the dusty country road reflected in the sunglasses of the main guard, and we remember Luke's smile, exactly described by buddy Dragline (George Kennedy) at the end: \"You know, that, that Luke smile of his. He had it on his face right to the very end. Hell, if they didn't know it 'fore, they could tell right then that they weren't a-gonna beat him.

            "content": "Only a few years after his role in the movie \"Hud\", Paul Newman is back playing a rebellious character again, only this time set inside a prison. And not just an ordinary prison; a chain gang prison, somewhere in the rural, southern part of America.This movie has a very simple and very straightforward approach really but some movies really don't need much more than that. It's simplicity is actually what helps to movie forward and the reason why you remain glued to the screen. It's s true compelling movie, about real characters, kicking against authority.You could say it's a slow moving movie but it actually never really feels that way. There is always something happening, whether it be on the screen or in the character's heads. It's what really gets you into the characters and make you care about them. Yes, they are small time criminals but only because society regards them that way. You could also say that they are free minds, who don't simply want to life by the moral standards of modern society and don't want to play by the rules. People who say that the movie and its story is just pointless because they don't see what exactly message the movie was trying to get across should really watch this movie again, with a clear and open mind. With all respect but there is so much in this movie and to its main characters that it's really ludicrous to call this movie a boring or pointless one.The way the Luke character is set up and gets portrayed by Paul Newman makes him such a great and true rebellious character. By being different he actually slowly start to gain the respect of his fellow prisoners and as a viewer you can also really understand why. You'll slowly start to understand the character better and why he does the things the way the does. Unlike the authorities, you don't condemn him for the things he has done and does in this movie.But really the movie still would had not been as compelling and great to watch, if it wasn't for its directing approach as well. Even though its 1967 movie, it has '70's style written all over it. I really loved some of the movie sequences and was really impressed with the movie its look as well. It has some great cinematography in it by Conrad L. Hall, who lets the camera move a lot and gives us some great looking compositions as well. I was disappointed to learn that it didn't even got nominated for an Oscar but perhaps that was also due to it that Conrad L. Hall was already also nominated for a different movie that year and the other acclaimed cinematographer Robert Surtees got nominated for two different movies already. Having only three different cinematographers compete would perhaps had been a bit too measly. But having said that; this movie its cinematography would had totally deserved to win and is worthy of all of its praise.But luckily the movie did not got completely ignored by the Academy. It did receive 4 nominations but George Kennedy would be eventually the only one that also got to take the statue home with him. Quite funny, I never looked at George Kennedy thinking he was an Oscar worthy actor but after having him seen in this movie, I can't really complain about him winning.Perhaps the biggest surprise remains that this was more or less a one hit wonder from director Stuart Rosenberg. Prior to this movie, he had only mainly worked for television and after this movie, he never really delivered a movie of the same grandeur and stature again. It's why his name also probably won't ring a bell, unless to those who have seen the original \"The Amityville Horror\" perhaps. But it should tell you enough already about his career that the only movie people are still familiar with now days, next to \"Cool Hand Luke\" is the '70's horror production \"The Amityville Horror\". A real mystery and surprise to me, since this movie shows so much class and talent, it is hard to understand why he never came close to that same level again.A real must-see movie, in my opinion.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I was stunned by this movie. Mainly because it came at an accurate and critical point in my life and also because I saw myself in Luke's character, his existential calamity and struggle to find his path. Cool Hand Luke also caught me because of its portrayal of the strong bonds between men, it's also a beautiful showcase of masculinity with luke as the unsettled rebel, Courageous, perseverant, cool and stoic.... etc representing the man model, however, it's these patterns that lead to his end. Yet, masculinity and men bonds aren't the main subjects of this film. The storyline of Luke is one of a tortured and free man brawling with this freedom and struggling to give meaning to his bleak life. Luke self-destructive behavior leads him to this work- camp/prison where he was supposed to get his mind right and comply with rules and standards. however, this place makes him more resilient to find his own way in life, trying to escape as he realizes he can't fit in with these ideals. Even if at some point we see him regretting not starting a home and settling down. It was stirring, as he turned to god and tried belief as his last resort in one of the most classical and best scenes of cinema, in my opinion. All this to end up to the realization that he was on his own. Add to it Paul Newman nailed his role, he gave his complex character this enthralling charisma and infectious witt but most importantly he triumphed at portraying the light and smiley despair of luke. A film for the ages, it truly resonated in me for all the right reasons.",

Since then I have watched it too many times to mention. First on TV reruns, then on video, and now I'm really pleased to own it on DVD as it has FINALLY been released here in the region I live in. Every time I watch it I enjoy it. It never gets stale for me. Paul Newman is just perfect as Luke. It's easily my favourite performance by him. Stuart Rosenberg isn't a name director (though he later made another pretty good prison drama 'Brubaker' starring Robert Redford, and also the underrated Mickey Rourke/Eric Roberts drama 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village'), but I don't care. He made this film, and it is PERFECT. I can't fault anything about it. The script is excellent and has an authentic air (writer Donn Pearce actually served on a chain gang), and the performances by the ensemble cast are flawless. Even George Kennedy is great! I also love Strother Martin ('The Wild Bunch') as the Captain, and Luke Askew ('Easy Rider') who plays Boss Paul. The inmates are full of familiar faces and character actors. I won't list them all but this is still one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled. Let me just mention three of my all time favourite actors Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, and Joe Don Baker, and also a couple of actors who later became well know from their TV work: Wayne Rogers ('M.A.S.H.') and Ralph Waite ('The Waltons'). Then there's Dogboy (Anthony Zerbe) and Luke's mother Arletta (Jo Van Fleet)... I'd better stop before I type the names of the entire cast! This movie is just full of great acting, unforgettable sequences and quotable dialogue! I'm not saying 'Cool Hand Luke' is \"the greatest movie ever made\" but it's up there with any contender you care to name, and it could well be the most ENTERTAINING. I love this movie so much I find it hard to know what to say about it! I think I'll go and watch it again. And again and again and again...",

Paul Newman is so indescribably cool in this movie, so mysterious and rebellious, that his performance can and hopefully will inspire non-conformists for generations to come. Put simply, it does not age.  He's only a man, and can be beaten, but his spirit is never broken, and his focus never lost. As for the rest of the movie, from end to end it's nearly flawless. Arguably the best script ever written, amazing cinematography from Conrad Hall, and a solid supporting cast gives the viewer the feeling that this is the definitive rebel movie. Surrounded by inmates who have forgotten to think for themselves and believe in themselves, he gets the whole prison believing again. It seems as if the one thing those inmates needed was the hope for freedom, being stuck behind bars and fences can quickly kill a man's will. Luke enters, and is the embodiment of all these hopes, and revels in the trust and camaraderie he is given. If you have the time to be reading reviews about it, use your time wisely and go rent \u0091Cool Hand Luke' tonight, you'll be very happy with the outcome. Rating: 37/40",

In films, audiences have great respect for this individual who displays courage against a superior force. In this film, we get a first hand look at the Southern prison system otherwise known as 'The Chain Gang.' Although the system was deemed cruel, abusive and flagrantly torturous and eventually outlawed, it has returned. The movie is called \" Cool Hand Luke \" and stars one of the most beloved movie actors of all time. Paul Newman plays Luke, an unemployed, lack-luster ex-soldier who occasionally gets drunk, finds himself arrested, tried and imprisoned in a chain gang system. His crime? Malacious mischief. It earned him two years incarceration. Here Luke defiantly adapts to the 'Boss' system of authority. The cons he's imprisoned with are unimpressed with him until he fights the biggest and strongest to a admirable loss. There after, due to his motto, \" Sometimes nothing, can be a very Cool hand \" he is christened \" Cool Hand. \" The Warden of the prison seek to crush his independent spirit so when Luke's mother dies, he is unexpectedly placed into 'The Box'. Unfairly punished, Luke accepts the challenge and retaliates. There after it's a question of time before, Luke is beaten or he makes good his escape. A number of notable stars can be seen in featured parts who also make this film the Classic it has become. Men such as George Kennedy, Strother Martin as the Captain, Morgan Woodward, Luke Askew, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Roger, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite, and Anthony Zerbe are the strength of this very serious film. The question lingers, is it Luke or the Captain who is responsible for the remark, \"what we have here, is a failure to communicate.\" Is the law guilty of provocation when one is punished unjustly for a minor infraction? Only the audience knows. This movie is easily recommended to all Newman fans. ****",

Newman's easy smile is a perfect cover for what Luke's thinking or what he'll do next. He seems aimless in civilian life, having found no particular purpose. Mom (Van Fleet) appears not to have been much help, with issues of her own and two fatherless boys to raise. But in the work camp, Luke appears to find some purpose\u2014 that is, by not giving a darn. He gets beaten to a pulp by Dragline (Kennedy) but keeps coming back for more, then stuffs himself with 50 eggs and drags his belly around. He seems oblivious to pain, thereby becoming something of a \"cool hand\" to his fellow convicts.Now, with his new reputation, he's got a purpose just by being himself. So what if he keeps getting caught while escaping, it just adds to his status. Of course, the guards do eventually manage to break him\u2014but only temporarily. Then there's that last scene in the church, bringing him face to face with what he's sensed all along\u2014that it's an empty, purposeless universe, with the cops waiting outside. His only recourse now is to submit once more to capture and return to who knows what kind of punishment. So, standing by the window, he's become a lonely man in a lonely world. But at least he's managed, thanks to an enraged Dragline, to strip the mask (glasses) off prison brutality and become even cooler than before. Perhaps that's why he smiles at the end.Anyway, this is just my conjecture on one of filmdom's more elusive and interesting characters. For Newman, it's a perfect piece of casting.",

It is all too easy for them to quickly revere and rally around laid back Luke with close to no backstory or reason. As a character Luke is never fully explored nor is there any strong substance driving this story. Paul Newman is a great actor and icon but the film leaves a lot to be desired. You end up having 2 hours of film with no ground covered, great directors have done a lot with less.

It adds depth, not pretension.Director Stuart Rosenberg keeps the action moving.  The pace and overall construction of this movie could be a textbook for aspiring filmmakers. His work with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall on this movie is gorgeous. Watch this one on DVD in widescreen if you can.The great visuals are backed up by the music, especially the simple but versatile Lalo Schifrin theme, which is alternately melancholy, menacing, and ecstatic.This movie never gets old to me, and I've seen it many times.

But I don't know if I'm the only one, but whenever I hear Strother Martin's unique nasal voice delivering this line, I immediately complete it, with \"\u0085 some men you just can't reach\" And I think this part of the quote best defines Luke's character.\"Failure\" is a word I can't associate with Luke. He's not a loser, nor a winner; he wouldn't care about how you'd call him anyway. In fact, he cares for nothing, except for his mother, who dies early in the movie, as a God's will to kill the last meaningful thing still remaining in his life. With the death of Lucas' mother, begins the incessant cycle of escapes and returns that'll build Luke's legend. The Captain senses \"a failure to communicate\" where the other inmates, on the top of them, Dragline, superbly played by George Kennedy, see a man whose spirit can never been unchained. One inmate admits though he doesn't have Luke's guts, but not his chains' either.But ironically, these chains are Luke's freedom, because they're the most eloquent expression of Luke's personality. The more they unchain him, the more he rebels, the more he's loved, the more he makes himself less lovable. Chains and chants, their ticketing acts as a reminder of a useless presence, useless because Luke has basically no memory whatsoever, for his spirit never looks behind. Luke is one of the most detached cinematic characters ever, in a sort of nihilistic way, not suicidal, but masochistic with a reason. His pain is his freedom, when following the rules is the best way not to be hurt or to spend a night in the box. Luke doesn't want safety, nor security, he wants freedom. No rule to define him. Why? The point is not why, but why not.This \"why not?\" attitude is Luke's detachment, expressed through Paul Newman's beautiful blue eyes and boyish smile. This Iconic smile that freezes during the opening credits best defines the character. Even Dragline, his number one fan, informs the chain-gang, that Luke was smiling at his death. Luke's smile is his weapon, the true expression of his free spirit. No message, no ideal, he just believes in not being guided. God is his only master and only He knows where this is leading. Luke is not guided but inspires the gang against his will, he's almost a God-like figure at a point he even tries to make himself less sympathetic.But it's just as impossible to hate Luke, just like to 'get' him, in all the meaning of the words, and what to get anyway? Luke has nothing except himself to show, the rest is just a nickname won with a hand full of nothing, a fake photography, a constant disobedience to the rules and an impressive insistence to take the hits with never giving up. That's all? That's everything. It's all about moral resistance. As long as he has the legs and the heart to run, he runs, where to, who cares? Who cares? Why not? The eggs challenge is another illustration of this \"why not?\" attitude. He eats the eggs, he takes all the hits, all the challenges, all the shots.After he finishes the eggs, there is a symbolic Christ pose of Luke. He's a Christic figure with no message other than to free your spirit from meaningless rules, that nobody should decide for your fate. Basically, Luke's character is bigger than his ideal, and the failure to communicate is a moral victory, they can touch his body but never his spirit. Luke is a Christ in his martyrdom, he takes the hits, the humiliations, the punishments and harassments, but never gives up, he still wants to find the road, the meaning of all this. He doesn't know where to go, but he knows he must go. He's a prophet with no verbal message, but the message is there anyway. When Dragline declares, with his eyes full of love : \"Oh Luke. You wild, beautiful thing. You crazy handful' of nothing\" you can see eyes of love and fascination. The message is clear, because it's not expressed by words, but by a smile, and blue eyes so pure the rest would be hard to express, due to the eternal problem of communication. Whoelse than Paul Newman could have played such a charismatic character?Luke doesn't want to be followed, as he doesn't even know where his road will lead him. He believes in God, and believes God abandoned him, he addressed him during the climax wondering what the meaning of this is? We wonder too. What was wrong from the start? He was arrested for cutting heads of parking meters, how did this lead to such an extreme situation? Maybe because, he's an extreme character, a man whose eyes look at the future in such a proudly detached way, they can't admit to pretend. How ironic, that he's killed by the fearsome never talking Man-With-No-Eyes, the blind one, who killed Lucas, whose last look is not a smile, but a shock, as to implicitly beg God to forgive them, because they didn't know what they did.Luke's demise is his last victory because they killed but never reached him. The last shot in the cross-roads symbolizes this victory, as he still inspires the working chain-gang who'll believe that no chains are solid enough to stop them. Dragline, talks like Luke's apostle, reminding us of his legendary smile. The last shot with Luke and the two girls, whether it was a fake or not proves that whatever Luke's character communicated to the inmates, to us, he didn't fail.",

As we soon learn Luke had a history of sort of rebellions (Listen closely as the captain goes over Lukes file and amazed to learn that despite of being a war hero, Luke got out of the army in the same military rank he was first recruited - private. According to Luke he \"was just passing time\" and now Luke got himself 2 years in a tough southern prison for cutting off the parking meter heads or \"maliciously destroyed municipal property\". The movie has excellent dialogs delivered perfectly by the actors sometimes with sense of cynicism. Most notable scenes are the sexy blond (Lucille!!!) chick whose washing her car in order to arouse the poor prisoners (\"She knows exactly what she's doing, driving us nuts and loving every minute of it\"). another scene is the boiled eggs meal where Luke eats 50 eggs! this scene is priceless. the cast is top notch: Newman is perfectly suited to this kind of role and his acting is flawless. He really makes the character of Luke unforgettable. George Kennedy in his Oscar winning role as the prison's tough guy who befriends with Luke. also watch for a young Denis Hopper as one of the inmates. This movie is a prison drama at it's best. Don't miss this classic, it's a must see for anyone who consider himself a movie fan. Recommended 10/10",

For its day, Cool Hand Luke took plenty of risks in its depiction of the brutality of the southern-style work farm (an easier way to say Prison) and of a Chain Gang.All the men here are rough and tumble, save for Paul Newman's Luke, a loner who was sent there for \"busting the heads off of parking meters\" as he so eloquently puts it.  He is thrown into this pile of self-effacing, self-deprecating men with only his own standards and basic moral code to help him stay aloft, but of course they all want to break him and will use any means by which are available to them to do so.  In every prison film that you see, the man (or woman) in prison always believes that he (or she) doesn't belong there.  That is also true for Luke, however we never hear him utter one word of contempt towards his captors at all.  Instead he tries to show his fellow inmates and \"bosses\" the human side of a man.  But, when all hope appears to be gone, Luke attempts to do the next best thing.  I won't tell you what that is, you have to see the film for yourself to understand it.Cool Hand Luke was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Score) with George Kennedy winning Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of \"Dragline\", the self-appointed leader of the inmates who shows Luke a thing or two about life in captivity.My rating: 3 stars",

George Kennedy won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the role of a gregarious fellow prisoner. The rest of the cast is solid, including Strother Martin and Jo Van Fleet in small but memorable roles.The script was nominated for an Oscar and contains more depth than I had previously realized. There are allusions to Luke as a Christ-like figure which are subtle and thought-provoking. However, the script's greatest triumph may be that it effectively makes us root for this anti-hero despite the fact that he does little that is heroic in the usual sense.The direction by Stuart Rosenberg is well handled and, combined with the cinematography by Conrad Hall, gives the film an attractive yet authentic look. Also worth noting is the Lalo Schifrin score, which was nominated for an Oscar.Today this film is deservedly regarded as a classic; one which I recommend wholeheartedly. However, I would caution that it's probably best considered as a 'guy' movie, so I don't know if it will hold as much appeal for women.",

            "content": "Cool Hand Luke (1967) :\nBrief Review -A prison drama glorifying an Anti-hero where Paul Newman puts his Best. In 60s decade some anti hero films and criminal films came which tried to glorify the main characters even they were not such good souls and apparently those films were loved by Critics as well as audience. Cool Hand Luke is another chapter from the same book trying to glorify the free spirited and unplanned living soul. This is a story of Luke, a war veteran is sentenced to two years but his notorious nature doesn't let him conform. He has Nothing to beat someone else but he keep coming back and he grows as a popular fella in the gang. His several attempts to escape the jail, his thinking to look at life and the kind of impression he leaves on everyone is all about this storyline. This entire storyline is very funny, engaging and full of fun. Some hilarious scenes in the first half feel pleasant and different from previous films. The scene of a Sexy girl washing her Car and the scene of eating 50 eggs are very entertaining. Paul Newman plays Luke as if he was born to play this role. Such a brilliant performance he gave in the film that for me his performance is the best thing about this film. George Kennedy deserved the Oscar Award for his supporting role. Stuart Rosenberg kept the narrative interesting for 128 minutes which is quite impressive considering the anti hero theme. However, few scenes lacks conviction and even climax doesn't reach the high level. The problem is in the script actually so there is no one else to be blamed but the writer. If writing had something outstanding in the climax which could compile the basic theme and the characterisation then it would have been a better experience. In short, Cool Hand Luke is a Cool looking film for Cool minded people but nothing High Class stuff.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

In the case of Cool Hand Luke starring Paul Newman as Luke who is in a Louisiana state prison where the toughest prison guard on the planet is a guy named Society Red played by J. D. Cannon. Now Society Red wears these dark shaded sunglasses while watching over the chain gang working on the side roads during the hottest part of the day in his effort to show them he is in fact the \"boss man\".But there is one prisoner who just will not allow himself to be intimidated by Society Red and that prisoner is Luke who continues attempting to escape but always seems to get himself caught and punished for his effort. Now after each attempted escape Luke's hero character grows amongst the prison population especially with a lifer named Dragline played by the great character actor George Kennedy.The one scene that is forever embedded in my mind and is one of those scenes that has helped make me a huge fan of the film industry is when Dragline suggests to the rest of the prison population and to the prison guards that Cool Hand Luke is invincible and he just can't be broken no matter what punishment the guards exert on Luke. So a bet is made that seems impossible to win and a lot of money and cigarettes are bet against Cool Hand Luke. What is this bet? The bet is if Cool Hand Luke can eat fifty (50) hard boiled eggs in one sitting.I do not want to spoil the film and especially this one particular all time classic scene but I will say \"attention children: do not try this at home!\" This is a most memorable film and Paul Newman is the epitome of the character Cool Hand Luke. This film is rated as number 172 on the top 250 IMDb list and it deserves an even higher rating. I give the film a perfect 10 out of 10 rating.",

I was left completely disappointing. There is no reason for Paul Newman's character behavior. No motive whatsoever is provided, not even a hint of it. In any other movie, you would expect him to reveal himself as some \"badass\" and knock out those who threaten him. It doesn't happen here. He refuses to submit and keeps silent, gets punished, then refuses again (and keeps silent, of course), gets punished, all the way to the sad end (he dies if I remember correctly).Very disappointing and in my opinion a pointless movie.",

The best scene is probably where the prisoners play poker. Strother Martin's \"failure to communicate\" speech is a classic.My main criticism is the pace is extremely, painfully slow. There is a pattern of brutality we have to witness and the point is well made about what these men are subjected to but for a feature film this does not move or develop with any rhythm. Even a documentary on a chain gang would need to have more pace than this.The dialogue is so-so and a lot of the scenes are too pretentious and of their time. Not sure how the prisoners get instruments to play. Harry Dean Stanton is good.I dont consider this to be a top 200 film as it is rated here. I was quite surprised with how unmoving this picture was considering how highly it has been regarded, and how often it has been named.

            "content": "This film might be the definitive Paul Newman film. Cool Hand Luke (1967), is what it says it is, cool. His portrayal of Luke, in this film, is him at his best (although, he has many other films that could be the one). He is classified as someone, who has more guts than brains and that is how he plays the character. However, there is a shrewdness to him that makes him the fan favorite of the men around him. The tough part, is the fact, that all of this takes place in a mid-western prison. A desolate, hot, horrible place. He only has to serve two years, but his guts forgo his brains and it gets him into a lot of trouble throughout the film.His exploits eventually win over the other inmates he's with, to the point that, they begin looking at him, vicariously, like they want to be him. This grows into him taking on a messiah, of sorts, persona, among the other inmates. None of this is more evident until we see the famed \"50 egg\" scene. Without giving anything away, director Stuart Rosenberg, finishes this scene by positioning Newman in a perfect pose that strengthens the underlying feeling of a messiah complex. A persona that he is starting to make us believe too. Eventually, all this \"fun\" he is having in the prison, makes him want out. He begins, breaking out of the prison, testing the prison guards and the prison warden.The warden is just called Captain (Strother Martin). Strother Martin's Captain is a very interesting character. He is polite, but brutal, a man of authority, but creepy too. He is the man, who coins the famous line, \"we have a failure to communicate\". Communication, is one of his favorite things and he deals it out fairly sternly. If you mess up, you are in the hot box for a night. His right hand man, Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward), known as \"no eyes\", wears these mirrored shades, that director Rosenberg uses for cool camera shots, that reflect what is being seen in the scene, but there are no eyes to see what he is thinking or even looking at. A mysterious figure and a brutal one.The cast of inmates are a collection of future film and tv stars, just starting out in the 'biz. Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, Harry Dean Stanton and Joe Don Baker, just to name a few. But, leading the group is the legend, George Kennedy, as Luke's right-hand man, Dragline. Dragline is the catalyst for most of the problems Luke faces. Dragline is so over-inspired by Luke after their first major meeting, that he ends up being the one who exasperates the messiah situation. He pushes Luke to do the things he does. He is the one that creates the fantasy of Luke, the chosen one.Sit back and enjoy this film like a book. It rolls along like it is broken up into three parts. The film came out during the few years, right before the MPAA came out, so it tests these lines and delivers a modern approach to the life of a prison inmate, surviving in the sweltering mid-western heat. The film has a sense of brutality, but always delivers the feeling of comradery among the men in the prison. Newman and the rest of the cast completely lure us in and we are delivered a really cool dramatic look at what loss really is.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

Iconic moments include the egg eating bet (not sure why the director chose to leave the Christ on the Cross pose as the last image in this scene - I don't see Luke as Christ figure - although he has disciples and his NO. 37 are biblical references - Luke.37 )and the hot and sweaty scene stealing car-wash girl - again often copied ( One Night at McCools comes to mind) but again who remembers its origin.Cool Hand Luke is one of Newmans best parts - he gets to draw on a range of emotions - but as the film draws to a close i still see him as a loser not a rebel not a hero but a man out of time and out of options. A desperate man in need of something he can never find - happiness. When at one point he is visited in prison by his mother he his chided by her for once being 'sensible' and making them worry at his attempt at normalcy. It seems he tried to settle down but it just wasn't for him.Right from the outset we know Lukes destiny - he can't be seen to win but by being the anti-hero he brings a little hope to those he leaves behind.

I won't reveal the ending, but to get into what interests me about the movie I have to get into the plot and symbolism...This movie works on many levels.  On the surface it's about the harsh world inside a chain gang, made easier when Luke becomes a part of it.  The other members of the chain gang live vicariously through Luke, who, in his easy-going nature, represents an alternative focus for the chain gang. Luke wins his fights and poker hands with, as Dragline says, \"a whole lot of nothing.\"  That smiling, unassuming, unrelenting demeanor makes Luke a free-spirited hero to the prisoners.  Cool-Hand Luke plays against the wrathful hand of the warden, who sees Luke as a threat to his authority.Most people who talk about this movie stop here at these obvious themes of individualism and non-conformism, but there is heavy biblical symbolism all throughout the movie.  Luke represents Christ for the other chain gang members.  His loving easy-natured resistance to the anti-hero warden gives the chain-gangers a saviour to live through.  There is a lot of \"soul\" symbolism.  Note the number of eggs equates to the number of members of the chain gang.  Remember that Luke tells the other prisoners to \"stop feedin' off me,\" and in a subsequent scene the prisoners help him avoid punishment by actually eating off his plate.  There are numerous scenes with cross symbolism, my favorite being the position Luke is laying in after eating the eggs.I have read the book the movie was based on looking for the Christ symbolism, but it's not in the book.  The book was based on the writer's actual experiences and observations in a Florida chain gang.  The movie goes way beyond that and vastly improves on the book.  The direction was inspired (both ways).  If you watch this movie enough times you will begin to appreciate how little is wasted in it.  I personally find it easier to understand Christ's impact watching this movie than reading the bible.As for the performances in this movie, George Kennedy definitely deserved that Oscar, and Paul Newman was wonderful as the reluctant hero.",

Wow!This is a story set in the deep south and filmed in 1967.Aside from the acting and music, there are definitely some social issues in there but they are just in there, not put in there if you understand what I mean.",

            "content": "A motley crew of prisoners, living in a deep south prison dormitory with strict rules, and working on the roads 5 days a week, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a great character study of prisoners. Newman plays Luke, who is in for \"cutting heads off parking meters.\" During a poker game early in the film, when Luke wins the hand with 'nothing' but a good bluff, he says, \"Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.\" Thus the name of the movie.George Kennedy plays 'Dragline', the large, tough guy who can't read, and who befriends Luke after their fight. It appears that he simply has a lot of respect for Luke, who isn't intimidated by anything, even prison.  I just saw \"Chicken Run\", and Luke's approach is like \"Ginger's\" - escape, get caught, get thrown into solitary, then back to the prison yard, then escape again.The first escape, sawed a hole in the dorm floor and slipped out at night. The second, got permission to go behind a bush to relieve himself then ran for it. The third, after becoming totally 'compliant', he drives off in a state truck after retrieving the snapping turtle just shot by one of the guards. This film also coined the familiar phrase, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\", after Luke's second capture. Then , at the end, when they had him cornered for a third time, in the church doorway, he repeats the line to the cops, with a big grin, then he gets shot, and dies in the police car on the long ride back to the prison hospital.There is a short ending scene, the crew working near the church, and Dragline telling them that's where he and Luke got caught. Luke in his death became a legend to them, the prisoner who wouldn't accept his plight.The film also has lots of humor. During the first escape, the police car comes back, they solemly open the trunk, and pick up a lifeless bloodhound, \"run to death chasing Luke\" who still had not been caught. During a day digging roadside ditches, the prisoners are treated agonizingly to a cute blonde bimbo in a gauze dress washing her car right in front of them, praying that the one safety pin holding her dress over her busom would pop open. Then there was the bet that Luke couldn't eat 50 boiled eggs in one hour, including the second-by-second countdown with only one egg to go!\nIf I were rating this film in 1967 when it came out (and my college graduation year), I'd probably give it a 9 or 10. Today, comparing it to so many great films of the past 20 years or so, I rate it a solid \"8\" of 10. Paul Newman is such a good actor, you almost forget he is acting. The whole film reminded me also of the fairly recent \"Life\" with Eddie Murphy, a movie that also focuses on the lives of the prisoners in prison.",

            "content": "Paul Newman is \"Cool Hand Luke\" in this 1967 film that co-stars a lot of familiar faces: Strother Martin, George Kennedy, Wayne Rogers, J.D. Cannon and Ralph Waite. It also has a scene between Newman and one of my favorite actresses of all time: Jo Van Fleet, who gives another brilliant performance. Just watching these two on camera makes the film worthwhile.However, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is worthwhile for a lot more than that. It's the vintage Newman antihero, coming along during the era of protest and noncomformity. Luke is a man put on a prison chain gang for vandalizing parking meters. He wins the admiration of his fellow inmates with his refusal to conform to the rules.There are many famous scenes and lines, one of the most famous being when Luke casually announces that he can eat 50 eggs. Newman's take on this role is fantastic - he underplays, speaks with a measured tone of voice, betraying his emotions in his eyes and his bemused smile - but when he lets loose with the goods - look out! One of the most poignant scenes is Luke playing guitar and singing when he learns of his mother's death. Even when you want to cry, you can't help but smile and admire him - when he prays in the church, for instance, turns and sees Dragline, and yells up to God, \"THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?\" - you just know what's going to happen, what he'd rather do than go back to prison.In the fight scene, though his opponent, played by George Kennedy, tells him to stay down, Luke refuses and keeps getting up. So we know that even when he begs for mercy, even when we see him stay down, he won't really do it. It's not in his nature.It's hard to choose Newman's greatest performance because he's had so many. But George Kennedy was rarely given an opportunity as he was with the role of Dragline, and he delivers. It's his best work. Strother Martin is mean as dirt, and the rest of the inmates, several of whom went on to star on popular TV shows, are excellent.Fortunately, what we have here is NOT a failure to communicate.",

            "content": "Cool Hand Luke is a film adaptation of the novel by the same title written by Donn Pearce. Paul Newman plays the title character Lucas Jackson. We first meet the man as he drunkenly walks the streets cutting the heads off parking meters. The viewers get a sense of what kind of character Lucas Jackson is when the policemen approach him. When asked what he thinks he is doing, Newman has a huge smile on his face and simply replies \"Small town, not much to do in the evening.\" This little moment holds great meaning into who Lucas Jackson is. As the film progresses you get a sense of the lack of respect for authority that Luke has. His persona could easily be taken as the student in class that always causes trouble (that is to say if this were a high school movie and not a prison movie.) When Luke first arrives at the prison he is no more than new meat and someone new for the old guys to push around. Quickly, however, Luke climbs right up to the top and has his fellow prisoners conforming to how he acts and thinks within no time at all. Paul Newman really makes you believe who he is playing. It was once said about Newman that you could never come away from seeing a movie with him in it where you disliked him \u0096 this is no different. Even though a person would not want their child to hang out with someone such as Lucas Jackson, but you come away from Newman's performance loving him. Even after he runs away multiple times from the prison and is forced to dig and fill in a grave sized hole multiple times until he breaks down and begs for forgiveness from the guards. You can feel nothing but sorrow for the guy even though what he did was very outside of the law.",

Newman continually tries to escape, and fights \"sumbitch\" captain Strother Martin's attempts to \"break\" him. Finally, it appears Newman has succumbed to his captors, or has he? With so many classic sequences - a car wash with busty Joy Harmon (as \"Lucille\"), Newman's fist-fight with Mr. Kennedy, the laboring to Lalo Schifrin's \"Eyewitness News\" score, the egg-eating contest, and Newman's final walk with God - director Stuart Rosenberg, writer Donn Pearce, and adapter Frank Pierson deserve a lot more credit than received.It all ends up being another retelling of the Christ story, and it's definitely one of the better ones. Interestingly, the allegorical, unlikely-placed Jesus Christ stories that became so popular in the 1960s capture the spirit of the character (man, God\u0085 take your pick) better than the reverentially conventional epics remembered (but not exclusively) from the 1950s. \"Cool Hand Luke\" also connects its hero the then current counter-culture; and, this is what the film does extraordinarily well.

As a matter of fact, by the time it winds to a rather sad conclusion, the viewer feels as though he's been harshly imprisoned along with Luke.As the title character, PAUL NEWMAN gives what has to be one of his finest performances--full of cockiness, swagger, and the kind of macho stubborness that gets him in so much trouble in the first place. He clearly has an attitude problem that the guys in charge do their utmost to change--to no avail. His struggles to escape are met with defeat at every turn--but does he learn his lesson? Hell no.GEORGE KENNEDY's is the other great male performance, excellent as Dragline, who at first bullies Luke and then comes to respect him. The only female performance in the film (aside from the curvaceous car-wash gal) is JO VAN FLEET as Luke's mother who also has plenty of attitude and has only a couple of brief scenes that she makes the most of. She's almost playing the same character she did as James Dean's mom in EAST OF EDEN.But it's Newman's film all the way and he's brilliant as the self-absorbed n'er-do-well whose confrontational attitude with authority is the whole raison d'etre for the plot and his whole reason for ending up on a chain gang. There's a moral there, but I'm not quite sure what it is. Still, it's an engrossing film, both gritty and humorous and sometimes powerful.Summing up: Well worth seeing for Newman's greatest performance.",

            "review_title": "Luke: A Man Like No Other",
            "content": "I believe the key to understanding this movie is to see our life in the life of the prisoners. Like the prisoners we are made to do work against our will, we are made to live around certain people, and submit to unyielding authority. If there is a God, like the guards, he can only be distant, judgmental, and utterly unwilling to listen to us. Like the boss with the reflective sunglasses, we can only see ourselves and our inability to please God when we approach Him, while He always hits the mark perfectly in his own holy righteousness.Into this prison, into this all too familiar world, comes Luke, a man who's only crime is that he has never really been given a decent chance in life, a decent 'hand.' It is clear from the beginning that Luke is really innocent, essentially a good man who was never put in a position to succeed at life or find his purpose in life. This is proved by the fact that he won medals serving his country at war, but is never given credit for that service. It is striking that he explains that the chains of prison aren't medals but represent bad mistakes after his nephew asks why he isn't wearing chains. This innocence and respect for morality sets him apart from the other inmates from the start.There are several other strange and almost startling things about Luke. For one, though he knows what terrible hands he's been dealt, he fully uses that nothing hand, making it a 'cool' hand and smiling as if in spite of his own fate. And the truly miraculous result of this is that it works. Using nothing beside a courageous unwillingness to give in and a joy unspeakable Luke beats Dragline in a fistfight, wins a poker game, eats fifty eggs, and escapes prison three times. Through all this Luke teaches the others (and us) about real freedom, real hope, and real courage. Freedom that comes like a breathe of fresh air when you are least free, hope like a fiery lighthouse when things are most hopeless, and courage like a rock no matter how bad the odds. And how does he do this? Though the movie doesn't admit it, its obvious that the real key is humility, or as Luke puts it 'nothing.' Luke takes himself lightly and that is the secret to his success midst suffering. Life will always give us nothing, but humility will give us the power to both recognize and use that nothing to its full potential.It is clear that the presence of Luke both physically and in spirit (the magazine) is an enormous comfort and inspiration to the prisoners. But they take this for granted and bask in Luke's glory while continuing to let him suffer at the hands of the bosses. I may be misinterpreting Luke's character, but I think there is a real compassion in Luke for the inmates that transcends mere camaraderie, he is angry at them for 'feeding off him' because he sees them simply using his sense of freedom, hope, and courage instead developing their own, and not living out the sheer independence that he embodies and suffers for.But besides the story between Luke and the other inmates, there exists the story - or more accurately the battle - between Luke and the bosses. It is a battle that he fights on his own and that he freely admits that he lost. The bosses did break him as he fell into the grave he had dug himself, moaning his apology and declaring allegiance to the bosses and the God which he had once mocked. But that is not the end, if it were than we would be back where we started. In a prison with no respite from the powerful justice of authority. Luke rises again, he escapes, a final triumphant miracle.But Luke knows that life outside is little different from that within the prison, that no matter where he is he will be dealt his hand of nothing. He brings his conflict to the God the bosses finally forced him to believe in - he prays, asking in extreme humility what the purpose and meaning of his life is. The lack of response prompts Luke to reinforce what he'd always found true - 'he'd have to find his own way.' Or in other words, he'd have to be his own God. But God does answer. Dragline enters with the bosses right behind him. And that's when Luke realizes the purpose of his life, what he was meant for, and what he was meant to do. As a fellow prisoner he could never really help the others, but as a martyred hero he could inspire them to find their own hope, freedom, and courage through humility. And even more than that, work out a communication with the bosses that is no longer a failure,that there can be peace between inmates and the Captain, between us and God.This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think Dragline is the first to latch on to the lasting significance of what Luke did. It is Luke which gave him the opportunity to shatter the guard's mirror glasses so that he would no longer see himself in those judgmental lenses, but the eyes of the judge; and though it is physically impossible, I sincerely believe those eyes were actually the eyes of Luke, looking in defiant grace and mercy at Dragline. That is when he realized just how much Luke was indeed a world shaker - that he shook even the guards to the point of acceptance. That God at heart has the independent spirit of Luke. Or maybe that Luke was right when he called on God to find he was talking to himself. That may come as a shock, but no more shocking than a 2000-year-old carpenter who also shook the world.",

The captain of the chain gang(Strother Martin, superb) tries to tell the new men that he doesn't want any trouble, so he wont give any trouble. The overseer of the chain gang at work is called \"Boss\"(Morgan Woodward, memorable in his shaded sunglasses, and never says a word!) George Kennedy plays \"Dragline\", the veteran of the group who dislikes Luke at first, but later changes his mind when he sees how defiant Luke is, with his repeated escape attempts and eating 50 eggs. The captain is determined to break Luke, in order to make an example of him, and squash this \"cool hand\" talk.Fine character study with solid performances and an insightful script that deals with defiance of authority, and one's fate as a consequence, and whether such a thing is even wise in the circumstances. Luke is no saint, though sympathetic, and certainly no role model, which is the central point I think...",

            "content": "This movie is so full of symbolism and is a literary genius. Many people who watch this movie at face value simply seeing Luke as just some guy who went to prison (chain gang) and would not conform do not get this movie at all. I've read many comments on IMDb about this movie and even those who really liked it do not hint on the meaning of this movie. Luke goes to prison for a simple crime of destroying government property by cutting heads off of parking meters in a drunken stoop. He truly cares less about life in general demonstrated by what he did in the war. In the war he earns medals that he downplays which relates directly to the respect he earns of his fellow prisoners. If you saw this as some kind of male bonding movie, then you aren't looking far enough into it. Consider that Luke eats 50 eggs which represents the rebirth of the 50 prisoners there. Eating the eggs bloated him which is what a pregnant woman looks like. You see Luke laying on the table with both arms straight out and one leg folded over the other and he's wearing only white shorts. If you didn't get the Jesus Christ symbolism at that point, then you didn't get the movie. This is NOT male bonding. Luke is emulating Jesus Christ in a rough manner taking their pain into himself. He escaped 3 times not because the author wanted you to see him keep getting caught, but 3 is a prominent number in the bible. For those who questions him dying at the end, it's obvious he dies if you follow that symbolism. He died for them. This movie is such a literary genius that it almost upsets me to even hear it compared to the likes of The Shawshank Redemption, a movie I also like. It doesn't compare. It's unfortunate that so many people do not see the comparable difference of a great literary work to that of another great movie. While the Shawshank Redemption was entertaining, it doesn't have that deep literary content that fills Full Hand Luke. This is why you don't hear great quotes from it like you do Cool Hand Luke. Probably the greatest thing about Cool Hand Luke is we all can relate to wanting to be like that, but most people do not have the nerve to be that strong. That's what makes him different. All the religious symbolism only strengthens this movie into what I feel is the greatest movie ever produced.",

Newman's good friend Robert Redford was directed in another prison film in 1980 entitled 'Brubaker' by the same man who called the shots on 'Cool Hand Luke', Stuart Rosenberg.  Rosenberg's style is a heavy handed reflective symbol of the attitude of the 1960's when individuality began to stand out more and more among society's people and the rebellious attitudes demonstrated by the populous are illustrated by Newman's performance.George Kennedy's Oscar winning performance in the supporting role was a perfect blend with the rest of the players in the film.  A victim of the so-called Oscar curse, Kennedy didn't really do much after this film and that's a shame.One of the most important things that may be derived from this film is that its message is so simple that it may be overlooked, and that is that the punishment doesn't always fit the crime.",

There are so many examples Luke makes juxtaposed to what both experienced as teachers, miracle makers, and risk takers. Those who doubted lived vicariously through them.Luke is, because of is character, doomed to die from the beginning, never giving up trying to be free from the rural prison and it's brutal guardians. It is as if it was time he was put there for those who needed someone to taunt and scorn but trying to show others opportunities they could take if they chose.We get, in the initial scenes of the movie, how loved he is by his mother and an unspoken feeling by Luke of his feeling for her which is the same. He is searching for something and someone to believe in him. He has that in her but as the movie moves forward also in the inmates who follow him and his earthly exploits.He shows a miracle to his peers by eating 50 hard boiled eggs in an hour letting those who thought him a fool and those he impressed or thought he was just running on dumb luck and borrowed time increase their wealth by betting on whether he could perform this feat, especially Dragline, George Kennedy, his protector and ultimately Luke's Judas. It is not without forethought that this brilliant screenplay by Donn Pearce has him placed on his back in a crucified position after accomplishing his mission of eating all the eggs.When word gets to the prison that his mother is dead, Luke immediately mourns her with a song sung tenderly and quietly from his bunk about the \"plastic Jesus\" on the dashboard of is car. He is never the same after losing the one person who loved and his rock escaping from the road gang and prison at every opportunity. The risks he takes to remove himself from the rural prison and life itself are almost careless yet brilliant, the last successful attempt at escape driving away in one of the bosses trucks after taking the keys to the other two so they could not immediately chase him.A total failure to communicate his need to educate the men in the prison to \"stop feeding off of me\" and take their own risks with their consequences in this life which is an everyday risk is the message I am left with ringing in my ears after Luke is shot and carried away bloodied from the shot entering is body.The director, Stuart Rosenberg, and Pearce have given a clear message to all who view this classic. \"Down Here on the Ground\", (the main title song), live your life for yourself not through the beliefs, success or pain and loss of another.",

People say how the mid-60's movies are pretty bad, but this one just proves them that not all the movies in the mid-60's were terrible. My favourite actor is Paul Newman and he always pulls off a great performance. I'm not sure if George Kennedy deserved an Oscar for this, but I'm absolutely certain Paul Newman did (even though he didn't win it). Luke is one of the greatest characters of all time; he never gives up!! I love the scene where he eats 50 eggs in one hour, that was incredible, I can barely eat 2 eggs in one hour!! I'm a girl but that car wash scene was so funny and agonizing at the same time, I could feel their pain! Although I love the fact that Luke doesn't really seem affected by it.Another actor that did a superb job was Strother Martin delivering a merciless performance and I will never forget that famous line he spoke.Anyways if you take a look at this movie yourself, you'll understand why I love this movie; its a real \"Cool Hand\".",

This is symbolized greatly in 'Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on 'Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, 'shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

By the look of it, it was recorded some time in the last year. Great story which I thought I'd add here. George said that Joy was going to be brought in for a half a day of shooting by director Stuart Rosenberg. The male cast was given the half day off for this shooting and were told they would be called when the crew were done shooting with Joy.A half day turned into a full day, and the guys were not called to set. Then two, then three days, and the male actors did not get called. Rosenberg shot Joy washing that car for three days (although she had no dialog and was only on screen for under 80 seconds). Then the male actors were brought back to shoot their side of the scene. For their inspiration for this scene, Rosenberg brought in a teenage girl who just walked around the car wearing an overcoat.George said two things about this. First, it was the toughest acting he ever had to do. And second, somewhere out there is about 28,000 feet of unseen film footage of Joy Harmon washing a car.",

Watching this film got repetitive as we were bombarded with the same information over and over - the wardens are cruel, the labour is harsh and the inmates are really good men underneath it all. The technical aspects of this film were actually behind the times and felt disappointingly low-budget which was sometimes distracting. By the end, the film picks up pace and we are treated to more about Luke's backstory and escape attempts which makes up for the rest of the film's plodding timeline.

Newman plays the titular character beautifully and there's something infinitely satisfying about his drawling quips and his ever-present smirk. George Kennedy as Dragline, the leader of the prisoners, is also a fantastic role performance, for which he eventually earned an Academy Award. Deservedly, I would say.What is a bit peculiar about the film is the actual prison, or rather how it's showcased. Because to me this seems like a rather nice prison. Not to say that the Florida heat isn't shown as harsh. Not to say that the guards are not shown in an unfavourable light, once Luke earns their ire. Not to say that they're not serving way too long sentences for their offenses. But their actual day to day life. That's actually portrayed as rather idyllic. Honest work, plenty of food, long evenings playing cards and such.And this really wouldn't be such a problem, if I thought it was intentional.Nevertheless, Cool Hand Luke is not a bad way to spend a few hours.

The Christian imagery reflects director Stuart Rosenberg's sixties interpretation of Christ, one which is open to reflection. I also see parallels between Kafka's The Castle, in which the individual is squelched by faceless bureaucrats who fail to communicate. I was thinking about how I can integrate this classic into the business class I teach, which includes discussions of conformity and communication. Strother Martin's classic line can be integrated into a discussion of the importance of communication and its relevance to power and conformity. The ensemble cast blew me away. I spent several hours figuring out where I've seen the various actors before--Dean Stanton in Big Love, for instance. What a movie!

I'm just trying to talk it down a bit so you won't get your expectations up to an impossible level.Paul Newman plays his part marvelously, and although it's a simple role, he fills it more than adequately. Essentially, he is Luke and probably had no problems filling the role. Another good acting job comes from George Kennedy, who plays Dragline, the most prevalent supporting character and leader of the prisoners before Luke's arrival. He nailed the Cajun accent for the most part and that is no easy task for anyone outside of Louisiana. And although the prison setting and filler characters are for the most part, not realistic, I enjoyed watching Kennedy interact with Luke. Another enjoyable character is the lead guard, a man who always wears aviator sunglasses and never speaks.Basically Luke has never been one to follow the rules, and never will be. This attitude has the ability to inspire and enlighten. That's the jist of the story.My main qualm with the film is the fact that it's somewhat repetitive. It could've been shortened considerably if certain events happened only once. I won't say what these events are, but after the second time I was getting a little annoyed. Another qualm I have is the ending, while good, I feel it could have been better. That is simply my opinion.All in all a really good film but not a great one, and a little overrated, but don't let that stop you. This could end up being one of your all time favorites. 8/10",

There is unquestionably so.The clarion example, of course, is the Crucifixion-like posturing of Luke following his eating the 50 eggs. The movie ends, interestingly, in a church. Prior to entering the church one sees 2 crosses (one on the steeple of the church; the other formed by a utility pole). Two crosses obviously leaves something missing. Where is the third cross from the Crucifixion of Christ? Well it is found in one of two possible places, one is following Luke's prayer in the church, he then folds his arms in a cross-like manner. The other possible cross citing is in the final scene of the movie as the camera pans out the crossroads forms an obvious cross\u0097this is not coincidental.Is it coincidental that Luke escapes THREE times vis-\u00e0-vis the Trinity? Is it coincidental that Luke is assigned the prison numeral 37? From that, one is invited to explore what is the Bible's wording of Luke 3:7. It is of interest that Luke 3:7 contains \"\u0085flee from the wrath to come?\" Then of course there is the request from Luke to God to \"just show me a sign, love me, hate me, kill me, just let me know you're there\" Of course in the following scene, Luke gets his sign\u0097the notice of the death of his mom.This film is deeper than it can be perceived.",

            "content": "I have watched a lot of movies over the course of a short lifetime. If I were to take all the movies I have watched and approximated their running time at about 100 minutes, I would be looking at about three years worth of movie watching at least. And that's just from watching each of them once. I've become accustomed to movies and what they do, how the stories and characters are formed, how the cinematography relates to the sights, sounds and lighting etc. and while I won't be presumptuous enough to say I know everything about film, I have become harder to surprise and even harder to please.It certainly becomes harder to surprise second or third viewing let alone multiple times. Yet sitting down to refresh my memory of Cool Hand Luke (1967), I was actually astounded by the intricacies of the story that I have previously overlooked. I have always believed it was an inspiring movie; an entertaining movie and the gold standard for prison-themed films. Now not only do I believe it is all those things, it is also one of the best religious allegories in American cinema.For the benefit of those who have not seen Cool Hand Luke I will summarize the plot. Luke (Paul Newman) is a former war hero turned drunken vagrant who is arrested for taking the heads off of parking meters. He's taken to a work-camp where he slowly by surely wins the respect of the prisoners to the chagrin of the warden and prison guards.The character of Luke is meant to exemplify the words, body and mind of Jesus Christ. His name Luke is taken from the New Testament; one of the Gospels about the life of Jesus and one that most characterizes the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth. The book of Luke is also the only book that covers the parables of the good Samaritan, the prodigal son, and the unjust steward. A story about an undesirable person helping and gaining the respect of another, the story of a son who finds redemption and finally a parable about a man being dishonest for a greater good.Each parable represents a part of Luke. He gains the respect of the other undesirables in the prison by sacrificing his pride during a boxing match with Dragline (George Kennedy). Outmatched by the larger, stronger Dragline, he stays standing. Later during a poker game he gains the respect of the others including Dragline by bluffing in a hand holding absolutely nothing of value. He comment; \"Sometimes nothing can be a very cool hand.\" Thus his name.In the middle of the movie, Luke's mother Arletta and his distant but above board brother John come to visit. John is coincidently the name of another New Testament writer. While he never speaks to Luke, he does seem to fit the description of a doting son by toting his mother around. Arletta bemoans her role in Luke's hardships while all but admitting he is the favorite of the two; the prodigal son.After her death, Luke is unjustly forced into the prison hotbox for a night. It is from that point on Luke starts to disobey and attempts his escapes. While Luke 16:1-13 is mostly about mammon and avarice, It still relates. For those unfamiliar with the verse, a disobeying steward forgives the debts of his debtors without his permission. \"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\" If interpreted more liberally, the parable is an endorsement of disobeying unjust masters. In this case of Cool Hand Luke, the warden and guards are the masters and Luke is the unjust steward.In addition to the parables, Luke does other things to exemplify the life and times of Jesus. There is a scene where Luke challenges himself to eat 50 hardboiled eggs at a time. When asked why 50, Luke replies \"Seemed like a good round number.\" It is also the same number of prisoners in the camp. The scene can be interpreted as Luke symbolically consuming the sins of the men. There is another scene where Luke goads the prisoners to shovel seed on a tarred road; a reminder of Luke 8:1-15, the parable of the sower. Finally, Luke speaks to God, referencing him as \"old man,\" much like a son would address a father.Now I'm not a religious person, nor am I deranged enough to think this is all one big conspiracy, but I can appreciate the universality of the many stories imbedded in religious literature. Even if the religious symbolism of Cool Hand Luke is coincidental, the prevalence of religiosity in our culture must have had an influence on the filmmakers. The writer of the novel Donn Pearce was himself an inmate of the Florida Department of Corrections and when he wasn't digging ditches he may-well have been reading biblical passages.The famous line \"what we have here is a problem to communicate.\" comes from the movie Cool Hand Luke. In many ways this film has struggled for years to communicate with me. It is only now that I can appreciate the symbolism, the beauty and the elegance of Cool Hand Luke. Here's to hoping you can appreciate it too.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

This creates problems with the prison administrator represented by The Captain (Strother Martin) and the various \"Bosses\" that control prison life, including Walking Boss (Morgan Woodward) and Boss Paul (Luke Askew). For a time, this also creates conflict with the other 49 prisoners since his approach challenges the leadership structure among the prisoners, especially with Dragline (George Kennedy), but including \"Society Red\" (J. D. Cannon), Koko (Lou Antonio), Babalugats (Dennis Hooper), and Gambler (Wayne Rogers). However, his doggedness in a losing fight wins the prisoners over.Luke gets along until his mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), dies soon after her only visit to him. The Captain punishes Luke by placing him in \"The Box\" to prevent escape to attend his mother's funeral. This injustice changes Luke, and the remainder of the movie covers his three escape attempts, climaxing in a final confrontation in an old church in a nearby town.The movie includes one of those lines that any movie-goer knows--\"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" George Kennedy won Best Supporting Actor for his role. Paul Newman was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Rod Steiger for \"In the Heat of the Night.\"This is really a Paul Newman vehicle. His blue eyes, enigmatic Mona Lisa smile, and anti-establishment persona shape Luke as he passes through doomed escape after doomed escape and makes it work. His character also has a couple of questioning one-way conversations with God, ruminating on his poor lot in life, though clearly, his own decisions were a factor.I'm not sure the film works as well in 2022 as it did in the late 1960s, but it's still worth a viewing.",

If you \"Stay Down!\" then you can eke out an existence, but you become a 'leech' rather than a solid example of humanity.The price for cementing your own presence saps your energy just as crucially, though, if less tangibly...Paul Newman is perfect for a role like this; because he seems to be the bearer of such a quiet dignity as a man anyway, let alone an actor. We're left to ponder whether it is in fact PRISON life which has imbued this kind of grace and dignity within Luke. He arrived there for some trivial misdemeanour, but in his current environment, even trivial undertakings eventually take on an extra symbolism all of their own. Things MATTER more, and how you approach them matters greatly, also. What exactly would such a man amount to in the open world, without the influence of oppressive and restrictive forces?Is the way to survive an institution to draw strength from others and yet not allow to be drawn from oneself? These are complex questions deriving from a basic theme; but there is a far simpler slogan that can become a 'byword' for handling your troubles...Luke would doubtless not be presumptuous enough to push it forward using the unwelcome 'leader' status he attains, but it goes thus: 'Know your limits, keep within yourself, and above all, be cool!' 10/10.",

The thing Andy Dufresne and Luke have in common is that they both are gutsy and stubborn fellows. But, unlike Mr Dufresne, Luke doesn't seem to have much wits.Now, the whole fifty years after the film's been released, it's really hard to tell why it's become such a cult classic. I guess it was once a very relevant representation of the people's dream of a wayward hero. A person men would secretly envy and women would openly worship. But these fifty years had certainly changed our world, just like they have changed us. And if back in 1967 we'd probably have been captivated by the reckless stubbornness of a person put in constraining, albeit still very mild, conditions, and if in 1994 we'd be swept away by an everlasting will of a person who believes that no prison, however harsh, is worth giving up on remaining a human being, then today's hero would probably try to avoid the jail's heat at all.Having said that, I really don't think that Cool Hand Luke is still able to uphold its former status. It's by no means a bad film. On the contrary, it's a fine piece of cinema. But definitely not thanks to the rebel spirit it was once meant to convey. Just like a 20 year old hotshot people once admired for his daring and bravery, who in fifty years becomes a tiny and quiet white-haired old man kids like to play around, this film is appealing not because it's bold - but because it shows the precious naivety of the old ways, when prison was almost as liberal as the army, while twice as fun, and when people with guns were still soft on the people in chains. Back then, this story could have been about one person's victory over the cold system. But today, it's more like a showcase of one dumb idiot who couldn't simply enjoy the life he was given. Which, considering the modern day hardships, both inside and outside the prison walls, is not heroic but rather plain stupid.",

At first Luke is not very welcomed by the other inmates however that changes once they see what he's made of. Luke continues to rebel against authority and repeatedly tries to escape. He also gains the inmates respect and admiration with his antics and unbreakable will. The plot is realistic, clever, funny, violent, ingenious, captivating and has a cathartic ending. The character Luke remains an icon to rebels everywhere. There are so many memorable scenes in this film. My favorite is the egg bet which challenges Luke to eat 50 hard boiled eggs in one hour. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote famous lines such as, \" What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach\".

            "content": "What I admire greatly in pictures like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is how they merely place their settings in a conformity-based location such as a prison but instead focus on themes of nonconformity and rebelling against what may be a not-so-perfect system. For the same reasons, I really enjoyed \"Cool Hand Luke\" a 1967 Paul Newman classic based on a book by Donn Pearce. Author Mr. Pearce based the novel on his own experiences as a chain-gang prisoner.The protagonist, somewhat based on the author of the book, is a war veteran-turned-vandal named Luke (Paul Newman), who is sent to work hard labor a rural prison for cutting the heads off of parking meters. Luke is informed by the steel-faced guards and captain (Strother Martin) of all his expectations and the rules he must follow. But after conforming to these guidelines for a while, he begins to rebel against the system, and inspires several of his fellow inmates to do the same.I think one of the reasons why people tend to avoid movies about people in prison is because when one tends to think of a \"prison picture\" they imagine a dirty, sickening, and unhappy experience. Maybe a realistic one, but depressing. That's not what movies like \"Cool Hand Luke\" is about. The prison is nothing more than the setting. What this movie is about is nonconformity. I sure hope it does not inspire real-life prisoners to rebel against the systems of our correction facilities, but that it will get lawful folks to take nonviolent action against systems that do not work. Like Luke himself. Luke does not club a guard over a head or hurt or kill anybody; he's still transgressing against the rules and trying to inspire change. And admit it, if you knew a man who could shove fifty hard-boiled eggs down his throat one after another in an hour, you would have some great level of admiration, too.\"Cool Hand Luke\" does a fantastic job of telling a great story. First it starts off introducing the protagonist (and audience) to a routine. Once he (and we) adjust, then it starts to give notes of inspiration and then it takes those inspirations to the next level. What's also very good is the way the film tends to sort of switch protagonists midway. At first, we follow Luke as he adjusts to rural prison life and then starts to rebel. When he does, we switch over to George Kennedy and other inmates. And we watch from their point-of-view as Luke begins a sort of self-sacrifice, like the crucifixion of Jesus as the movie continually parallels. The fact that these characters are so wonderfully-written with such memorable, and yet natural dialogue, and well-portrayed by Paul Newman and the cast enforces our interest in the outcome, which is notably affecting.Now there are some problems with the picture, however, they are sporadic. They all tend to revolve around the direction by Stuart Rosenberg. I must confess I am not particularly affected by his style. Two core moments in the movie are almost rendered static by hampering long takes that would seem lifeless if Paul Newman were not such a great actor. Rosenberg is clearly also a director willing to experiment and while I appreciate that, sometimes, I think, as he may have discovered, his experiments don't always work out. But he knows how to make a good picture, and most the time he does a good job setting up his camera.Despite some uneven directing, \"Cool Hand Luke\" has deservedly gone on to become a classic. I can't sincerely throw my fullest support behind director Stuart Rosenberg, but I can for the screenwriters Doon Pearce and Frank Pierson for their dialogue, characters, and themes. I must also commend the actors, who are indelible in their roles. Newman and Kennedy (who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor the following year) are fantastic, as are J.D. Cannon, Strother Martin, Jo Van Fleet, Clifton James, and Morgan Woodman.\"What we've got here is failure to communicate.\" - Paul Newman as Luke",

            "content": "With Stuart Rosenberg's COOL HAND Luke in 1967, Paul Newman completed a series of five films, including THE HUSTLER(1961) by Robert Rossen, in which he provided audiences with an extraordinary hero/anti-hero unparalleled (bar Marlon Brando) in cinema history. As Luke, the former war hero turned social misfit imprisoned for chopping the heads off parking meters despite claims he has \"a score to settle\", Newman gives a striking and unforgettable image of a man that just won't lie down, no matter what treatment he endures. Whether it be the seemingly endless torture by the guards, treating him as a dog in order to discipline him after his second escape attempt, or the stomach-churning scene in which he upholds his bet to eat 50 eggs in the space of one hour, Luke always proves his doubters wrong and grows to become a hero for the others prisoners. His bravery, \"more guts than brains\" as states the incarcerated lawyer, and downright stubbornness leads all the others, even the ultimately naive tough guy Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar winning role), to silently worship him as their hero...the guy standing up for the things their cowardice won't allow them too. Newman's role became iconic, and this is down to some legendary scenes that have turned this movie into an all-time great. For instance, the Saturday afternoon fight scene with Dragline, in which Luke just won't \"stay down\" despite the barrage of punches coming his way, concluded by him muttering: \"to keep me down, you gonna have to kill me!\". Or the scene where Luke is able to push the other members of the chain gang to work at twice the speed, thus giving them more free-time and puzzling the guards. The film is also filled with memorable one-liners, such as: \"What we have here, is failure to communicate.\" This in a way sums up the entire film, Luke is a rebel, someone who won't be repressed by the rules set down, whether it be those of the guards or of his inmates. His incarceration is due to his nonacceptance of the rules set down in the outside world, his reason for his crime being that it was \"a small town, not much to do in the evening\". But the world to which he is introduced represents many more \"limits\" which, every time he breaks, imposes increased and harsher punishment. He pushes the Captain, played with a peaceful but easily ignited rage by Strother Martin, into demonstrating to the full extent his \"mean son-of-a-bitch\" side, whose wrath parallels Luke's vision of the \"Old Man\" up above who sees him solely as a \"hard case\".As he says, \"You've got to admit, You ain't dealt me no cards in a long time\". The spectator may or may not like his character, but what's sure is that definitely dosen't give a damn whether we do or don't. And that's what makes COOL HAND Luke such a powerful movie.\"You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice you got yourself two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set, 'cause you gonna get your mind right\", the other characters, the other members of society are doomed never to comprehend him, leading to his actions being completely unpredictable. But as he says himself, \"I never made a plan in my life\". The movie may not be beautifully filmed or as exciting as other prison escape movies such as Steve McQueen's THE GREAT ESCAPE and PAPILLON, but that is not its point. COOL HAND Luke represents a cultural and historical milestone, with Newman's performance up their with the very, very best. 18/20",

Director Stuart Rosenberg would go on to direct Newman in a couple more movies had just made the leap from television director to the big screen with Cool Hand Luke as his first theatrical feature. Rosenberg would enjoy continued success with Brubaker, The Drowing Pool, the April Fools and The Amityville Horror. Kennedy won the Supporting Actor Oscar but more people probably remember the remarkable performance by Strother Martin. Cast members also include Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne rogers, Ralph Waite and Joe Donn Baker. Cool Hand Luke thumbs it's nose at conformity, establishment and oppression which made it very popular in 1967 with audiences. I'm generally not a big fan of prison movies but I would give this an 8.0 out of 10.",

            "content": "For all you non conformists out there, take a look at this little film. I think you might enjoy it. In it, Paul Newman plays the epitome of rebellious and non conformist, Luke. Luke is serving two years in a rural prison on a chain gang and he absolutely refuses to conform to the prison way of life. The other prisoners admire him for his gustiness and his smooth coolness, hence the title of the film, and the audience admires him in much the same way. At least I did. He has got a lot of spirit, attitude, and life in him to make him an extremely likable screen character. It also helps that he is Paul Newman.This film is an excellent insight into chain gang life. It conveys a perfect mixture of laid back ease as the prisoners go about their day to day work. There are a lot of fun moments that give the film a very cool and easy going feel, but then other moments appear out of nowhere that change the tone of the film instantaneously. Reality bites back hard in this when just as things start to look up, the harsh reality that this is still prison life comes down hard on Luke and his friends. Luke tries multiple times to escape and every time he is caught and brought back to the prison. There, the prison staff have no choice but to break his spirit any way they can so he won't try to escape again. This is where the film becomes its harshest, but also its most compelling. The film flows very nicely and is a slow crescendo to the riveting end.Perhaps one of the best things about Cool Hand Luke is its great effect as a character study. Paul Newman plays Luke extremely well and keeps him a steady hero to the audience as we root for him during anything he does. But what is also very interesting about his character is the relationships he builds with the other prisoners and how they morph and change throughout the film. George Kennedy plays Dragline, a fast talking rough and tough prisoner who Luke grows closest to. Their relationship is very compelling and developed incredibly well. Dragline, along with the rest of the prisoners, idolize Luke for his spirit and determination to escape, and seeing how this admiration develops on both sides of the equation is very interesting. As Luke grows more and more discouraged his adherence to the admiration dwindles until he is tired of it, making for some very interesting confrontations. The film is a very well rounded and interesting character study from start to finish.Cool Hand Luke is indeed a classic that will be remembered forever and revered as one of Paul Newman's finest roles. It is a very interesting look into chain gang life and the minds of those who work endlessly on the chain. It reflects a golden age of cinema and exemplifies what good filmmaking is all about. There's no BS here. Cool Hand Luke is a very well made film.",

I can see why his fellow prisoners seeing Luke as cool and aspire to be like and admire him. Newman does give a solid, interesting and enjoyable performance. I think Kennedy creates an equally important and realistic character as Luke's lead admirer type and champion, equal in importance to the story as Luke's character. Is Luke really a wronged, non-conformist hero to be admired and someone others can learn from about how to go through life? Absolutely not. However, he and Kennedy do represent two of life's types, and even though this film is not the great film some espouse it is still worth checking out.",

Nearly the whole film is played in a prison in a rural area, where the prisoners have their ways of living, and obviously a kind of boss among them (Dragline= George Kennedy), but once Luke is placed in prison, his way of resisting anything around him attracted the sympathy from many of his colleagues. He was never afraid of anything, he did not know why he was living in this life, and he had serious doubt about the existence of God. Probably he had a heavy childhood although he loved his mother very seriously. Prison in many parts of the world, not to say everywhere, instead of being a place for educating persons, it is just a place for punishment without any mercy. Many of the prisoners due to this was of living normally become more dangerous than in the past. This film shows an injustice, Luke's mother died, and the bosses of the prison put Luke in a hole just to avoid him to escape, So where is the logic? the man did not do anything wrong and is punished. Obviously, Luke became a hard rebel and escaped anytime he could. At the end of the film, there is an interesting scene when he tried to talk with God, whom he called the Old man. God did not reply to any of his questions, and suddenly a bullet reached him and is killed.",

            "content": "COOL HAND Luke is a crime drama film. This film is a very powerful representation of brutality and sadism on one side and a rebellious indifference on the other. The main protagonist tries to find sense in cruel conditions in a prison thanks to his ingenuity, charm, humor and firm attitudes. This leads to unnecessary idolization, which gets a tragic epilogue. It is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel of the same name.Luke Jackson is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. The chain gang is run by a stern warden, the Captain, and a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey, whose eyes are always covered by a pair of mirrored sunglasses. Luke refuses to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader Dragline. When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Although Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent, he refuses to acquiesce. However, Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. After news of his mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison punishment box. After that, he begins to plan his escape...This is a story about a lonely man who hides certain doses of his defiance and scorn under his own mask of sarcasm. That man accepts his current life situation, but in spite of that he wants to consolidate his beliefs. However, his expression, in prison conditions, becomes a symbol of rebellion. He becomes a symbol of mutiny on one side and the subject of beating and torture on other. Such conditions destroy pride and will for life, however, a firm belief remains untouched in this case. This is the irony of this movie. An excellent characterization very well corresponds to a melancholic mood in this film.Paul Newman as Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson has offered a top performance as a loner who looking for his lifestyle. His unbridled nature and alienation are in reverse contrast to his actions. Simply, he is a positive character, while fate is playing with him. George Kennedy as Dragline is a pragmatic man who has found his own passion in the actions of his friend. A friendly, almost fraternal, mood has enriched his character. Strother Martin (the Captain) and Morgan Woodward (Boss Godfrey) are a personification of brutality and torture. Jo Van Fleet, as Luke's mother, shows, in a certain way, his emotional loneliness.This is a realistic and very convincing experience.",

The prison warden, known as Captain (Stother Martin), reads from Luke's records that the new prisoner is a war hero with no prior arrests, making him an outsider among outsiders. But even if he had more in common with the other prisoners, Luke's style is to maintain his individuality rather than to try to fit in. Showing no signs of fear or of quitting whether he goes up against other inmates, the bosses or even inner conflicts, Luke is most inspirational when he is at odds with the working order. He consistently chooses the hard road, taking knockout blows again and again in a fistfight with the much bigger Dragline instead of accepting defeat by simply staying down.

The story is timeless, incredibly powerful and ultimately uplifting and the cast does a great job at putting it all together. Most impressive, of course, is Paul Newman who gives a very likable, well-rounded performance that exceeded my high expectations that I had built up. I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture.The most interesting aspect of the film for me was the metaphor for the life of Christ that was displayed throughout. At the beginning of the film we see Luke engage in a boxing match where he is badly beaten, but he refuses to lay down and give up. As a result of this, his fellow prisoners in the camp become his followers. They praise him and look towards him as a leader for the rest of the film. He leads them up against the guards; not in an act of rebellion in order to overthrow the camp, but rebellion just for the sake of rebellion. Luke doesn't ever ask to become the leader of this group or to be anything more than himself. He just does things in order to pass the time, in order to entertain himself, and as a result everyone else in the camp projects these Christ-like qualities upon him. The film itself makes direct references to him being a religious symbol; his camp number 37, is a reference to the bible and after the scene where he eats fifty eggs he lays on the table in the form of a crucifix. Most interesting for me, though, was the story of his resurrection. After his second botched escape attempt, he comes back and the guards begin to beat him over and over again. They torture him for no reason other than to break him and when they finally do, they push him down into his grave, literally. But then the warden, as god, lifts him back up out of the grave and puts him back into the camp. His fellow prisoners think he is broken and that he has abandoned them, but instead he rises back up and escapes once again. I'm not a religious man by any means, but the metaphor for Luke as Christ throughout was something that I found very intriguing.The ending itself was great. Luke was finally killed but the impact of his life lived on through Dragline. The most powerful moment of the film for me was when he rose up and attacked the man with no eyes, who had served as this haunting figure looming over the prisoners for the entire film. Seeing those ominous get crushed under the tire was such a powerful anti-establishment statement. The final montage of Newman's beautiful smile could have come across as overly sentimental, but instead further served the uplifting message that the film carries all the way through. A great story highlighted by a sensational performance.",

He is a very versatile and impressive.  But, believe it or not, Newman isn't the highlight of this film.  Kennedy steals the show as Dragline, the dim-witted but honest, good heated and tough leader of the inmates.  He starts off intimidating Luke, but as the movie goes on he grows to appreciate and love Luke, and even becomes his partner in an excitingly fun escape scene.Watching the progression of Newman and Kennedy's characters is highly entertaining, a must-see for all who like good cinema.8.5/10",

            "content": "I'm not very old. I grew up in the Nineties, not the Sixties; \"Cool Hand Luke\" had been out for nearly three decades by the time I saw it. And man, oh, man, is it a powerful film. I recently revisited it, as much for kicks as anything else, and I was surprised at how much I had missed when I first saw it. This film is heralded as a nonconformist film and a social commentary. Well, it may be a social commentary, but calling it a nonconformist film is like calling the Hope Diamond just a gem. It is so much more. Luke is a stubborn guy, and when he's shot at the end, it's affecting. But Luke isn't the type of guy who is stubborn to be a nuisance, it's just how he is; he can't help it. He became a hero to the men, compromising their own dreams of freedom just to get a glimpse of Luke's, but he never chose to be. He partakes in horrible acts of self-destruction, like eating fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour or boxing against the makeshift leader of the men, and his does so willingly, until he's battered and broken beyond repair. The film is about what it takes to break a man. The psychological and physical torture put upon him by the guards cause him to question himself, and then God for having made him as he is. When he runs to an old church and asks God what to do with the hand he's been dealt is a haunting and indelible piece of cinema, from his soliloquy to his death. It's unforgettable. George Kennedy plays the leader of the prisoners, and a friend of Luke's. His character is deep and complex, not as strong as he lets on, nor does he understand Luke, but he is a wonderful character and a good man. This film is more bleak than other social commentaries, like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" a decade later, but Paul Newman as Luke is a more likable, sympathetic character in a significantly worse situation. Nobody else could have pulled off a role like Luke.",

There are some things that I don't liked about it, the studio kind of lightning for example, is way too obvious in supposedly external sets, what makes the things a bit weird. The ending is not fully satisfactory either, in my opinion.The most interesting thing about this film is how it depicts the situations. There is an irony in every event in entire film. The reason of why Luke was arrested, as main example. A critique to the judiciary system. There is also some interesting philosophical questions risen. A man can really change his 'personality'? A theme that was explored better in the excellent A Clockwork Orange(Stanley Kubrick, 1971) but both films are worth anyway. You can't go wrong.Recommended. 8.3/10",

This is not to demean the other actors in the film who all give good performances and the writing and screenplay are also good, but I doubt if the film would have been anywhere near the cult classic it has become without Paul Newman in the lead role. He is the ultimate anti-hero. He does not seek the attention and the adulation but cannot help but receive it. His role is one of passive rebellion right until the end. He accepts his fate at the end and becomes an inspiration and a myth to the other prisoners who do not have the strength to emulate him. Even though he dies at the end this is a feel good movie. It leaves you uplifted, but not in the crude way today's films often do it is a very subtle film. Paul Newman is that rare thing a true film star who can truly act.",

Nevertheless it's hard not to enjoy Paul Newman's upbeat attitude and his performance as Luke brings a strong level of character and charm, regardless of the many situations and flaws he brings upon himself.Final Verdict: Considering its age, it still holds up well enough to entertain.

            "content": "Although in this age of \"director's cuts,\" it's not as true as it once was, one of the most appealing aspects of film is that it is unchanging.  The \"Cool Hand Luke\" that I recently saw on video is, with the exception of the widescreen aspect ratio that was lost in the panning and scanning, the same movie I saw several times in theaters in the late 1960s.  I, however, have changed, and see things in \"Cool Hand Luke\" that I hadn't noticed before.What really stands out are the allusions to Jesus Christ.  Ol' Luke, the decorated war veteran who never rose above the rank of private and is now serving a two year sentence on a Southern chain gang, is apparently meant by director Stuart Rosenberg to be a Christ figure.  After the contest in which Luke downs 50 hard-boiled eggs, he is photographed lying on his back on the table, his legs outstretched and legs crossed in such a way as to suggest the way Jesus is depicted on the crucifix.  Later, Luke moans his way through the song \"Plastic Jesus\" while accompanying himself on the banjo. At the end, the photo of Luke with two beautiful women that his fellow cons ripped in half after learning it was a fake, is shown taped back together and superimposed over an intersection in the road--a cross.  I assume that the repaired photo is meant to suggest a resurrection in the sense that the cons believe in him once more.  \"Luke is detached and indifferent,\" Paul Newman is quoted as saying on the back cover of the video, \"but he can't beat the system he scoffs at.\"  Perhaps the religious symbolism in the film is meant to suggest that Luke, though providing his fellow cons with a vicarious taste of freedom through his repeated escapes, is no savior at all.  He is merely a \"plastic Jesus\" just like the one in the song.Whatever the imagery is meant to suggest, \"Cool Hand Luke\" remains an excellent and thoroughly satisfying film.  Paul Newman's performance is one of his best, and the rest of the cast (including such then obscure actors like Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper, and Harry Dean Stanton) is excellent.  And let's not forget that terrific score by Lalo Schifren.",

The other interesting thing about this movie, is the most memorable scene with the hot blonde woman played by Joy Harmon...in my memory, she really grinds herself into that car's window while wet and soapy for awhile, on further review, the scene only lasts about three seconds!!! I think they should probably do a remake and extend that scene and play some really great hot and heavy music, or maybe somebody should just make a cool music video with the scene and play it in slow motion for the greatest effect!!!

He ends up in prison where..eventually he becomes a hero to his inmates. Luke knows they are intimidated by the villainous Warden (brilliantly played by Strother Martin) and that means he cant be friends with any of them. Luke shows no fear....and continually aggravates the hard--line Warden. There have been many parallels drawn about the Vietnam war Etc. Etc. , and his close resemblance (in behavior) to Jesus Christ. Luke sees defeat in the eyes of his fellow chain gang members..a willingness to toe the line. That is not the Cool Hand Luke way, so he goes it alone.

Recently caught it again on TCM, for at least the 12th time. Still as impressive as Newman shines in a large cast of talented actors in a prison movie taking place in the mid-60's, somewher in the Deep South. Luke's been sent up a couple years for basically being drunk and stupid, breaking into municipal parking meters in a small town while on a bender. He's been sent to a road crew work repair prison among what seems to be a non-violent segregated prison population in for writing bad checks, stealing cars, violating parole, parole violations, failure to provide child support, etc. There's really no rehabilitation attempted but it does provide cheap labor to work on the local roadways.Like any place, there is a prison hierachy that is led by Dragline, superbly played by George Kennedy. He probably became ex post facto leader by being the biggest, strongest and toughest among the population. He's illiterate, but clever and has learned how to survive in prison-indeed one gets the feeling he has spent the majority of his life in various confinement-reform schools or prison. He's learned the system and to show the proper respect and defer to the \"bosses\" i.e. The warden and guards. Newman's Luke as the new fish is one who will at first subtly, then overtly challenge the establishment hierachy.The film becomes a series of entertaining sequences showing the prison life, some funny, some heartbreaking. The convicts going out daily for back breaking work clearing brush, the \"titillating\" well endowed local girl who teases the crew by washing her car in the flimisiest of dresses (at age 12, this was my favorite memory) the boxing match when Dragline knocks the absolute hell out of Luke, who refuses to stay down, ultimately earning the respect out of Dragline and the other prisoners. There's the comedic egg eating scene and later a sad reunion with Luke and his dying mother, well played by Jo Van Fleet who stops by for a final visit.Many other excellent performances and some familiar faces, including a pre-MASH Wayne Rogers, Dennis Hopper, JD Cannon, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Harry Dean Stanton. Most notable.is veteran character performer Strother Martin, as the warden, AKA The Captain who tries to mask his cruelty with his phony benevolence with Luke sees through instantly. Indeed, Martin delivers the film's most memorable line after smacking Luke with a cane numerous times after backtalking to him.\"What we have here men...is a failure to communicate\"",

I think that Nurse Ratched is the Manager with the sun glasses in this film just like her hat showing power and both Newman and Nicholson don't like authority heads. I feel that they are both really just rebellious unlike what they are made out to be which are a whack job and a very bad criminal that have really done minimal damages apart from the under age sex ordeal with Nicholson. With the scene with the eating of the eggs the scene with the voting to watch the game is when they really are both accepted and both scenes are equal bringing all of the characters together.The main scene that stood out to me was the escape scenes as you really wanted him to get away and for the film to end for his safety. But my favourite scene was the egg scene. He ate 50 of them, I liked the scene as it was when he was accepted into the group, it also had some humour not only eating 50 eggs he was bloated with an over-sized stomach, this also made me feel sick just the thought of an eggs makes me feel sick, I literally start gagging, yuck. I think the ending was very when he was shot, although was killed but also escaped from the enclosure but not the way he wanted to. With his smirk on his face maybe also realising.There are stars and then there are actors like Paul Newman who is iconic for this role and many others like Butch Cassidy. The cocky motion of Cool Hand Luke may wobble from time to time but Newman's magnetic personality lends the film some weight. I love that is shot in widescreen. The story is quite straightforward with a anti-authoritarian story to a macho tall tale and winds up ultimately as somewhat of a curious and incomplete Christ tale. Luke represents man's journey from Genesis to Jesus' death. He was living in a perfect world, or eden, where everything was free and such, but Luke decides to leave by doing a very stupid act in retrospect. When Dragline questions Luke about this, Luke replies, 'Well you can't stay in Eden for too long.' Luke doesn't feel too bad about being sent to camp until he realises that it is unlivable once his mother dies; the only way out? to escape, but in the bible, the way for individuals to escape the restrained world was for Jesus to die, just like Luke. Also, Luke is able to motivate a great number of people to finish tarring the road quite easily. Dragline represents Judas, turning Luke in. But all the same stay very engaging. The film is filled with quotable lines such as 'What we've got here is a failure to communicate.' and memorable scenes. It is light in meaning but is full of cultural significance. A great deal of Cool Hand Lukes greatness is the supporting roles from Dennis Hopper and George Kennedy as Newmans Rival turned right hand man. But Luke doesn't clarify his motives, he seems as if he was put there for a challenge, inviting a conflict with the system to see if he can win. It isn't till the conclusion that the rebellion seems to be more free-spirited. The thing that makes one certain character quite dominant is the use of the sun glasses by the manager hiding his eyes; eyes are the doors to the soul.Unlike the other prisoners Luke rejects the prison conformity's that come with the enclosure and his unco-operative stand leads to tradegy. If Cool hand Luke is about how far one man can push the system, it's also about what happens when the system pushes back.",

Will the prison be able to break Luke's iron spirit...The best thing about the film is the character of Luke and Paul Newman's stellar portrayal of him. The film appealed to me greatly simply because of Luke, as a teenager I felt as if I could relate to him in so many ways, his humorous,independent nature, his rebellious attitude, his feeling of crippling emptiness, his unbreakable,superhuman spirit and willingness to keep trying, his craving for acceptance and longing to be someone and his constant, undying determination to spit in the eye of the establishment and give it hell resonated with me in such a powerful way that is rare for any other film character to do so.I could see parallels to my own life and in most scenes felt his pain, which at times nearly moved me to tears. The film has a handful of truly poignant and remarkable scenes, the scene in which Luke eats 50 eggs in an hour was just incredible and an absolute pleasure to watch. It was beautifully filmed and amazingly directed, the camera-work makes the scene quite tense and as it progresses, I found myself cheering Luke on, it's a monumental scene in movie history. The scene shortly after Luke's mother dies and he sings the song \"Plastic Jesus\" was dazzling and I was completely engrossed by Newman in this scene. As he sings, tears begin running down his face, which nearly moved me to tears.The film really packed a bruising punch with it's religious symbolism and Christian allegory, which gave the story a fascinating and powerful dimension. As the film goes on, the other prisoners begin to follow Lukes example and treat him as a God-like figure, a factor which ultimately leads to his death, the most powerful and hard hitting scene in the film comes when Luke is forced to dig a grave-like hole. He is repeatedly beaten and forced to dig whilst his fellow prisoners watch and sing gospel songs, with the scene culminating in Luke crying out to God for mercy and begging the guards not to beat him anymore. This scene was fantastic and chilling ,it's packed with brutal emotion and Luke's raw desperation completely blew my mind, another religious undertone is how Luke appears to be broken, but in the end, even though he dies, he beats the system and wins. Also note the scene in the church at the end of the film in which Dragline persuades Luke to give himself up to the authorities who are waiting outside, an act which results in Luke's death, this scene is similar to Judas betrayal of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. The final scene was electrifying, it gave me Goosebumps, Luke mimics the Captain's \"Failure to communicate\" line and is shot, but dies with a smile on his face, this scene was handled excellently and beautifully shot. Overall I was impressed with the allusions of parallels made to that of Jesus, the director handled this in a delicate and adult way,the film highlights how massive an impact faith can have on the human spirit even when it appears broken and also how good will always prevail over evil.The camera-work was brilliant, I loved the shots of the prisoner's toiling under the unrelenting sun and the shots of the dry, vast landscape reflected onto Boss Godfrey's sunglasses were superb and do not compare with any other camera shots in modern cinema. Some of the quotes in the film were amazing, thanks to a remarkable script, Paul Newman is exceptional as Luke and is legendary in the role, with his blue eyes and immortal smile, Newman was born to play the role.George Kennedy is superb in the supporting role an definitely deserved the awards he got.COOL HAND Luke is a potent, modern classic which tells a monumental,compelling story, it has an outstanding script with a mind blowing performance from Paul Newman and the Christian imagery is evoked in a strong and powerful, yet sensitive way which makes the film relevant, significant and appealing, it should definitely be shown to every film student in every film college.The film will always be special to me due to the immortal personality and undying human spirit of the main character.10/10.\"sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand\".",

It's a pretty seminal film, being referenced and drawn from by generations afterward.The problem is that those generations have actually pretty much surpassed it. Newman is certainly the epitome of cool as the main character Luke, and George Kennedy deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the supplanted prison top dog who ended up Luke's best friend, true. However, when you combine the fact that The Shawshank Redemption took the framework of this plot and made it better in almost every way, and the fact that O Brother Where Art Thou borrowed the setting and many of the characters for what amounts to a farce and arguably an outright parody, the two leave not much left to recommend Cool Hand Luke. It's not that the film is bad, it isn't. It's just been done so much better elsewhere that there's not much point to it any more.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",

While he works the ditch, his large adversary Dragline is watching a young country girl as she wash's a car. While she Wash's the car, she presses her breasts against the wet window. The shot is brief, but I have seen it in so many other movies. This was the first to use the shot. Another thing worth commenting on is the wardens high pitch souther accent. I have also seen this portrayed in some of the goofy Naked Bullet type movies and shows. Also the guard who is known as 'No Eyes.' He wears his reflective sun glasses at all times and has no lines in the movie. He remains a main character by his position and being a great shot with his rifle.",

Cool Hand Luke is the story of Luke (Newman) who has to face the prison sentence for a small crime . The prisoners before the arrival of Luke are not united and have lost all the fighting spirit within them. Luke who is a born rebel and a guy with a \"Never Say Die\" attitude brings about a great change in the mindset of the prisoners. With his mere guts, he becomes a hero for them . He escapes from prison many times but is re-captured again. After the escape acts, his respect among the prisoners increases many folds. This movie can surely be called an Anti-Hero prison movie with an underlying message.Some Great Scenes Still lingering in my mind : 1) The Sexy Blonde Car Wash Chick seducing the prisoners. 2) The Boxing Fight Between Newman and Kennedy 3) The Tarring of the Road 4) Luke's all escape scenesI have watched many Paul Newman movies, but this movie increased my respect towards him as an actor. Kennedy as the leader of the prisoners - Dragline was also impressive. Special mention to the 'Man with No eyes' who has not spoke a word in the movie but still creates a visual impact. Highly Recommended.Rating : 8/10",

A timeless classic, Cool Hand Luke is one of those old school films that get's better and better with age. Paul Newman was at the top of his game and made the role of Luke breathe and come alive, a talented actor indeed who can convey convincing emotion but at the same time maintain that cool and cocky aura that consumes him, what a heck of a guy!His somewhat larger, more gregarious partner in crime, the so called Dragline is superbly acted by the awesome George Kennedy, the guy is dopey, not the brightest bulb in the box, but he's been at the prison a lot longer than Luke and takes the new meat under his wing..., alas Luke doesn't seemingly take too well to Dragline, he prefers to do things himself, flying solo as it were, whereas Dragline becomes what could only be described as besotted with the maverick man. Luke is cool without even having to try, he has that natural aura about him, that gaze he does throughout the film, a gaze that says you'll never beat me, and I'll never give up, you'll have to kill me! That kind of gaze. The dialogue is top stuff and in-keeping with the context, that this is a road prison in the south full of seedy, uneducated types. Cool Hand Luke really is a quality film, tough to get through though, it's roughly 2 hr 10 min runtime felt like it lasted an hour or two longer than that, it's slow methodical pace slows the film down, therefore slowing the experience down for the viewer, making the film feel longer than it is. Thank God, thank God so much that my life is far easier with far more freedom than the guys at the road prison have got, you repeatedly find yourself saying this all through the film, it makes you squint and tense yourself, it's gritty stuff, back breaking hard work and endless graft, your life, their life isn't their own, and you soon realise watching the film that your life really isn't that bad. Essential viewing for any film fan or student, it is right up there with the best..., easier to try and watch it in one sitting with no breaks in my opinion.",

He meet other prisoners and soon win over them. He always wishes to escape but one brutal act by the authorities during his mothers death makes him to escape. The third and final escape turns out to be fatal for him.It starts with rather unclear reason of Luke getting in prison. Now when its Paul Newman as Luke, certainly his acting was enjoyable with feel good events. Even then the script didn't seem going together and fit with his acting, yet both script and acting were good. The plot is new, entertaining and enjoyable with few beautiful depiction of human behaviour in fine manner and tough circumstances. Dialogues, were just good and fun to hear. The escape sequences were special attractions. Supporting actors were weak and not to the match with Newman yet don't know why Oscar awards saw it differently. The film is certainly not the greatest or good movie, here no doubt it got no Oscar nomination except for acting performances, but nevertheless Cool Hand Luke can be liked.",

If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, \"Cool Hand Luke\" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission.",

I am glad it wasn't because I suspect that vested interests would have messed with it in one way or another for commercial reasons. Thankfully it was made when it was and the cast and crew deserve a collective congratulations on a job really well done. I have met people like Luke in my life on a few occasions and although I briefly warmed to their respective personalities I was also aware that they were not destined to be be around very long for at least one reason. Luke was a square peg trying to fit into a round hole and no matter how hard he and they tried he and they never actually make it work. In another country at another time he may have survived but not in this state and not at this time. Whatever it was that Luke wanted he was never going to get it because the people who ultimately had the control in this case a prison but it could easily have been out on the streets, were not going to relinquish that control for nobody or nothing. I understand that rehabilitation can be a wonderful thing but I suspect that the word was not in the forefront of the training if there was any for a job in that prison. If you were strong enough and intelligent enough to survive the heat, the monotonous work, the beatings and even the mind numbing boredom then I suppose you would leave at the end of your sentence and try and get out of that state as fast as possible. If you weren't strong enough you perished and ended up in an unmarked grave. For all his strength of character and trying to 'live life free and above board' Luke doesn't make it and fortunately the film is a lot more than just about how and why he fails to survive. Some square pegs eventually fit into round holes with luck and support from family and or friends, Luke had none of these and although his defiance was admired by the other inmates the guards broke him and eventually killed him.

George Kennedy won an Oscar for his portrayal of Dragline, a loud, somewhat dim good ole' boy who becomes Luke's closest friend. The cinematography is also spectacular.

It presents to us an injudicious judicial system, whose wanton brutality and heartlessness confronts the audience. Vicariousness (which we all to some degree can identify with) is examined, in the most depressing of circumstances, namely, imprisonment. Much meaning is conveyed throughout the film and the film's overall message remains as relevant today as it did when the film was made. Luke says in the film, 'sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.' That, in a sentence, embodies what Cool Hand Luke is about. The director is trying to say that there can be victory, regardless of circumstance and that hope, persistence and optimism can prevail against all. It is Luke's hope that keeps his smile on his face; it is hope that typifies him as a hero to his inmates, it is hope that continues to fuel his escape attempts and, above all, it is hope that keeps his spirit free. It was Thomas Carlyle who said, 'he who has hope, has everything.' The truth of these words is personified in Luke. An air of invulnerability surrounds Luke throughout the film and it is hope that acts as his protection. Even on the doorstep of death, Luke is seen smiling. From beyond the grave Luke tells those who lived vicariously through him 'keep Hope alive.' It is also this that the director is telling us. Ultimately, Cool Hand Luke tells us that freedom of spirit is of far greater importance than that of the body. It is a reminder to us; we who are 'free' to ensure that we do indeed, lead truly free lives. That we should not live our lives in a vain effort to conform to our bureaucratic systems but rather, live our lives in the way they ought to be lived. The director is telling us to be free and to hope and it is that that Cool Hand Luke so skilfully imparts to us.",

You can't help but love his stubborn arrogance as he goes up against the system and many of the films ideas can be found in better and deeper movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It's sad to think that it is better remembered for the egg-eating scene than for it's symbolism and regard to those who choose to live as social drifters.",

            "content": "If writers Don Pearce and Frank Pierson set out to emotionally overpower moviegoers by creating a character that not only inspires admiration and adoration as a crafty and charismatic individualist but also evokes feelings of compassion as a complex and sometimes tragic loner, then they realized their plan with me.Despite my experience, though, I understand why for some people \"Cool Hand Luke\" amounts to little more than a typical prison tale. After all, the viewer sees intermittent acts of cruelty, unappealing living conditions and a tedious daily routine, and the usual attempts by inmates to escape. Nevertheless, the story has moved me each time I have seen it.The first time I watched \"Cool Hand Luke,\" I felt so enamored of the protagonist, Luke Jackson, that at the end of the film I felt a loss that stayed with me for weeks. When during the following year another cinema presented \"Cool Hand Luke,\" and when months later television broad-casted it, I again found myself engrossed in the story, then teary eyed as the curtains closed and \"Down Here On The Ground\" played a final time.When I have seen \"Cool Hand Luke\" more recently, I have noticed the allusions to Christ which at least a couple of critics have mentioned -- the eating of all of those eggs now seems to border on the miraculous -- but the movie still entertains me because in Luke Jackson I continue to see a real person who, though self-defeating, has the unique ability to transcend the drudgery of prison life.",

Remember this movie was made in the 60s when rebellion was in the wind. These tendencies land him in a prison sentenced to hard time and performing hard labour for the big boss man. These days lawyers would buzz like hornets knocked from a shaken hive and screaming about infringement of civil liberties of a prisoner who was forced to sweat while incarcerated.  These guys had no air conditioning, no weightroom, no TVs with 40 channels and no legal sharks to protect them. Just mean bosses, hard work and time. Life seemed a little more innocent and simple. These boys were all criminals, but yet they had some scruples of their own. They all had a line drawn in their conscience and if not society would draw it for them. In this prison, which is a common theme for a Hollywood venture, there is no F#*^# this or F^%#&!n that, no sodomy in the shower fiasco, and no gangs. Everyone knew and remembered that any man playing grabass or fightin' in the building spends a night in the box.Luke is a lovable character and has a grin like a baby. He is a carefree spirit who never plans anything. He shoots from the hip and is fountain of hope for the other inmates. Luke is a crazy handful of nothin and is stubborn as a plow pullin mule. He is not dangerous to anyone except himself. Paul Newman will always be a real Cool Hand Luke to me. One of the great performances ever.  The surrounding characters are great. George Kennedy plays Dragline and wins some awards for his performance. Dragline is Lennie from `Of Mice and Men' with a rap sheet. I love the blues gospel of Harry Dean Stanton ringing out of the bunkhouse while raindrops fall on the boss's dirt. Those songs set the mood like Johnny Mathis and candlelight, but its not love that's in the air.  The music sets the tone for gettin ones mind right. Captain, played by Strother Martin, has one of the most memorable quotes in movies. His line is a classic. His performance is a classic. Many of the quotes are always on the tip of my tongue. I love it when ole Luke tells Captain to stop being so nice to him. The eggs and wager scene is great. The car washing is a sexy scene without showing any flesh. She is a true Lucille!I have watched this movie several times. This film is a world shaker. I have the tape and I watch the reruns on TV. I will buy the DVD. Anybody who does not like this movie.. Well...What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some movie viewers you just can't reach.",

They say that books are hard to turn into movies (watch \"Sphere\" to see for yourself {the book \"Sphere\" was good but the motion picture sucks!}) and that you have to start from scratch when moviemaking- obviously not with Cool Hand Luke.  Luke is copied for heroes in many other movies, books, and even video games (Metal Gear Solid), as is the mysterious warden (\"Holes\").  Cool Hand Luke is a movie about a man arrested for something he did while intoxicated, then makes every effort to escape a labor camp. Special appearance by Dennis Hopper when he was young.

He plays a guy whose sole purpose in life, even in prison is just to be cool--to take every dare and to risk it all every day of the week.And of course, I can't go through this movie without mentioning the car wash scene, where the chain gang boys happen to be working across the street from a lonely southern girl who gets her kicks by teasing them with her sexuality. Wearing a very thin, very tight sundress, she gets all soapy and wet while washing her old Chevy. George Kennedy just about goes mad trying to decide if he sees better with or without his prison-issue sunglasses: \"Puttin' 'em on, boss!\" \"Takin' 'em off, boss, they're blocking my view!\"Anyway, Newman does a great job showing us one too cool for this earth.

It's a very bare bones film altogether. Few characters, small soundtrack (1 theme and a couple of blues songs sung by the inmates are all I remember), and a simple plot sometimes make for a boring movie. But this movie is lighthearted and enjoyable. Paul Newman and George Kennedy put on good performances along with the other cast. And that's about it.

Upon entering the prison, he eventually gains respect from his peers because of his laid-back, cool attitude and his unrelenting fighting spirit even when he has nothing. Thus, he receives his nickname \"Cool Hand Luke\" by winning a round of five card stud with a hand of nothing and a few bluffs delivered with such cool ease.I can talk about Paul Newman's spectacular performance all I want-- about his perfect execution as this non-conformist in a prison camp-- but what makes this film special to me is something more than the terrific acting and interesting storyline. That something, which hits home to me, is the idea of spirituality.One who is well-versed in the story of Jesus knows that His story and Luke's share many similarities (after the egg eating, make sure to look at how he lays on the table). The question of spirituality then, in my case, is the most powerful message of the movie. \"Does God exist?\" Luke questions numerous times. By the end of the movie, Luke gets his answer (you'll have to watch it to see what he finally figures out). In this way, he and I, two men both on the same road trying to figure out 'what of God?', are alike. I relate to Luke and to this film. And to relate so personally with a film or character or for either to have such an affect on me is an achievement in a film's own right. The power and the message effectively conveyed to evoke the audience's emotions makes a film great in my book.There's more to it than that though, I'm afraid. There is more reason to watch this classic than being able to relate to this flawed, yet surprisingly admirable character, whether it is his beliefs or character with which you relate or admire.The acting by Paul Newman and George Kennedy is superb. I apologize for mentioning it once more but I have to reiterate Paul's effective portrayal of Luke. I just can't let an amazing performance fly under the radar when I list reasons for watching films, though I realize one can make his or her own judgement and can easily spot a terrific performance. Paul Newman is among my top four favorite actors and number one still living. Every time I watch one of his films, I do not think of him as Paul Newman, but of his characters. He makes Luke seem so appealing, heroic, strong... very admirable traits indeed. And George as Dragline, the leader of the pack before Luke comes in and an idolizer of him upon learning of his sheer determination. Both of them perfect.On top of it all, many scenes from \"Cool Hand Luke\" remain so vividly memorable. The egg eating, the church, Boss Kean's ditch... and of course, \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" I recommend this film to absolutely everyone and anyone. Watch Newman in one of best films portraying one of the greatest movie characters. That old Luke smile will charm you, make you feel good, shake up your world. No doubt, the classic \"Cool Hand Luke\" is not something to be missed.",

Left with nothing but inferences (and the exotic behaviors of everyone else), we have to insert ourselves into the part to sort out Luke's feelings.The end of the song gives us a glimpse, but even that moment is fleeting and shrouded, so the title character remains a mystery to us forever.",

Luke was arrested in a major prison for a petty crime which is inhumane imo.3. How is it that each time he tries to escape, he never succeeds, and each time the movie doesnt really show how they got to him.But ignore these few issues, its a great movie about non conformism and hope.

This movie resonated with me like no other before, and I can see what many reviewers mean when they use the term \"life changing.\" It really is a spiritual experience in a way no Ingmar Bergman nor Kubrick or Orson Welles film could possibly accomplish. Where Bergman made esoteric films that were solely for 'intellectuals', and Kubrick and Welles did films to either impress other directors or annoy audiences Cool Hand Luke speaks in a way wholly it's own. Much like The Seventh Seal (1957) Cool Hand Luke dwells on the meaning of life, and like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Citizen Kane (1941) it focuses on what makes a person human. But unlike those films it doesn't get hooked up on the minutia of existential philosophy that bogs down many spiritual films. It all plays out in a way that is easily digestible for both intellectual and average viewer alike no matter their background. Cool Hand Luke treats death not in a blunt or purely metaphorical way, but in a comforting and understanding way. One of my friends committed suicide last week and the questions of \"why\" and \"how could this happen\" have been in my mind every second since then. This movie was a cathartic experience that did nothing but bring comfort to a mourner.",

            "content": "I think it's safe to say Paul Newman helped define the contemporary American male that emerged between WW2 and the androgynous 60's (most of which occurred on a mass, mainstream level in the 70's). A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty. But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman): beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity. And this post-modern male persona, established in many movies (ON THE WATERFRONT, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE to name only three) was perhaps best exemplified in the movie COOL HAND Luke.We fall in love with Luke during the opening scene, I think: The utter stupidity of a grown man, drunk & alone, cutting off heads of parking meters is, well, damn satisfying to watch. There's something Dostoevskian about it (from NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND: \"What about the millions of facts that show that men, deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were, spurned them and rushed in a different direction? They did so at their own risk. . .refusing to follow the safe, well-trodden path and searching for another path, a difficult one, stubbornly working their way along it in the darkness). And our love of Luke is sealed\u2014after he opens the beer he'll never drink\u2014at the beginning on that beautiful freeze-frame of him laughing at life: her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.And that is also why we loved Paul Newman. He deflected (or more accurately Fast Eddie, Luke, Butch, & Henry Gondorf did) the slings and arrows life through at him with a grin and a twinkle in his eye that couldn't help but win us over to his side. We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs. And speaking of miracles, you may or may not know that this movie is a retelling of the story of Jesus (complete with disciples, miracles, persecution, doubt, prayer, crucifixion, and resurrection).The last image we see is of a photo in a magazine Luke had sent the chain gang showing him living the good life. When they find out the picture is a phony and that Luke is not the man they thought he was, Dragline rips it up. At the end of the movie, the photo has been resurrected: the repaired rips forming a Cross after faith in Luke has been restored. But however you chose to interpret COOL HAND Luke, it is Paul Newman whom we ultimately respond to. With all the lives he impacted, he was--on and off the screen--one of the quintessential American males of his times. I mean, think about it. Is there anything more irrelevant than a movie star? Has there ever been a movie star more relevant than Paul Newman? He was a natural born world-shaker.",

An American classic, Cool Hand Luke (1967) is as much a product of its time as any important movie ever made. CHL marks the beginning of the end of the cycle of American movies about rebels standing up to authority. In many ways it is the apotheosis of such movies, providing in one fell swoop both one of the most appealing of the rebels, while at the same time fundamentally questioning whether the \"establishment\" is at all vulnerable to rebellion. It is, at its core, a pessimistic film... pessimistic about the possibility of justice, of reform, and of individualism. In the end Luke dies for his sins, and to an outside observer, his reification as a folk legend among a small band of convicts seems like a hollow victory at best.

            "content": "\"What we have here is failure to communicate\"So says the captain about the inmate called \"Cool Hand Luke\" in the film of the same name. In the movie, Paul Newman plays a man who lives in a small town. He personifies the very individualistic mindset.Having nothing to do and no friends, Luke (Newman) decides to do a little drinking while cutting the heads off of parking meters. When confronted by the police, Luke acts like he is drunk (either he is actually acting or he actually is drunk) and finds his way into prison .Once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang. All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him. He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy. Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand.Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard.This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous \"Night in the Box\" speech, \"nothin' worth listenin' to.\" As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his \"mind right\" repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawn when he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right.Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished.Thus, \"Cool Hand Luke\" becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke. Like them, society tries to kill Luke. Too bad society has not learned to deal with other people's views.",

            "content": "Cool Hand Luke revolves around a unique character name Luke Jackson, who is played by Paul Newman. In short, the plot involves a small time criminal who removed heads from parking meters which resulted in him being sent to prison working on a highway road gang. Set in the sweltering heat of the South, the action is both dramatic and humorous as Luke continues his penchant for challenging authority, which is the recurring theme throughout the entire movie.Luke gets his nickname \"cool hand\" in a prison poker game that he wins by bluffing. When it is revealed that Luke's cards amounted to nothing, Luke responds \"sometimes nothing can be a pretty cool hand.\" Cool Hand Luke also has an excellent supporting cast lead by George Kennedy as Dragline, Strother Martin as the Captain, and Clifton James as Carr (also known as \"the floorwalker\"). Their strong acting performances combined with Paul Newman make the viewer feel they can hear the crickets and the broken down fan as if they were in prison themselves.Luke through a combination of boredom and the need to challenge authority constantly does the unexpected. For example, Luke challenges a much larger Dragline to a boxing match. Dragline continues to knock Luke down, but Luke keeps getting back up to an extent that is almost painful for the audience to watch. The refusal to quit results in Dragline and Luke becoming best friends in the film. The scene where Luke bets he can eat fifty hardboiled eggs in an hour is humorous and indicative of the lengths the inmates will go to distract themselves from the grinding boredom of prison life.Additionally, the ongoing theme of challenging authority is exhibited through a series of escape sequences that ultimately result in Luke being returned in chains that helps him become a legend in the minds of his fellow prisoners. It is both funny and sad when one of Luke's escapes causes the Captain of the prison to explain, \"What we got here is failure to communicate.\" Eventually, Luke challenges the ultimate authority, God, and is unsurprised when his prayer for a sign from goes unanswered.Cool Hand Luke has similarities to the newer movie Shawshank Redemption. Both movies deal with the theme of escape from prison life, with protagonists who become loved and respected by their fellow inmates. In contrast between the two films, Cool Hand Luke has a blue-collar feeling as Luke is an unemployed misfit, while Andy in Shawshank has a white-collar tone as he is a banker and tax accountant. Also, the Cool Hand Luke subplot is failed redemption, while Shawshank exhibits fulfilled redemption.The cinematography in Cool Hand Luke is stunning. The audience can almost smell the tar on the road resurfacing projects and the palpable fatigue of Luke digging and refilling a deep ditch. The strong backlighting and close-up camera work is present in many emotional scenes included in this movie. Also, the grainy rough film techniques give the film a gritty and sweaty tone to it, something that is expected for life in prison.If good acting, compelling storyline, and a great script are appealing, Cool Hand Luke is strongly recommended. Although prison movies can be depressing, this film takes prison life to a somewhat humorous and heroic level of a man trying to beat the system. With little to no flaws, this film is really an example of great communication, not a failure to communicate!",

If they followed up that question with \"Have you ever heard of COOL HAND LUKE?!\" I would be dumbfounded. I watched this movie in film class, which I was very fortunate for, because this movie is one of the best, or the best movie I've seen in my life.Paul Newman is a perfect fit for the character of Luke, a quiet, witty man with a smile that makes your knees give. The cast of this film is utterly magnificent, with a chemistry that adds a notorious charm to this film that attracted me to it.The religious imagery is a strong theme, and makes the film so interesting. Imagine, Paul Newman portraying a Jesus-like character.  Who woulda THUNK?! Not to mention George Kennedy as Luke's large chum, and even smaller roles, like Jo Van Fleet's portrayal of Luke's coughing and gagging mom, all of which are legendary. If you havent seen this movie, you are truly missing out on one of the best movies in the history of film, and now every time I see my Ol' friend Paul Newman on a bottle of creamy ranch, I think of the charm of Luke, and the impact this film had on me.",

            "content": "Good Newman film - taut energy - the strength of the film lies in Newman's portrayal of Lucas Jackson, a non-conformist who under most circumstances wouldn't even be considered a criminal. But he's paying the price for a drunken jag resulting in some damaged parking meters, and without trying, ingratiates himself with fellow prisoners following a physical beating at the hands of fellow prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy). That confrontation sets up the story for Luke's repeated attempts at escaping not only from the work farm, but from his own restless sense of being a prisoner in his own skin. Director Stuart Rosenberg magnifies Luke's struggle for redemption in the strongly imaged fade out right after the egg eating contest, showing the prone Newman in a crucifixion pose with arms outstretched and legs akimbo.Newman's not the only standout in the picture though. George Kennedy earned a Best Supporting Actor trophy for his portrayal of Dragline, the nominal head of the prisoners who is so inspired by Luke's work ethic and integrity that he eventually comes around to calling him 'my boy'. Strother Martin also makes an impact as the prison captain, and I wonder now if his signature line in the picture, which is now a staple of middle managers and parents everywhere, was the first time it was ever used - \"What we have here, is failure to communicate\".To be sure, there are a lot of great scenes in \"Cool Hand Luke\" - the fight, the car wash, the egg eating contest, the escapes. I myself could watch Carr the floor walker (Clifton James) over and over again as he explains what it takes to earn a night in the box.",

It really holds up.Newman should have won for this role (or maybe \"The Verdict\" but that is another review) instead of the pseudo-lifetime achievement award he got for \"The Color of Money\". He WAS Lucas Jackson!George Kennedy was born to play Dragline.  He won the Oscar and deservedly so. That tough character with the naive underbelly was totally believable.Mostly, though, the ending blows me away. Even though I know what is coming it still leaves me numb and chilled when Strother Martin says \"Get out of the way! He's ours!\"See this movie.",

How it missed out on Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cimenatography is amazing. There are so many great camera shots. The one that stands out the most is after the \"Walking Boss\", \"the man with no eyes\", as Kennedy's character says, shoots the snake Luke is holding up in his hand. The camera moves to a close-up of the Boss' mirrored sun glasses and we can see and hear Luke talking in them. The religious symbolisms are many. Just to name a few; Luke spread out just like Jeasus after easting the eggs, the scene when Luke talks to God in the bad storm and even the way the roads form crosses.",

While I had heard of the movie, I never took the time to watch it before this class. What a great movie with a lot of symbolism. I watched this movie and immediately saw the character of Luke as Freidrich Nietzsche might have seen him, an overman type that had come as close as maybe anyone to using his own \"will to power\" if you will. While I am a fan of Nietzsche, I also saw other points of other philosophers as well, even Nietzsche's opposite Kierkegaard and others like Heidegger and Camus. Maybe this movie was intended to be philosophical and maybe it wasn't, but I enjoyed it either way and recommend it to anyone regardless of their feelings of life or philosophy.",

While I'm upset at the Academy Awards snubbing Newman's performance, 1967 would've been a hard year to choose a winner (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night, Spencer Tracey in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate, and the icing on the cake, Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde). All the performances were Oscars caliber, and I guess they couldn't have a five way tie....but Rod Steiger? Oh, well, that was many many years ago. Newman's performance finally got some attention this summer as his character of Lucas Jackson appeared on the list of the top 50 heroes of the movies of the last 100 years. It made me very happy seeing as AFI failed to list the film in the top 100 movies. But your favorite film can't win everything I guess. If you're a Paul Newman fan definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed. If you don't check it out you're a \"Failure to Communicate.\"",

I myself can't stand movies having nihilistic themes such as 'Pulp Fiction',although these movies have been quite a success at the big screen and no body feels reluctant to call them 'Blockbuster'. Existentialism on the other hand is not as hopeless a philosophy (If you consider it a philosophy) as Nihilism.Existentialism in a nutshell is philosophy 'individualized'.Its emphasis on human freedom and liberty is such that it has attracted many creative writers and film makers.The influence of existentialism spreads beyond the realm of philosophy. 'Cool Hand Luke',staring one of my favorite actors Paul Newman stands up as a movie which can surely belong to existential genre.The movie surrounds around one man's defiance against authority .The protagonist from start of the movie till its end ,struggles to get himself free.The problem with the most of the people is that they give up pretty quickly but the problem with our hero is that he never gives up.He can be described as a person who consciously makes all those efforts to get himself free,but is unconsciously aware about his futile efforts.Any person who have special affinity towards 'Existentialism' must see this masterpiece.Had Sartre reviewed this movie he would only have used one sentence to end it all,the sentence would surely have been ,'Man is condemned to be free'.But I will end my review with the tag line of the movie,'What we've got here is a failure to communicate'.",

Strother Martin had a never failing genius when it came to portraying southern cads, regardless of what level of society he represented. And as the cruel warden in this film he is just as wonderfully entertaining as his fans have learned to expect. Casting the amazing Jo Van Fleet in the cameo role as Luke's mother in failing health on a last visit was a thoughtful touch, adding depth and understanding to Luke's personal turmoil. Anyone who has seen her brilliant effort as the defiant elderly landowner (Van Fleet was actually 46 at the time) in Elia Kazan's Wild River would expect no less. George Kennedy turns in his usual stellar performance as the big tough, but not too bright prison ringleader. His best-supporting Oscar was well deserved. The only disappointment I have as I watch and re-watch this great movie, is the fact that the utterly fantastic performance by Paul Newman as the born loser who throughout the film was called upon to exhibit the extreme highs and low of human emotion, and did so with amazing realism, went home without the Oscar. He truly deserved an Oscar for this role.",

He has lived, he has done horrible things, he has loved, and all with nothing more than an innocent smile on his face. He did only what he felt was right.But, burning with such passion has it's own negatives... even though he inspires everyone around him, for every ounce of passion he inspires, it seems that twice as much passion is ripped from him. As he creates life, his own life is drained...It is a story about selflessness. It is about a man who gives all of himself despite the toll taken upon himself.
