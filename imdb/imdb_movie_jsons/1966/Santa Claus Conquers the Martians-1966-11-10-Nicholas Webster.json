            "content": "This is certainly a consensus pick as one of the worst (if not the worst) movies ever made - and for that very reason I've always wanted to watch it. Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain \"cuteness\" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say, except - \"Hurray for Santy Claus!\" 4/10",

            "content": "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a low budget kid's movie from the early 60's. It has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. But, similar to most such famously trashed films, it actually turns out to be nowhere near the worst of the worst. More accurately, this could be described as an enjoyable slice of cheese. Sure, its rubbish on several levels but it also happens to be memorable on several other levels.The story, such as it is, has the Martians kidnapping Santa Claus and, in the process, abducting two Earth children as well. You see, the Martians want to enjoy Christmas as well. With a plot-line as moronic as that, there's really no point in splitting hairs over details and instead just sit back and watch what unfolds. The sets, costumes and make-up are all bargain-basement but they all work well enough within the confines of the plastic coated world that they exist in. Some of the highlights of the film as a whole include an angry Martian and friendly but stupid Martian, an impressively unconvincing and fake polar bear, a comedy punch up and last, yet surely best of all, a truly infectious theme song about Santy Claus. In the final analysis, there's enough strangeness here to qualify this as a bona fide cult item. It's poor, yet simultaneously quite good. Come on now; let's hear it for Santy Claus!",

            "content": "BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONESTGrowing up in Oxnard Ca this film always played on KTTV Channel 11 around Christmas time. It later moved to KTLA Channel 5 and Pia Zadora even did a fireside chat with television movie host Tom Hatten. Even today watching this film is a huge part of my \"Christmas traditions\". It was a \"Must See\" when I was a child and today I still watch it (Around Christmas)\". I also still watch \"Rudolph\" \"Charlie Brown\" \"Frosty the Snowman\" and MGM's \"A Christmas Carol\". One of the main reasons why I love this film is because I loved John Call as \"Santa Claus\". He is a huge delight. He is a terrific Santa. In this film \"Santa\" gets kidnapped by Martians. The reason is that the children of Mars do not have a \"Santa\". They also do not know how to have \"fun\". So the leader of Mars goes to Earth and kidnaps Santa as well as 2 earth children. \"Santa\" then slowly wins over the Adult Martians even though there are certain forces against him. Now if you are an adult (and you have never seen this) you will think this movie is terrible. Children (Who still believe in Santa) will be entertained. It is harmless fun! Even the theme song \"Hooray For Santa Claus\" is \"Cute & Catchy\".The films low budget is all too apparent here however if this film did have a bigger budget then it might not have the weird charm.I beg all of you to watch this film. Have a viewing party. It is a film that many people have seen and actually are afraid to admit that they enjoy it. I am not afraid to admit that I even bought this film on Blu-Ray.",

            "content": "Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children's movies - but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it's not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.Santa Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians (white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads, as well as inexplicable capes), who want to rescue their depressive, antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big red-suited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines, but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.I'm not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.Aside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting (Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film, though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad), this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience, however, this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for B-films. In terms of production, this film has the feel of a 2 hour, 1960s low budget TV show, and is almost as clever.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you're compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute, funny, and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people, it's a film version of your great Aunt's wallpaper - it's just there on the TV, while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet.",

            "content": "I really enjoy this silly little holiday flick. A bunch of serious Martian adults are afraid that their serious Martian children are too serious, so they go to a serious Martian senior citizen. The old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh, and then he explodes for no reason. The only logical thing left to do, of course, is go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus, who we meet as he is being interviewed by the Rip Taylor-like Andy Anderson. I liked how in the movie's universe, Santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him. He really does deliver toys to everyone, toys made by a dozen elves (who all look like they're suffering from mini-seasonal depression). One toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on \"real rocket fuel\", Santa proudly explains. I would ask, \"Where do little kids get rocket fuel?\" The details of Santa's amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up, but it's probably black magic-related.The Martians nab Kris Kringle and two little Earth children, who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed. The Martian leader forces Santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine (Soulless Toy Machine would be a good name for a band). Despite the numerous violations of human rights, it's all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy, except for one mean Martian (with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like Jamie Farr) who plots to kidnap Santa (even though he's already been kidnapped). Santa encourages the kids, even the Martian kids who have now learned to have fun, to hurl lots of heavy mid-sixties toys at the bad guy's skulls. Through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted, and Santa is permitted to go back to Earth, letting the mewling half-wit comic relief Martian named Droppo take over the reigns of the Martian Toy Empire. (The Martians are out-of-shape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them, and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces. Imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in Juan Piquor Simon's \"Monster Island\" and that's Droppo).How can you hate this movie? If I were a little kid in 1964 I'd be enthralled. They packed this movie with nutty stuff. Elves get shot with freeze rays. Mrs. Claus is a frantic goofball. The Martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills. The bad guy's hideout looks like that one King Crimson album cover.  I loved the part where the villain tries to shoot Santa and the kids out of an airlock, and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixed-up. There's a guy in a goofy robot costume, and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume. And that deliciously idiotic theme song- \"You spell it S-A-N-T-A C-L-A-U-S, Hooray for Santy Claus!\" Oh, it's so good!I sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions, and while they didn't have a huge budget they made a fun, silly kids movie. If it was the same exact movie but done in Rudolf-style stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition.Oh, yeah, and  Pia Zadora is in this, as if anyone cares.",

            "content": "I think that the main magic of many of these endearing old camp films comes from the fact that they undoubtedly have something amiable, cordial .In these things, SANTA \u0085 excels. From this came a sort a primitive poetry that has emotional relevance and can still be enjoyed, tasted. The effects were clumsy and what not, yet the touch was light and amiable. It elicited, on the viewer's part, a complicity. SANTA \u0085 is in no way a classic; but it is a cordial amiable funny movie very aware of its limitations, humble yet confident. It was the joyfulness of the pictures made by another race of movie makers. This is what has been lost since, and is missing today.Such films have an undeserved fame, an unmerited bad reputation; they are not bad, they are clumsy. There are thousands of worst movies; and more clumsy.These are picturesquely clumsy. This is their specific. Only the philistines take them for being 'bad', or even 'the worst'.SANTA \u0085 was so long ago labeled, classified, that,as a new\u0097comer to the cult,I knew what to expect\u0097and I was not disappointed. I suspect of hypocrisy those who pretend to be amazed (negatively) by what this film is about\u0097or about what it looks like. Come on, we all already knew\u0097the film but confirms us. Its cult precedes it.Santa Claus is a funny ,serene Sci-Fi adventure for kids. I have seen for the first time as a 29 yrs. man,and liked it.I can only guess what a fun experience might this film be for a kid. It is clumsy in a way so humble, so modest, that it's endearing. It is a nice joyride, colorful and amusing. It is cheerful ,childish and clumsy. I do not understand the sour bitter compact prejudice against it. It's not much to be said about SANTA CLAUS; what can one comment about a nice joke, or about an unpretentious fairy tale?",

It's hysterical, but even as you're laughing yourself breathless you can't help but feel bad inside that you're actually chewing down this rotten junk food. Because that's what Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is: a case of food poisoning. There are layers and layers of awfulness in this movie, and it really is an unforgettable experience. The actors are all stoned out of their minds and extremely ugly. The title pretty much explains the plot, although there's not really a lot of \"conquering\".

I know it isn't as catchy, but at least it's not deceiving.It would be impossible to sum up all the stuff that sucks about this film, so I'll break it down into what I remember most strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the \"bear\" from Hercules in New York); an extra with the most unnatural laugh you're ever likely to hear; an ex-dope addict martian with tics; kid actors who make sure every syllable of their lines are slowly and caaarreee-fulll-yyy prrooo-noun-ceeed; a newspaper headline stating that Santa's been \"kidnaped\", and a giant robot. Yes, you read that right. A giant robot.The worst acting job in here must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been \"frozen\" by the \"Martians'\" weapons. Could they be *more* trembling?

The children of earth discover the plot to kidnap Santa and decide to stop them.The Martians here, wearing very tight, revealing clothing, look exactly like humans except they have green tinted skin (making me believe that the Wicked Witch of the West must have been a Martian) and felt skulls with antennas, some with moustaches and some able to laugh. There's even one who could have been the Mickey Rooney from Mars. One of the Martian children is the young Pia Zadora who would go on to become the greatest film star of the 1980's. The art direction is actually pretty interesting, but it looks closer to a 60's TV science fiction show (like \"Lost in Space\") than the serious sci-fi films of the time. Get a loaf of the fake polar bear in the north pole sequence and a giant robot that is truly laughable.What makes this film really bad is the idiotic dialogue and the acting which really seems like the actors (if you can call them that) memorize the script that morning and never rehearsed before the cameras rolled. The Martians also use guns that look like they are shooting nerf balls. At least there's that zippy \"Hooray For Santa Claus!\" song for audiences to sing as they left the theater.

By making a low budget film out of it. And that's just what Joseph Levine thought when he released this film onto an unsuspecting Earth. Now I ask you, is this indeed the WORST film of all time? My opinion: NO. In my translation of the meaning \"bad film\" means \"unbearable, unwatchable and disposable.\" Not \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" This film is a landmark in the American motion picture industry. The makers of this film actually had the guts to create and release this film. Now that takes some serious talent! Let's not forget the actors either. Surprisingly the acting isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be (people confuse the 'acting' with the 'plot.'). The children, the Martians and even Santa Claus make one heck of an impression on a shoe-string budget film like this (don't forget that weird professor Albert Einstein wannabe). Above all, clever a production design really create a fine sense of cheesiness. Now, how about a brand new DVD 'Special Cheesy Edition' of \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians?\" \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is a rare and satisfying little gem of a film that broke, no, shattered all the rules of making a \"good and enjoyable\" movie. Now if only the bad films we get nowadays would be as bad as this one.

Of course, there's also the single most pitiful and unconvincing polar bear to ever shamble its pathetic way in front of a camera. The big clunky robot Torg is markedly less than impressive as well. The sets appear to be built out of cardboard, the cinematography looks ratty and washed-out throughout, the pace plods like a sad snail doped up on anti-depressant drugs, the fumbling (non)direction stinks, and the painfully forced attempts at wacky humor leave a great deal to be desired.

Either way, this one will appeal to them.For the rest of us, there's the issues of Santa-kidnapping Martians in BRIGHT green makeup and helmets that resemble Yul Brynner's headgear in \"The Ten Commandments\"; other Martians that you either want to punch out (Dropo) or try and talk out of future acting opportunities (a young Pia Zadora-???); Santas that walk around saying \"Merry Christmas\", despite the fact that Christmas is not even close; pop guns that immobilize people; polar bears that have extremely long hind legs; and blah, and blah, and blah...But DOES Santa Claus actually conquer the Martians of the title, like it says?  Yep, but he doesn't hit, punch, kick, bite, scratch, claw or anything. Sorry kids, green blood does not flow here.  You see, Santa puts in a Martian North Pole workshop and wins over the Martians with peace and good will towards men...and Martians too, I guess.  He even makes lazy good-for-nothing Dropo a Martian Santa.  GOOD; anything that will keep that nutcase on his own planet....Two stars for SCCTM; one star for the Christmas spirit and another for the fact that it was half-price beer night when I went in that pub to see it again.Maybe they should do that for \"The Horse Whisperer\"....",

There is plenty of memorable moments. My favorite is when the toy manufacturing machine goes haywire. In this movie the people of Mars kidnap Santa Claus so he can bring the \"Child Out\" in the children of Mars.

He is brought to Mars to get the kids to focus on more traditional Martian values or something. They are watching too much TV, I guess. But the pitfalls are that the Martians are so uninteresting.

They are obsessed with the planet's television programs and don't want to do much of anything. In an attempt to get the kids peppy again, Kimar orders the kidnapping of Santa Claus (John Call), hoping that the jolly old toy maker will know how to cheer the children up again.

It's all very pretty in colour and it boasts a charming song that later sold well as a single.Santa himself is portrayed as a genial old cove who smokes a pipe, and his Missus makes a rare screen appearance. The Martians wear probably the silliest outfits - with headdresses that make them look like insects - since the days of 'Flash Gordon' (although 'Lost in Space was soon to surpass it) and one the daftest-looking robots you're ever likely to see.The Martians all have American accents, greet each by rubbing noses and seem to consist of just one family and a handful of henchmen. The po-faced delivery by most of the cast is rather at odds with the raucous score by Milton DeLugg, and the sets belong in the shabbier episodes of 'Star Trek'.It's good to see both sides of the Iron Curtain united against a common foe. There's also a little bit of what passes for topical humour in that one of Santa's reindeer is called 'Nixon' and the head of America's space programme is called 'Werner von Green' and that one of the Martians is entranced by his introduction to the slinky spring.Predictably the least funny element is the comedy relief.",

The big thing they're all excited about is a live interview with Santa.

Briefly, Martian children don't know how to have fun, but they watch Earth TV constantly and hence know about Santa Claus. The Martians decide they need Santa there to teach their kids how to laugh and be happy, so rather than just go ASK the big guy for help, they decide to kidnap him. Santa takes it all in stride and endears himself to everybody he meets except the bad guy Voldar. Two earth kids get taken to Mars with Santa, and hilarity ensues. The sets, the props, the acting, the lines - you name it, it screams \"low budget,\" but it's done in such a way that you realize everybody KNOWS we're on a low budget so just go with it and laugh yourself sick.

Then the martians have the idea of kidnapping Santa Claus (and in the process they also kidnap two Earth children that act very poorly). On Mars the Martians are happy but Santa and the kids not. This because the kids are nostalgic of their home and their family and Santa in the technological world of Mars hasn't nothing to do but pushing the same buttons over and over again. Then Dropo (the dumbest and most obnoxious alien that you'll ever find in a movie) disguises as Santa and then the Martian kids are happy, and the real Santa Claus and the two kids are sent on Earth at the end.Everything in this movie is pretty bad. The acting is very bad by everyone (especially by the two Earth children). I personally saw much better acting in Pauly Shore or Steven Seagal movies! The sets are pretty bad, like in PLAN 9 and ROBOT MONSTER there is too much stock footage, and the alien's costumes are the most hideous costumes I ever saw in old B-movies. The special effects are atrocious (especially the polar bear that is a guy in a suit which his head falls while he is chasing the kids), the characters are all unlikeable except Santa, but I hated Dropo SO much that I wanted to jump in the movie and beat him for stopping him!

Santa Claus Conquers The Martians was made in 1964. Anyone who was a child around 1964 can tell you it was a very innocent time compared to today. Kids genuinely believed in Santa Claus then. One must also consider a child's concept of Martians, robots, and space travel in 1964. The cheesy Martian makeup and the clunky robot may evoke laughter from a modern audience, but a child's toy collection in 1964 might have had a Marx tin robot toy that looked very much like the one featured in this film. In fact, Marx Toy Company created the toys used in this film. I was born in 1968, and I remember watching this movie on commercial television in the early 70s with my mother. Adult viewers see the story, set design, and effects as cheap and silly, but to a child in the 60s and 70s, this film was perfect Christmas viewing. It's important to remember that this film was intended for children, and more specifically, children from a specific time in history. Not all films are timeless, and this one can be regarded more as a time capsule, showing just how innocent kids were 50 years ago. The premise that Santa was real and had adventures beyond his annual duties was just fun for kids. I can't imagine this film having the bad reputation it has if it were done as one of the Rankin-Bass animated Christmas specials. A look at the cast also reveals that all of the adult actors were professionals from stage and other film productions. I found the line delivery and acting to be sincere, and it's obvious that the cast did this because they loved their children. If this were done as a stage production, the audience would laugh along with the silliness, but kids would be mesmerized. And that's another thing to consider: the movie's costumes and set design actually seem more suited to a stage play rather than a film. I'd say if you watch this film expecting some kind of sci-fi classic, you'll be disappointed. But if you look at it from a historical point of view, and consider that it's a play made with love for children who believed Santa Claus would visit them soon, you might see it in a different light.",

This amazingly silly film was obviously intended for young kids to see during Saturday afternoons in December, first in the cinema, and later on TV (just like the Martian children glued to their set).

Reputedly, Gene Lindsey is the man in the polar bear suit, but he can't bee seen; later, he guest-starred as \"Randall Drew\" (Roxanne's brother) on \"Dark Shadows\", a show sparking the imagination on a limited budget.With a small budget, your really need a big imagination. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" has a few good lines, a phallic set statue (as the Martian kids watch TV), and a nice view of the sky as seen from Mars (see Saturn?) - but, there isn't enough creativity aboard.

The Martian kids have their own television sets which broadcast to them specials telecast on Earth, and a live interview in Santa's workshop instigated by a jovial reporter.

I could go on and on, but, again, the movie's crowd was supposed to be children, and it's spirit is aimed at this particular demographic so we as adults are gonna respond with embarrassment at it.

Claus was a total freak.the dialogue, even though mostly atrocious, offers some deep insights into children and humanity. upon seeing a Martian(at least i think it's a martian, that looks like plumbing fixtures on the helmets) the little earth girl asks \"what R those things on yer haid?\", to which the impatient Martian replies, \"they are sophisticated antennae\". the little girl then questions \" duh, R yew a teevee set?\". the disgusted Martian then scowls,\" is that what you want to do to the intelligent children on Mars? turn them into nimcompoops like these earth brats\". how true, how true. and how very deeply insightful.i thought Droppo was a tard and Chochum didn't seem as wise as everybody said he was. those are also the ugliest elves i've ever seen. Volder the evil bad guy was cool though. he's the only one who makes any sense. he's thinks it's a all a bad idea and wants to kill Santa. i like Santa, but he has no business on Mars and is an offense to Martian culture and tradition.still what would Christmas be without this cheapo freak show. it's schlocky but hilarious, and that's a convincing, if not kinda scary Santa Claus. funny when i was a little kid this movie used to scare me and give me nightmares. i used to close my eyes because i was afraid of the robot. i was also kind of afraid of this Santa. shows what dunces kids are. now i think it's so funny i use it for laughs. in the immortal words of John Call, who i think might be the real thing, \" Merry Christmas and AWAAAAAAAY!!!!",

I'd rather own something like this than, say, Richard Harris's first film \"This Sporting Life\", which is so boring that there is no way of getting any enjoyment from watching it. This is a bad film with a bad plot and it does get boring in parts, but it'll cheer you up on a bad day.",

However, it is definitely worth seeing to see how bad it is. I do think the film starts off well, the first twenty minutes are refreshing and entertaining. After that, it is a different story, and although it is a mess it is hard not to be entertained by it.First off, while the sets aren't too bad, the effects are hysterically awful and the costumes especially with the martians are pretty hideous. The cinematography is also rather shoddy. The music is okay, but gets too much after a while. With Hooray for Santa Claus, I wasn't sure whether to cry \"Three cheers for Santa Claus\" or \"Bah humbug\".The script is appalling mostly, cloying and unintentionally camp, while the story is incoherent and mean-spirited and there are some real pacing problems especially in the middle. The acting is not great either, John Call initially seemed a good choice for Santa with just the right charisma, but he is too jolly and he looked drunk or out of it in some way. I think a previous commentator is right, maybe he did read the script, knew it was terrible and decided to play along.Overall, pretty bad but entertaining also. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

Personally, a bad movie to me is one that has no entertainment value whatsoever (or a movie that has nearly no entertainment value). For example, \"Demented\" and \"Burial Ground\" are bad movies in my book. \"Santa Claus\" is not.The storyline is simple: Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians to provide joy and toys to the children of Mars when they become overly depressed. Sounds like an ingredient for one of the worst movies of all time, right? Wrong! This movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end! It doesn't ever get REALLY boring, instead having long stretches of goofy comedy that isn't funny for the right reasons. The acting is mediocre at best, but I did like the sets they used. Very surrealistic, in my opinion. There is plenty of great dialogue to laugh at (i.e, \"I wasn't sleeping! I just haven't been able to sleep these past few nights...I forgot how! So I was just practicing!\"), most of it coming from clumsy Droppo, \"the laziest man on Mars!\". The little children who are kidnapped by the Martians are a mix of wooden and dedicated. Of course, some scenes' inadequacy are inexcusable! The polar bear costume is obviously fake and the Martian guns are Whammo Air Blasters that freeze people (who manage to keep moving and blinking, for some reason)!Scenes to watch for: the Martians use the robot Torg to kidnap Santa, but Santa makes him into a toy!; the 'suspenseful' space door scene; the 'amazing' toy conveyor belt; Droppo passing as Santa (antennae and all); and the final showdown between Voldar and Santa, utilizing bubbles, water guns, soldiers, and other conveniently placed toys! \"Santa Claus\" is pure entertainment, in my opinion, and all those who speak against it should be sent to Mars!",

All the children on earth get anxious because Christmas time is coming up and jolly music plays from every television set. For some hi-tech reason, the children on Mars receive the earthly TV-channels as well, and they're depressed because they haven't got a bearded fat guy in a red suit that hands out presents. The great leader of Mars \u0096 busy man that he is \u0096 promptly organizes a mission to earth in order to kidnap Santa and return the happiness to his children's green faces. So far so good, the sets and costumes are incredibly cheesy and laughable, but you can't help smiling at the screen.

Then the movie just gets plain boring and I imagine even kids from the early 60's would have found it dreadful!

Alas, despite the expenditure of a fair bit of money on sets and costumes, every plot opening turns into a dead end. Admittedly, not the worst movie ever made but it tries mighty hard to reach that distinction. If the script was meant to be joked up or played tongue-in-cheek, almost the entire cast seems unaware of that fact. In fact, John Call and Leonard Hicks are offered some really splendid comic opportunities but both seem relentlessly bent on playing the script straight, despite prodding by Vincent Beck and Bill McCutcheon (plus Don Blair in a small part as the television news announcer) to follow their examples.

But also on the trip to Mars are two Earth children who get caught up in this mess by helping the Martians find Santa Claus. Not everyone is too happy about this outcome, as one of the Martians doesn't like this idea of Santa spreading fun to their children, so he goes out of his way to stop that happening.What's Christmas without watching a Christmas flick. But oh my what a film to pick! I remember watching this flick a long time ago, but I didn't remember too much about it and that was definitely a good thing from what I just watched! It isn't the worst film I've seen, but it isn't that far away from it. 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians ' does give the word bad, a really bad name. Ah, maybe bad is too loose of word to describe it. Abysmal, yeah that's better. Sure, this is aimed at children, but really there's whole lot better Christmas flicks out there! Especially since it treats you as if you're damn fool! There's nothing subtle about it with you basically being slap in the face with its heavy handed nature of forced morality and force-feeding you, to where the story is heading. If you're thinking that it might be so bad that it's good entertainment\u0085 far from it, actually. Ed Wood might be proud of it as it does share patterns to his type of work in the cheap effects, lousy costumes (except Santa's, but not the polar bear) and cardboard sets, but his films had heart by being too over-the-top, while this made in the basement production was a total drag and ultimately cold. Even if there's one or two hammy performances amongst many droll ones. That would be John Call as Santa Claus. The Christmas spirit to me came across as false and rather unsettling. Yeah, unsettling. Something about it and all the happiness felt unstable and just got my nerves. When they broke into that unnatural laughter and strained humour, *argh*, don't they know their limitations in this incompetent hogwash. Nice idea, but handled without any real passion and it shows by its restless nature. So, this is how to celebrate Christmas! And to think, is this feature mocking itself or being serious. Ah, I think more so the latter. Bah! Oh my beloved eyes and ears. Why did I put you in this much pain? Other things that stand out in this uninspired trite has got to be the choreographed action pieces that just blows you away. Blows you away at how amateurish they were. Pretty much it's cartoon style in its action, gags and wait the drowning music. Stock footage is patched in rather elegantly! That's if you got bad eye sight. The diabolically lengthy script with its emotionally touching and you bloody don't say speeches aren't helped by the mostly robotic performances. These mainly came from the kids and the aliens from Mars. Well more so, people who just like to wear green (because it's logically that they be green) and have a hard hat with tubing and a TV antenna on top. Gee, they looked so realistic! It looks like it just comes second nature. Be careful you don't lose any brain cells as the catchy, but annoying opening and ending tune sticks in your head! \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" No, \"hooray it's over\" sounds a lot better.Expect the unexpected.

As of April 2011, it is ranked number seventy-nine on the IMDb Bottom 100 with a 2.3 overall rating. It's such an odd little, creature of it's time, it's getting the \"wonderful\" honor of a remake. Completely unnecessary. There is pretty much no way this film could be made to be good.The title alone mystifies me. At no point in the film does Santa Claus \"conquer\" anything. Martians are grim after watching Christmas specials on Earth depicting the jolly man St. Nick as a guy to bring happiness. They have no one like that on their planet. So the Martians summon an old man that tells them Mars is awful because there is no Santa Claus. So the Martians capture two earthlings that lead them to the \"real\" Santa Claus at the North Pole.How the film is shot is another thing that is difficult to explain. It's 1960, color is quite popular in movies. Being only shot with $200,000 and having a name with \"Santa Claus\" in it probably means they wanted to use essence of color in the film. The color is dimmer than a 3D film. I can't tell what process was used. Obviously, Technicolor wasn't. With this, some scenes are in color, but it's so dim if the color isn't red or blue it's hard to see.Sometimes, on frequent occasions, if something large in the movie is a bright color, like red, the color will spill onto other things around it. I know it's 1964, but color was around. This is lower budget, but if this was black and white it would look a lot less wonky and protruding.The acting is unbelievably atrocious, but oh how I love it. There is a scene where the idiot martian Dropo (McCutcheon) is getting yelled at by the other martians for lazy. He runs away and \"accidently\" falls into various levers and is supposed to look like he fell into them. When he actually runs up to the levers, pulls four abruptly, and quickly grabs the other two he \"missed.\" The ship then rumbles uncontrollably. Absolutely, unintentionally scene that was an unexpected delight.Watching this with a friend was fun because we would talk back to the screen, ask the TV questions, and so on. Nothing is more fun than asking a movie why, what, and how questions that you genuinely want to know. It's like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is known for it's public domain status in the United States. Public domain is where a film is open to the public and has no copyright on it in any form. Ever see those fifty movie packs in theaters that have fifty films from a specific genre? Like horror, drama, \"box office gold,\" etc. Those are all public domain films. Even though I gave the film a low rating, it's most likely the best public domain film in its own right. Usually all of the films have bad acting, a lame storyline, and poor picture quality clearly diminishing from its frequent copying from one DVD to the next. Santa Claus has all of those qualities; and it's pretty much the strangest Christmas film to exist.Starring: John Call, Leonard Hicks, Vincent Beck, Bill McCutcheon, Victor Stiles, Donna Conforti, Chris Month, Pia Zadora, Leila Martin, and Charles Renn.

Levine's Embassy Pictures, director Nicholas Webster later at the helm for another trip to the Red Planet, 1967's \"Mission Mars.\" When the Martian leader (Leonard Hicks) decides that his children need some jolly good cheer to snap them out of their doldrums he's advised to travel to Earth in search of a Yuletide figure in a red suit and white beard located at the North Pole, but with a Santa found on virtually every street corner he finds himself in a bind. Fortunately, two earth children direct the Martians to Santa's workshop, all three kidnapped to exile on the Red Planet. Vincent Beck is the lone Martian who opposes such pointless frivolity, yet without him there would be no story and little enough amusement as it is, despite the worst looking polar bear suit ever deigned to be captured on film. Too cheap and listless to be appreciated as an inept cult film and too dull to amuse even the youngest viewers, military stock footage dragging out the running time to 80 minutes (shooting lasted 10 days in Long Island's Michael Myerberg Studios, a former aircraft hangar, surviving kiddie matinees well into the 1970s, its director still earning a $6 residual every year at Christmastime). John Call does at least look the part of Santa Claus, though his laugh needed a bit of work, and the little Martian girl is played by 10 year old Pia Zadora, who first gained a certain measure of celebrity notoriety during the early 1980s.",

First off the title of the movie is enough to pull in nearly any B-horror fan before they realize that Santa isn't up in the sky blasting away at the Martians. Rather he is kidnapped and ends up going pretty quietly. The problem with Mars is that there is no joy to be had for the children on Mars. Drawing this from the sad looks on his children's faces, the Martian leader decides it'd be a great idea to kidnap Santa and force him to spread Christmas joy on their planet. Again, Santa has no problem with this and goes quietly. However, the evil Voldar sees weakness in joy and decides that Santa must be destroyed before all of Mars becomes a happy place. So does Santa actually conquer anything? No. Is there anything in this movie that's worth seeing? Unless your extremely forgiving when it comes down to children's movies, no. Another thing that should be noted is that I do believe the soundtrack for this movie was recorded in the 7th layer of Hell. It's that bad. Not even worth the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart.

An old sage suggests this is because they don't have Christmas on Mars, so the solution is to kidnap Santa and bring him back to live on this annoying planet.

In the end, the Martians decide to send them all back because they realize that a mentally deranged Martian named Dropo wants to be the new Martian Santa. He's really annoying and I wanted him to die, but apparently that is the sort of Santa the Martian kids want.

The acting, plot and sets are completely awful--Ed Wood quality bad! I can't see how ANY kid would have liked this film, but for adults it's going to provide some unintentional laughs!

It's worth remembering that this story is aimed at kids and kids alone, kids who won't be worried by the cardboard scenery and ham acting.The storyline is fast paced even though it doesn't make much sense.

Martians have poorly applied green makeup that doesn't cover all their faces. Also, they wear used helmets painted green with broken antennae attached, for some reason. The robot and the polar bear are two of the most absurd monsters, and the freeze ray doesn't work too well on actors who visibly move while \"frozen.\" There's one character meant to be comic relief, but he's hard to find, since everyone else hams it up as bad as he does. Cheap sets, probably left overs from a grade-school play. Nonsensical dialogue, plot holes, miscellaneous errors, the list goes on.

Meanwhile Santa has a white moustache, a true battle of wills represented by such a duality! The black moustache man complains about the excess amount of soy in the atmosphere of Mars softening up all the martian men and plans to kill Santa who is apparently conspiring against his traditional values.Meanwhile Santa is depicted as an alternative version of \"The Mask\", always laughing and mocking around, playing stupid and naive while he appears to have the power of a God.

In some weird, surreal way the movie at least comes off very child-like and you can't help but feel and notice how innocent the entire thing is. With that said, I'm not sure the children in 1964 would enjoy it and it's doubtful they would today. This is clear a movie for adults because they'll be the ones able to get some laughs out of it. There are many classic bad scenes but some of the highlights has to be the (fake) polar bear coming after the kids, Santa's elf helping having to hold still after the martians freeze them and then there's the classic scene where Santa get the martian kids to laugh.

            "content": "Oh dear! As misguided family movies go, they don't come much more misguided than Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. A meagre budget does not necessarily spell doom for a film (check out some of Mario Bava's films, for instance, which had little money behind them but still emerged pretty good on the whole), but in this case the lack of funding is evident in almost every frame. The whole film is a desperately sad attempt to make a movie for kids and adults to enjoy together \u2013 kids are likely to be hugely unimpressed by the lame comedy and boring story, while adults will be depressed by the woeful acting, production values and plot. One critic wrote: \"frankly, I am ashamed to be from the same species as the people who made this movie\". Which sums it up. Perfectly.On Mars, the Martian children are acting strangely. They seem lethargic and depressed; Martian leader Kimar (Leonard Hicks) notices that his own kids are especially gloomy, and wonders if their obsession with tuning into Earth TV programmes is affecting them. The Martian leadership council summon a wise old elder to ask what he thinks is wrong with the kids. The elder (Carl Don) says that the Martian kids are not allowed to play, to have fun, to be young-at-heart, etc, and this, coupled with the fact that it is almost Christmas time on Earth, is making them unhappy. By watching so many Earth shows, they are learning all about Santa Claus and festive spirit, and feel like they're missing out. Kimar decides to take a unit of men to Earth to kidnap Santa (John Call) and bring him back to Mars to cheer up the children. They accidentally end up capturing Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti), a couple of Earth children, as well as old Saint Nick himself. Trouble beckons when Martian subordinate Voldar (Vincent Beck), who has been vociferously opposed to the plan from the word go, tries to sabotage the mission by doing harm to Santa and the two Earth children.The sets wobble and bounce, the outfits look ultra-cheap and unintentionally funny, the make-up is pitiful (towards the end the green Martian make-up must have almost run out as the Martians look nearly white\u0085 unless there's a whole racist subtext at work?), and the performances are roundly terrible. Don as the elder is so awful, adopting a croaky drawl which makes him sound like a constipated cockerel, that the audience is reduced to guffaws during his scene. The others fare little better (Stiles and Conforti are wooden as the Earth kids; Call chuckles away inanely as Santa; and Bill McCutheon as comic relief character Dropo is so irritating one wishes one could strangle him and quietly dispose of him in the space garbage!) At least Hicks and Beck try to give interesting performances as bickering Martians, although the dumb dialogue defeats their efforts. Worst of all is the utter deadly dullness of the film. I literally cannot watch this movie in a horizontal position \u2013 I attempted to view it twice in bed, and was sound asleep both times within mere minutes. In the end I stood up and watched the movie whilst ironing to make sure I stayed awake. That bad, you ask? You bet ya!",

This basically only works as a \"so bad it's good\" kind of thing. How does it suck, you ask? Let me count thee ways: The colors and lighting are hideous and straining. It's soaked to the bone in sweetness, and so thoroughly and consistently ridiculous that there is a genuine chance of viewers getting diabetes and ending up stark raving mad from witnessing this. Almost all of the \"humor\" is painful. I'm not entirely sure how many of the attempts at putting a set-up and a punchline together I would go so far as to actually call \"jokes\". Gags almost invariably crash and burn. A little bit of the slapstick is perhaps not completely hopeless. The majority of the laughs this garners are unintentional. Once this realizes that it might hold the potential to make a point, it continues to mercilessly beat the audience over the head with it, until, presumably, the writers forgot about it. No, I honestly would not expect much from anyone who, during the Cold War, would take the words \"nuclear\" and \"curtain\", and put them together to mean something harmful of great power, in the script for a *family movie*. This can only be appreciated as anything \"serious\" by children, and the kids would still need to be of limited and/or impaired mental capacity. The acting is nonexistent. The pacing is decent. The developments are utterly unimaginative and predictable. The plot details how Santa, here portrayed as a gullible moron who couldn't get himself out of even the tiniest trouble unless inactivity was enough to accomplish that, is abducted by Martians, for the benefit of their offspring, who have clearly learned how to e-nun-ci-ate. The MST3K of this does hold hilarity, but it's not their best. There is no sex, violence or language. I recommend this to fans of B-rate flicks and all who enjoy their sides splitting at the things the creators of this did not mean to be funny.

That was about a dozen years ago, so when this film showed up on the Mill Creek/Tree Line compilation of fifty sci-fi classics, it was the capstone to an outrageous mix of mostly goofy flicks that every 'B' movie fan should own.Now the thing is, despite it's poor production values and stodgy acting, there's an endearing quality to the film that comes through with it's message of joy and fun that all kids hold dear. That perspective is provided by the way Martian children are programmed from birth with adult minds, so they never have a childhood. When the children of Martian leader Kimar rebel, they're displaying the cranky behavior we all would if we didn't have anything to laugh or care about.So much for the psychoanalysis. There really are some far out story elements here that defy logic. For example, Kimar is eight hundred years old, but his kids Girmar and Bomar are eight and ten, the same as Billy and Betty Foster. They're the Earth children kidnapped by the Martians along with Santa Claus (John Call). These kids seem to be pretty emotionally stable, as they never seem to miss home for a minute.All your classic stereotypes are on display here. The evil Martian villain is Voldar, with a Jamie Farr lookalike as a sidekick. The comic relief character is Dropo, who's desire to become a Martian Santa Claus earns him the job by the end of the story. The use of a giant cardboard robot named Torg to capture Santa at his toy shop was a neat touch, especially when the big guy turned the tables and rendered him harmless. Hey, how about that goofy polar bear! Curious how all the instructions on the Martian space ship were written in English. True, one wouldn't understand them otherwise, but they could have labeled the Radar Box '%$@$! X^+' and who would have been the wiser, they still would have called it the radar box. And come on now, I know you chuckled just a bit over the Martian-mallow joke.Hey, how about if this Christmas, the programming execs at one of the cable networks replaced \"A Christmas Story\" with this one for it's twenty four hour holiday marathon.

This is pure schlock, start to finish.The plot? Well, the kids on Mars are raised in such a way as they reach the intellectual level of an adult when they are physically children. The current crop of kids are obsessed with 'Earth television', and the concept of Christmas. The solution to this? Well, some sneaky Martian adults kidnap Santa, and for no apparent reason, some kids from Earth, and take them all to Mars so the Martians can enjoy Christmas.Don't let the title fool you. At no point does Santa actually conquer any Martians. I'm guessing the title refers to his bringing good will to Mars. What a let down. I was hoping for some sort of war-mongering, bad-to-the-bone Santa that handed out whoop-arse instead of toys. I guess I'll have to make my own movie like that, but for now I still have this.Despite three paragraphs of negative comments, this is fairly enjoyable if you like the 'so bad that its funny' angle. The Martians don't come off as that mean, and Santa is pretty naive, a 'Jurassic Park' scientist kind of naive. The quality of the story defies description, and the special effects could be bettered by a blind chimpanzee. A drunk, blind chimpanzee.

One earlier comment here, defending the film, noted this popularity and said, in effect, \"If it's so bad, how come people are still watching it 40 years later?\"Good question. I think it begs another question: Is it possible to make a film so bad it actually becomes good?Not if this is any proof. SCCTM is just bad. Really bad. Bad sets, bad acting, bad direction, bad music, bad costumes (or \"custumes\" as the credits read), bad everything.The idea of the story holds some goofy promise. On the planet Mars, children are sad, and in order to cheer them up, their caring Martian parents kidnap Santa from Earth. Santa arrives, bringing Christmas cheer along with a couple of Earth kids who help show their Martian counterparts how to have a good time. Naturally, there's one Martian who doesn't think all this merry making is so great (it's turning his people into \"Martian-mellows\"), so he sets out to stop it.Fine. You know what kind of picture this is. Questions of astrophysical relativity and the available military response to Martian encroachment are really out-of-place. This is a film to watch with a five-year-old, toddlers even, and get whatever enjoyment you can through them. Children's films can be good, great even, when they are served up with the right amount of humor, care, and passion, like any other film.But the film fails so miserably that you just cringe at the idea of an audience of any age sitting through it. The broad overacting of Dropo (Bill McCutcheon did forge a decent acting career after this, including a Tony and a memorable role in the under-appreciated \"Mr. Destiny\") sets a low bar the other players limbo right along after. Even Voldar's wacky assistants ham it up, pulling faces in every scene no matter who's speaking like they need Ritalin. I don't know if the actor playing Santa was drunk while making this movie, as some posters here say. I can only hope so.There's unintentional comedy abounding, like the \"bear\" that sniffs out Billy and Betty near the North Pole and Kimar (Leonard Hicks must be Martian-speak for the word \"stiff\") stepping on one of the children actors' lines. Normally it's not nice to make fun of bad acting by children, but even if these kids hadn't grown up long ago, it would seem necessary to make an exception. They clearly didn't belong in front of a camera. What's that you say, there's a famous future actor in the bunch? Oh, yeah, Elliott Gould as Voldar, right. I spotted him right away. Actually, the only kid who even could read lines was Billy, and his monotone delivery is pretty much the gold standard for the tykes and adults alike.I watched the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" version of this movie, and I laughed and had fun. I always wanted to see this film, especially in December, and MST3K was the way to go. But I really, really mostly just wanted the movie to end. I felt sorry for these poor people on screen, left adrift by their producer, writer, and director, trying to be entertaining and just embarrassing themselves. I thought of all the ways the creators could have freshened up the story, thrown in some genuine interaction between the Martian kids and the Earth children, that might get a young viewer to care. Finally, I tried to enjoy it as a kitchy spectacle, but when the film doesn't care enough to take itself seriously, the point is lost.Like Huey Lewis said, sometimes bad is bad. SCCTM is awful.",

I'm not convinced that Mom's diet of 'dinner pills' didn't go someway to achieving the catatonic state of acting that Pia and her on-screen brother achieve, but there you go you can't lambast parents for too many things at once in an ostensible flick for kids. That would be subversive! If, by the time the sing-a-long 'Hooray for Santy Claus!' end credits refrain rolls around, you're not convinced that at least some involved in this prodigious production were not under the influence of something, it is always interesting to note the air-lock resolution premise of Alien being trotted out for the second time (following It!

Pia Zadora first film role. Several known kiddie show comedy actors fill out the martian cast. Be sure to see the martian pistols in the film. They are over-the-counter Whammo \"air blasters\" of the day. *Emotion- Good kiddie film only for very small children, over that age the acting is abysmal 101 and sickening sweet like a Saturday morning kid show.",

It's very evident that most people in these comments don't understand how perfect this movie was for the pre-ten year old set in 1964. As another commenter noted, it has Santa, it has Martians, it has elves and magic.I love the rich color of the movie, and Santa is the best, especially his first scene, being interviewed by the news reporter. This is all a great trip back in time, like to a forgotten old story book. The acting is fine, though I don't think it's an issue unless the kids are absent mindedly looking into the camera when they shouldn't.Great hokum. It reminds me of some of the early BAD Hannah-Barbara cartoons and various early 60's surf board movies but I don't mind at all.

The Martian children are depressed about Christmas and their lack of presents. The King, Kimar, ventures out to confide with the old man in the Martian caves. Of course he points Kimar in the right direction before suffering a severe case of spontaneous combustion. Puff! The Martian's complexion is ruddy and they resemble the Klingons from \"Star Trek\". Voldar is the villain because he has a mustache and doesn't follow orders. I think Voldar's bad attitude is terrific. He also has more wisdom than the elder who is older than dirt. The crazy headgear makes little sense and their weaponry--the wham-o guns--are a laugh riot. Dropo is strictly present for comic relief. Kimar's wife is a handsome Martian female but doesn't do much but dole out food pills. The art direction is note worthy--especially a water sculpture at Kimar's residence and the alien landscape of the planet. The interior of the ship is okay and the special effects competent. I also like Santa's workshop and that wild polar bear with the zipper up his back. The reporter has a strange response:\"Wow we wow\" when he catches a glimpse of a Martian doll.

Basically Santa Claus (John Call) is getting ready for another jolly Christmas, dropping all the presents off for all the good children of the world. Meanwhile on the planet Mars, concerned for their children becoming obsessed by Earth television, Martians, led by Kimar (Leonard Hicks) decide to go Earth and kidnap Santa Claus. Their search eventually takes them to North Pole to Santa's Workshop, where the elves are busy making toys ready to be delivered, and they send a robot to go and get the red coated jolly man. Santa, and children Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti), are put aboard the Martian ship, and leader Kimar hopes Santa can bring some Christmas spirit to the red planet. While mean Martian Voldar (Vincent Beck) thinks Santa is a menace, and kidnaps fellow Martian Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) dressed in Santa's get-up wanting answers.

Jacobson, armed with a $200,000 budget and a cast assembled from the ranks of the Broadway stage, as well as a crew comprised of behind-the-scenes principals from the ranks of New York area television, has set out to create a big, large scale science fiction adventure starring ..... Santa Claus? There are many individuals who have, over the 30 or so years since Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was first released, tried to explore the many reasons why this particular story, so remarkably third-rate in terms of sets, scripting and even special effects, and yet, in one sense prophetic, given that the story foretells at one point the short attention span of the succeeding generation of children to come. Still, the adventure Santa shares with the Foster children, Billy and Betty, as they spend their time in the house dwelt in by Kimar, Momar and their kids, Bomar and Girmar, has a degree of suspense and dignity.In the scenes taking place at the region called Chochem's Chair, the wise old Martian sage rants that the children of Mars are rising up in rebellion, for the simple reason that they have not yet discovered the meaning of fun. Only Santa Claus, Chochem proclaims, can provide such a meaning. For the remainder of the film, we follow Kimar and his crew, including hilarious Dropo, the laziest Martian of them all; and Voldar, the jealous, petulant angry person who sees Santa's presence as a potential threat to the Martian future.There are many who have discussed young Pia Zadora and her appearance in this film --- and, frankly, these descriptions run the gamut from too cute to too campy and back again. Yet such descriptions are noted here because recently Penguin Books USA has published an unprecedented novelization of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, written by film historian Lou Harry. In his version, in which he uses approximately 90 per cent of the actual dialogue taken verbatim from the film itself, the story is presented from the perspective of a now grown-up Girmar, who has succeeded her father as ruler of Mars. Harry's Girmar narrates the tale in a sort of Valley Girl/Queen of Outer Space sort of dialect; indeed, her account of the film's concluding toyshop battle, wherein she and her brother, along with the Fosters, pummel Voldar with toy after toy, ultimately leaving him in tears, will send your funny bone into the stratosphere --- somewhat.The final verdict has still not yet been fully written regarding Santa Claus Conquers the Martians --- there will be many more historians who will argue its reasons for being --- but one thing is certain: however many times one may call it a flop, there will be others who will wonder what producer Jacobson was \"on,\" if you will, when he conceived the project. What will matter in the end is the simple question: Did you enjoy the movie already? If you did, wonderful; if not, well, who knows?",

This is about how martians - who we know are martians because of their awful, vomit-green paint on their faces and helmets that were bought at 1964's equivalent of Party City, despite them not coming from a red planet (for the brief seconds we see Mars it looks more like some green orb with some varying shades of things, I can't describe it at all for the life of me) - see that their martian children are too obsessed with the TV and a news reporter interview with Santa up at the North Pole. This leads them to come to Earth, they end up kidnapping two hapless kids first, and then use a robot (which doesn't do much) to kidnap Santa Claus so they can... do WHAT, exactly? Maybe the filmmakers thought they were going to make a sweet and dopey little children's movie, but what they got instead is alternatingly obnoxious and kind of insane in how the editing goes, not to mention the casting of John Call as a Claus who may just be TOO close to how kids picture Santa so that he becomes nightmare fuel instead. There's one particular martian named Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) who seems to be the biological father of Rob Schneider as far as being the kind of comic relief one wants to punch repeatedly to make him shut his face. There's also a couple of nefarious martians - one of which a Bryan Cranston stand-in and another who has a mustache halfway to Connery's hairy appendage in Zardoz and Daniel Plainview - who are so uptight that their performances can't help but be laughable.I think it's advisable to go the MST3K and/or Rifftrax route for this one, but I would be curious to some day watch it without the addition of the commentary. It's so bad that it's mesmerizing at certain times, from the stultifying acting and extremely cheap sets (at one point, and this is when they're still on the ship I think, the martians put a couple of the kids in what looks like a broom closet, no mock-up done to it at all), and how it's all done with a completely straight face. It's almost excusable how one note the child actors are (if they even are actors, I think a couple of parents lost their children at the bus stop and they were plugged in to this for a week or two), but what undoes any even shred of good-will is that its Santa does the same \"conquering\" in scene after scene: he will make the martians LAUGH until they're uh still green in the face.This all leads up to a climax where one of the martians is defeated by, you guessed it(?) Santa using his dark arts to use the toys to attack him with their cuteness and toy-ish ways. The way the editing, in a montage style that I'm sure (no, I'm not) was lifted from the Eisenstein cookbook, cuts back to a laughing Santa Claus during this makes it look like he could be a serial killer instead of jolly ol' St. Nick. From the consistently terrible dialog, an occasional appearance by a newsman that looks like a marionette, and the first screen appearance by, uh, Pia Zadora(!) this is a complete mess, but a lot of fun.(PS: In full disclosure I did watch this with Rifftrax Live, and it made for a spectacular experience)",

Also the title really doesn't describe the plot. It's more about Santa befriending the Martians rather than conquering them.Martian parents are very annoyed that their kids are watching too many Earth programs on the TV. That somehow leads them to capturing two Earth kids and Santa Clause to suck the joy out of life, but Santa uses his charm to become friends with most of the Martians, but the few that still hate him plot against him.None of the actors, including the man who plays Santa Clause are likable and they all do a pretty bad job. The special effects are better than I expected, but they are still really bad... a guy in a bear costume and a really strange looking cardboard robot. The climax of the film is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, and any mildly positive thing goes away here. But even with all of it's continuity errors, terrible acting and pure strangeness, it's still better than other bad Christmas movies, such as \"Santa Claus\" (1959).My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 83 mins.",

It basically does everything wrong and should serve as a perfect example of how not to make a movie.The concept already of course sounds completely awful but the complete script is even worse than the actual concept. Basically very little actually happens within the movie and has some serious pacing problems. The movie also features an awful bunch of characters, Santa Claus himself included. I don't know who are what is more annoying, the kids, the Martians, Santa Claus, or that guy in that polar bear suit. More annoying is when suddenly burst into laughs, often without an apparent reason, to probably make the movie more cheerful and comical to watch.For a Christmas movie it also surely isn't cheerful enough. Instead its actually rather depressing. It has absolutely no Christmas spirit in it and the atmosphere is just totally wrong for this production. It's hard to say what they tried to achieve with this movie. Make a joyful season Christmas movie targeted at children or was it an attempt at making a more 'serious' science-fiction meets Santa Claus crossover, aimed toward an older audience.Of course the movie also uses tons of archive footage of rockets being blast off and also some more random footage of airplanes refueling in the air and world leader gatherings, to 'discuss the startling sudden disappearance of Santa Claus'.It's '60's science-fiction, so it features all of the usual stupid and silly looking ingredients. Next to lots of archive footage, this means that the movie also has fake looking 'futuristic' sets, awful costumes and make-up for the Martians and just also general bad fake looking sets and costumes for the robot and the earlier mentioned polar bear.Don't, under any circumstances, ever watch this movie!1/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The script is ridiculous, the acting generally pathetically bad, and the \"special effects\" could have been created by a second-grader. However, I do think it's better than a lot of junk that we're exposed to nowadays, at least on an entertainment level.The Martian king (Kimar), his wife, the mom (Momar), and their two kids (Bomar and Girmar) start off the movie with the kids unhappy and listless with their Martian existence. So, Kimar decides that the best solution is to kidnap Santa Claus and bring him to Mars in order to cheer things up. So, Santa Claus and a couple of earth kids are abducted and brought to Mars (despite the Martian bad guy Voldar's attempt to rub out Santa), where all sorts of \"hilarity\" ensues. Santa makes everyone happy, so he and the kids return to earth as the catchy song \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" plays on the soundtrack.I like this movie for the laughs it provides, even though its juvenile plot moves like molasses sometimes. As most folks know, Girmar is played by a very young Pia Zadora, though the rest of the cast is mostly unknown actors. There's atrocious dialogue to spare, and once you've heard \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" you may never get the song out of your head. Depending on your sense of humor, \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" can become an annual holiday tradition at your house. Of course, you may end up throwing it in the trash instead.",

Speaking of cardboard, part of the sets look very much like painted cardboard and the costumes hold are on the same level, it' only he stock footage of the air-force that holds any kind of quality. My guess is that this was a low budget film quickly put together without much thought for anything.

A timeless classic that reminds us of our childhood while teaching our yutes to celebrate peace, love, forgiveness and the wonder of giving to those in need. Santa, himself, would be proud of such joy a movie could bring to the whole family.Shockingly, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians isn't that movie. In fact, it's not only the opposite of the previous description, I'm sure it sparks all kids from 0-99 to question Santa's existence. Rightfully so.To hate this movie, to bash it, to say it's one of the worst movies of all time isn't really fair. Sure, I'm awarding it 1/5 stars, but come on. Its sole intention was to make a cross-genre kiddie/sci-fi movie for kids only. Well, for those under three, but still. Saying this is absolutely horrible for any age, is like saying those old Gamera films are lousy. They did serve a purpose \u2013 outside of Joel Robinson's Satellite of Love, that is.Of course, it has its many, many\u0085many problems, such as buck fifty FX, even less spent on sets, bad acting and unintentionally hilarious dialogue. Surprisingly, the number one thing wrong here is\u0085pacing. For a movie under an hour and a half, it's a wonder this movie would ever end. Okay, that goes along with the incredibly bad \"talent\" the director had, but scenes just kept going on and on past their expiration date.The second worst attribute of Santa V. Martians was just how creepy it was. Again, I believe these doofuses had good intentions at aiming their childish experiment film very low, but at times the movie got a little, well, baked. Like the filmmakers were, probably. Just look at that Kooky! climatic fight.So, we have big-green people of Mars who have \"adult-children\" (but not like the ones from Ork) who are in need of Santa to help them\u0085uh\u0085sleep and eat more. I get the eating part: Santa's rather obese, but a large and disguised male running after kids and his hired job is to get them to bed? See? Creepy.Anyways, after an extremely long space trip to Earth, the barely-painted-green Martians kidnap two annoying kids and Santa while the evil second-in-command is against this because\u0085uh\u0085Martians used to be warriors?

I can't find any definitive proof but I'm pretty sure this was made for TV.There are little breaks,it's 81 minutes and not rated and it's just very poorly made.All made for TV trademarks. The best part of the movie is Pia Zadora(who???) in the role of a lifetime as Girmar,the emotionless Martian child. So the Martians are advanced enough that they receive earth(American) TV and they understand and speak English. Yet they are dumb enough to think Santa Claus is what their planet needs. There's lots of terrible acting and plot holes. The Martians abduct Santa at gunpoint(the guns are hilarious and they never shoot anything),they also take 2 children so they won't be able to tell anyone what happened to Santa.Two seconds after they leave earth,the entire world knows Martians did it. They use stock US military footage for the space force that goes after the Martians,you know...the United States Space Force....... There are a couple Batman-esque \"Bang,Pow\" fights to counter the rambling dialogues.It's not enough to save the movie but it's something. There are apparently about 9 people on Mars,yet when one puts on Santa's spare costume,half of them think he really is Santa. The abducted children never cry or complain or ask for their mommy or to go home.They also quickly memorize all the Martians names,an amazing feat. Santa is happy and making really bad jokes the whole time and the name is a total lie.Santa Claus does nothing but make toys.At one point,the kids shoot bubbles at one Martian but that's it.

You see, San Neo Taku (Santa Claus) feels compassion for alien children, specifically Martians, who are oblivious to the everlasting joys of Christmas. However, Santa is trapped by Neo-Nazi officials who are spreading Hitler's 4th Reich propaganda across the planet Mars. Santa, and his trusted elves use the blood of Jack The Ripper to perform a ritual that vaporizes the evil Neo-Nazis. Mars is saved, and Christmas is celebrated throughout the planet.This is one of the most emotional films I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The animation is unlike anything I've ever seen. The colors and technical aspects are superb. It really makes you FEEL like Santa Claus. The acting is convincing-you can really see the emotions the characters feel throughout the movie.

For a 1964 kiddie movie, the production values are pretty good, the style, though somewhat naivistic, is consistent, and the sci-fi (always keeping in mind it's made for kids) is not bad at all. Based purely on its production values, acting, etc., most discerning people should realize that this movie doesn't deserve to be held up as an example of a particularly bad movie. I think most people who have given it a low rating must have seen it in the ridiculed MST3K version. If you look at it from the point of view of someone who is used to sci-fi, the effects and general impression are not at all poor for the time.After a few minutes of watching this, it hit me, however: The Martians are supposed to be communists. This is a movie that none-too-subtly indoctrinates American kids against the reds, whose poor children allegedly never laugh or have toys or Christmas. Santa is a representation of imperialist America, going to Mars/the Soviet Union so capitalism can triumph over communism. And it's done in so obvious and heavy-handed a way that it is frequently sickening to watch. This movie is proof that, for whichever instance of anti-capitalist indoctrination existed in eastern Europe during communism, a similar and reversely directed instance existed in the West. Insidious propaganda for kids.But, as such, also an interesting historical document.4 out of 10.",

It puzzled me for the first few minutes but once I got a grip on the toilet brush I was about to witness, it didn't seem to bother me that much. This isn't just a bad movie it redefines bad movies. If ever a holiday pipe-cleaner existed this is it.It involves a group of Martians whom have hit upon the problem that all their children ever do is watch earth television shows centering around Santa Claus. So they kidnap Santa and a group of kids so that they can do away with the big guy and focus their children's attention on more important things. Their bargain basement 'custumes' look off the rack from trips to K-mart AND the hardware store. Their spaceship looks like sets thrown out after 'Laugh-in' got cancelled.It does have one thing going for it, a catchy title. Beyond that the movie stinks to high heaven.

The Martains are rigid fools, the earth kids are good annoyingly good and the Martian children (one of whom is Pia Zadora) march through the movie with a case of stage fright.

            "content": "When is sweetness that thing that rescues the tart from bitterness, and when is it the thing that makes the already sweet sweeten to vomitus? I pondered this whilst rewatching the 1964 color film 'classic' Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. This little film routinely shows up on many folks' Worst Films Ever Made lists, along with such abominations as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Robot Monster and The Beast From Yucca Flats. Yet, while there truly is no 'more' to this film vs. the others, in terms of depth, acting, writing, cinematography, etc., there is one big difference between this film and the others: this is the only one of those films, and a half dozen more notorious 'so bad they're good' films, which was made and targeted specifically for children. The others were failures of a mature vision (so to speak), whereas this film is the failure of an immature vision; a sort of failed Elf- the Will Ferrell hit of a few years back. For that reason, it is far more difficult to pin down what exactly is the result of mere ineptitude and incredible stolidity (not to mention cheapness, for the film was not made in Hollywood, but at the 'Michael Myerberg Studios' on Long Island, New York; which was, in reality, an abandoned Air Force hangar- if legend is to be believed) and what is the result of cynical adults simply not 'getting' bygone children's entertainment fare. Think of Santa Claus Conquers The Martians as the 1960s answer to that current piece of PC PBS swill, Barney The Dinosaur. Of course, this is an instance where I am openly pondering intent (although, with such a title, what sort of serious intent could this film have?), but because that's perhaps the lone thing that might take a rational being more than an instant to decide their opinion on.The film was directed by one Nicholas Webster, who went on to a mildly successful Hollywood career as a television director, and was written by two- Paul L. Jacobon and Glenville Mareth, who did not. The film's only other claim to fame- aside from its artistic ignominy, is that it featured the film debut of Pia Zadora- the legendarily bad future softcore porno star who won a 1982 Golden Globe Award for Butterfly, purchased by her decades older billionaire husband. Zadora stars as a Martian girl called Girmar (Get it?: Girl Martian- Girmar).Here is an in depth (OK, a cursory) look at the film's narrative, such as it is: The kids of Mars are dull, lazy, and trained from birth by electronic devices to have a full store of knowledge by the time they are able to toddle (sort of like children now, who at three or four, are Internet savvy\u0085.and increasingly autistic). Worse, they are zoned out by watching mindless Earth television shows (the revenge of Newt Minnow!). The King of Mars, Kimar (Leonard Hicks), is perplexed, and asks his wife, Momar (Leila Martin, aka Mom Martian) about what's ailing their two kids, Girmar (see above) and Bomar (Christopher Month: OK, let's see\u0085.Boy Martian?). They divine that the kids are not having fun, so Kimar rallies the top leaders of Mars to visit an 800 year old sage, Chochem (Carl Don), in a Martian forest (which lacks trees), and he tells them the legend of Santa Claus, and how Mars needs a Santa Claus. I swear, Yoda from Star Wars was patterned after Don's seminal performance here\u0085. I probably first saw this film when I was five or six, less than a decade after its release, and it has stuck with me through the years- despite its flaws, which attests to the fact that it has power, from whatever source. Of course, the same can be said of herpes, but enough of that line of reasoning. The DVD version I saw was on one of those cheapo 50 pack DVDs, thus there were no special features, and the public domain version of this film is about at the level of a 20 year old VHS tape- i.e.- in some reels the Martian's look like they're wearing green skin makeup- due to desaturation; in others gray, pink or black (my wife initially thought Girmar and Bomar were black kids!); and in some others there appears to be no makeup. The music, aside from the theme song, is virtually nonexistent. The film is also notable for some of the stock footage it uses of U.S. military planes scrambling to intercept the Martian flying saucer (although, in honesty, the craft looks more like a bad erector set than Plan 9-like pie tins). The film also slips in some none too sly political references, such as Santa forgetting a reindeer's name, and calling him Nixon, then literally winking at the camera, or having the TV reporter who first informs the world of Santa's kidnapping, interview Werner Von Breen (not Braun), head of NASA- or the film's equivalent. Small moments like this almost make up for the ineptitude of good intentions, as does the casting of Ned Wertimer as the TV reporter who goes to the North Pole to interview Santa, for Wertimer would later go on to star in a small role as Ralph the doorman on the TV show The Jeffersons. But, reread the above; I wrote almost. Despite my personal affection for this winsome little horrorshow, I cannot give it an enthusiastic Ebertian thumbs up, the way I can for some of the aforementioned classic baddies. Instead, let my thumb quiver in the middle. Decide for yourself if that's a recommendation or a deleted scene of Dropo just after indulging a flatulence fetish.",

From the annoying opening and ending theme, to the horrible production values, bad story, and inept actors this has to be the worst Christmas movie out there. And there have been some really bad Christmas movies. From the title, I was almost expecting something along the lines of that fake movie in \"Scrooged\", the one with Lee Majors. However, this is just a very bad movie where martians want x-mas so they kidnap Santa. Not much in the way of fighting or conquering going on here. Santa is rather annoying, but he probably is the best actor in the film which is scary. And the less said about the one martian who dresses up as Santa the better. The child actors are not much better and there is really nothing to be said of the sets. Every thing here is rather cheap looking and there is a scene with a polar bear that is just to stupid looking, however it looks great next to the martian's robot. As for the plot, strictly by the numbers, nothing is going to surprise you here. And I know this is probably someone's favorite x-mas movie from their childhood and they are going to want to write me and tell me how this movie is about changing socialistic lifestyles through being more friendly, but please save your breath. I just thought this movie sucked and there is nothing anyone can say that will change my mind.",

This film should also have disqualified her for the infamous \"Best New Star\" award she received in 1981, not for the fact that she can't act but for the fact that she had already made her debut 17 years earlier in this monstrosity.

            "review_title": "what's worst about this infamous clunk o' junk is not the acting or the special effects or even the lack of continuity, but the harrowing impression that nobody is even trying",
            "content": "Allow me to state a firm, sincere opinion of mine right off the bat. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is one of the all-time worst, most depressing, inexcusably amateurish and unendurable movies ever made. Even at a brief clocking time of eighty-one minutes, watching it feels like eighty-one days. I seldom use the word 'hated' when discussing movies (even bad ones) but I have to here. Because on my list of the five movies I would never, ever want to see again, this ranks at #4. There is not one - not *one* - redeeming element about this clunk o' junk. Everything in it is miserable. But what's most depressingly bad about it is not the directing, the acting, the writing, the amateurish cinematography, or the special effects that are dwarfed in conviction by the amateur monster costumes I saw at the G-Fest this year. What's most terrible about this movie is the harrowing impression that nobody is even trying.For those who care, it is a children's' movie. During the other-world month of Septober, the children of Mars (or at least the present-day children of Mars) become increasingly depressed due to a lack of toys and fun and games. So one day, the king of Mars (and father of the only two Martian children I saw) decides to kidnap Santa Claus and have him manufacture toys for his children. With some goons, he kidnaps Santa and two Earth children around Christmastime and bring them to Mars. But, oh no, there's a mean old Martian with a mustache who doesn't want Santa making Martian children toys. And then...and then...Ah, who cares? What a stultification-inducing plot. And believe me, the story is even lousier. But let's shove all of that aside. Let's just pretend we live in an alternate reality universe where movies don't need plots or stories or good writing or acting or directing to be good. Let's just judge it on bad movie standards. Oh, no, it fails on that level too. The movie would like to be a funny, charming, low-key little gem but instead comes off as a shameful catastrophe. I suppose somebody once conceived it might work, but nobody even bothered to try. There are moments that by themselves may induce laughs, but when seen with the rest of the movie just force your eyes toward your watch. The movie opens up with one of the worst, most annoying songs I've ever heard as the titles (with many spelling errors such as \"custume designer\" as Crow pointed out) scroll with horrible animation. Following this is just one headache-inducing moment after another, including an outrageously bad scene with a polar bear, which is the worst monster costume until \"Hercules in New York.\" And would-be laughs with a goofy Martian bumbler just make one click the 'mute' button or hope for some violence to eliminate an annoying character.Nobody was even trying with this awful movie. There's a critical moment after the point where Santa is kidnapped, and then the movie flat-up forgets all about it. It's a scene that takes up a great deal of time and then without any explanation stops. It seems as if the screenwriter wrote the story on paper towels and used one to wipe his lips after supper. Or is it possible that instead of a screenplay, they just made this up as they went along? Heck, the sets are so cheap and the actors so deprived of enthusiasm, they could afford to.There was not a single, insignificant moment of \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" that I enjoyed. The entire thing from start to finish is a complete headache and a mind-numbing bore. It isn't quite the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is on the runner-up list and not too far behind. Very few movies have sunk so low. The most shameful thing about is that nobody is even trying. With most bad movies, there is the relieving element that at least *somebody* in the cast or crew was putting up an effort. But nobody was here. The only reason why people watch this movie is to a) see a young Pia Zadora as the Martian girl and b) to test its reputation, as I did. It is a movie that must be seen to be believed. But I implore you to take my word for it. Oh, and incidentally, the movie is called \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" Well, at what point, exactly, did Santa Claus conquer the Martians? See? Even the title makes no sense.",

Jaime Farr is in the movie in an early bit part. The toys were provided by Marx Toy Company which is now out of business. The premise is silly, but very good for a children's film of that era. The Martians decide to kidnap Santa Claus from Earth because their own children are bored and she how happy the Earth children are on television stations from earth that are picked up on Mars. The Martians go to Earth and kidnap two Earth children and make them tell them where Santa Claus lives. The fight up at Santa's work shop is classic with the polar bear who is obviously someone in a costume. The Martians kidnap Santa Claus and the two children and take them back to Mars. On the journey back one of the Martians tries to eliminate Santa Claus and the two children, but he underestimates Santa's power of escape and wisdom. The Martian leader tries to make the Earth children feel at home but they miss the earth and their parents. The final confrontation scene in the toy workshop on Mars is laughable, but still good fun.

            "review_title": "It's hard to imagine a worse Holiday movie...",
            "content": "Many cult movies owe their newfound popularity to Mystery Science Theater 3000. It was a remarkable program, in that it dissected all of a film's shortcomings. They had a heyday with this one. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians fell into obscurity after its release until it was featured on the show. There are probably more holiday science fiction films out there, but if they are in anyway similar to this one, then I don't want to see them. The movie is a complete disaster in presentation, editing, acting, plot, and special effects. It even has an inappropriate title.May I spoil the plot for you? I feel obligated since the title is misleading. Santa doesn't conquer the Martians. No one conquers anything. It's just a simple story of one planet's (Mars) desperate need of Christmas cheer. Martian ruler Kimar (get the joke) decides that his children, Bomar (isn't it funny) and Girmar (fake laughter) aren't acting like normal. They watch too many Earth TV shows and are despondent for no obvious reason. Somehow, Kimar is convinced by the planet elder that Santa Claus can make the children happy. So he and his trusty sidekicks Voldar and Dropo depart for Earth.Once their tin can on a string, I mean spaceship, arrives on Earth, they kidnap two Earth children named Billy and Betty (where's Bertha?) to help them locate the real Santa Claus. The scene shifts to the North Pole which looks like a high school stage which paper snowflakes. Kimar and Voldar apprehend Santa and return to the ship. On board, Billy tampers with the craft's radar cloak which allows a US spaceship to \"gain on (them)\" but never actually catch them.On Mars, Kimar builds Santa a toy factory operated by Dropo and the four children (who are the only kids in the whole movie). Voldar decides that Mars should return to its status as a warrior planet and vows to end Santa's reign of holiday camp. Thank God for that! Too bad he fails to notice that \"Santa\" is Dropo wearing a suit and mistakenly tries to negotiate with Kimar who arrests him. Santa then suggests that Dropo take his place as \"Martian Santa\" so he can return to Earth with Billy and Betty.There is a lot more fiction than science in this so-called science fiction piece. How can both the Martians and Earthlings not need space suits while traveling on each other's planets? How can Earth children magically acquire winter clothing when they reach the North Pole? I'm glad they do since the film indicates that temperatures are -91\u00b0 Fahrenheit there. The entire movie also takes place from early December until Christmas Eve which is enough time for a round trip between planets. Why doesn't anyone notice the UFO when it lands in Billy and Betty's suburb? The gaps in logic aren't nearly as poor as the acting. None of the child actors possesses the ability to add intonation to his or her voice. All lines are flat and monotone. Oddly enough, most of the adults overact worse than Jack Nicholson ever did. Dropo is worst of all. He constant spews ridiculously corny jokes in such an over-the-top matter that Bill McCutcheon knew how lame they were when he performed them. \"What's green and roasts over a fire? A Martian-mellow!\" is one such joke.I also noticed a slightly political twist to this movie. Martian children aren't as happy as Earth children because they are \"fed information from birth by a machine attached to their heads\" (actual dialog). Little Earthlings get to frolic and play without a brain machine in sight. A newsperson notes that the Martian spaceship isn't a Soviet Union product. Why was that line included, I wonder? Draw the obvious allegories and you'll notice the subversive effect this movie could have on its intended child audience. This film was released in 1964, right after the Cuban Missile Crisis, so I'm not surprised that it has this message. Nevertheless, I find directing propaganda towards children particularly distasteful. Had the USSR not been directly referenced, I wouldn't condemn the film but that reference firmly establishes its intent.This movie was recently placed in public domain and is available on Netflix for instant download. In the pantheon of crappy Christmas movies, this film is one of the worst. I'd recommend the MST3000 version more than the real one. It highlights the errors more thoroughly than I can here. I don't recommend movies for camp alone, so I advise you to watch another bad Christmas movie.",

Sadly neither the first or the second of the discs that I bought got further than the middle of the film, when a man in a polar bear suit, made by someone who had clearly never seen a real one appeared.So I have been waiting for it to be shown on TV to find out what happened in the end for closure and I have to say that if it didn't even interest my Mother, who watches all sorts of badly made, B-Movie, 'Murdoch Mysteries' sort of rubbish, then it was never going to wow me and she switched off to check her eyelids for holes pretty early on.Once the robot Targ arrived, like something made in Primary School for a play, I knew that it was only going to go even further downhill than Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) had already taken it.Having watched a lot of 'The Two Ronnies' comedy stylings lately, I found this film to bear a strong resemblance to their approach to sketches and I could easily see them replicating this situation with the same humorous results and without losing any credit as comedy sketch writers.Kimar (Leonard Hicks) could easily have been played by Charlton Heston, not only because he sounded just like him, but because the acting was of that sort of calibre, poor as it was from basically everyone.And as if the idea of Martians kidnapping Santa Claus wasn't daft enough, the end result was just stupid.Also, the execution of the film and the \"Special Effects\", special like a painting from a kid at nursery school, were dire and odd to say the least. Talk about a shoestring budget.A badly done B-Movie, that should probably be a Z-Movie instead, because it didn't even provide that usual fun charm that others like 'Flash Gordon' (1980) have had.349.01/1000.",

Santa Claus Conquers The Martians combines a typical 50's-mid 60's B-movie obsession with UFOs with a typical TV Christmas movie feel. One of the things that sticks out about the movie for me was that it didn't portray the Martians as the usual \"evil, murderous aliens\" they usually were in B-movies of this time period (well, except for Voldar). Their desire to make their children happy is what leads them to kidnap Santa Claus. Santa seems more than willing to help out the Martians, even running the toy shop without complaining. All is well at the end for everybody- Santa and the earth children go home, the evil Voldar is humiliated and defeated, and Droppo is inaugurated as Mars' very own Santa Claus.

            "content": "Kids, for the most part, are not stupid. Despite the countless gloom-and-doomers who despair of this or that being a \"negative influence\" on the younger generations, my experience has taught me that children are not merely innocent sponges that absorb whatever happens to be at hand. They have much more awareness and understanding, I think, than they are often given credit for.I cannot imagine any child over the age of three being taken in for one moment by \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,\" a movie that seems to have been made under the delusion that children are complete idiots who will believe anything you tell them and are unable of accepting anything but the most basic of concepts. That alone makes it contemptible, and when you throw in cheap sets, bad acting, laughable dialogue, and non-existent special effects, the result is heaven (and/or hell) for the bad movie aficionado.The movie begins in mid-Septober--at least according to the Martians, who, despite having adopted Earthling language, food (albiet food in pill form), and television, have for some reason completely rejected the Gregorian calendar. But it's early December on the planet next door, and kids all over the world are eagerly anticipating a visit from Santa Claus (like most movies about Santa, this one ignores a) the large portion of the Earth's population and their children who do not, for various reasons, celebrate Christmas and b) any and all religious significance of Christmas itself). But Martian head honcho Kimar wants to draft Kris Kringle into bringing Christmas joy to the little green boys and girls--represented by his kids Bomar and Girmar--who are suffering from, I don't know, not having toys or something. So the Martians hijack St. Nick--bringing along a couple Earth rugrats for good measure--a development which Santa takes with frightening good cheer, even when the requisite bad guy Martian tries to throw him and the kids out of the airlock. You'd think he'd be angry at someone who'd murder a couple children, or at least be mildly worried about disappointing the Earth kids while he's being carted around the solar system, but no--he takes it all in stride.The whole movie takes place in that weird parallel dimension found in old \"educational\" short films and some early sitcoms. You know the one: everyone is squeaky clean and unflinchingly polite (except the bad guy, who just hates everything on general principle), and speak only in exposition. Nobody is allowed to think or do anything that would stand in the way of the plot--such as the end, where the painfully-unfunny comic relief Martian is mistaken for Santa Claus despite it being inescapably obvious that, well, he isn't. Ethnicity is unheard of. Women are either scolding or shrewish (Mrs. Claus) or dutiful homemakers (the mother Martian). The latter is played by Leila Martin, who later was in \"Phantom of the Opera\" on Broadway, a fact I mention because I saw her in that show and can attest that she's a very capable actress,which is not something you'd know from this movie.There's more, of course. I haven't even covered the guy in the polar bear suit. The Martian robot, who may very well be the polar bear guy in a different outfit. And Dropo, the aforementioned non-comic non-relief whose stylings, much like a natural disaster, need to be experienced firsthand in order to understand the horror of it. But enough.

The characters are extremely annoying, their costumes are ridiculous, and the settings are cheap and pathetic. Mothers, don't expect this to be a silly family flick that your kids can enjoy. NO! This is garbage! However, it contains one positive element. Unlike \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\" (another awful awful movie), \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is not seriously bad, but rather comically bad. The MST3K version is extremely funny and could satisfy all those with a sense of humor on a relaxing or boring day. One of my favorite moments occurs when the two Earth kids are being chased by a man... in a bear costume. For its ridiculousness, this film gets an extra point. Overall, a 2 out of 10.",

John Call plays Santa like he's had far too much egg nog. And the sudden shifts in plot and mood are more jarring than those found in more famous midnite monstrosities such as BARBARELLA. The Martians are a scream, and the sets are right out of Captain Video. The plot really isn't much different or more advanced than the Saturday morning shows many of us grew up on.  No its not Citizen Kane or Schindler's List.  It is so much on the other end of the spectrum that it HAS  to be watched!  So turn on your tv. Tune in this movie.

Sure-fire top forty stuff.Martian children are watching earth broadcasts and lamenting there is no Santa Claus on Mars. (The tv reception is excellent on Mars, so apparently Time-Warner cable is not involved.) Anyway, the kids' father, Kimar, decides he will go to earth and put the bag on Santa. He is accompanied by the villainous Voldar and the moronic Dropo. They all look like teletubbies.Santa is a bit senile - he refers to one of his reindeer as \"Nixon,\" presumably the one with the sweat on his lip. The Jolly Old Soul is accosted in his workshop by a Martian robot, who tosses around a few elves before Santa calms it down. Kimar and Voldar arrive and convince Santa at ray-gun point to come to Mars and make the children happy. Santa agrees, and when you see his wife, you'll know why he is anxious to get off this planet. Accompanying him on the trip are little Billy and Betty, who were snatched in the woods after giving up Santa's whereabouts. Stoolies.The rest of the film, if you've stayed awake so far, pretty much has Santa making toys and Voldar trying to gum up the works. In the exciting finale, Voldar is toyed into submission by Santa and the kids.I actually recognized a few people in this cast. Vincent Beck, as Voldar, talked so loudly I kept hoping his moustache would fall off. Ned Wertimer, famous as the doorman on \"The Jeffersons,\" plays a roving reporter. I never heard of Gene Lindsey, but he plays a polar bear and makes one yearn for their extinction. I would never have recognized 8-year-old Pia Zadora as a green-faced Martian kid.By all means, have the kids watch this on Christmas Eve.

Does it deserve this dubious distinction? I would say \"no\"; compared to the bombs skewered on MST3K such as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" or \"Monster A Go-Go,\" \"Santa Claus\" comes off relatively well. For one thing, those responsible for this movie appear to have been able to operate a camera and microphones in a reasonably competent way, which already places it on a higher plane than some movies. So, this is definitely not one of the worst ever.That said, \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is nevertheless a abysmally bad movie. How bad? Well, let me put it this way: imagine the corniest, cheesiest, most broadly overacted and painfully unfunny '60s-era sitcom you might have had the misfortune to catch on Nick at Nite or TV Land some evening (I am talking \"Gilligan's Island\"-level bad). Now imagine a movie that makes that sitcom look like \"The Wire\" in comparison. This should give you some idea of how tediously stupid \"Santa Claus\" is.Of the various players in this monstrosity, probably the one who escapes with at least a shred of dignity is Victor Stiles, who plays one of the two kids from Earth. Stiles brings at least a little conviction and naturalness to his role (although he also probably benefits from being one of the few cast members who does not have to wear a ridiculous costume of some kind).By contrast, the worst player in \"Santa Claus\" is, without a doubt, Bill McCutcheon as the Martian Dropo (although John Call's creepy Santa Claus gives him a run for his money). The \"comic relief\" in this mess, Dropo will make you long for the charm and wit of Jar Jar Binks.Do not even think about watching this without the MST3K (or Cinematic Titanic) commentary.

            "content": "This review is not concerned with the plot or details of this film, rather the aim is to explain why it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. If you're looking for plot details, skip this review.I am a fan of films; I've seen the AFI top 100, and the IMDb top 125 to name a few. I've watched numerous forgettable films. As a result of my film watching experience, I've determined some criteria for what makes a film truly awful. I am most displeased to announce this movie meets all criteria with resounding success, and may in fact have displaced Ironheart as the worst movie ever.1. A terrible film should start off with some promise (to raise your expectations against your will), and then quickly and progressively get worse. This film does this wonderfully. As I recall, the first 2 minutes are the best scenes of the film, and look like the movie will score a solid 4 or 5 out of 10. Shortly thereafter, absolute drivel is introduced, and the plot and script spiral into ineptitude with absolute finesse.2. All the actors are relatively talentless, and of the same caliber. This is necessary, to avoid an actors performance standing out, as good or bad. A good or bad performance can give the viewer a focus for the intense dislike of the film. I'm proud to say, I can't remember anything of the acting at all, except for the first 2 minutes, in which Santa Claus gives a reasonable mediocre performance from his workshop.3. Most miserable movies tend to fail by accidentally including some scene that results in laughter. Those that do it too much can become enjoyable cult classics, such as Barbarella, or The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This film sadistically and unfailingly pounds the viewer with scene after scene of insipid drivel.4. An awful film should have an inconsistent plot for the obvious reason that it makes it difficult to follow what's going on. I think the film had a relatively consistent plot, and stuck to it. However, it succeeded here on a new level beyond my wildest imagining. It's clear from the first moment this film starts that it's intended audience is children, or soon to be dysfunctional families. Typical with such films, there is a moral message, and this movie is no exception. I'm delighted to discover I've managed to burn it out of my brain, but I'm sure it was along the lines of be nice and get along, share stuff and don't kidnap people. The point is, as I'm watching this insipid driveling film, minute after minute, I am forced to think of these young kids watching this film, and unwittingly having their innocent minds twisted by this mess. By sticking to the plot, the makers of this film forced me to continue my nightmare visions of mental torture of children. In this film, sticking to the plot made it worse, and thus a more successfully bad movie.5. The most important criteria from any film, good or bad, is to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Boredom doesn't count. What I look for in a miserable film are feelings of anger, sadness, or revenge. As with Ironheart, it was a struggle to continue watching this movie. I was angry with the producers of this film, and everyone else involved in the project, including those responsible for it's digitization, so that it's evil could continue to spread. As with Ironheart, I wanted to destroy this film before it was complete. I was deeply saddened by the loss of 90 minutes of my life spent on this drivel. Finally, I wanted to get revenge on everyone involved in the project by subjecting them to repeated watchings of this movie. What surprised and impressed me most about this film, is that I wanted to destroy it much earlier into the film than I did with Ironheart. I think it was about 45 minutes for this one, and about 60 for Ironheart.6. It should go without saying, but a terrible movie should have no redeeming features at all. Clearly this movie fails in that regard, since it eventually ends. However, the makers save the best for last; a horrible song, with words that appear on the screen so the kids can sing along. I'll never be able to forget \"Hooray for Santy Claus.\" Yes, Santy Claus. Ugh...This movie easily scores 0 out of 10, a tie with only one other film - Ironheart. I strongly recommend that no experienced, thinking individual watch it.",

While it's not as bad or as weird as the Mexican Santa Claus movie, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is dreadful and goofy in its own right.Its premise: two equally mythical types, Santa Claus and Martians, are both real. The Martians are worried about their wooden faced, lethally depressed kids, who never smile or play or have any fun. The leader of the Martians goes to consult an oracle to see what he can do. Thre oracle is a guy so asthmatic that you just want to jump into the screen and hand him an inhaler. He wheezes out that the children need Santa Claus to cheer them up. How so, I must ask? Santa has always reminded me of an alcoholic pedophile drug addict, and this one's no exception. What is he smoking in that pipe when he's on t.v. that makes him so goofy? A touch of the wacky weed, perhaps? And Mrs. Claus is equally scary, hitting Santa and generally bullying him. They need marriage counseling, big time.Anyhoo, the Martians determine to come to Earth and kidnap Santa. But these idiots in their tiny spangled jumpsuits and stupid antennae helmets can't even use their equipment to find out where Santa is! So they go and ask to annoying little Earth trolls..err...children, and then kidnap them so they can't tell anyone that Martians exist. So they saddled themselves with these little morons? I'd have just pushed them out an airlock and been done with them, as one of the Martians tries to do.They go to the North Pole to make off with St. Nick, and somehow the Earth brats escape from their ship. Instead off freezing into little kiddie popsicles(they're at the North Pole! In the winter!) the whiny little dopes wander around the fake snow set, and get chased by a guy in the worst polar bear costume ever. it looks like a white shag rug with really cheap seams.The Martians have a huge robot that's supposed to help them make off with Santa, but old Mr. Claus does something to the robot so they have to leave it behind. TOoo bad they couldn't have left those kids behind, as well. They take off, pursued by the air force. The kids and Santa are treated to one of the dopiest characters in the film, the comic relief Droppo. He's apparently the laziest man on Mars, and he's a pure numb skull as well. Why wasn't he chucked out the airlock? Or at least kicked hard?They get to Mars, and Santa sets to work making cheap knock off toys for the Martian brats. Some of the Martians don't like Santa(big surprise) and they try to wreck the workshop and they lock Santa up. I say good for them. I'd have done the same. Bury that crazy old pervert somewhere deep, so that he can't come back and twist another generation of Earth children. But nooo...The 'good' Martians save Santa, and Christmas goes off without a hitch. Everybody's happy. yay! I guess. This movie just reminds me how much I really, REALLY hate Christmas movies.",

Being much more intelligent than people from planet Earth, they kidnap some kids first to tell them where Santa can be found. \"What's that on your head?\" asks the girl. \"An antenna\", replies the Martian. Then the girl asks: \"Are you a television set?\" This aggravates the Martian version of Grumpy, who thinks television and Santa Claus turn the kids into nincompoops.Anne Robinson (the cruel host from The Weakest Link) once said she hated children's tv because the presenters always shouted and treat the kids like morons. The same can be said for this movie. It's not because it's a movie for kids that it can get away with a stupid plot. A movie where children's footprints are only noticed after the Martians discovered the children have escaped. A movie where Mrs. Claus is portrayed as a brainless plant. A movie where the dwarfs are paralyzed by the Martian's guns (it's a pity the actors can't stand still). A movie where Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians.

Mainly because after seeing this crap, I felt like committing homicide.I don't know when you're sleeping, I don't know when you're awake, but I know when a movie's been bad or good, so don't watch this for goodness sake. The plot is basically that the children of Mars are too serious and adult-like for their own good, so the ruler of Mars has to go kidnap Santa Claus from Earth to teach their children to laugh at the advice of an 800-year-old Martian on crack who explodes in and out of reality. They also pick up two Earthling children as well on their raid of doom named Billy and Betty (creative names, huh?). They take the threesome back to Mars and they begin to make toys. Along the way they inform Santa he can never return to Earth, although they feel sympathetic towards the children. The bad guy, who hates laughter and fun sabotages the toy factory by snipping wires (a master plan, no?) and a strange fight scene ensues between the plucky youngsters and the cruel and vindictive Martians.I saw this after buying it for a dollar at my grocery store, thinking it strange and bizarre at best. After seeing it, I learned from my doctor I now only have one kidney, lung, and eyeball and my spleen has to be removed from my body due to the intense radiation poisoning I received from watching the movie. My brother suffered chest and brain hemorrhage.Okay, I was exaggerating, but despite the creative plot and loony cast (including probably-mentally handicapped Martian Droppo, possibly the best worst character since Torgo and a family composed of Momar the mom, Bomar the boy, and Girmar the girl) things could have been better. I was truly shocked to learn this was produced in the 1960s. I was actually thinking it may have been from the 1940s. I will list below some of the best (and occasionally funniest) parts of the movie.The best part is probably the fight scene. Betty, Billy, Bomar, and Girmar attack the evil fun-loving Martian with toys, some of which attack with furies of their own, such as a legion of toy soldiers and a tank. The horrible camera views and terrible music, backed up with Santa laughing like a severely deranged maniac in the background, made me both scream in terror at the thought that this was made by a human and laughing for the same reason. By the way, Santa makes horrible jokes and laughs at the most inappropriate moments throughout the film (such as walking into a room laughing like a goon for no reason and laughing for about 10 minutes), as well as smokes a bubble pipe, although I doubt that those are soap bubbles coming from the pipe. Another great scene is when Billy and Betty are at the North Pole and are attacked by a \"polar bear\" which is the crappiest suit since the \"mutant\" suit from Lost Skeleton of Cadavra (which was different as that was intentional). When one of them pointed saying \"Look!\" I have to admit I was expecting a wampa to attack. Also, there is a killer robot shown on the cover, which gets about five minutes of screen time, as it is \"turned into a toy\" by Santa's mystical superpowers and completely forgotten.All in all, this is far from the \"heartwarming children's tale\" it set itself up to be. The actors are on drugs and there are too many parts were the plot makes no sense. When you watch, try not to shout, try not to cry, try not to scream, 'cause I've told you why.",

The Martians are especially fun to watch. They have what looks like a vacuum hose on their heads for no apparent reason. They also have coat hanger antenna that the earth children think makes them look like televisions. The two earthling children are really obnoxious. They can always get away from the Martians, but they always seem to get caught. There were at least 2 elements of the script that were never resolved. Why didn't the martians retrieve their robot from earth if they didn't want to be discovered? and Whatever happened to the Rockets Earth sent up after the Martians?

When they got to they North Pole, the two children were almost mauled by a guy in a polar bear suit,they capture Santa Claus, and head back to Mars. When they get back to Mars, Santa starts making toys for the children, but not without resistance. Voldar and other Martians form to dis-troy Santa Claus, but in the end, they get caught,and Santa and the kids went back to Earth.This movie is one of the worst ever!!! Here are 10 of the most unrealistic, disturbing and stupid things in that movie:1.Droppo,the terribly gay martian 2.The polar bear 3.Torg,the martian robot who is turned into a toy by Santa 4.Milton Delugg, the guy who did the music in this movie. 5.

OK, so the film itself may have some problems with performances, continuity, etc., but the bottom line is that it is made for CHILDREN. And as a child, I thoroughly enjoyed it; so much so, that I still remember it fondly today some 20 years later! Some reviewers may have issues with this film when compared with the technology in films today, but one must keep in mind when this film was made. It was the early 60's, the space race was at it's height and USA had yet to make it to the moon! Misconceptions may abound in the plot, but they were pretty common in the 60s/70s. I love Star Wars although there is a world of difference between the original film and Episode III, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable (although my daughter thinks Star Wars is boring and old fashioned...gasp).Although the film may not be worthy of top honors, it certainly does not belong in the bottom of the heap with the likes of Gigli, Glitter or Crossroads (which I believe has a better rating...WHAT?!?).Maybe this would be a classic today if it was animagic (like Mad Monster Party) instead of with actors, but I still recommend children see it at least once in their lives.",

The aliens look like Halloween costumes. A scary polar bear that chases 2 children is clearly a man in a suit. Everything visually is so poor that a recording of a school play would arguably look better.The acting is not the worst, but no actors were getting nominations either.And you know what?

A few years later, whilst playing the part of Anne Frank on stage, she was so bad, that when the German troopers arrived, the audience shouted '...she's in the attic...' This film does not, however, rank up there with the 60's Godzilla and Gamera movies, which really had a style of their own.

And a good question, from all this:Santa Claus Conquers The Martians; despite the title, there is more chance of this crap conquering your mentality.

When I first saw it, I thought it was the WORST movie ever made, (watching Manos and Monster-A-Go-Go changed my mind on that one).The whole movie is an assault on our sanity. The lousy acting, idiotic dialogue, props that are rejects from Lost In Space, and Dropo. Like Torgo, Dropo cannot be explained, he must be seen. Torgo at least was interesting, (funky knees and all), but Dropo is the type of person you want to strangle, OVER and OVER again. My favorite line is when Tom Servo says \"Hehe, KILL HIM!\" referring to Dropo.The music is also irritating, the kids soo whiny you that want them to join Hitler's Youth, the spaceship faker than a Clinton promise, and John Call as Santa is also enough to make you ponder having those final two tequilas and sticking your head in the oven.But, I have never laughed so hard at a movie as I did this one. I am glad that is now shown every Xmas on AMC, etc. I just regret I overtaped the ending of on my tape of the MST version.Horray for Santa! (and get a better spaceship!)",

There is no one to save Santa but for a bumbling Martian and two Earth kids who are inappropriately dressed for the situation.  I mean, the kids go to the North Pole, where it is supposed to be -90 degrees dressed in sweaters, hats, and mittens!  The girl was wearing a skirt, for crying in the eggnong!  A skirt!  I am from Wisconsin, where it routinely dips below zero, and NO ONE goes outside in that kind of weather dressed so stupidly!  You'd freeze before you'd know it!  And the kids never got so much as frostbite!  Not even hypothermia!Anyway, it's a very stupid movie, but really entertaining in the way that only very stupid movies can be.

In the case of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, I would like to nominate it as the first film that's so bad it's utterly hilarious.Starring a group of nobodies and a young girl who should've remained a nobody (Pia Zandora), the film battles with a low budget and poor acting all throughout. The story is actually relatively original for a movie of this budget: Martian children are growing bored and listless, causing the adults on Mars to kidnap Santa Claus to try and alleviate this condition.Beyond the story, most of the rest of the movie is too funny for words. Santa acts like a drunkard, the Martians use a freeze ray on some of our heroes (that doesn't work as the actors don't know how to stand still), a man in an extremely fake bear suit chases two Earth children (who act so poorly that I can hardly believe they're actually children), a robot is made out of cardboard boxes and dryer tubes, and so on, and so forth.Despite the film's obvious low quality, I think everybody should watch it at least once. The film is so full of unintentional humor that it makes it well worth the small investment. (I've heard there is also a Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this episode, but I've yet to watch it. I'm sure it's quite hilarious, though.)",

However, there is a somewhat indescribable charm to this film - it's so bad that it's kinda good. I guess that's why Experiment 321 of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" is so utterly memorable (well, that and Crow's brilliant Christmas carol entitled \"Let's Have a Patrick Swayze Christmas\").There's no denying that this movie really sucks on a lot of levels. In a world where everyone believes in Santa Claus, KID-TV reporter Rip Taylor holds a \"person-to-person\" interview with the big man, preparing to go out on Christmas eve \"the old fashioned way\" (guns a-blazin' and everything). While C. Everett Koop's children toil away in the workshop, the residents of Mars are experiencing a rebellion. At least according to Chochum, the spontaneously combustible wise man of the planet who explains that the Martian children need a source of happiness - namely, a fat little man in a red suit (no, not Truman Capote). As a result, Kimar leads a troupe of Martians in their cricket lighter on an expedition to Earth to kidnap the bearded one and take him back to the red planet. Of course, mustachioed Voldar is against the whole thing, but nobody cares about his plights to preserve the planet's heritage. Instead, they grill Billy and Betty Foster (kids who live in the woods with a radio as a parental substitute) for Santa's location, and the kids squeal immediately. So it's off to the North Pole, or maybe just Minnesota in October...whatever, it's a place inhabited by dopey guys in polar bear costumes. Using an equally dopey guy in a robot costume to break into Santa's workshop, the aliens immobilize those who oppose them with Wham-O Air Blasters and capture the fat man - who seems to have no qualms with this whole thing, surprisingly.Voldar's still foaming at the mustache over Operation Santa Claus, and he plans to flush him and the kids out the airlock. But Mr. Claus has a nasty habit of surviving, and they're soon back on Mars, the planet of no child labor laws whatsoever. While Santa runs his sweatshop, Martian dope Dropo plays dress-up in Santa's spare suit (and spare beard - you know, just in case) and ends up being mistaken for the real thing by Voldar and his not-very-perceptive henchmen (who include Jamie Farr and Jimmy Durante). Eventually, Voldar receives his just desserts for trying to preserve the proud heritage of the Planet of War when the children attack him with an endless barrage of toys (not since the pie fight scene in \"The Great Race\"! Not since the mud slide scene in \"McLintlock\"! Not since the wagon race scene in \"The Hallelujah Trail\"! Not since the chess-playing scene in \"The Seventh Seal\"! Not since the orgy scene in \"Caligula\"!...Well, maybe not those last two). A Merry Christmas is had by all who believe that \"Santa is within all of us\".It tries, it really does. Sure, it falls flat on its face a lot, but it's just so much fun to watch it do so. I guess you could say it's got camp value...but either way, I wouldn't try to watch it without a shadowrama along the bottom of the screen. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a hankerin' for some chocolate ice cream food pills.See, 'cause...it's Mars...",

They want to be children again, like children on Earth. This problem could be easily resolved by banning the viewing of Earth TV on Mars, but instead Kimar, the cape-clad leader and his gang of moronic, tight-wearing martian minions set out to find Santa. They get all the way to Earth before they realize they have no clue where to find the jolly old elf (and they call themselves superior). To locate him, they ask then kidnap some stupid kids. They all head to the North Pole, where the kiddies escape, almost freeze to death in their skimpy skirts and stupid hats and hide from a vicious, man-eating polar bear costume (I kid you not) only to be captured by a robot one of the martians built after dumpster diving (you'll have to see that to get it). The martians storm Santa's workshop and lay the freeze-down on some elf behind and the Mrs. before taking the big man back with them. One of the Martians has a hairy creature living under his nose and is evil. He wants to 86 Santa and the Earthlings so the kids of Mars will stay in line. Not going to happen. I don't even feel like talking about Droppo. Must have taken three seconds to think up his name. In the end, Santa gets to come back to Earth after making everyone laugh.

We then see on \"Kids News\" an interview with Santa himself. Martain children see this, and they're so depressed without Santa that they won't eat or sleep. So their father goes to see an old troll in the deserts of Mars who apparently knows everything. The troll, who looks like Tim the Enchanter from Monty Python, jumps to the conclusion that they need Santa on Mars.The martians get confused when they see a Santa everywhere, so they get 2 kids who without a struggle get in the martian spaceship and go to the North Pole. Once there, the kids escape and face an oh-so-menacing guy in a polar bear suit crawling around on his arms and legs, and a large cardboard robot called Torg. The martians kidnap Santa and use a poor freeze-gun that is supposed to keep them from moving. They still move.On Mars, Santa sets up a mechanical toy shop that only builds 5 or 6 different toys and plays horrible organ music when it's working. If tampered with, it puts teddy bear heads on dolls and doll heads on teddy bears! This movie is terrible, but everyone needs to see it once in their lives.

Not to mention his costume of cardboard boxes and dryer tubes. Even better, was the music done by The Laziest men on Mars integrating SSCTM dialogue. So rejoice in its sheer horribleness! And also, I hear a 2002 remake is on the way. This I must see.",

            "content": "This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. Yes, yes, I know some people tend to over-dramatize the extent of their hatred for something, but I assure you, I joke not. This is excrement in its purest form. I have no doubt in my mind that the next time I have to use a toilet, a DVD with \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" on the cover, will plop into the ivory bowl. Did it even have a budget(i.e. man in god-awful polar bear costume)? Aside from the alien mother(who I found to be rather intoxicating for an early 60's film) the other actors seemed to be as clueless as I was about what the hell was going on. I was bored. You'll be bored, too. I don't know what drugs good ole' Santy Claus was taking when he made this movie, but he could not have looked, or sounded, any more tanked than Colin Farrel at happy hour. They must have told the fat, red man that a mountain of weed would be waiting for him at the end of shooting this garbage. You know how there are some movies that are funny and others are just plain stupid? This one belongs in the category of the latter. I literally felt embarrassed for all the actors, especially the children. These poor young lads and lasses would no doubt have killed their film careers by even being mentioned in the opening credits. When the film finally did end (a time period that seemed to span somewhere in the proximity 50 or more years) I promised myself that I would never subject myself to any movie that had the combination of \"Santa Claus\" or \"Martian\" in the film's title. Thank the lord, Jesus H. Christ, I didn't waste any of my money renting this worthless excuse for a film (and I use that term loosely). Do NOT rent this film. Buy a new hat or something.",

We searched the papers for something decent and this was the only movie that sounded at all interesting. I don't remember a lot from when I was ten but because this movie was so horrible I remember it. The acting was absolutely horrible, the special effects were something kids would do in their dads garage. I remember being embarrassed that I was watching it and for the first time in my short life I walked out halfway through a movie. I can't believe I even lasted that long. This movie is not even worth watching just to be disgusted or to say you watched it. Please, do not watch this movie. It would be better to spend 2 hours cleaning the floor with a tooth brush than to subject your brain to absolute garbage.",

I don't think that i can ever sit through this whole movie again unless im watching it on MST3K.  I can't believe that i was watching this on AMC (American Movie Classics) channel.",

I don't know whether it was because of all the food I had consumed throughout the day or just pure boredom but for some reason, I sat down with my father and viewed this hysterical holiday film. First you have the martians, grown men in bright green makeup and funny hats. Their names are so ridiculous that you cannot even remember who is who. These martians are frightened that their children are becoming boring (probably because they are fed math problems and equations through their tentacles all day long) so they ask an 800 year old swamp creature who looks like a cross between Yoda and Planet of the Apes what to do. He tells them to kidnap Santa Claus!!! At this point, I should have walked out on the movie but I continued due to ridiculous curiosity. Basically, the Martians make a trip to earth in a space ship that looks like a Bic lighter and kidnap two innocent children from a park. Along with the Children they head to the north pole. The children escape at the pole and attempt to warn Santa of the Martian plans but are stopped short by a polar bear that looks like the Snuggle bear from those laundry commercials and a robot who looks like corrogated cardboard and crushes things. The rest of the idiotic movie is Santa building a martian northpole on mars and giving \"Dropo the drunken martian\" the position of Martian Saint Nick. Then, Santa and the children head back to earth just in time for Christmas eve. After viewing this insane film and laughing hysterically throughout, I had to review it and warn the public. Do not view \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\"!!! It is without a doubt one of the single dumbest movies I have ever seen.",
