            "content": "Children and adults alike are decidedly ill served by \"Inspector Gadget,\"  a frenetic but genuinely mirthless live action take on the popular Saturday morning cartoon series that mires poor Matthew Broderick in the role of a nerdish do-gooder who gets the chance to live out his heroic fantasies when he is converted into a one-man, self-contained crime fighting cybernetic arsenal.Thanks to current state-of-the-art special effects, the filmmakers manage to effectively translate the cartoonish  aspects of the original to the live action format.  Despite a few glaringly bad shots utilizing rear screen projection, the visuals that help to realize the infinite gadgets at the inspector's disposal are genuinely jaw-dropping.What the movie makers couldn't (or, at least, wouldn't) come up with is a decent script - without which all the greatest special effects in the world cannot a quality film make.  Gadget is surrounded by a gallery of dull, poorly written caricatures ranging from a giddy, self-absorbed mayor, to a gruff, shortsighted chief of police, and an effete mad scientist bent on creating an army of indestructible gadget warriors, with which, of course, he (ho hum) plans to rule the world.  Even the newly \"hipified\" gadget mobile comes across as a charmless, grating irritant as he provides a constant stream of witless one-liners as running commentary to the action.Of the actors, Broderick and Rupert Everett cannot be faulted since both provide a degree of enthusiasm wholly unwarranted by the inferior screenplay with which they are saddled.  For a perfect marriage of sophisticated writing and unsurpassable special effects, check out \"Toy Story 2.\"   And see what \"Inspector Gadget\" might indeed have been.",

I wanted to like it (Matthew Broderick is one of my favorite actors of the 90's), but he is undermined by effects (some good, some pointless) and a Rupert Everett claw man.  Only one part of this film is remotely watchable, that is the end where there is a seminar for bad guys including the metal mouth from the James Bond films and Mr. T.  I reccomend that part to movie buffs, but thats it.  If you are really interested though, just watch the cartoon version, which is at least reccomended for kids.  Among the worst of the year (unfortunately).  D+",

            "content": "In between 1987 and 1990 (in between the ages of 5 and 8), \"Inspector Gadget\" was one TV show I couldn't miss. It was a crucial show to my childhood. I was actually pretty open-minded when I saw the trailers and commercials and stuff for the movie. When I found out it was going to premiere on the Starz channel, I sat and watched, for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then I got up, left, and came back in time to see the ending credits. I was just dumbfounded. There were SO MANY things WRONG with this movie:1. Chief Quimby. In the cartoon, he would give Gadget his assignment, usually by popping up in the most bizarre of places (akin to \"Get Smart's\" Agent 13). Once Gadget got his assignment, he'd toss the paper back to the chief. Of course, EVERY assignment ended with \"This Message Will Self Destruct,\" and when Gadget tossed the paper back at Quimby, KA-BLAM!!!! Usually when the assignment blew up in the chief's face, he'd lose it. And that was about the only time you'd see Quimby lose it in the cartoon. In the movie, the chief was more uptight, and very bitter, and I think there were times where he HATED Gadget! By the end of the episode of the original cartoon, he would always praise Gadget for a job well done (not realizing it had been Penny and Brain that did the legwork).2. Matthew Broderick is definitely not a believable Gadget. Gadget is supposed to be a bumbling fool, and incompetent. Broderick's portrayal kind of made him a little smarter than usual, but not very bumbling.3. Inspector Gadget Meets Knight Rider! Seriously, they turned the Gadget Mobile into a car that talked. Like KITT on \"Knight Rider.\" In the original cartoon, IT NEVER TALKED!!!! Was that trip REALLY necessary?4. Penny and Brain, or rather lack thereof. They're my favorite characters from the original show, and the fact that they were barely in this ticked me off big time. That, and Penny in the cartoon is a 10/11 year old blond girl in pigtails. In the movie, she's a brunette tween. I seem to remember at one point she was using the Top Secret Gadget phone to take a personal call from a friend. Penny and Brain are the ones who are supposed to solve the case. Such was not the situation in this movie.5. I didn't like Gadget's love interest in this for some reason. I don't know why, she just rubbed me the wrong way.6. This last one was the biggest, and the thing that REALLY ground my gears over this movie. Why, why, WHY did they cast Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw?! And what was with the name \"Claw?\" It was always DOCTOR CLAW in the cartoon! Everett looked too young to be Dr. Claw, and above all: they showed his face throughout the whole picture! That is just wrong! You're NOT supposed to SEE Dr. Claw's face, people!!!!!Seriously, this movie made me wonder something: Did they even WATCH the original cartoon before they made this?",

            "content": "Once again, Disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background. About the only thing common with this and the original Gadget cartoons is the names. The most glaring errors are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, Dr Claw is more a show-off than an evil villain, etc. but there are more than that. The horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having Gadget as a security guard called John Brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right in the beginning we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disney-compatible. Add to this the fact that the \"Claw\" seen in this film and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline. What would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney failed in that too. The whole movie is just Gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after Brenda. As if to add insult to the injury, Disney introduced the \"new\" Gadgetmobile - it doesn't look, function or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical \"comic relief\" figure. Disney obviously recognised that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the clever running gags (like the assignment paper exploding in the Chief's face) and replaced them with Gadget being a moron, the Gadgetmobile being a wise-ass, and \"Claw\" showing off. Someone should tell Disney that \"children's movie\" doesn't imply \"total lack of any brain usage\". Gadget should be targeted for children of 10-12 years... not children of 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it is NOT, repeat NOT, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate this.",

            "content": "First of all, I absolutely love the cartoon, it is a classic, and great fun for adults and kids alike. Unfortunately, while there are some redeeming qualities, Inspector Gadget, came across for me as dull, uninspired and disappointing. But it is not the worst movie ever, I did think Disaster Movie and Home Alone 4 were much worse.There are some bright spots. One is the special effects, they were very very good and the best part of the movie. It is true that the film is a tad low on laughs, though the part when the thumb turns itself into a cigarette lighter does raise a chuckle or two. There are some terrific scenes involving Gadget's robot self, a car chase and a helicopter. And Joely Fisher is lovely as Brenda, and Rupert Everett, ever reliable, makes an entertaining Doctor Claw.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. I am in complete agreement with anyone who thinks that it could've been so much better. Matthew Broderick struggles to make a convincing enough title character, but I do think it is to do with the fact that the role of Inspector Gadget is badly underwritten. Having said that, the script is very weak, and lacks any sense of plot and drive, and the plot is rather slow moving and doesn't make much sense. Plus the editing was rather choppy.Overall, a disappointing film, that could've been so much better. Had it been more faithful to the show, and had more of a sense of fun, it could have been a great film rather than a mediocre one. 4/10 for trying. Bethany Cox",

While it admittedly had its faults, it was rather enjoyable.Naturally I was very interested in seeing the film version.  That was before I saw it.  Afterwords I wished it had never been made.Besides being miscast all around (who on Earth though Broderick was even close to the role?) it just didn't make the grade.The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action!  What was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.The original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude.  It was FUN.  The motion picture became murky and took itself FAR too seriously.  If it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a \"cartoon on film\" it might have been enjoyable.As it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the \"Gadget Legacy\".",

            "content": "I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget. First thing- in the film, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the awesome book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.Another thing is that it's too much \"Good Guy v. Bad Guy\" in the film. It's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. Also, Gadget never should have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.But if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The movie was too serious, too overdone, had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny.Tip for those who haven't seen it: NEVER see it. EVER. Watch the cartoon, it's a true classic.",

Because this was made by Disney, a studio (to put it nicely) I am really not fond of. Matthew Broderick does a good job as the title character (really). The other actors don't play their characters as well as they could have. Moving to a more positive aspect, the special effects are another major highlight of the movie. Same for the action and fight scenes. As for the story, it's okay. The story is pretty much a prequel to the animated series, showing Inspector Gadget's origin. It's far from perfect, but keep in mind this movie is based on a Saturday morning series from the eighties and intended for the kids. Thumbs up.",

            "content": "Well, here it is... the Inspector Gadget film. The TV-show-made-movie. The live-action version of an almost 20 year old animated series. The complete and utter disaster of a film. While this film may be somewhat entertaining to kids under the age of 7(and even that is a stretch), it's terribly insulting to anyone older than that. The plot is contrived and stupid beyond belief. The pacing is non-existent. The acting is either over- or underdone. The characters are paper-thin stereotypes. The tone is childish. The humor is incredibly poor. The whole film is so obviously directed at kids, no one else could find it even tolerable. It's so... Disney. All the way through it. A character even points out that \"this is a Disney movie\". In case anyone was wondering. Just to make sure we know where to direct our anger. Wouldn't want any undeserving poor sap(s) to be blamed for this mess. I could barely, with enormous amounts of effort, concentrate on watching a few seconds in a row of this film... after which I had to turn away, out of fear it might rot my brain or at the very least diminish its capacity to keep watching. It's almost physically painful to look at this film. I read that this film was cut down to 78 minutes... from 110. I can't help but wonder; if they knew it was so bad, why did they leave any film at all? I'd have destroyed all master tapes, personally. One to be approached with caution and an appropriate amount of childishness. Otherwise, it's fair to assume you won't make it out of the viewing with your sanity. I recommend this only to children and the most overbearing parents of such. Everyone else should avoid. 1/10",

Bumbling boob can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.The gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?Gadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.Also the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says \"Wowser\". It is and should always be \"Wowsers\". It sounds lame with out the 's'. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase.The ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.\nThe other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that \"Brain isn't in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof.\" of course this isn't laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voiced the stupid car.Kids will like this, anyone over 13 won't.",

He awakes to find himself rebuilt by the scientist's daughter and with all manner of gadgets at his disposal.I watched this on a wet, cold generally miserable Sunday afternoon while I lazily did some ironing.  I didn't expect much from it and I was surprised (and slightly ashamed) to find that I actually quite enjoyed it.  The plot is nonsense and the action is all very silly and aimed at kids, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek and seems to know that it's all just  bit of dumb fun.  As a result we have everything exaggerated for humour \u0096 whether it be Gadget's gadgets or the performances themselves, it is all playing to the adult audience saying `we know this is silly but bare with us'.This may annoy many but I can quite enjoy a silly film as long as it acknowledges what it is and goes with it.  The film had a few really good jokes in it as well as the odd movie reference or post-modern adult gag in it.  My favourite bit was in the end credits, where a repentant henchman attends a henchman anonymous group meeting \u0096 in the crowd are various Bond villains including Jaws and Odd Job!  While the film lacks the wit and sophistication of films that really play to kids and adults, this was still quite fun to watch even it is all was very silly.The cast do a reasonable job with the material \u0096 again, all seeming to do it with a wink to the audience to acknowledge what we were thinking.  Broderick is better than this, but is still OK in the role, he plays it fairly straight but is still amusing.  Fisher has less to do and the voice of the Gadget Mobile is just a bad Chris Rock impression.  The one character than dominates the film is Everett, he plays it so very OTT and knowing that he is fun to watch.  He, like us, knows it is silly but is determined to have fun \u0096 I had fun watching him, whether he is hamming it up or dropping references (`Madonna').  He helped raise the film by simply playing to it's sole strength \u0096 that it's dumb but fun!Overall this is not a great kids movie if you view it alongside cleverer movies such as Toy Story etc which serve both types of audience (kids/adults) equally well.  However it still manages to be fun and, if you're in the mood for a dumb silly film where the comedy is slightly self-mocking then, while there's still much to be annoyed by, there's still some daft fun to be had.",

Matthew Broderick was cast as the most annoying character possible: the title character himself. His character gets \"fixed\" after an accident; he is turned into a robot (at the beginning of the movie), or a cyborg, or something that we couldn't possibly care about.Also another thing in the movie is that Dr. Claw, the villain in the original Inspector Gadget TV show who never reveals his face, is clearly visible on screen most of the time, and he's just an ordinary looking guy. Nothing works in this movie. The show was never owned by Disney in the first place, but they bought the film rights to the show and lowered the show to Disney- fied levels. I never watched the show growing up, but I have seen some episodes and they were a lot better than the movie, even though the episodes were pretty standard.Avoid this piece of rubbish at all costs.

Both ham it up beautifully, and make the most of this film.The script is far from innovative, but it does have some very clever jokes. There are a few moments of smarmy \"use your heart\" dialogue, but, they're thankfully kept to a minimum, and outnumbered by some more subversive lines.",

There are enough adult-type jokes to clever material to make this fun for us older folks. I'd have to say this is one of the better efforts ever by the Disney company.Broderick plays two roles, and is especially funny as the counterfeit Gadget with the fake teeth. The little girl in here is cute, too, and the talking car has some of the best lines of the film. At under 80 minutes, the film breezes by at good clip.",

            "content": "Who else wanted to hold Penny's computer book for just one moment in our lives? Was I the only one hoping to one day catch a glimpse of Dr. Claw's face? If you are chanting \"YES. YES. YES\" along with me, then you are already aware of my feelings with Disney's debacle of a feature film presentation. Now, this isn't to say that there weren't elements that I found entertaining (gosh, am I saying this...), but overall this seemed to forget the foundation that it was built upon \u0096 even the perverse cameo at the end sent shivers up my spine. Where did the creators go wrong? Let's begin by saying that this was a concept, a cartoon, that Disney had no right placing their expensive hands into.I was hooked at the beginning surprisingly. Why? I wanted to see the birth of Gadget and the reason why Claw and him were always pitted against each other. I wanted to see the creation of good and evil, but after twenty minutes, I saw Disney do what they do best. Matthew Broderick nervously steps into a role that he obviously wasn't ready for. He plays Gadget himself, a bumbling security cop who dreams of being a police officer. Due to Rupert Everett's whining and obvious lack of knowledge of who Dr. Claw is, the two find themselves crossing each others paths at a bio-technology lab where a new form of artificial intelligence is being designed. There is a pretty girl/scientist (played by Joely Fisher) whom John Brown (Broderick, pre-Gadget) pines for, but cannot win because he doesn't have the confidence to win her over. Well, we all know where this is headed next, and Disney lays it on thick as Broderick uses every torturous gadget in his disposal to eliminate ... not Dr. Claw, but a clone that is demolishing the city ... can he win? I can't give it away, though it would make you better film viewers if I just blurted the ending ... who would pay money for this plastic form of entertainment.Alright, characters \u0096 there was no commentary on this film, so I only watched it once (thankfully!), but Broderick was the obvious stand out. He tried, I know I feel bad saying this, but he did try to bring some depth to this character. Gadget is a bumbling idiot \u0096 but he has a good heart. I thought Broderick was a good choice personality wise, but he never took Gadget to that next cinematic level. I wanted to have the foundation of the cartoon, but then grow into a feature film that had heart and dedication. In this mere 78 minute short film, there was nothing. So, on one side we have Gadget (Broderick doing his best), then on the other side we have the worst Hollywood idea ever \u0096 Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw. This was a hazard. This was Disney thinking they could take a enormously popular villain and give him a soul. This was Rupert needing to ham it up more than Broderick so that there was a share of the screen. There was no evil, there was no corruption, there was nothing that even faintly resembled the \"Claw\" that we grew up with. The henchman seemed more in tune than Everett. He wasn't funny, he wasn't sinister, he wasn't diabolical in any way. He was fluff, and that wasn't the Dr. Claw that I attempted to pay money to see. His portrayal was a disgrace to anyone that has ever even glanced at the cartoon. Arg, it makes me mad just to mention it in this review. Rupert Everett ruined Dr. Claw. Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) seemed to follow the Everett style of \"Gadet-ing\", but not following her character at all. Shouldn't there have been a prerequisite to see the cartoon prior to making the film. Oh, filmmakers, how I shun thee.I guess if one could literally pull themselves away from the hideous acting by Everett, the rest of the film just seemed raced and pushed. I was happy to see that it only lasted 78 minutes, and they did cover quite a bit of ground, but it just felt like they weren't willing to give the credit due to the cartoon. This was a cult cartoon, and to see Disney play for a younger audience, care nothing for the pre-existing older audience that grew up with Gadget, make jokes that seemed clich\u00e9, and bubble the bad guy. It was hard to watch. I was pleased with the script, the director tried to go dark with a really random Broderick attempting to play a darker, more fun character as Gadget's clone \u0096 but overall this film just lacked the spunk from the cartoon. I wanted animation, I wanted excitement, I wanted an adventure that would befuddle Adams himself, but instead I had a story that seemed like it would be in the dollar bin within the week of its release.Overall, this film wasn't horrid. The story itself wasn't anything I could watch again, but their ability to not overextend the plot, made it for simple viewing. It was 78 minutes of filming that I didn't mind, but couldn't get myself to watch it again. I will forever hate Everett for what he did to Dr. Claw, I think Dr. Claw will forever hate Everett as well. His portrayal ruined this film. It knocked it to the ground with no opportunity to pick it up again. Broderick was watchable, but I don't think he was what this film needed. \"Inspector Gadget\" is a perfect example of what happens when Disney puts their hands into a project and is determined to ensure that children get laughs from semi-crass physical humor. This was a sad attempt of a film, but a part of me is happy that I watched it \u0096 now the cartoon seems better than ever! Grade: ** out of *****",

Studios began to suddenly think that by re-imagining previous cartoons as live-action films, they could stand to make a tidy little profit. The Walt Disney Studios got off to quite a huge start when their 1996 starring vehicle 'George of the Jungle' (taken from the cartoon of the same name by legendary creator Jay Ward) made upwards of $100 million. Suddenly, a new trend had caught on. But not wanting to stop there, Disney thought they'd try again. Though this time, with a hot cartoon property from the 1980's, dubbed 'Inspector Gadget.'The previews touted a fun, rollicking film, where Gadget would be a live-action crime-fighting 'tool,' complete with Gadgetcopter, extendo-legs, and much more. But aside from all the cool, techno-gadgetry, the film became the stuff of typical executive schlock. The town where our characters reside is colored so garish that you'd assume color-blind monkeys did the decorating work. What's more, most of the plot devices that made the cartoon series memorable have been jettisoned in favor of a jive-talking Gadgetmobile with trademark-friendly sponsors, pop-up-video-style memory flashbacks, and more.What made the cartoon series work so well, was we never did learn most of the big questions, like 'how did Gadget get his gadgets?' 'Why does Dr Claw hate Inspector Gadget?' And even the most important one: 'what does Claw look like?'For this film, those questions are answered for us, and it gets to the point where you just want them not to tell you these things.'Inspector Gadget' is a throwaway summer film, as well as a mindless babysitter for when you need to do your laundry.what Disney Studios crafted here was something so brainless that parents most likely got bored while their children were held in place with cheap live-action gags and the usual round of fart and poop jokes.",

            "content": "I never knew of the original Inspector Gadget cartoon until I watched this movie. In that case, once I saw the original I can understand why fans were disappointed with the outcome. This movie is very sloppy and some of its characters don't even follow the original screenplay. But with a little help with the special effects and some funny characters, it doesn't turn out to be so bad as its claimed to be. As the old saying goes, if you leave your brain at the door and take it as it is, it's a fun ride.Playing as the dim-witted inspector is Matthew Broderick, who I'll say is an interesting choice because he does his job well. But for an actor who has played other characters with more intelligence, seems like the clumsy Inspector Gadget is not the right choice for him. Especially if ten years before, Broderick starred in Glory (1989), one of the most influential movies in cinema history. Another flaw in this film is sticking Dr. Claw in the light; so he is finally visible to the viewer. Who thought of that idea? If he was a concealed mastermind in the cartoon, why would he want to come out a decade later? Dr. Claw is played by Rupert Everett who I think does a good job although his voice sounds nothing like the original. But he does have his funny moments. Dr. Claw's henchmen are funny too, and they help add to the goofiness in the screenplay.One thing I'm curious is to why director David Kellogg decided to have a love interest in this film. In the cartoon, Inspector Gadget had no time for a woman. Why does he need one now? Is it because it's a Disney movie and all Disney movies have to have romance in them? Love is not always needed to make a film successful. There were points in the movie that felt so cheesy when Inspector Gadget was talking to Brenda (played Joely Fisher). To me, that was one of the lower points in the film. I felt that it was unnecessary. The film already had enough female power in it, which was Penny, Gadget's niece.As for the effects, it is fun to watch all the utilities that Broderick tries to call upon. I don't even know what half of them would be used for and how they pertain to being a detective but that's what makes the movie fun to watch. For example when Gadget is at a ball and decides to listen on Brenda and Dr. Claw's conversation he places his ear on statue and starts walking as the cord stretches. And no one notices? How much more ridiculous could that get? Well it does but at least the public does not surround him too often. Another cool effect is the Gadgetmobile. Voiced by D.L. Hughley, the Gadgetmobile has a good number of wisecracks that'll keep the viewer laughing. This was one of the stronger points of the film. It was fun to see Broderick converse with the car. That car probably had the same amount of gizmos as did Inspector Gadget. As for everything else, the music was alright, there was nothing really special about it and the sound effects helped the film sound like it still was a cartoon (in a sense). For the most part I was satisfied with the end result. I didn't think it was a total waste, but there were some things that could've been left out and added in to make it better.The live action version of Inspector Gadget has eye-popping special effects and is quite goofy; perhaps too goofy. Though overall, it works as a kiddy film, nothing will bring it up to par with its origin of roots.",

Matthew Broderick deadpans throughout (and seems to be making a habit of putting the show down on talk shows anyway).  Everyone else seems to be having some fun.  Wish I could've said the same.The one funny moment?  The Minions Recovery Group scene in the end credits. I don't know why Richard Kiel is listed as \"Uncredited\" (his name is mentioned as \"Big Minion With Steel Teeth\" or some such).

Claw's hand is not anywhere near where the bowling ball lands so it clearly is seen to be behind the bowling ball that \"crushes\" it. The \"goof\" that Gadget is covered in wires when he leaves the operating room. He'd just fired a rocket from his foot and it shot all over the room, that's why he's covered in wires.The little CGI inserts between scenes. Makes me get the feeling they couldn't write a script long enough to make a full motion picture. I really didn't like the fact that the car knew it was \"A Disney movie\".Broderick really doesn't make as good a Gadget as the cartoon used to be. And if he just started in the police force it's unlikely he's going to have been given the rank of Inspector already, is it? It's a rank that takes at least a decade to reach.Rupert Everett as Dr Claw (Or just plain Claw as he wants to be known), is just to pretty to be a bad guy. And please? STOP typecasting British people as bad guys in movies.The whole \"Law enforcement professional hurt in the line of duty and rebuilt as a cybernetic better individual\" has been totally done to death starting with stuff like Joe 90, The 6 Million Dollar Man and Robocop.This film is weak with no plot. Dabney Coleman is mildly bearable, Broderick should hang his head in shame after roles in such good films as Wargames (with Dabney Coleman, oddly enough), Project X and Godzilla.Joely Fisher is pretty but when they said her name I thought the even prettier Joely Richardson and she's certainly not her. I don't really know her from any TV or other films to be honest either so I have nothing to compare this performance to.The RoboGadget character is excellent, Broderick plays him very well. The Robot Brenda somehow managed to be prettier than the real Joely Fisher. Her outfit, hair and makeup help a lot there. Now, there was no real reason to have to implant John Brown with the Gadget technology. None of the injuries he'd suffered were things he wasn't going to recover from.The scenes of the towns people running from Inspector Gadgets shadow dinosaur and the dinosaur rampage shots were nice touches and gags at Brodericks own expense from Godzilla.I do wonder why he didn't deploy the very useful roller blades when being dragged by Claw's car? Also, when him and Brenda are falling he calls to deploy his parachute (quite loud and clear) but it doesn't work until he's in the water.As usual and just like the cartoon, Penny and Brain solve the case with the help of the Gadgetmobile.But Claw doesn't do the proper voice for his \"next time, Gadget\" speech. Weak ending for The Inspector and Brenda because you know he was going to get the girl.Robo Brenda wasn't destroyed by falling off the huge building? I do like the room full of minions, Penny is actually wearing the watch she normally wears in the cartoon. The voice of Brain is the voice from the cartoon. And no-one captured the RoboGadget body?",

I do enjoy Matthew Broderick in a few movies but, this isn't one of them, he just comes off as too smart to play the role of a bumbling detective. I don't know what Disney was thinking! I also enjoyed Rupert Everett in Shrek 2, but here, he too is completely miscast as Dr. Claw and in the original cartoon, his face was never shown. Why couldn't Disney keep that in the movie? I think Christopher Lloyd or Tim Curry would have been much better in the role.Another thing that this movie screws up is making the Gadget Mobile talk. Since when did this turn into Knight Rider? The car never talked in the cartoon. Also, I can't understand why Brain and Penny are hardly in this film at all. In the cartoon, they're the ones who always solve the crimes, but that isn't the case in this film.The humor is also bad. It seems like the film makers try to squeeze too many fourth wall jokes in, especially at the end.On the positive side, the visual effects do look pretty nice, but otherwise, it's just an unfunny, poorly acted, and messy film with no respect for the cartoon.This is definitely one of the worst live-action adaptations of a cartoon I've ever seen.

The possibilities of such technology catch the attention of Sandford Scolex (also known as \"Dr. Claw\" and played by Rupert Everett), who steals the functioning limb with plans to replicate it and use it to evil's advantage. Brown, who gets in a horrific car accident while trying to catch Claw, has irreparable tissue damage that can only be fixed by having alternate, technological gizmos put into his body effectively making him \"Inspector Gadget.\" It's now up to him and his sly daughter Penny (a young Michele Trachtenberg) to stop him, allow justice to prevail, etc.The first problem is the pacing itself; the film moves so fast and so quickly that it could be the direct blame for young children with lower attention spans. The action is manic, the overall material choppy and inconsistent, and with situations happening too abruptly to be taken seriously and ending too quickly with no payoff. Poor Broderick is at the center of this absolute madness, thrown into so many messy, incoherent instances with no rhyme or reason, I can see him going home from the set, everyday, a disgruntled mess that would slave over a bottle of hard liquor.The second major issue here is the writing, which is worst I've seen in a children's film in a while. For once, it's not for its immaturity, as most films targeted at the youth demographic succeed in, but just for the stench of desperation this film has no problem letting loose. It tries every possible thing, even resorting to disjointed, second-long credit cookies at the end of the picture trying to leave the audience giggling at something. I laughed not a single time during the course of this film; desperation is almost never funny and that alone should be the encompassing message of Inspector Gadget.There's a term I use when describing unsubstantial movie affairs for children and that term is \"fast food filmmaking.\" It's films that seem to only exist as a cash-grab for a kids-movie-deprived season, often raking in cash from parents who are looking for a quick little babysitter for their youngsters, and in return, they get a film that does nothing but that. Instead of giving them lovable characters, entertaining and memorable fun, and a keenly wrapped moral, they are given nothing but uncreative, unfunny drudgery.This is a painful exercise to say the least. The imagination that could've spawned a wonderful adaptation of Inspector Gadget is halted by desperately unfunny writing, bland acting, awkward and frantic pacing, and to add one more nail into one more coffin, the transfer from animation to live-action. With the limited the knowledge of the Inspector Gadget TV series that I have, I can say the charm seemed to stem from the limitless possibilities that could be done thanks to the likes of 2D animation. Nudging that eclectic and visually-visceral world into the live-action world simply doesn't translate well. The dizzying sound effects, exhausting use of computer-generated gags, and tiresome slapstick instances never amount to anything aside from frustration and true tedium. With that in mind, and the fact that they completely skewed the villain of the series and provided everything with a shamelessly half-baked treatment goes to show that this particular cinematic gadget needs more than a few tweaks; it needs reprogramming.Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle Trachtenberg, Dabney Coleman, and D. L. Hughley. Directed by: Dave Kellogg.",

I like the addition of the Gadget mobile being a living car; He turned out to be a funny character! I also love Gadget's origin story and crush on Brenda! They fit the character well. Although Penny and Brain ended up not doing much in the whole movie, which was a little disappointing. But, I did enjoy the fact Gadget was able to save the day on his own rather then receiving their help like he always does in the series. It shows even though he's naive, he's learning!

Well, Inspector Gadget is one of those films.This film is really terrible. It's so terrible that there can't possibly be any good things in it, because they're overshadowed by the bad ones. The film hardly contains a story. It's more like a succession of horribly edited scenes, filled with stupid slapstick, and accompanied by horrible acting. Matthew Broderick plays Inspector Gadget and gives possibly the worst performance of his career, which is saying a lot in his case. The villain is played by Rupert Everett, who completely ignores the Doctor Claw character in the cartoon, and gives one of the worst performances in cinematic history. Throughout the whole film he just acts like a homosexual mental patient. All the other actors are hardly worth mentioning. Most of them are terrible and add nothing to the film.The one thing that's really exceptional about this film is the editing. It looks like it was done by someone who just had a lobotomy. In some scenes it feels like you entered right in the middle, and that a part of it was just cut out. The film also has some idiotic transitions between scenes, that are supposed to be funny, but are just completely pointless.Nothing about this movie is funny or even remotely entertaining. I know it's for children, but it's all just stupid, cheap slapstick with horrible, over the top acting. This is like someone took the Inspector Gadget cartoon, chopped it up, burned it, marinated it in diarrhoea, called it a motion picture, and served it to the audience. Don't bother watching it, unless you're in a masochistic mood.",

Even the thrill of seeing the Inspector using his copter hat is gone, thanks to the poor special effects. No expense spared? Yeah right!

There's a reason cartoons are never meant to be real: They're just silly. But silly in that function that they are meant to be entertainment. Kids (of all ages) love cartoons because it takes their mind of reality. But once you make them as real as we are takes a great risk. A risk these Hollywood producers seem to take haphazardly. Just because they have the technology to make 'em, doesn't mean you can capture their appeal. So it proves by the subject of this review: INSPECTOR GADGET.I never knew much of the original cartoons this movie claims to be inspired from, but I did know it exists and I did know it was a cartoon, and I believe that's all you'll ever really need to know, I guess. I never really got into the characters, but I still smell precisely that INSPECTOR GADGET got it all wrong from the start. The first hour devotes to where our cyborg-like hero came from, something the original cartoon really shouldn't have time to do. That comes to no surprise, the introduction is simply just a comedic rehash of ROBOCOP. Detective John Brown (Matthew Broderick) encounters an accident during active duty and needs to undergo an operation that requires mechanical knots and bolts surgically attached to his body. Pretty soon, he's what he calls himself a hardware store.You know the rest too. All he needs to do is say \"Go, go gadget\" and instantly he has either a mechanical arm or an umbrella popping out of his hat. His ride is the talking Gadget Mobile. He also gets by with a little help from his dear niece Penny (her played by Michelle Trachtenberg) and her little puppy Brain. And there's the evil villain Dr. Claw (here played by Rupert Everett) who is also melded with a machine, this time turning his hand into a mechanical claw. You know all these characters and these situations. What really lacks though, is the appeal. And in the end, it's exactly what we demand. Broderick and Everett try their hardest in their roles, and they sometimes achieve their goal, but they aren't given much more to do. Everett's over-the-top performance leads to nowhere, which is a shame. The Gadget Mobile is almost just as annoying as they say Jar Jar Binks is (though I pick Jar Jar's endless yapping compared to this). The moments of silliness would have been fine, in fact entertaining, if it were a cartoon. Translating it to the big screen losses the charm. In the end, it only ends up silly. And silly is this movie all the way.Rating: ** out of 5.",

Matthew Broderick just isn't a good choice for this role, but it isn't entirely his fault.  Whoever edited this film should be shot along with the person who thought having the car talk was a good idea.  The person who conceived of the plot deserves blame too.  In the cartoon Inspector Gadget, it was never shown how he got that way, but here they do.  He also isn't on the street five seconds before the villain makes a clone of him for crying out loud to frame him.  What is up with that?  That is more a plot device for a sequel.  And why do we have to have an actor play the Claw...I don't think you ever saw him in the cartoon.  The jokes were awful too, and what is with his gadgets.  I don't remember him having so many gadgets that served no purpose at all in the cartoon.  They also don't show the gadgets working very long either as most of the time they just show Broderick's face.  Avoid this one at all costs.",

            "content": "When I was a little tyke, two of my favorite cartoons were \"Danger Mouse\" and \"Inspector Gadget\".  Both had a bunch of odd jokes, bumbling characters, superspy/heroes, and very cool cars.  Of course, the better of the two was Gadget.And now, Disney brings back the great inspector in the movie \"Inspector Gadget\".  Now, I'll be the first to confess, I thought that a rehash of the cartoon in live action would just be typical Disney junk: add one good actor and one decent idea, a pinch of good jokes, a pint of bad jokes, and about 3/4ths cheesey special effects.  No story really necessary.But I was wrong.  Gadget was great.  Watching Matthew Broderick (whom I still feel is the most underrated actor in the business) as the hapless and clueless inspector was a thrill.  He brought a charm to the character that made Gadget much more than an idiot, he's just a well meaning klutz who's trying to figure everything out for his own.The actual story is about John Brown (Broderick), a security guard longing to be a police officer.  When trying to stop the evil Claw (Rupert Everett) from accomplishing a laboratory heist, Brown gets in a car accident and is blown up.  He is saved by the beautiful scientist Brenda (Joely Fisher) who was part of a project to create a new type of robocop.  An operation turns the ordinary John Brown into the multi-parted Inspector Gadget.Watching the movie was like a trip down memory lane.  All the classic items from the cartoon were there.  The Gadget-copter  and magnifying class are still in his hat, the Gadget-phone is still right IN the palm of his hand, and of course, the expanding arms, legs, and neck.  All of the memorable lines were present too.  \"Go go gadget ______\", \"Wowsers\", and yes, even Claw's tradmark \"I'll get you next time, Gadget.  Next time.\"Many of the jokes were either subtle, plain obvious, or even on a few occasions, hidden.  While only a few jokes really cause you to burst, you still giggle and smile at some of the lines cause that's what the movie wants; it wants you to smile through out.There was only one joke so bad that it left me very annoyed.  While taking his first drive in the Gadgetmobile, Gadget is told by the car to put on his seatbelt.  \"This is a Disney movie after all!\" the car chuckles as it rounds a corner.  Time out.  They aren't supposed to know it's a movie.  It's ok to make a joke that winks at the audience (such as the wonderful saturday morning cartoon reference) but to tell the audience and the character that it's a movie isn't funny.  It's arrogant, rude, and plain stupid.That takes us to my biggest problem: the Gadgetmobile.  Beautiful, yes. Gadget filled, oh yeah!  Talkative, unfortunately.  It was impossible to get through a scene with out the car (D.L. Hughley) saying some sort of sarcastic comment to Gadget.  If the car is as new as Gadget himself, why does the car repeatedly refer to Gadget as \"rookie\"?  Apparently, Disney figured the car would be it's big popular character/toy.  They were wrong. Personally, I liked the van that turned into a sportscar.  Now that was cool.Now while Gadget was essetially the same as in the cartoon (down to the costume), the Claw was a total opposite.  The great joy of the cartoon was never seeing anything more of Claw than his hand (almost like one of a suit of armor).  We didn't know who he was, why he was evil, or what he looked like.It took guts to explain it all in the movie.  Thank god for Rupert Everett. His over the top style made Claw the best character in the movie.  Even when his jokes were falling flatter than a pancake, you still laughed just cause of his flamboyance (and Everett is not playing Claw as a gay character, for the record).  When Brenda tell Claw that she liked him better in college obese, a devilish smile preceeds Claw's cry for junk food.  \"Bring on the brownies!\"Overall, the oddest part of \"Inspector Gadget\" was, despite the small number of laughs, you still exit the movie fulfilled and satisfied.  If anything, you kind of wish for maybe a little more direct Gadget vs. Claw.  Maybe in a sequel.  Oh come on, it's Disney.  You know they'll do it.  And for once, they at least have my approval.You \"Go go Gadget!\"",

(possibly an attempt at an innuendo gag but failing) as I remember it it was a gadget COPTER. 3:Wowser No, Wowsers! yes. 4:What the heck is up with that gadget mobile etc. mostly I blame the star Matthew Broderick who completely fails in every sense to pull off being Inspector Gadget possibly due to the fact that in an interview he said that he'd never even seen a single episode until a few months before shooting. Plus, the awful self referencing gags that did not work and were totally uninspired. Plus another thing, the plot, how many times do we have to go through the same plot of super hero has a clone made of him that does bad things and he has to clear his name. Sorry if I've ruined the plot for you but that's all there is. I really wanted to enjoy this film but was blocked at every turn. I just hope if the Transformers Movie comes to fluition it will be much better than this, but there is less to go wrong(but who knows what these evil people could do). Glad I didn't buy the DVD it would have been a worse buy than Boogeyman 3. As a Inspector Gadget movie 0 out of 10 As a movie 1 out of 10",

A bunch of thugs stole the foot (because it was possibly needed for their evil project), and a man with a Pinto (or was it a Nova?) was off to the rescue!!!!! Anyway, he got hit by a Yahoo!/Kodak billboard and needed to be hospitalized. What he didn't know was that he would be turned from human being to human robot!!!!!

Adults everywhere will be rolling their eyes into the very backs of their heads when Dabney Coleman spouts off a \"wowsers\" at the end of the movie. I may have actually gagged at that part.

Sure Dr. Claw holds cat, but he is never mentioned and only seen once!There were a few good things I did like.1rst, it tells the story of how Gadget became Gadget.

I wonder if the creators ever watched it, since they got just about everything wrong. Lets start with Dr. Claw and his face, his face ?! Yes, it was always kept hidden from the viewers in the series. Here we get to see it in the first scene. When did Gadget become so smart? There's Penny, his niece, she used to be the real inspector in the series, because Gadget was just a mindless idiot. And Brain, his dog, who had to save Gadget from the bad guys over and over for the same reason. That's where most of the comedy came from in the old days, instead we get some CGI-slapstick and not all that funny if you ask me... and where are Dr Claw's henchmen ? Exactly, nowhere. Madcat is dubbed Sniffy. Chief Quimby suddenly hates Gadget, not because of his stupidity, but because he believes his police force is going to be replaced by Gadget-like cops ?! Oh yeah, they also felt it was necessary to explain how the inspector got his gadgets and that he used to be a security-guard called John Brown before that - why ? perhaps kids today are not allowed to have any imagination? So you didn't see the cartoon - you should, they took an original and funny idea, then stripped it of everything that made it funny. The actors are certainly not to blame , they did a decent job. You can a) rent it and keep the kids busy for an hour  or b) watch it yourself and have your chilhood toon memories butchered.3 out of 10 (for FX)",

You have Matthew Broderick as the Gadget, Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw, Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny and Dabney Coleman - the most perfect of these casting decisions - as Chief Quimby.It then ruins all that good will by showing us Dr. Claw's face, a fact that never ever happened across every season of the cartoon.Perhaps the best part of this movie is the minions anonymous scene, in which a variety of henchmen appear, including henchmen include Mr. T and \"Famous Bad Guy with Silver Teeth\" (Richard Kiel as Jaws), \"Famous Villain with Deadly Hat\" (Richard Lee-Sung as Oddjob), \"Famous Identifier of Sea Planes\" (Bobby Bell as Tattoo from Fantasy Island), \"Famous Native American Sidekick\" (Hank Barrera as Tonto), \"Bane of the Bumbling, Idiotic Yet Curiously Successful French Detective's Existence\" (Jesse Yoshimura as Cato Fong from The Pink Panther), \"Son Before Second Son\" (John Kim as Lee Chan, number one son of Charlie Chan) and \"Famous Assistant to Dr. Frankensomething\" (Keith Morrison as Igor).After disastrous test screenings, the film was cut down from 110 minutes to 78 minutes. I have no idea just what was so upsetting in those 32 minutes, nor do I understand why this movie had to be any longer than 75 minutes.Disney still made money from this movie, despite scorched earth reviews, as there weren't a lot of kid-friendly films out in the summer of 1999. Throw in a bunch of cheaper direct to DVD sequels and a McDonald's promotion to make your own Inspector Gadget that had parents traveling hundreds of miles to complete and even the worst of films can be a success.",

            "content": "Inspector Gadget is set in the American city of Riverton where lowly security guard John Brown (Matthew Broderick) yearns to be a real cop, one night while on duty at the Bradford Scientific Research Institute he witness a raid in which robotics scientist Artemus Bradford (Rene Auberjonois) is killed & a robotic foot stolen. John pursues the thieves but is badly hurt in a car crash, Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) the daughter of Artemus reconstructs John as a new high tech police officer cyborg with dozens of inbuilt attachments & gadgets. After being placed on the local police force & nicknamed Inspector Gadget John sets out to catch those responsible for his own & Dr. Artemus' death, the rich businessman Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) also know as Claw due to the fact he has a claw rather than a hand...Directed by David Kellogg one has to say that while it's not a complete disaster I feel a lot more could have been done with this live-action film of the popular Inspector Gadget (1983 - 1986) TV cartoon series that ran for two seasons & eighty-six half an hour episodes. I don't want to get all nostalgic here but I remember seeing this on British children's TV over here during the mid-eighties & was one of my favourite show's (along with The Trap Door, He-Man, The Mysterious Cities of Gold, Thundercats & the like, those were the days...) although I can't really recall any of it. Anyway, the script here was by Kerry Ehrin & Zak Penn & the main thing that stands out is that this Inspector Gadget live-action film is extremely silly & aimed squarely at younger children & I mean young because anyone with half a brain really isn't going to find any of this particularly funny. There are many, many scenes which are played purely for laughs which is fine because that what it evidently set out to do but for fans of the cartoon show this film has really, really dumbed it down to silly slapstick comedy with lots of CGI computer effects that kids will look at & say 'wow, that's cool' while anyone over the age of five will look at it & say something more along the lines of 'wow, that's silly & not very funny'. The plot is also lacking, again I know it's for young kids but I'm not a young kid so I'll call it as I see it & say the plot is poor, Claw poses no threat or menace whatsoever & barely even has a plan other than to build some robots to sell to armies worldwide. OK great, but since that motive is money driven & he's already a billionaire businessman I found myself asking the question why? The character's are slim as well, they are strictly one dimensional which again is alright for young kids but for anyone older than five it's not so good. At a mere 78 minutes (including opening & closing credits) at least it's short, it moves along like a rocket & it isn't boring.Director Kellogg does OK, the action set-pieces although silly & impossible to take seriously do have a certain energy & imagination about them. The CGI computer effects vary, some are very good like when Gadget uses his helicopter gadget to fly through the city but other's are terrible. It generally stays quite faithful to the cartoon with all the major character's included although they are presented in a different light here, Penny Inspector Gadget's niece for instance is no longer the brains who solves every case for her bumbling uncle, Chief Quimby is different & Claw is very different as well with no deep voice or metal hand & in the cartoon series his face was never shown. One thing I must mention though is that there is a lot of product placement & that Gadgetmobile is extremely irritating. The best jokes in the entire film come during the closing credits, the single funniest moment comes when Claw's henchman Sikes attends a meeting of the Minion's Support Group including Richard Kiel who played Jaws in the James Bond films & lookalikes of Oddjob & Nik-Nak as well as a cameo from Mr. T! With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 this had a much bigger budget than I thought although I'd have said most of that went on the extensive CGI computer effects. The acting is as one dimensional as the character's the actor's are given, basically no-one is going to win any Oscars for this.Inspector Gadget is a Disney film aimed squarely at the younger audience which is fine I suppose but I would imagine a lot of teens & adults who grew up with the cartoon will be very disappointed with it, not unlike myself as it goes. It's strange because Disney usually make films that can be enjoyed by both the young & old but that's not really the case with Inspector Gadget. Followed by the straight-to-video/DVD Inspector Gadget 2 (2003) which is meant to be even worse than this, I shudder at the mere thought...",

After the plot was well established, there seemed to be no character development at all, as Joe Brown instantly became Inspector Gadget.  The movie was also replete with plot holes, as the audience is left wondering \"When did THAT happen???\" on several occasions.  If you're looking for a cute remake of the TV show, bring your kids and let them enjoy it.  If you're looking for a great movie, you'll probably want to skip it.

This regards an individual of many resources. Too bad the screenwriter had none. In the cartoon Dr. Claw's identity is never shown but here Rupert Everett waves the menacing object and far too early in the film. Setup effectively shows how Gadget came to be and his battle against an evil twin. Conventional with cartoon violence making one wonder whether director David Kellogg ever seen the cartoon? Special effects include numerous items hidden about Gadget's suit that are the film's one payoff. Everett holds certain charisma as Claw but in the cartoon he is concealed. This should have been handled with greater payoff as oppose to a celebrity appearance. Matthew Broderick is totally wrong as Gadget. Someone like Bill Murray would have been better casting. Michelle Trachtenberg looks nothing like Penny. The character had blonde hair and pigtails while Trachtenberg doesn't fit the profile. Dabney Coleman plays Chief Quimby with no exploding cigars, which was a running joke in the cartoon. Don Adams provides the voice of Penny's intelligent dog Brain. Pointless and rotten little heap.

But, even as a stand-alone film, this movie was awful.There were no suspense or captivating moments in this movie, not even during the scenes where John Brown (Matthew Broderick) first realized he became a bionic being, nor during any of the investigative scenes. There were too many corny, childish and overzealous-acting characters like the excruciatingly annoying mayor and Scolex's dumb-founded minions. Even Scolex (Rupert Everett) himself is not menacing or evil-bent, but a vain, smug, and a clown of a villain.Inspector Gadget wasn't portrayed as much of a hero, but a clueless, bumbling idiot who couldn't even control his gadgets (at least in the cartoon, the inspector had this always-on-a-mission mentality and had control over his gadgets most of the time). Penny and Chief Quimby didn't contribute to the plot at all (and Quimby despises Inspector Gadget as opposed to the cartoon).The script was weak and the plot was rushed-through - it's just basically Gadget trying to capture Scolex (shouldn't he be called Dr. Claw at least?), with the Gadget Mobile doing most of the work. There were no intriguing subplots, no character development and no character chemistry. The special effects were OK to say the most, but this movie bombed big time. A very lame and unfunny movie which I wouldn't even recommend to children.Grade F",

            "content": "Inspector Gadget was an amazing cartoon, but it had a brief stint on Portuguese television. I remember him, and I really enjoyed seeing him, but I don't remember seeing him much longer than four or five years. Despite this, it was one of the cartoons that I was most interested in as a child. The live-action movie we have here, however, doesn't do it justice... which doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. Plain and simple, the film is what it is: a piece of entertainment full of weaknesses.Designed to appeal to children and teenagers, I have serious doubts about the film's ability to appeal to adults, particularly fans of the original cartoon. It's not a bad movie, it's minimally funny and has some effective comic material, but most of the time it fails to make you laugh. Also, the film has bad dialogue and the script is quite poor and poorly written. So poorly written that I'm afraid of spoiling it if I say too much, so I'll limit myself to saying that the film follows the creation of Inspector Gadget and the birth of his archenemy, Claw.The cast is one of the most redeeming qualities of this film. Even with a basic story and very weak material on hand, each actor did the best they could, and I'm pretty sure they all tried to put in the effort and be professional. However, some did better than others. Rupert Everett, for example, makes the most of his charisma and steals our attention whenever he appears, with well-placed, sarcastic humour. Matthew Broderick doesn't do poorly in this job either, but he seems to find much more difficulties with his character. Joely Fisher is attractive but has little to do. Mike Hagerty and Michelle Trachtenberg are relegated to the shadows most of the time.Disney invested some money in the film, and it shows in the quantity and quality of the visual effects and CGI used. Gadget is very similar to the original, with the same clothes and the most striking gadgets from the cartoon, as well as the problems, confusions and breakdowns that have always characterized the character. The sets and filming locations help and do their part, as does the soundtrack, which contains a new version of the old cartoon theme song.",

I also knew this movie was based on a cartoon, but I knew nothing about the cartoon, and I knew about the movie first, so naturally I would assume that everything that happened in the movie is just like the cartoon, but I've read from other reviewers that this movie is so different from the cartoon. Since I never watched the cartoon, I'm reviewing this as a stand-alone film. This movie is really fun to watch; Matthew Broderick was the right man to play the title role, and he actually looks the part, I don't know why most people beg to differ, and Rupert Everett is funny as Sanford Scolex (aka Dr. Claw), and is sinister enough to get you invested, but the problem with his character is that he doesn't actually pose as a menacing threat to the society or to Gadget himself, he's more of a smooth talker. His henchmen are funny enough and they are great comic relief, but perhaps my greatest memory of this movie was the song, \"I'll Be Your Everything\" by Youngstown. That song is funky, it's a nice boy band tune, and it's good to listen to, but just recently, I found out that it's actually lyrically suggestive. For example the line, \"So just call out 'Go-Go Gadget'\", is actually, \"I can freak you with my gadget\", hahaha, lol, yeah I know, dirty, huh? The Robo-Gadget devil is funny, and he could've been the villain throughout, but all he does is wreak havoc around the city. The humor is good enough, and this movie is good, but I don't understand what pushed Disney to make a direct-to-DVD sequel, which was a complete travesty, and not worthy of being watched! I've only seen previews of the sequel, but that was enough for me to know that it's TERRIBLE!!! Overall, I like Inspector Gadget, and it's good for what it is, and enjoyable enough, especially if you liked it as a kid, if I were you, I wouldn't be so harsh towards the movie and just accept it as a stand- alone film. 8/10.

My only complaints are very minor.. the car.. for one was annoying and Jar Jar Binksesque.

            "content": "John Brown is a security guard at the company where Dr. Brenda Bradford works.  One night the movie's villains break in to the building and steal her latest project.  In the chase, Brown is so badly injured he has to be almost totally rebuilt.  The result: a supercop called Inspector Gadget. Brown has trouble controlling his new powers, resulting in chaos, and then he must learn to handle the Gadgetmobile, a nearly 40-year-old Lincoln that talks and has a mind of its own.  This results in even more wild comedy. But Brown feels his powers are being wasted:  he mostly rescues kittens from trees.  The Riverton police chief does not like having a 'supercop' on the force anyway, and he is not eager to see Brown do anything important.  All of that changes when the villain, Sanford Scolex (also known as The Claw after his own injuries from the car chase), hires Dr. Bradford, who does not realize Scolex stole her project and apparently killed her father.  Scolex has also created an Inspector Gadget lookalike who is terrorizing the city. Can the real Inspector Gadget save the day?The visual effects are amazing.  Gadget's fingers turn into such things as a lighter and a Swiss-army-type knife, and his legs and arms can extend to many times their original length, among other things.  The fake Gadget looks computer-generated but is almost as amazing to watch. I don't know when I have ever seen such fast-paced action, and I would have preferred they slow it down some.  And Michelle Trachtenberg was adorable as Brown's helpful niece.  It was a fun movie.  The youngest ones probably shouldn't see some of the violence, but the music and sound effects constantly reminded us this was really a cartoon.",

In no way does it deserve to be called bad but it will never be called the greatest film either.Matthew Broderick plays Inspector Gadget (who didn't even bother working his way up from Officer to Sergeant to...ah forget it) and he pits wits against Rupert Everett who plays the wicked Dr. Claw. The rest of the cast such as Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Cheri Oteri, Michelle Trachtenberg and Dabney Coleman also do a good job.The film itself is plenty of fun. The opening scene is fantastic as Officer Brown (a pre-robotic Insp. Gadget) prevents a disaster and throughout the film there are plenty of great scenes especially those where Gadget faces his doppelganger.The film was good except that I expected it to adhere more to the cartoon version. Chief Quimby doesn't like Gadget at the beginning of the film whereas in the cartoon, Gadget was Quimby's top officer. Another thing was Dr. Claw. Rupert Everett did a good job as the bumbling Dr. Claw but I would have preferred a menacing and unseen Dr. Claw like the one from the cartoon. However, I guess change is inevitable when adapting a film from a cartoon.All in all, Inspector Gadget is worth checking out.",

            "content": "First off, let me say that I liked Inspector Gadget overall, and gave it a rating of 7/10.In looking over the comments here, I was a bit puzzled to see people complaining about the \"lack of plot\".WHADDAYA MEAN, THERE'S NO PLOT???  If there's no plot, there must be something wrong with my brain, because I had no trouble following the (supposedly nonexistent) plot.  I'm left to wonder if people are looking for something more complex than what they got.  Come on, this is a movie based on a kids' cartoon, of course the plot is going to be simple!I will admit, there is one glaring plot hole that bugs me, namely, on the day of the final battle, Pittsburgh (starring as Riverton City) looks in pretty good shape for a city that was supposedly torched by the evil Robogadget the night before.  I could also have done without the suggestive gag with Gadget and the eastern meditation guru....About product placement.  Yes, the Yahoo billboard and the Gadgetmobile's Coke/Skittles dispenser are blatant.  But some of the reviews I've seen give the impression that they dominate and/or detract from the movie.  Sorry, nitpickers, but they don't.  (Although the Gadgetmobile's line about having the Skittles knocked out of him was BAAAAD....)Aside from these few gripes, I thought the movie was very enjoyable.  The important thing to understand is that it's basically a live-action cartoon. That was my attitude going in, and it paid off with lots of laughs at the cartoonish sight gags.  Penny, though she doesn't get much screen time, still gets an important role to play in the films finale (contrary to what I heard, and therefore a delightful surprise); Gadget, though a bit smarter, is still as klutzy as ever; and the Pittsburgh backdrop is put to very good use.  And, it's about time Gadget got a girlfriend.  :)",

            "content": "This 1999 live action Disney film is based on the 1980s cartoon series of the same name. I must confess, I'm not too familiar with the cartoon. I did see it a bit during my childhood (reruns in the '90s), but have very little memory of it. I had never heard of this movie until a couple years ago, as my last year of high school was drawing to an end. I got to see the first little bit of it in one of my classes, when we had no work to do. Eventually, it was interrupted by a fire drill, and by the time we were allowed back inside, the class was over. Two years later, out of curiosity, I have finally watched the whole thing, but it wasn't much fun.Officer John Brown is a security guard who is severely injured in an explosion, after a failed attempt to catch the evil Sanford Scolex! Fortunately, Dr. Brenda Bradford, who specializes in robotics, manages to save him by inserting cybernetic components into his body. This is how he gets the name, \"Inspector Gadget\", and with his new robotic functions, he becomes a police officer, which is a dream come true for him! However, many problems ensue for Inspector Gadget with his new functions and job. He must now battle Sanford Scolex (or \"The Claw\"), and stop him from carrying out his evil plans with stolen cybernetic components, but this will obviously be a challenging for Gadget, and sometimes, it may seem hopeless! In addition to that, the cybernetic cop finds that his gadgets don't always work! Many criticise this movie for how much it differs from the animated series that preceded it. Like I said, I'm not that familiar with the cartoon, so I can't point out any major differences, apart the one you obviously already know, one is animated and the other is live action. However, knowing how people have complained about many differences, I can't deny it, and can see why a fan or former fan of the show wouldn't be too pleased about it. Basically, I'm just going to have to focus on 1999's \"Inspector Gadget\" as a film. As a comedy, it's not very funny at all, in my opinion (I didn't laugh, or ever smile once). No horrendous gags, but no remotely funny ones, either, and some of them might be just a tad annoying, such as Gadget reaching out and accidentally grabbing the guru in a VERY uncomfortable place while blindfolded (in fact, as a guy, I found this a tad disturbing), and the scenes with RoboBrenda. Unfortunately, there's nothing to make up for this.This 1999 adaptation of the popular '80s cartoon show is, by definition, a kids' movie, and as such, I guess it's not so bad. However, for anything else other than a kids' movie, I suggest you forget about this version of \"Inspector Gadget\", regardless of what you may think of the cartoon series, or how familiar you are with that show. In my opinion, Gadget grabbing the guru in the most uncomfortable place is the most memorable part, but in a bad way. I doubt too many of us guys could forget that scene, as much as I'm sure many of us would want to! Apart from that, most of the movie is forgettable. If you want a Disney flick that can captivate many kids and adults alike, there are lots of those, but this is not one of them.",

I don't know what little kids (whom this film is meant to be for) think about it, but I liked it. All in all I found this film pretty OK, it was a bit cheesy of course (especially the henchman at the end) and I never really laughed but it was watchable due to the effects and the sphere it brought over. The thing I liked least about this film though were the \u0091jokes' at the end of the credits, they were really lousy and kind of messed up the actual ending, so my advice: do not watch the credits.\nFor me as an adult this was average, what kids think I don't know, hey I liked E.T. a lot when I was young and now, well does the expression yak!!!! Mean anything to you.\nThere are now actually but two things I want to say. The first is if you like this one, try RoboCop, which is by the way a Paul Verhoeven film, so don't try and watch it when your under 17 or so and the second thing is actually a question. That Kramer dude in Inspector Gadget (watch out for the freaky hair), is he a spoof of Seinfeld's Cosmo Kramer or was the Kramer in Seinfeld a spoof of Inspector Gadget?????

            "content": "INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) **Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg   80 minutes   Rated PGBy Blake French:Disney's new film, \"Inspector Gadget\" is about a cop named John who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says \"Go Go,\" only to be called Inspector Gadget!The actual movie's structure is much like the body formation of Inspector Gadget himself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6-9 would enjoy.The cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick, who, until \"Inspector Gadget,\" was on a success spree with movies like \"Election.\" His character becomes Inspector Gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful \"William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream.\"There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving Inspector Gadget's wacky body parts and mechanism elements. It has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father, who was earlier killed by Claw. Competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. Also a major character is the Gadget Mobil, a life like automobile that is devised for Inspector Gadget himself. It is voiced by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy \"The Hughly's.\"\"Inspector Gadget\" is a movie that I found quite bad. I know, I am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. The movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself caring about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film, \"Mr. Magoo,\" which opened using clips of the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke: Inspector Gadget's bumbling goofiness.In movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries-something to help make out what can happen and what can not. In \"Inspector Gadget\" there are no such boundaries. This is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors, who surly had lots of fun. I am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called \"Blankman\" which again, contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it too lacked something needed for every movie: audience participation.A character that I found being left out a lot is Gadgets daughter, who by the end of the movie, I still has not clue of what her name was. She is used only as a plot device-and I question how she was used to further the plot as well. For her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. We never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents. Thus, this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.In closing, I'd like to state that \"Inspector Gadget\" is an awful, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti-young audience action picture \"Blade.\" I am stating once again that I had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens. \"Inspector Gadget\" had so much going for it at the same time, it made literally made me dizzy.",

            "content": "\"Inspector Gadget\" (1999), I remember watching the original \"Inspector Gadget\" (1982-1986) TV series as a kid and enjoying it quite a lot. Even though I was born in 1992, they still aired reruns of the show. Whenever it came on, I always had fun watching it. So, as you can imagine, when I first heard about this \"film\" coming out, I was excited about seeing it. But sadly, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was just okay, in my opinion. Then, the more I watched it, the more I hated it. This \"movie\" has a cliched and boring story, standard to terrible acting and cheesy special effects. The plot is, a security guard named John Brown is involved in a near-death accident. Sanford Scolex a.k.a. Doctor Claw also winds up getting hurt badly in the accident as well, which results in him becoming Doctor Claw. From there, John is transformed into a cybernetic police officer, which will help keep him alive. The opening scene leading up to him being transformed into Inspector Gadget was honestly pretty well-executed. That was all well and good, showing a similar fate between the primary protagonist and antagonist. However, there's one glaring issue here, the villainous Doctor Claw's face was fully exposed! In the original animated show, Doctor Claw was never shown. He was always a hidden character, which made him all the more intriguing. Just when you thought that there couldn't be anymore issues, you haven't seen anything yet! After John Brown becomes Inspector Gadget, Doctor Claw plans to take over the world (how original!) From there, it's up to Inspector Gadget to stop him. They got the concept correct, but the execution was so terrible that it almost doesn't seem real. For the most part, I just thought: \"what am I even looking at?\" It's like the story doesn't know where to go, and it's just random with nothing of substance happening! This \"film\" is nothing but non-stop extreme nonsense with an onslaught of unresolved subplots and then it ends. As for the acting, it's just as weak as the plot. But, the worst performance comes from the main star himself, Matthew Broderick as John Brown/Inspector Gadget. Just like the storyline, his acting is all over the place. It's like he doesn't know what kind of performance to give, so he keeps changing it up with every single scene. Also, his line delivery is off as well. With nearly every sentence he speaks, it's never focused on just one specific emotion. An inconsistent performance always results in a confused audience. Rupert Everett is also a letdown as Doctor Claw. When you look at him and listen to his voice, you would never know that he's supposed to be Doctor Claw! The rest of the cast is just standard to bad with their acting. As for the special effects, most of them are passable. However, the majority of them have not aged well. Especially the CGI effects! At least they do try to incorporate some practical effects here, and a lot of them are good. But, even those can get a little bit cheesy at times! Another thing, the editing is horrible. Some of the shots and angles are so poorly composed, that you can't even tell what's going on! Also, some of the shots last for less than a second. Why would they include those shots when you can barely see them? Overall, the special effects are just hit and miss. Now, let's get to the only two positive elements in this \"film\", which are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give the \"movie\" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Debney is well-done. His film score really sets the tone for the plot. If only the story was actually worth it, then his film score would've had more meaning to it! John Debney has written a lot of great movie soundtracks, and this one is no different. \"Inspector Gadget\" is one of the worst live-action adaptations of an animated TV series I've ever seen. Had it been completely void of any redeeming qualities, then it would've been on one of my top ten worst lists! You just watch this \"movie\" and gain next to nothing out if it. I rate this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stick with the original animated \"Inspector Gadget\" TV series, because this \"movie\" does very little justice to it. All it does is leave scars that will never heal. Whenever I think of this \"film\", I cringe! Now, I know what you're all thinking. \"What do you think of the sequel?\" Well, that'll be a whole different review for another time. Bottom line, just avoid this \"movie\" like the plague. Instead of saying the phrase, \"go, go, Gadget!\" You'll just be yelling: \"go, go, go away, movie!\"",

            "content": "What is it with Disney movies? Inspector Gadget and Herbie Fully Loaded are just two of the reasons that I think that they're (almost) unwatchable.Perhaps it's just to cater to 'the kids' - like Lucas did with his new trilogy - that they 'hipped up' everything even at the cost of losing the spirit of the cartoon.Inspector Gadget was one of my favorite cartoons - I used to tape every episode on Betamax (and I even taped over a rented Top Gun beta because I didn't check what was in the Beta!) - and I was really hoping (perhaps against hope) that Disney would do it right for a change.This offering is nowhere NEAR the Cartoon Inspector Gadget. At best it shares the character and the basic storyline but it has none of the 'smarts' and attraction that the cartoon did. As many other reviews mentioned almost everything in this movie is 'non-canonical'.First off, Matthew Broderick as Gadget? Come on! What's Colonel Robert Gould Shaw doing there pray tell?? He talks just the same way he did in Glory (and I love that movie by the way) not in that very strange high pitched Inspector Gadget voice. And John Brown? PLEASE! When did this become a Civil War picture? Second, attitude. Inspector Gadget is a cartoon Clouseau, he's a clueless Mr.Incredible, he THINKS (and everyone else thinks) that he's doing it all with his gadgets but it's really Penny and Brain! Third, Penny and Brain. This is where they really botch it big I think. The central premise of Inspector Gadget (the cartoon) is CHILD WISH FULFILLMENT - it's letting the child viewer identify with Penny and Brain, it's almost like Charlie Brown and Snoopy as detectives (well maybe not Charlie Brown, but you get what I mean, a child and their pet out on a great adventure). Sure, Gadget is the vehicle that makes the show move but Penny and Brain are the ones that solve things. There's also that super computer book which (before the internet) was just the coolest thing - the information of the world at your fingertips.They brought Scooby and Garfield to life, why not Brain? This is a really important point I think. This is certainly why I watched - and the thought that for a 12 year old kid Penny was smart and smart=sexy. Disney used to do this so well - how could they miss the mark so badly here? Third, Dr.Claw - he's Jaws (the shark). You don't show the shark till the end and maybe not even then. Even in the cartoon intro when Gadget puts the cuffs on him and it's a bomb. That's just the best. Why bother showing his face? Would you show the face of the neighbor in Home Improvement? Fourth, the wise-ass mobile. That really spoiled it for me big time at first viewing. What is this Shrek and Donkey except Broderick's 'security guard' with no attitude is less of a character than Shrek? The Gadget mobile was almost like one of the Bond mobiles - can you imagine the Bond mobile shooting its mouth off like that? Too much stupid and unnecessary updating.I don't know why they even bother, except for lucrative gain. Those people are all special effects and NO form, NO substance. They never did their homework and found out what made Inspector Gadget tick. Heaven forbid they do 'Where in the World is Carmen San Diego' the movie!",

Writers who think Abusing animals & using them like punching bags is hilarious.Inspector Gadget is almost like the quintessential blueprint for \"cheap, poor taste, poorly live-action \"comedy\"\".Here's the entire joke of the series; hold your sides in case they split. \"The monkey gets bullied and abused (hahaha so funny!) and unpleasant (ahahaha) and the main kid whines a lot (ha...ha....haa...)\".Do you get the joke? It's funny because Beast Wars did these jokes prior this show *constantly*. Isn't that hilarious? No?Hm. Well, if that's not funny, what if we do it a million times? Surely that will be hilarious?It's almost agonising explaining the concept because this whole show is so painfully stupid. It's designed by people who are either stupid or simply lazy in order to appeal to other people who are stupid and/or intellectually lazy.If you're forced to be subjected to this awful film, at least treat yourself to The Happytime Murders. It's like an antidote to this fatal poison.(Oh, and I haven't even mentioned that the main character is a mockery of a literal monkey that the writers know nothing about. Because trying to ruin a kid's life by portraying them as an ass in a TV show is a totally moral thing to do. Disgusting).",

            "content": "\"Inspector Gadget\" the cartoon show was a funny, light-hearted romp not unlike other cartoon shows made before the duldrums of Congressional legislation changed the kids TV market. The show featured a half-man, half-robot, half-witted policeman (voiced flawlessly by Don Adams of \"Get Smart\" fame) and his adventures solving crimes with MUCH assistance from his niece Penny and faithful dog Brain. Having loved the TV show immensely, I immediately saw the film upon its release. Now there's one 5 dollar bill I'd like back.I should have known how bad the movie version would be - having seen the bad commercials and the inevitable McDonald's promotional tie-ins. And to top it all off, the movie was produced by Disney - notorious for butchering perfectly good source material for their own profit. Just look at \"The Jungle Book\" and \"The Little Mermaid\", movie adaptations that are far from what the original authors of each respective work had in mind. Disney has once again chopped up its source material - this time one of my favorite cartoons.Matthew Broderick is the predictably youthful choice to play Gadget, the man with more inventions than a swiss army knife and less brain cells than an organ grinding monkey. Had Disney wanted to make a movie more pleasing to a broader audience the natural choice to play Gadget would have been the voice of Gadget himself - Don Adams. Even considering that this is a kids movie, Broderick is extremely hammy and not at all funny as Gadget. Equally bad is Rupert Everett as Claw - he's about as intimidating as a housewife with a bad manicure.The good news is the supporting cast is solid. Michele Tractenberg makes a good Penny (although the cartoon Penny was blonde, not brunette) and Dabney Coleman is good as Chief Quimby. Cheri Oteri as the mayor and DL Hughley as voice of the Gadget mobile are also solid for the few scenes they appear in. Joely Fisher is good as Gadget's love interest.The worst news is that the movie ignores almost everything fans loved about the cartoon. Penny is nowhere near as smart as she was in the cartoon and Gadget nowhere near as dumb. It is apparent that no one involved in the making of the film knew anything about the material upon which the film was based. The Gadget-copter is called a \"Gadget-chopper\" and even Gadget's catch phrase \"Wowsers!\" is sans the 's'. While some criticize the cartoon as being empty-headed and formulaic, the movie is dumber and scatterbrained. It seems like the filmmakers filmed a bunch of stuff they thought would be entertaining and filled in the gaps as they went along. The plot is so scattered - the evil Gadget subplot seems tacked on - that it makes no sense whatsover.No doubt kids, who care nothing about plot and will laugh at anything will find this movie entertaining. The old fans of the cartoon will groan in pain though. The movie gets a 9 for some nostalgic value and a -1 for entertainment value.",

I laughed once, when the Yahoo! billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came on.  However, that was only because I thought it was making fun of it, but then I realized it was yet ANOTHER product placement. \nI loved the cartoon.  I used to watch it almost religiously.  (although i missed the last episode.  I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, somebody comment on the show's page)  The cartoon had Penny and Brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point.  I hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop.  Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget.  He is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was.  Another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, except for the oil slick.  He also screwed with the tone of \"Wowsers\" which used to be in an excited tone.  I felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly.  Everybody else felt that way too.  Us 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon.  I was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. It relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor.  Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along.  Product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows.  The wise-cracking car is not that good at cracking wise.  The gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy.  The cartoon was a better look.  The silly scenes were crap.  In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right preview.  This movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment.  I highly recommend \"The Iron Giant,\" which was sad, but very very good.  This movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1",

The movie was a little shorter than I expected, but I guess that is so the kids (the main audience) can keep attention at all times. I did have a few pet peeves with the movie. For one they are in \"Riverton\" and it is suppose to be \"Metrocity\". Second, Penny does not have a computer book or her communicator watch ( she gets the watch at the end during the credits). Third, Dr. Claw is just Claw (one word, like Madonna;) ) and, he does not have an organization called \"MAD\". Not to mention, we see his face, unlike in the cartoon.

            "content": "\"Inspector Gadget\"Nothing brings about sweaty palms quite like a Disney live action movie event. This time the Mouse has a beloved 80's cartoon to work with and a huge effects budget to bring it to life. I really was hoping for something good, but I knew in the corners of my mind that Disney just can't pull this type of film off anymore. With Walt gone, all this material means to the company is Happy Meals and video sales. \"Gadget\" is an outrage of giant magnitude. The latest in a string of Disney live action family films with no class and no respect to the viewer.If anything is inspired about \"Inspector\", it might be the casting of Matthew Broderick as our multi-gadgeted hero. Broderick still has the right amount of fresh faced charm and honest personality for the role. I doubt anybody else could have been a better choice to play the character, but then again I can't see anyone else taking the part after reading the script. The plot is basic, evil Claw(Rupert Everett in an embarrassing performance) vs. good Gadget. They also take the time to show us the origins of the characters, something the show never did. I would like to know why, in each of these cartoon or comic based movies, do we need to show the character foundations. \"Gadget\" would have been a lot more satisfying if they just dropped us in on the action and skipped the needless back story.Distressing, almost hilariously so, is the use of Gadget's \"thought balloons\" for three key moments. It's no secret that this film tested very poorly and was continuously edited down to the current bare bones running time of 80 minutes. What was deleted was basically every inch of narrative(check out the Evil Joely Fisher, in purple latex, that comes out of nowhere and then leaves even quicker) and character, leaving only the action and more action aspects of the movie intact. I submit that this might be the first film that could legally be diagnosed with ADD. But back to the thought balloons... Some scenes that were cut are back in the film in spilt-second memories that Gadget has about plotlines that were excised. Each contain effects that I know Disney ordered back in due to the high cost of creating them. In the middle of all the noise we get Gadget remembering more noise. It's weird to describe it, it's even weirder to see it.Since this is Disney flick, the filmmakers also include heaps of product placement. To those who found the gratuitous \"Austin Powers 2\" beer plug distasteful should stay away from the \"Gadget\" McDonalds, Skittles, Coke products, Tommy clothes(see below), and most blatantly, the Yahoo Internet corporation plugs. I've come to expect this behavior, but the discretion in which the placements are being presented is getting faint.\nWith the use of a huge budget the film does have the unique virtue of fully fleshing out the Inspector's gadgets. I'm trying hard not to be a sour puss, so I will heartily admit that the special effects are great. They colorfully display Gadget's trinkets more realistically than I could have imagined. The filmmakers deserve credit for the creation, but they ruin it with Gadget constantly in the midst of mayhem. There should've been more opportunities for Gadget to breathe, for the audience to get used to madness. No such luck. \"Gadget\" runs at full steam from opening credits to closing credits.Almost sacrilegiously, the filmmakers have also decided to tamper with the essence of \"Gadget\". Niece Penny (sharply played by Michelle Tractenberg, in full Tommy Hillfiger gear) and canine Brain were, in the cartoon, the real reason Gadget got out of trouble. The real inspectors behind the Gadget. In this film, the two are quickly introduced and then quickly forgotten. The film relies on Gadget alone to solve the crime. He bumbles has way across town while Brain and Penny sit and watch. By taking out the essential charm, why did they even bother to make the film? Oh yeah, to sell toys.\n\"Inspector Gadget\" is the bain of current children's cinema. The nation complains about violence and the impact on children, all the while blaming movies aimed at adults. The real enemy are these frenetic kid's films with nothing redemptive about them. \"Gadget\" is a one-note weapon of mass distraction aimed at kids all over the country. Take my advice and go, go, go to a different movie.--------- 1",

Gone is the simplistic but comforting plot of Qumiby calling on Gadget, Gadget in trouble, Penny/Brain saving the day, and Claw finishing \"I'll get you next time, Gadget.

Together with his talking car - oh man, that was almost Herbie - they fight crime and try to stop the second Gadget from destroying the town.

You knew what would happen to the guru.  There's a scene spoofing Godzilla, but that idea was recently seen in The Lost World: Jurassic Park.  The English Patient joke was funny though. When I saw the trailer and learned the plot involves an imposter of Inspector Gadget, I had the instant feeling this may not turn out so well. It's like what happened to the movie Judge Dredd.  You barely know these characters to care about them.  The hero would have to prove what makes him great.  As it is, it's 80 minutes long to state what makes Gadget a great character.Also, what's curious is the fact that a director known only for the movie Cool as Ice gets a gig for this big budget movie.The verdict: 2.5 of 5 stars.",

            "content": "There are adaptions and there are remakes of cartoons. This movie straight up defiles the cartoon it was based upon. If there were a porno based up the Inspector Gadget franchise, I'd find it'd be pressed hard to be more offensive then Matthew Brodrick's performance as Inspector Gadget. To put it into perspective... there was a direct to video sequel starring French Stewart as Gadget... that was infinitely better as it least French Stewart knows how to play a bumbling idiot. It would seem rather then been watch Get Smart, The Pink Panther movers and the Original series Brodrick instead decided to watch Rob Schneider Movies as he plays Gadget as some unlucky guy were supposed feel sorry for and hope he gets the girl. This enough is more then enough to upset the fans of the original show, but that wasn't enough for the people writing this film. Dr. Claw in the original series was always hidden in the shadows, making him one of the most iconic villains for not being seen... this movie didn't even wait a half hour to give him a face... or an excuse to have the claw name by having him lose his hand in a really really stupid way along with when Joe (yeah they thought that Gadget needed a name) got his cyborg body.Penny and Brain in the original show did most of the work so that Gadget could take the credit and be a hero. Here they almost weren't even present and you can't say it was they were too afraid at the idea of cgi effects (straight up abuse in this film) given what they did with brain in the credits. Chief Quimby was played up as a straight up jerk the whole movie too.This issue I have is about a character but it gets its own point because of just how awful it was. In the cartoon Gadget near the end of the series got his \"Scrappy Doo\" of the time, Corporal Capeman, an obnoxious overweight man who boarders on being a vigilante but ends up extending Gadget's gross incompetence.... he would have been a welcome condition compared to what gadget got as a sidekick... namely the the gadget mobile. In the original cartoon the gadget mobile was quiet, it's most amazing feature was it was a police car that was up to racing specifications that could become a precursor to sub suv. Here they decided to turn it into an obnoxious, severely racist stereotype, wingman to Gadget. I know it was part of Disneys need to push some over the top magical character in kid's faces but It was obnoxious to some of us who were grown teens who grew up with the show and had this paste it character added.The plot follows Joe Brown as a originally a pathetic security guard hoping to become a police officer but didn't have what it takes, so one day while working guarding a science firm working on building cybernetics controlled by psionic transferring chips allowing people to control robot parts with the human brain... he interrupts a robbery by Dr. Claw and his henchmen and he gets blown up after the scientist who made the parts gets murdered but his daughter sees the effort Joe went through to try and save her dad and insists they do unethical beyond belief things to save Joe's life turning him into something looking like a cross between Robocop and the Mask.Joe becomes Inspector gadget, someone chief quimby treats like he deserves to be treated given he hasn't done anything at this point to make him more then mascot for the police force then anything. Gadget insists on trying to catch claw.At some point as if Brodricks bad acting wasn't bad enough, a robo gadget shows up built by claws henchmen... it demonstrates that brodrick can play an evil version of gadget somehow even worse then his portrayal of good gadget.Somewhere along the movie claw snaps the chip that lets gadget control his gadgets and it looks like he effectively dies... til magically he saved by his heart with the power of love or something. In the end he catches claw (can't they even get that right?) and saves the day.To say this movie was bad would be like saying wisdom tooth surgery pain is a bit achy.",

I did not like the fact that you could see Claw's face.  That just shouldn't have been.  And what about the car?  Didn't it change from a car to a mini van kind of thing?  And while we're on the subject of the car, what about the fact that it could talk?  Hmmmm...The effects weren't overdone, as some might have thought.  The previews were not as representative of the movie as I originally saw them to be.Matthew Broderick was a perfect casting choice in this; he has the mannerisms and the endearing qualities that make him the ideal Inspector.All in all, I liked the movie immensely.  This is one movie that I'm going to buy as soon as it comes out on video or DVD.

Michelle Trachtenberg, captured just before she scored the plum role of Dawn on \"Buffy\", is a prodigious young talent, but is given too little to do in this sub-par film adaptation of the \"Inspector Gadget\" animated series. Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett mug shamelessly to little effect, and the end result is frankly a mess. The film is too chaotic and violent for very young children, though it might just work for pre-teens. For older viewers, there is too much cuteness (typical Disney), the acting is way too hammy and apart from the challenge of spot-the-cameo, there is not much on offer.The film pretends to be a retread of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", but in fact offers a saccharine reworking of \"Robocop\", as bumbling but good-hearted security guard John Brown (Broderick) is horrifically injured in a robbery-murder, providing the raw material for the eponymous crime fighter. Unlike the animated series, the film emphasises Gadget (and the romantic interest, robotics expert Dr. Brenda Bradford) and plays down the importance of Gadget's niece Penny and dog Brain, who in the cartoon series did all the detective work while Gadget bumbled about, getting himself into trouble.This film also deserves some sort of award for shameless product placement. The billboard with an internet search engine prominently displayed could be forgiven, but the candy and soft drink vending machine in Gadget's car - in a children's picture - is beyond the pale. Even Robocop would baulk at this level of corporate mind control.",

I can hear what Walt would say if he saw what Eisner was doing: \"What have you done to my empire?\"This movie was made after Disney bought off DiC Animation City (but they're free from Eisner's clutches now) so they make a live-action movie based off one of their classic '80's 'toons, namely \"Inspector Gadget\".  Novel concept!And what do they do?  Disney-ify it.  Meaning: many changes are made just for the sake of changes.  I liked the Universal movie \"Street Fighter\" because it tried to tie in the game with news headlines of 1994.  This is just more junk, the newest brick-in-the-wall of the Disney empire. \nA \"Yahoo!\" billboard falls on Claw's car and we hear the tune from the commericals.  Stereotypical Asian music plays as a doctor holds up a pair of chopsticks.  This is one element of a cartoon that falls flat in live-action.  Product placements everywhere.  Skittles, McDonalds, Apple Computers, etc.  At the time this movie was in theatres, McDonald's had an \"Inspector Gadget\" promotion and Skittles candies gave away prizes tying in with this movie.  Shameless, huh?  All that missing was the mottos from the commericals.  Little nitpick I also found: while the cartoon took place in Metro City, this movie takes place in Riverton.  (Just wait.)  The Gadgetmobile's license plate, which is built by Brenda, reads Ohio.  But at the Gadget vs. Evil Gadget fight, doesn't the bridge they're fighting on look a lot like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco?This film just sinks under all it's gimmicks and ads.  Nothing priceless, Walt wouldn't be proud.  After paying little homage to the cartoon (THEY SHOWED DR. CLAW'S FACE!!!  HOW DARE THEY!!!), the Gadgetmobile, during the credits, says, \"This was my movie.  That's right, MY movie.  Even though we called it \"Inspector Gadget\".\"  If they called it \"The Wacky Talking Police Squad Car Movie,\" no one would've bought it.  It's almost like they're hinting at something.  Like this was almost another movie before the cartoon's name was slapped on it.  That's license abuse!Bottom line: Misassembled.   Go go get \"The Iron Giant\" instead.",

In fact, it's a horrible movie, the type that knows it's insulting the audience's intelligence and gloats on this fact.  But, dang it, I laughed.  Not constantly, grant you, but enough for me to leave thinking, \"That was funny.\"  Horrible, but still decidedly funny.Actually, \"Inspector Gadget\" gets fairly high honors in my book, because I'm forced to rate it as my second favorite terrible movie, the first being Tim Burton's \"Mars Attacks!\"  The problem was that it was funny at places, and those places were almost enough to make it a funny movie.Now, let me state the obvious.  The script is horrid.  Or maybe even worse than that.  Let me put it this way:  It's even worse than \"Titanic,\" a lot worse.  Also, David Kellogg's direction is idiotic, over-the-top, zany, and utterly revolting.  The film stars quite a few talented figures, like Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett, but they're all completely wasted.Still, it's funny.  What more can I really say?** out of ****.",

Gadget was smart in this one, not his hilarious idiotic self like he is in the cartoon. In the series, Penny and Brain always solved the case, they could have been written out of this movie totally and it would have been better. Dr. Claw was a total mistake! You never, ever saw his face in the series. The only way you could see his face was the action figure that was made of him. (which looked crappy too!)  And what about his claw?  It wasn't even a claw, it was a clamp!  Granted the metal arm and hand in the series wasn't a claw either but at least it was cool.  MADD cat in the movie was pure white, nothing like the black and grey cat we all loved and they even gave him a different name. This movie sucks and if watched (you better not spend money on it) should be considered it's own movie and not even though as having anything to do with the cartoon.

This movie is way too short and has way too much bad acting to be of any use to any living creature...unless you run out of fire wood.   I'm looking at a can of Sprite right now and realizing that, in fact, the can of Sprite is funnier and much more fulfilling than this movie.Unless you include Broderick's voice acting as Simba in The Lion King (1994), Election (1999) has been his only good movie since Glory (1989). Hopefully, Broderick can get out of this bad movie funk soon, because he is very fun to watch on the big screen.2 out of 10",

Dr. Claw was never shown in the cartoon we just heard his voice. In the movie we see his face and body for the entire movie. Penny was an insult. Her character was crucial in the animated series, but here she was useless and did absolutely nothing. You could cut her character out the movie and nothing vaule was lost. Michelle Tractenberg was also miscast. There was no chemistry between Matthew Broderick and love interest Joely Fisher. DL Hughley is obnoxious as the voice of the talking car. Typical jive talking black guy. The movie is poorly directed, goofy sound effects, it's not funny, and the movie was wayyyy too short! This movie is only 1 hour and 10 minutes and that's not including the end credits.... This movie stinks! Just watch the original animated series from the 80's.",

The special FX are pretty good, due in most part to Stan Winston Studios and Dream Quest Images ( it's interesting to see how far they've come since their 'Nightmare on Elm Street' days, if only in a better movie). There are some clever moments in here, but they could easily be fit into a comercial. It's very sad to hear Don Adams was in this. To me, he is the ONLY Inspector Gadget.

The director has the right to take many changes in any adaptation of a story, and for legitimate reason. But in a sequel, he SHOULD NOT make any (which happened to IG2).I feel the casting, direction, comic content, SFX/ VFX all are really fine and blended perfectly to suit the sci-fi-comedy theme of the movie.I always liked Rupert in his role as Klaw - perfect for the villain needed against our hero.Bottom line: Disney had adapted, refined the story.

The movie by itself is great, nontheless.)  For one, they didn't get Penny and Brain as involved as I thought they might have.  I guess the GadgetMobile kind of stole some of that supporting-actor thunder.  Also, I was somewhat dissappointed that they made almost no effort to hide Dr. Claw's face and overall appearance.  It would have been cool to see them do clever things to hide his face, a la Wilson on \"Home Improvement\" or Ms. Bellum on \"The Powerpuff Girls.\"  In addition, they didn't have the cat-face logo for Dr. Claw. Also, I feel that they failed to fully capture the \"Get Smart\"-esque feel of Inspector Gadget's character.Of course, this isn't to take away from the movie, which is excellent by all other standards.It was interesting to see how they used the CGI for the different gadgets, etc.SPOILERS OVER!Overall, I'd say that this movie is worth the time to see.

            "content": "Overall, I thought this film was below average, even for a Disney kids' movie.  I love the cartoon \"Inspector Gadget.\"  Unfortunately, I thought this film was a cheap hack of a vehicle mainly used to promote products like Coke and Skittles.  (As it is, in the theatre I'm already sick of being shown commercials before the trailers.  This isn't television, dangit; didn't I *pay* for this?  Why weren't these ads booed away like they were in the 80's the last time the theatres tried this?)  And why is it only 70 minutes from Disney logo to roll credits?As an adult, I found the Gadget movie to be tedious in many places and largely lacking development.  The slapstick humor, such as when Gadget accidentally grabs a man's crotch, generally did not make me smile even a little.  However, I can see how this kind of humor would appeal to children.I enjoyed some of the gags, like the \"Minions Anonymous\" bit, but if this were an adult movie, I would have been hard-pressed to give it a 3 because of the annoyingly overt product placement and the repeated direct address of the audience with references to Disney.  (Not to mention my disappointment since the cartoon Gadget was so superior.)  Disney has produced much better movies.Rating this as a kid's movie, and considering the aforementioned issues, I gave it a 4.",

The tricks and gadgets that the Inspector (Matthew Broderick) is constantly pulling seemed to me to get a little repetitious after a while.\nJoely Fisher makes a very bright and effervescent screen presence. Much more than I can remember in any of her previous films. And Rupert Everett, as Claw, the Inspector's nemesis, is a hoot. He plays the bad guy very, very broadly and is so different than any other role I have seen him in that it is hard to believe it is actually Everett in the role.\nI can't say I am sorry I went to the movie, but it really didn't live up to my expectations. I would give it about a 6 on a scale of 10.",

Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It looks like they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you don't get a refund. I'm sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap.

Also, to give it spice, they gave it a remarkable score, by John Debney, with touches of that familiar old cartoon score. The music has almost as much of an action feel as the movie does! To bad the score isn't available on CD!The CGI is seamless. This is one of the few films where the special effects don't look like they are done by CGI!!! I'm not knocking other films with CGI by any means, but in this particular film I think Dream Quest Images have out done themselves!The acting is A+++. Rupert Everett, is remarkably funny as Claw, his facial expressions will have you rolling on the ground in laughter.Matthew Broderick is also funny as the Inspector Gadget.....just watch as he first discovers about his new abilities!Great movie, all the way. It is a must see. If you get it on DVD, you get 2 times as much of the fun, and the picture quality is wonderful!  An action packed film filled with fun, fun, fun. Remarkable!",

Joely Fisher and Michelle Trachtenberg are a little livelier as scientist Brenda Bradford and Gadget's niece Penny -- but not much.The writing is bland, too, with more classic-Disney platitudes than any live-action Disney comedy has used in decades.  There are rare moments when it develops a faint sparkle, mostly when it's breaking the fourth wall (the Gadgetmobile remarks partway through on this being a Disney movie), but nobody's really made an effort to put any sort of spin on the standard hero-girl-evil genius plot.

Also you'd think an English actor of Rupert Everett's calibre would have been able to point out to someone that phrases like \"myriad of\" are grammatically horrible and sound moronic. For these two reasons, if you let your children watch this, you are a bad parent.Another thing is the Comedy Black Man, the Uncle Tom type, which has become a massive clich\u00e9 in films over recent years, and which I find really annoying.

For one thing, Matthew Broderick is not a bad actor, but this just wasn't a good part for him.  I mean, he didn't even try to do the voice right!  The bumbling, incompetent, extremely self-confident Inspector Gadget from the cartoon was way more funny.  Dr. Claw was a disappointment too.  How can he not be, when they replace a scary, mysterious person with a sniveling little wimp?  Penny and Brain and the Mad Agents being missing in action wasn't a good idea either.  They made for the entire plot of the cartoon.  There was too much romance and confusing plot development and not enough humor.  The worst part of this movie though?  The Gadgetmobile, hands down.  With a personality at least as obnoxious as those of Jar-Jar Binks and Scrappy-Doo, I still can't see what the writers were thinking when they came up with that.  Take away Gadget's voice and personality, Dr. Claw's voice and personality, the antics of Penny and Brain, and the antics of the Mad Agents, and there goes all the humor that really made that series what it was.  If they do remake this movie or make a sequel, I sincerely hope that they think more of the fans of the cartoon.

While I don't think I reveal too much about the story or anything, I want to make sure I don't ruin it for anyone.Okay, this movie is EXACTLY what I expected.  I was a huge fan of the cartoon (and of Get Smart as well) as a young child, and had some hopes for this film.  I expected the kid stuff, it is, after all, a Disney movie, but that was outweighed by the thrill of seeing the Inspector himself in live action.  I felt that the time I spent on this movie was well worth it, as it brought back the fun I remembered about the series.  My comments below may seem a little on the harsh side, but I DID like the movie, I just have a tendency to see where I think things could have been done better.First off, the praise.  The special effects were pretty seamless and entertaining, put in where they should be, but the cinematography was wonderful!  The atmosphere in any given scene is exactly what it should be. Especially of note is the scene toward the beginning with Claw's limo being chased by Brown.  The lighting and camera angles are just what they should be.  The sets deserve just as much commendation.  The \"modern\" looking city was just enough cartoonish to fit with the movie, but not so much as to be unbelievable.The casting was pretty much on target.  Matthew Broderick provided a well enough Gadget, however he needed a little more development.  He goes from champion of justice to bumbling idiot just a little to quickly.  These aspects should have been blended a little more.  Rupert Everett played a perfectly diabolical Claw, but where was his CLAW?  Not this robot grasping thing he has here, but the metal glove CLAW?Now I come to Andy Dick.  What happened there?  Andy Dick, usually a very exuberant and fun actor suddenly becomes understated?  I ask, why?  His role provided some laughs, but not nearly enough as there should have been.  He should have been allowed to cut loose.  Well, there's always the sequel.Everyone else does a pretty good job, though, with the little material they had.  Dabney Coleman and Cheri Oteri needed way more screen time than they got, as their's were the most enjoyable characters.  Michelle Trachtenberg played Penny very well, but her role as the one who always saves Gadget from his own idiocy wasn't there as it should have been.  In fact, I can't think of anything really important she did to influence the finale (except for the Minions Anonymous scene).  Joely Fisher did a good job, but the Robo version of her was unnecessary.  And, of course, Rene Auberjonois is always fun to see (Odo from DS9 for non-Trekkies).Okay, now down to the REAL complaints.  The Gadgetmobile.  At the very least, its screentime should have been cut by two-thirds.  D.L. Hughley was not the right choice for the voice either.  In my opinion, THIS is where Don Adams should have been, not in a ten-second scene during the credits.  I get upset just thinking of the jokes that would have been possible between Broderick and Adams as the Gadgetmobile.  Alas, that was not to be.  Also, the CGI figure that represented the GM on the dashboard should have been eliminated, along with the literally blinking headlights.  In fact, unless Adams was there, the GM should have been eliminated altogether.Length.  An hour and eighteen minutes just doesn't cut it.  The movie should have been expanded and more screentime given to the costars of the TV show, namely Penny, Brain, and Chief Quimby.Plot.  Not enough.  Tell us WHY Claw wants these armies of Robomen!  His net worth is over 10 billion dollars, so what can these Roboguys do for him that 10 billion smackers can't?  The Robo-Gadget.  Good idea, but maybe should have been toned down in terms of cuteness.  He should have been a tad more menacing.  And how in the world did Gadget come back to life without that chip thingie?  I don't buy that.  I think Andy Dick's character got him a new one and Gadget was faking being dead to get a kiss.The jokes, and a lot of the movie overall, were too much on the kiddy side. Movies can be made that appeal to adults and kids.  Disney themselves proved this with Toy Story and it's worthy sequel.  Some of that cross-generational humor could have been well used here.Overall, as a prequel to the TV series, this wasn't too bad.  If you liked the old show, check it out.  The flaws can be overlooked if you try hard enough.  Anyway, like I said above, there's always the sequel.Go-Go Gadget!",

Are writers today so uninspired that everything they come up with is either at one time a cartoon or a TV sitcom? I loved Inspector Gadget as a child. It was one of my favorite cartoons,but this was a bad representation of it. For one thing,one of the really cool things about the cartoon was we never got to see Claw's face and throughout this whole movie his face is shown. Maybe it was intended to be more of a kid movie and that's why it couldn't hold my interest,but I wouldn't suggest wasting your time.",

Penny played a VERY crucial part in the cartoon, as opposed to barely on camera in the movie. What happened to Penny's cool power book that could do anything? And her radio watch (which was only shown at the end, what is that!), and her communication with Brain. These were the best parts of the cartoon in the 80's! In this new version, Penny is just a silly little niece who plays a minimal part, and Brain is simply a dog there for posterity. True, the special effects were very amusing (however not as extensive as the previews made them appear to be), but very poorly used. The talking gadgetmobile was just ridiculous. Was this supposed to make up for Penny's lack of technology? The \"cool\" and \"jazzy\" car seemed like just a space filler in a poorly planned movie, and the work of some bored animators. Those FX were trivial compared the things being done today. Another wonderful memory of the cartoon is the exploding missions and the chief getting blown up! That was great! Unfortunately, there was nothing even remotely similar in the movie! HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTING. The movie seemed to be created as a cute little love-story \"date movie\" instead of a cartoon turned movie. And it was a cute \"date movie\" that had the girl I took to see it saying \"awww\" by the end. So all in all, it was a decent movie. I do not think it was worth the $16 I had to pay for my date and I to see it in the movies though.",

As did his eight and six year old cousins.The movie follows recent Hollywood formula.  Take a well-like cartoon/comic-strip character, make it live action with as many useless special effects as possible.  In other words, film a concept because you can do it.So why did I give it a relatively high '5' rating ?Simple.

            "content": "Go Go Gadget Cheese.Last night I watched Inspector Gadget, Disney's live action re-make of the 80's Saturday morning cartoon.  Yes, yes, I can see you all groaning and shaking your heads.  What did I expect, mutter some of you, Citizen Kane? Well, no - my expectations going into the film were not that high - but there was no way I could have realized that it was going to be *that* bad (and I've seen Wing Commander, so I _know_ bad).John Brown(Mathew Broderick) is an inept, yet well meaning security gaurd who dreams of becoming a hero.   Dr. Brenda Bradford(Joely Fisher) is a scientist working with her father to perfect a new form of cybernetics. Sanford Scolex(Rupert Everett) is the evil head of a multinational corporation, who wants to become the richest man in the world.  Scolex kills Bradford's father and steals the technology (evil is a foot) - but John gives chase.  After an explosion, John is in critical care and Scolex is minus a hand.  Before you can say, \"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him...\" John is reborn as the ultimate crimefighting machine.  Assorted stuff happens, evil is vanquished, kiss the girl, THE END.  You've seen it all before. It's Robocop without the violence.  The Mask without the humour.The story is nothing sensational or groundbreaking, but still, it had the potential to be a fun ride.  Alas, the film has a bland, paint by numbers feel to it.  There are no twists or turns.  The plot knows where it's going - as do we all - we just have to sit as the movie drudges its way there with one sight gag after another.  It feels as if the makers of the film had a checklist of \"Things Kids Find Funny\" and simply tacked them together.Toupe falling off.  check. Man drinks coffee, unaware something nasty's in it.  check. Spit take. check. Wise-cracking, black sidekick. Hmmm, been done a lot.  Better make him a talking car. check. Injury to the groin motif.  check.The effects are well done - a practicly seemless blend of classic film fx and cgi, but their overusage tends to dull their impact.  I can't wait for the day when studios get over their love affair with cgi and begin to use it sparingly.One thing that really distracted me was the film's usage of sound. Everything makes a noise - loud and greatly exaggerated.  There's not a silent second in the whole movie.  What bothers me about this is the philosophy behind it.  The studio's opinion is that if there's silence, people will loose interest.  So, like trying to entertain a cat, they stand there dangling their string calling to us repeatedly, making funny noises, all in a vain attempt to maintain our interest.  I'm sorry, but if you want my interest, then make an interesting film.The movie's editing leads me to believe that the original product and what ended up on the screen are two completely different creatures.  Sadly, I have a feeling that what ended up on the cutting room floor is the heart and soul of this picture - victim of countless focus groups of Joe Average (the same Joe Average that makes up the audiences at the Jerry Springer Show, I imagine) and executives who think their degrees in economics make them experts in storytelling.I've read a few reviews of the film since seeing it, and I see time and time again the flaws of the film brought up and then excused because, \"It's a kid's film.\"  Look, our children are not stupid - stop treating them as if they were.  Sure, it'll get a few laughs from the tykes.  How could cat vomit in coffee not get a laugh from a five year old?  But will any of these kids remember this film a year from now?  A month from now?  I think we need to stop equating kids films with \"crud\".  A Fairy Tale, Babe, My Neighbour Totoro - these are kids films.  But this lifeless, humourless film called Inspector Gadget is only one thing - a wasted eight bucks.I give this film five out of five on the smelly piece of cheese scale.",

Though \"Gadget\" has been, for the most part, slammed by critics, I found it to be hilarious. The slapstick wasn't forced and the dialogue was witty.

            "content": "I can agree with Roger Ebert in saying that for adults the best part of this movie is that it's only about 80 minutes long.  It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it's so predictable that I felt like I had seen it before.  My major complaint was with Rupert Everett, who played Claw.  I guess he was supposed to be one of those super-intelligent villains, but his part was so poorly written that he came across as one of those guys that's so insecure that he has to use big words just to make himself feel better.  He never even seemed like a real threat.  Maybe it's because I was a kid, but in the cartoon, there was always that tiny doubt that the villain just might win this time.  There is not even a smidgen of that in this version.  I know this is a children's movie, but the villain can still be at least a little chilling!  Everett had not one single moment of evilness.Except for Claw, this movies was easy to sit through.  Again, I'll agree with Ebert and say that the Gadgetmobile is the best part of the movie, but in my opinion the car doesn't get enough scenes.  There are funny moments, and if you have to take your kids to a movie, there are a lot worse ones you could pick than this one.",

            "content": "Go Go Gadget...Two thumbs up!This film was funny, heart-felt, fast paced, cohesive and witty! The chemistry between the entire cast was perfect. I found myself chuckling through the entire movie b/c of all the little jokes and sarcastic comments that speckled the script.Matthew Broderick was flawless! He really brought the bumbling, yet loveable Inspector Gadget character back to life...and added his own unique twist to the part. He added a more humanized and comical aspect to the mechanized Gadget. He truly was Gadget.Rupert Everet's evil and convincing \"Claw\" villain added a sarcastic and evil wit to the movie, which helped keep the pace lively.The special effects and in this film blew me away entirely! They added a reality to this fantasy film, which I did not think was attainable! Mr. Broderick did a fantastic job in creating the evil Robo-Gadget character. Those teeth, his whiny cartoon voice (much like Don Adam's orginal Inspector Gadget character voice), and his evil bulging eyes created the perfect monster!One must keep in mind, though, that this IS a children's movie, based on a CARTOON...so it is no \"Schindler's List.\" It is just a fun, silly flick to make you laugh. And although the character and premise is taken from the cartoon, one should not base their judgement or expectations of this film on the cartoon.The two negatives of this movie, that I could find, was (1) the lack of development of the relationship between Penny and the good Inspector. (2) The annoying Gadget Mobile with the bad attitude.PS:I am that glad Mr. Don Adams contributed to this picture with his short, but amusing cameo. After all, he WAS the one that originally brought Inspector Gadget to life!",

This film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing.  I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind.  The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!",

However, when I found out it was a Disney movie and that it starred Matthew Broderick, I figured it's got to be pretty good.  Well, it wasn't. It was terrible.  Stupid humor, terrible development of plot and bad acting. Almost seemed as if the actors were simply putting in their time, but none of their effort.  Don't bother with this one.",

How Broderick could make this and the wonderfully subversive Election is beyond me.I will admit it is a children's movie and not a work of art, but at least the cartoon was entertaining. This remake, one of endless TV remakes, is just STUPID! The only bright moment is Cheri O'Teri's all too short performance as the mayor.",

Instead of the Penny/Gadget/Brain dynamic of the series, you have a confused and overloaded cast that seems to pander to every stereotype you can think of.  Why the emphasis on the car?  Why turn Penny from the true detective of the series to just an annoying kid?I feel sorry for Rupert Everett, too.  He doesn't look very comfortable with his role at the best of times.",
