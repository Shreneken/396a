            "content": "This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films. It is another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story.The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film. The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (the dad) and Laura Dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.)The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I wish there more of these kind of films made today.",

            "content": "I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day...That's not to denigrate this film at all.It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast \u0096 Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list \u0096 with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was...I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie.Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs.",

            "review_title": "A film that hits close to home....",
            "content": "\"October Sky\" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this.This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person. If it has done its job, you won't want it to end. And \"October Sky\" accomplishes just that.",

            "content": "I have yet to read \"The Rocket Boys\", the book upon which this film is based, but this situation will not continue! I did read a short story by Hickam which was apparently the seed that started him on the novel. It grabbed me even then.I am one of those fortunate enough to have lived adjacent to Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, where my father worked, and this childhood situation no doubt fostered my lifelong interests and hobbies. I also met Werner von Braun, and one of the other German rocket scientists repaired a rubber band driven model plane I had (I WISH I still had that plane!) I mention this because I went into the movie with serious expectations and very much desired to see a film with authentic treatments for the nostalgia and emotions of the period.I was not disappointed. While there were superficial flaws here and there, the movie came together like so few Hollywood films do. Good storytelling, authentic emotions and period atmosphere. As others have experienced at this excellent film, I was choked up at the end and had to wipe away the tears. The father of the family next to me asked to borrow my spare paper napkin to wipe his tears. About half the audience applauded at the end, and most everyone stayed through the credits. It's just one of those films.Not the greatest movie ever made, but one of the best family movies in a long time.",

            "content": "It was 1957 and Russia had just launched Sputnik. I was almost 12, and I remember my father pointing up into the October sky as we tried to catch a glimpse of the Earth's first artificial satellite orbiting overhead. Thus the title \"October Sky\". In West Virginia the son of a coal miner became intrigued with rockets and space travel and, in spite of his father's urgings that he accept his fate and become a coal miner too, eventually won the national science fair competition, and a college scholarship, ultimately became a key member of the space exploration team of NASA. A wonderful and inspiring story, and a superb film of that story.Everyone was good in the film, but Chris Cooper as the miner boss and stubborn father was far and away the best in \"October Sky.\"  Although \"rockets\" is the theme, the film is primarily of the struggle of children trying to break out of the cycle and become more than just another coal miner. As an epilog we learn that all four of the \"rocket boys\" went to college, the father died of mining-related disease, the teacher of Hodgkins disease, and the whole town and mining operation was sold and shut down in the next decade.",

            "review_title": "It was hard to choose your future in the 1950s for a worker's son.",
            "content": "A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

            "content": "I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres.  \"October Sky\" feels and looks oh so familiar.  And it is.  All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better.  But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. \nSputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation (\"What do you call it?  You call it a miracle.\"), Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale.  While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new.  Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher.  Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship.  Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film.  Perfectly played all around.  Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion.  Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking.  \"Myrtle Beach\" says it all. \nA major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money.  For once, I agree with them.  You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.",

As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end.What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times?",

            "content": "There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: \"The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right.\"  That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way.\"October Sky\" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exited about that future.One night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same.First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation.  Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses.The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition.The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance.  I put up with it without complaining in 1997's \"Inventing the Abbots,\" but I have had just about enough this.But that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999.",

The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted. The acting is superb all around (Chris Cooper has never turned in a bad acting role in my opinion!) The message of this film is so well delivered, so powerful, that it moved me to tears the first time I saw it. Not sad tears, which are easily solicited by cinema formula, but tears of joy--a rare thing.Although I did not grow up in the 1950's, I believe this film honestly portrays the mood and setting of the time.

            "review_title": "Surprisingly refreshing, a film with pure heart and no pretensions...",
            "content": "When I first saw the premise, I thought the movie would be similar to VARSITY BLUES (without the sports, of course)...somewhat cheesy and predictable. However as the story develops, one will notice that Joe Johnston actually had a well-thought out plan for this feature. The story is moving and compelling, and will affect you emotionally in ways movies like these rarely do.The reason? It's a simple movie, with a relatively familiar backdrop, but it's done very straightforwardly with no hint of pretension. At times there is some degree of predictability, but then the story takes rather unexpected turns. Just when you think you know exactly what will happen, the movie will prove your alleged clairvoyance wrong.The standout in this movie for me is the interaction between Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. This interaction provides one of the more complex and layered father/son relationships you will see in a movie of this nature. Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively.Moreover, much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance; from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture, this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s, adding to the overall viewing experience.I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a (much) better-than-average film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity, although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mind-numbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place in my Honourable Mentions list.",

            "content": "A high school boy's fascination with the Russian Sputnik missile fostered a life long love of rocketry and outer space travel. \"October Sky\" tells that story of Homer Hickam and his boyhood friends who achieved a level of notoriety in the small town of Coalwood, West Virginia in the late 1950's. The film is inspiring in it's message of believing in yourself and following one's dreams, even in the face of widespread ridicule and family opposition. Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friends Roy Lee (William Lee Scott), O'Dell (Chad Lindberg) and Quentin (Chris Owen) join forces to develop their own personal answer to the country's space program by repeatedly trying and failing to build a successful rocket, until their perseverance is finally rewarded with a successful launch that amazes even them.A palpable sense of family tension is present throughout however, as Homer's dad expects his son to follow in his footsteps as a home town coal miner. He treats Homer differently from older brother Jim (Scott Thomas), who's athletic ability stands to earn him a college football scholarship, one of the few ways out for a graduating teen growing up in a town with no prospects of it's own. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) doesn't come around to Homer's way of thinking until the very end of the story when the young man's accomplishments earn recognition for himself, his 'Rocket Boys' team, and his high school. And as often is the case, there's a stellar teacher on hand to support the pursuit of knowledge for it's own sake. For Homer, it's Miss Riley (Laura Linney), stricken at an early age with Hodgkins lymphoma, but undeniably a supporter who's belief in Homer puts her in direct conflict with the school principal and it's Board of Ed.I thought it quite interesting that a marquee at a local movie house in the picture was featuring \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\", a B grade sci-fi flick of the era. I think if you watch that film, you'll find it to be a whole lot better than it would have any right to be based on it's title. In a way, it's diametrically opposite to Homer's goal of reaching for the stars, as it's main character is faced with a dilemma of growing smaller and smaller on a daily basis. At first horrified by that prospect he eventually comes to terms with his plight and endeavors to adapt to a life that brings him new challenges on a daily basis. Any sense of closure for the viewer is left to one's own imagination, a rather daring concept for a film of any genre to propose back in the Fifties. Reading some of the other reviews for the film on this site, it's not surprising to see how many others got misty eyed over the relationship between Homer and his father. The father/son dynamic is one that affects me in similar ways in movies like this, as one looks back over one's life, it's comforting to reflect on those good times that overcame any difficulties. Coming from humble beginnings, I'm sure young men like Homer and his buddies never forgot their roots and where they came from, knowing that their experience might some day inspire others to reach for the stars themselves.One last thought - the title 'October Sky' is a perfect anagram of 'Rocket Boys' - how cool is that?",

This one, however, was nothing less then good.October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother.The story is well written. A bit too predictable maybe, but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clich\u00e9s, but that's OK. It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clich\u00e9s. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable.This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the film very good.The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast.All in all I'm glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feel-good movie. Not bad at all!",

The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center.The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik.This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail. In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's sub orbital flight, as well as Grissom's.This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more.",

The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves. I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the \"Science Gap\" the U.S.S.R. had on the U.S. in those Cold War days...This is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages.

My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us \"UberNerds\" of the late '50s and early 60's.We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country.

            "content": "OCTOBER SKY is a great, great movie. I would consider it to be one of the best dramas ever made. Perhaps even one of the best movies ever made in any genre. This is the true story of four boys in a coal mining town that, instead of growing up to become coal miners like their fathers, they want to do something more. They want to make something of themselves. Inspired by the launch of the first Sputnik, the four boys set out to create their own rocket and win the county science fair to win themselves scholarships. OCTOBER SKY wins on every level. Humor, drama, a little action, some romance (not very much). I really enjoy movies of this caliber. While it wasn't a very big hit in theaters, it was still one of the best movies that I have ever seen so far in my life. I saw this movie in science class, because we are learning about the creation of rockets ourselves, but I didn't really pay much attention to the building of the rocket, it was more the feel and sadness of the film. It is truely a great movie to watch with or without your family. It is good either way. After I am done writing this, I am going to watch it again. I just thought it best to write my review before I see it in friggen wide-screen format on my DVD. I seriously cannot see how people can enjoy watching movies on wide-screen. It takes away half of the screen! What the hell is up with that? And people say its better? Some people are just really stupid. But, here's hoping that the great feel of the movie will keep me happy and keep me from not moaning about it. If you like this movie, I also recommend THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, STAND BY ME, THE MAJESTIC, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE,and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. 5/5 for all of those including OCTOBER SKY.",

Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible. The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik. Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coal mines upon graduation from high school. But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible. There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth. For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit. It is a delightful little film. Grady Harp",

            "content": "My son, now a college science freshman, has been fascinated with space exploration for over a decade now and always dreamed of watching a blast off from Cape Kennedy. He now views NASA's space program a little more realistically and perhaps not quite as positively, but this film was a true inspiration to him and a great hit with our entire family.It tells the true story of a West Virginia coal miner's son, Homer Hickam, who dreams of rocketry after seeing the USSR's Sputnik lighting up the October sky...very dramatic scene here, truly conveying his awe and wonder at the spectacle. To the consternation of his mining dad (who disapproves) but encouragement of his science teacher, Miss Riley, Homer puts his dreams into practice as he, the school nerd, and a couple of pals experience a series of failures and successes (mainly failures) in their trial and error rocket building attempts. Will Homer succeed in time for the county science fair and win the much needed scholarship awarded as prize?I won't give the ending away, but this film is a tribute to dreaming big dreams, pursuing those dreams despite obstacles and opposition, and especially persevering. It should serve as both an inspiration to all young people, whatever form their dreams may take, as well as a tribute to man's ongoing curiosity about our galaxy and methods for space exploration.The characters are well drawn, especially the interactions between Homer and his father, who finds himself in conflict with the son he loves, having planned for him a traditional coal mining career. In light of the recent West Virginia mining disasters, the dangers inherent in that particular career choice have been sadly brought to the forefront of public attention in a way much less meaningful to me when I first viewed this movie.As for the love interest to which other reviewers have made reference, it must indeed be a sub-plot as I have absolutely no recollection of it now. Obviously not crucial to the main drama, though the whole movie had a real and rather refreshing nostalgic, old fashioned 50's feel to it. It made me wish I was raising my child back in that era.Wonderful heart warming and uplifting tale that will surely put a lump in your throat and encourage you in your own way to reach for the stars.",

The American experience was diverse and things were moving ahead at a faster clip. No place was more unique than West Virginia. It was a place built on the blood, guts, and that black magic energy source. In a town named Coalwood we find a boy mesmerized by the Soviet satellite Sputnik. As the future of coal, due to the town's mine starting to give out, was anything but certain Homer Hickman, our young rocketeer, decided his future wasn't coal. It was rockets. This young boy was a classic dreamer whose blue-collar father thought was wasting time with this silly rocket idea.October Sky delivers oodles of Americana in a time of great change in the evolution of our country from industrial to technology. No one could imagine that technology would trump old industrial might and for a youngster dreaming of rockets it was an uphill climb. In Coalwood especially because this town's glory was rooted in a past history of producing coal and nothing else. Coal was Coalwood so the name is natural. There is a struggle not only in the town to keep up finding new coal reserves, but with the changing times forcing change. In this climate the young dreamer Homer was snake bit with his dream of rocketry. He wouldn't give in to any of the roadblocks and his own dad's insolence. In fact he began the arduous task of changing minds of which his dad's was the most pivotal.This movie really nails a historic time. It is a great human interest story that happens to be Homer Hickman's true story. This story is compelling and the movie gets the period, the town, and the nation's quick push into science and space down pat. Jake Gylenhaal delivers a fine performance projecting a fine career ahead of the young actor here. The bottom line is Homer Hickman represents a nations new paradigm and against all odds he achieves his dream. See this film because it's equally going to pull your heartstrings, stir prideful nostalgia, and tell the story of nation all in the guise of young boy. Excellent! I also recommend you read Homer Hickman's book Rocket Boys AKA October Sky.",

            "content": "October Sky is one of the most average films in recent memory.  It moves from cliche to cliche without a care in the world because the film itself is a cliche: if you work hard enough, you will be rewarded.  You get all the elements that work against our unlikely hero, such as a tough father and skeptical friends, as well as some unexpected advantages, like a helpful teacher and a resident genius friend.  The movie stumbles through these situations and banks that the audience will buy it because it is based on a true story.  And it seems like it has worked because most viewers seem to like the film.There were some fine elements in the film. Chris Cooper is Hollywood's most underrated actor.  His performance as the father could have been very flat, but instead he allows him to be a three dimensional man.  The development of the relationship between the father and son is nice, if not a little Freudian.  The other performances are nice too, but nothing special.  Laura Dern, another underrated performer, is given a terrible, underwritten role, but she does the best she can.  Also, the film does end much better than it begins.  The first 75 minutes have a lot of silly setpieces, like \"let's play on the train tracks like in Stand By Me\" and \"let's find our lost rocket even if the relevance to the plot is no longer clear\".  The end of the film really comes together, though, by focusing on the father-son relationship and the futures of the boys once they get out of that dreadful town.One final note is in order.  I believe that the film was completely unfair to unions and intentionally tried to make them look evil.  Why is everyone associated with the union leadership portrayed like a wild, snarling animal? Could it be that the entire film is a quiet piece of right-wing propaganda? Does anybody really believe that if we just follow our dreams that everyone has an equal chance in America?  These are just a few final thoughts, and they ultimately do not impact on my overall appraisal of the film, which I give a 6.",

But formulas are in such common use because they are dependable. Who would argue with A squared plus B squared equals C squared? They get the job done.Jake Gyllenhaal is the obsessed kid. He looks ordinary and is fascinated by an arcane subject like rocket design in a way that only a teen ager can be. He lives in a small West Virginia town where everything revolves around the coal mine which, like the town itself, is moribund. He has his mother's love, of course, but his dad (Chris Cooper) grew up in the mines and is now a kind of manager, and Gyllenhaal's aspirations occasion some irritation in his father. Cooper wants him to come down in the mines like everybody else instead of fooling around with this nonsense and worshiping Werner von Braun. Cooper makes a particular point of never attending any of Gyllenhaal's experimental launches. Gyllenhaal's teacher (Laura Dern) recognizes that the kid is a wizard and supports him.At first the others in town treat him and his interest in rocketry as half loony. One by one, though, the kid draws others into his sphere. A pimply nerd and a handful of other alienated students join him in building rockets that at first explode if anyone looks cross-eyed at them. Eventually others, including a black machinist at the mine, help him build rockets that act, not like inverted pendulums, but like rockets. There are, naturally, some obstacles along the way. His father's constant belittling of him, for one thing. And then there's the matter of finding money for materials, which leads to one or two comic incidents. Then his father is injured in a mine accident for which the company won't pay, so Gyllenhaal must drop out of school and go down and work in the mines for a while, accompanied by plangent violins. But in the end, he is sent to the Science Fair in Indianapolis, where he displays his rockets and their components. The score swells into an orgasmic triumph. (It's the International Geophysical Year of 1958.) Does Gyllenhaal win first prize? No power on earth could force an answer from me. Gyllenhaal returns to Coal Community, WVA, where he sets off one last big celebratory rocket. The entire town of Coaldorf has attended, everyone bursting with pride. Gyllenhaal dedicates this rocket to everyone who has helped him in his travails, listing them one by one, before finally reaching \"my father\" -- and, lo, there is Dad edging his way to the front of the crowd! Final shot: the space shuttle being launched from Cape Canaveral. It's got every clich\u00e9 in the book but it's kind of sweet too. None of the performances stands out, although Chris Cooper does a good job with the role of the all-but-fossilized, but gentle, father. He's a pretty good actor.Of all the films about adolescents finding their own voice, this one is about average, but it's suitable for family viewing. The kids will understand it as well as the adults, and although their minds may not be exalted, neither will they be turned into suppurating boils. The location shooting is good, too, leading us to understand why Gyllenhaal would like to leave Coalton-sur-mont behind him.",

            "content": "October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a high school boy from a coal mining town in West Virginia. Unless you were able to get a football scholarship the chances of getting out of Coalwood were small. Homer does not fit the bill of a football player and refuses to become another miner. Instead he sets his sights on what's above the earth rather than below it. In the wake of the first Sputnik launch Homer decides to take up rocketry without the approval of his coal miner father John (Chris Cooper).This film is a small slice of life depicting the perseverance of Homer and his friends to make something of their lives. They receive little support from the majority of the town members who believe that there's not much else to life besides mining coal and playing football. October Sky takes the dreams of four high school boys and inspires those who believe that you can become something bigger than the life society deems for you.The screenplay is well written, the acting top notch, and the story is bigger than the setting. This small period piece is amazingly uplifting and can touch a wide audience. It is a family movie and is one that all can enjoy regardless of age.I first saw this film in theaters when I was eight. Over fifteen years later I still find this movie as inspirational as the first time I saw it. I keep it on my shelf under movies that will lift me up. It is simple but extraordinary at the same time. This little gem should be on everyones list to watch. I think it is a movie that will never be outdated and one that will stay with all those that have seen it.",

Having driven through Coalwood WV where they grew up, one quickly can see how the odds are favorable for working in the coal mines. Being raised in a similar situation where the principle income was coal and refractories while graduating from high school in the 98th percentile in the nation in science, I can identify with these boys challenges, desires, and purpose driven objectives. Many a child in similar situations simply take what is laid before them and turn from the challenge to break the mold and move out into a bigger and more broadened world. Homer struggles with this challenge and even finds family obstacles and academic hurdles to overcome should he and his friends decide to break on through to the other side.Will Homer and his friends make it? Should they try to make something better of their lives? The director, cast, and crew work hard at making you part of that decision process. Expect to find points where you want to scream \"do it\" but also expect to be saddened when the chips fall and the challenge grows to greater summits then the boys have courage. Will they succeed? Will they meet the challenge and rise above it? Or, will they join the rank and file and become just as their fathers and their fathers for generations? You have to see this one and have your children see it too. I give it a 10 for content, life impact, and personal growth . . and . . the directing, acting, and setting aren't bad either. Actually the latter set the pace for an exciting and enjoyable flick that will leave your heart filled with desire. DrD",

            "content": "I think that we can now say that Jake Gyllenhaal's troika of great roles are \"October Sky\", \"Donnie Darko\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\" (\"The Day After Tomorrow\" was also worth seeing). In the first one, he plays 1950s West Virginia teenager Homer Hickam. In their small town, the men work in the coal mine and it's assumed that all the boys will go into that line of work - or become jocks.Then, in October, 1957, the Soviet satellite Sputnik glides across the sky. Homer realizes that he wants to go into that line of work, so he and his friends start making test rockets. Needless to say, Homer's family is shocked at this, and the local jocks don't like it either. But Homer knows his desire, and he and his friends keep at it.If Jake Gyllenhaal was relatively unknown when this movie came out, then it surely cemented him as a talented presence on the silver screen. Equally great in the movie are Chris Cooper as Homer's coal miner father, who is nervous about his son doing this, and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, who encourages him. All in all, very well done.",

The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me.

            "content": "It is October 1957 and the USSR has launched Sputnik 1, the first satellite. In a small town in West Virginia a 17-year-old boy, Homer Hickam, is fascinated by this development and is determined to build and launch his own rocket. He enlists the help of three friends in his endeavour. However, coal mining is all that people know in those parts and they will face stiff opposition, most of all from Homer's own father, the manager of the local mine.Interesting story, based on Homer Hickam's book \"Rocket Boys\". Seems conventional but the plot has enough twists and turns to prevent it from being unoriginal and predictable. Very entertaining at times, as we see the boys' adventures, struggles, failures and successes in building and launching the rocket.There's also a great human element to the drama: Homer's relationship with his father, the teacher's interest in the project succeeding, the constant danger that awaits those that take the town's usual profession - coal mining. This adds a sentimental and emotional element to the movie that ultimately results in some great heart-warming moments.Jake Gyllenhaal, in his first starring role, is great as Homer Hickam. While this movie didn't truly launch his career, his next would: Donnie Darko. Good work by Chris Cooper as his father and Laura Dern as Miss Riley, his teacher. Solid supporting cast.",

            "content": "Whenever Hollywood makes a biopic, I am left wondering how much of this is true and how much is a screenwriter's fantasy. All too often, true stories are transformed into fiction in order to 'tell a good story'....though these are REAL people and they deserve a true accounting of their exploits. And, when I began watching \"October Sky\", although I enjoyed it, I also was saddened that once again the truth was, at times, completely expendable. The real story is differeent in too many ways for me to mention here--just suffice to say that instead of 4 brilliant budding rocket scientists, there were 6 and IMDB mentions several more ways in which this movie diverges from the truth.The story begins with Sputnik. Not surprisingly, the Soviets making it into space first caused an uproar here in the States....and this film is about how it inspired a group of West Virginia high school students to become junior rocket scientists. On their own, the group built some amazing rockets for teens though the film talks a LOT about how the main character's father and principal fought so hard to keep him from following this dream....and again, I really wonder if this was true or was 'artistic license' (a nice way of saying they lied).Despite my complaint about the voractity of everything in this movie, I DID still enjoy it quite a bit and found it quite inspirational...and much of it is because although there were changes to the story, the fundamental kernel of a story was great! By the time it's over, you'll likely be misty-eyed and excited...which are great testaments to the acting and direction in this movie.",

            "content": "October Sky is one of the best coming-of-age films out there to watch. It has the theme of kids should do want they want to do, not what their parents decide for them. My favorite part of the movie is how the relationship between father and son was depicted. In most movies like this, the father is often depicted as the tyrant. But, while he is strict here, he is not as bad as most of these fathers. The film is boasted by lovable, relatable characters, a very strong screenplay, and great direction.Joe Johnston's film is about how four guys including Homer Hickam in a coal-mining town decide to create a rocket against the will of everyone in town besides their encouraging teacher.The acting is very good. Young Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Homer and he is a very good actor, much better than other child actors. Chris Cooper was really good as his father and I didn't hate him as much as I thought I would. Laura Dern is pretty good as the teacher, but I believe she over-acted just a little.Overall, this is a fantastic film for all ages to see. I'm sure this film could hit notes with the older generation who grew up in the 1950's. The movie inspires everybody that they can be who they want to be, and they must not let anyone get in their way. I rate this film 10/10.",

With the success of Elton John's musical version of \"Billy Elliott,\" how long can it be before \"October Sky\" hits Broadway.Like Billy's tale, the story of Homer Hickam is based in fact. Captivated by the launching of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, Homer wants to launch his own rocket, and Werner von Braun becomes his hero. Teaming with three schoolmates and encouraged by his teacher, Homer learns all he can about rocketry to achieve his goal. Well written with conviction and heart, \"October Sky\" has a fine cast that seems to have realized the special nature of the project. A young Jake Gyllenhaal is fine as Homer, a role that obviously gave a boost to his career. Laura Dern is excellent as Miss Riley, the cheer-leading teacher. However, Chris Cooper is the standout as John Hickam, a man who has spent his life in the mines, risen to a leadership role, and does not comprehend that his son wants more than that. Cooper is a master of repressed feeling. For some unknown reason, Cooper was overlooked at awards time for this and his later roles in \"American Beauty\" and \"Breach,\" which makes his Oscar for \"Adaptation\" all the more deserving.Although filmed in Tennessee, Fred Murphy's cinematography captures the gray bleakness of a West Virginia mining town. The use of popular songs from the 1950's and early 1960's adds a nice period feeling, and Mark Isham's haunting original score aches with nostalgia. However, Gyllenhaal and Cooper are at the core of the film, and their scenes together capture a strained father-son relationship that evolves over the course of the film into one of mutual respect. Again, this parallels the dynamics of Billy and his father. Elton John, are you listening?",

            "content": "This is a great film, based on a true story and inspired by a best-selling, award winning book called \"Rocket Boys\". The book and the film tell the true-life saga about one high school student, who beats the odds and eventually gets a scholarship that sends him on his path to a career at NASA. It is the mid-1950s and America is facing its fears of the Soviets getting into space before them. Two worlds of thought begin to emerge when major changes happen in world history. This was a big one. Imagine living in the quiet 1950s. The baby-boomer generation was in full swing and people were happy. Technoloy and innovation was on a huge rise. The computer was a new thing and the most infiltrating thing in your house was a rickety old TV (roughly 55 million households had TVs in 1958). On the dark side, World War II opened the floodgates to missile and rocket technology. We just ended the Korean War, but began the Cold War. Imagine you living in your home with your simple life around you and one of the super powers (and not the one that represents your team), gets into orbit first. So, that pushed the paranoia of the day and naturally people worried about their Eden coming to an end.Homer Hickam JR., played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a simple kid growing up in a coal mining town in rural West Virginia. Homer, a senior in high school, has an older brother, who Homer has to deal with when it comes to impressing their father. It is always tough for a kid, trying to do well on his own, when he is over-shadowed by an older sibling, with a football scholarship already waiting for him. His father, played magnificently by Chris Cooper, is the leader of the coalmine and he sees his son, not the football-playing one, having a future in coal mining. Homer, however, has a different idea about his future. It is an amazing transformation. When we are first introduced to Homer he gives off an impression of naivet\u00e9. He seems like a kid who would be perfect for living a simple life and not one of brilliance or determination. But, as the film goes along we realize he isn't made for football. He wasn't put here for coal-mining. He is a kid with his own dreams and choices. His biggest cheerleader is his mother, Elsie (Natalie Canerday), who feverishly, but very quietly helps push her son along on his quest. She always supported Homer.The first few minutes of the film shows us the day that the Russian satellite Sputnik 1 was sent up into orbit and as it crosses over the West Virginia skies it sets a tone that travels through the rest of this great film. It tells us about how paranoid Americans were when the Russians got into space first. The idea of the Russians taking pictures of our bases and spying on us is explored and the veil of paranoia that always accompanies moments in history is felt heavily at the start of the film. The concept of a space race and beating the Russians all begins to take shape.Homer's determination to make his rockets reaches a point where he needs help from others. He enlists the help of two of his high school buddies, Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg). In a move to further his cause, he enlists the aid of a kid in school, who no one really talks to. It shows to us how much Homer's character already has evolved. Pushing aside juvenile prejudices, his own pride and reputation, Homer extends an olive branch to Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen), a nerdy math genius. Also in his canon is the major support they get from their science teacher, Frieda J. Riley (Laura Dern). As the film moves along, after setbacks, failed attempts and family interference the boys eventually reach one goal after another. The amazing journey that they take brings on more help as support from friends and family turns into even bigger support when the high school and the whole town begins to cheer for their success. Which brings us back to Homer and his father, John (Cooper).The Cold War/Sputnik aspect is only a small fragment of what this film is about. The space race, satellites, America's place in the world and Sputnik are all part of the backdrop to an even bigger part of life. The main core of the film is an excellent study in father and son relationships, and Homer and his father couldn't be more different, as much as they are the same. This is what I meant earlier when I said two worlds of thought emerged out of the launch of Sputnik. The mentality between Homer and his father are total contrasts to each other. It is a collision between old-world thinking (stay down in the coal mine deep in the ground in an industry that is dying), or new-world thinking (go to the stars in a rocket moving straight up). It is the small battles between the father and the son contrasted to the battle of the space race. It is the small battles between classmates and the Principle contrasted to surviving in a coalmine. It juxtaposes the more modern idea that there are a lot of things that kids understand more than their parents do. It is the, always, conflicting, struggle between old-world thinking and the ideas-of-the-future that bind this film together.8.8 (B+ Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "When the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, it was something the world viewed with great trepidation. If they had the ability to put something man-made into space, it didn't bode well for the future of the free world. The Cold War was still very much in effect, and most people thought of Sputnik as something to cast a shadow over their freedom.But Homer Hickam saw something different. He saw Sputnik not as an end in itself. But a beginning. A whole new chapter in human history was being written right before our very eyes. The people just couldn't see beyond their own fears.October Sky is one of those surprisingly charming films that even when you sense the film is tugging on the heartstrings, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Perhaps because I'm a sucker for films about the space race. Or maybe because October Sky comes from one of my favourite directors, Joe Johnston.Johnston is a filmmaker best known for rousing action/adventure films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer. In fact The Rocketeer could almost be construed as the same film but in a slightly lesser developed form. So OS comes as a nice change of pace. Its more leisurely than Johnston's norm but that's OK. The film has excitement alright. Just of a different sort.When Homer first spots Sputnik gliding through the night sky, it is a sight that will change his life forever. Up until that point, Homer's future was very clearly mapped out for him. Once he graduates from high school, he's supposed to work in the local coal mines. Like everybody else.The mine is the town's main source of income. So its very important they get as many workers down there as they can. And for Homer, the pressure is on him especially because his father happens to be the pit foreman.John Hickam (a flawless Chris Cooper) doesn't want his son wasting his time building rockets. Homer knows his future is tied up in engineering, but John thinks the needs of their town are more important.Homer refuses to accept a life in the mines, and convinces a few other boys at school to join together and build a rocket. But the Rocket Boys (as they come to be known) face stiff opposition from just about everybody. The school principal. Their peers. And especially John.October Sky, based on the manuscript by Homer Hickam Jr is one of the nicest films you'll catch on TV. Its slightly underrated, even if its no classic. But it has a really excellent cast. And it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping the clich\u00e9s inherently buried in the narrative.There does seem a slight predictability to the film. Things like the stern, traditionalist father. The idealistic young man who dreams of the future. Opposition from all sides. The helpful teacher who's more enlightened than the rest.But surprisingly, the film succeeds more often than the above paragraph would suggest. Johnston has chosen a fine cast to remedy any possible uncertainties. Although Jake Gyllenhaal didn't make public notice until Donnie Darko, he more than proves his worth as Homer. October Sky was Gyllenhaal's first starring role. And already he shows his budding talent. Gyllenhaal always projects a fierce determination hidden behind an amiable expression. In Donnie Darko it was particularly startling. Homer of course is a complete opposite, but Gyllenhaal channels it into his ambition to prove his worth, and make a life for himself outside of a coal mine.Joe Johnston is always notable for drawing out strong, gracious performances from children, and he seems equally at home directing teenagers as well. Any scene with the Rocket Boys is thankfully devoid of over-sentiment and slush. Sometimes it threatens to. But it never boils over.And in regards to the adult cast, they do their part as well. Laura Dern is always good value and so she is here as Miss Riley, the schoolteacher open to Homer's ambitions. Her terminal illness does seem to emerge too quickly though, given a curious lack of buildup by Johnston.But its Chris Cooper who steals the show as John. He does wonders with the role of a father set in his ways. He never seems a one-dimensional tyrant. There are subtleties in his acting if you look hard enough. He may disapprove of Homer's activities, but I think hidden in his words is a grudging respect for Homer. And Cooper shows all this with a prolonged silence or a casual glance.Don't forget, John never outright stands in the way of Homer. He could have done any number of times and refuses. I think John is concerned Homer may be setting himself up to be disappointed. And wants to spare him that. John may have had ambitions at a young age too, and circumstances robbed him of that dream. Perhaps he wants to save Homer the same fate. Its all very fascinating when you think about it. A quite faultless performance on Cooper's part.There is the inevitable happy ending. And a few inevitable bumps in the road to get there. But October Sky is a fine, unpatronising film well worth your time. Plenty of 50s tunes to enjoy. And a nice consideration for the plight of the working man, and achieving what may seem hopeless dreams.",

            "content": "My Science Teacher let me borrow a film for the past weekend and I picked October Sky. I of course looked at the reviews of IMDb to see if it was any good. After seeing the many positive reviews I decided to sit and watch it.The film is about Homer Hickam played by Jake Gyllenhaal and his 3 friends Quentin played by Chris Owens, Roy Lee played by William Lee Scott, and O'Dell played by Chad Lindenburg who witness the first artificial satellite named Sputnik go into orbit in October of 1957. This prompts Homer and his friends to build a series of rockets and try to launch them into orbit. However his father played by Chris Cooper wants him to work in the coal mine much to Homers dissatisfaction.This was really good. The film is not your normal '50's movie like Grease(1978) this one takes a more serious route. The things I like about it: I love the performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, The plot captures what the real Homer Hicam did and yes this is based on a true story. I love how the movie is not to serious and how it does have humor in it. The only thing with this movie that I have a problem with is the Language. Yes I know I watch a lot of films with strong language but this is rated PG. Just because a movie has a PG Rating doesn't mean you have to use a ton of language once in a while it's fine, but not in every scene. I still say it is a very fun movie to watch.Rated PG For Language, Brief Teen Sensuality And Alcohol Use, And For Some Thematic Elements.1hr 48min/108min.****/****",

The story follows a teen through his experiments in rocket building, and the hardships his working class town imposes on him while he tries to expand his mind to follow his calling to science and engineering.\nBeing a scientist who broke out of a working class town myself, I instantly related to this movie. But the movie is more than that - it's a message to all Americans: if you work hard at something you want, you can achieve it; furthermore, people will eventually respect you for being good at what you do. But, whatever you do, don't quit.A great movie to sit a pre-teen (or a teenager) down with, and an even better movie to watch as an adult for its amusing and heart-warming scenes, not to mention its endearing plotline.It may look pretty dull in the video store, but it is well worth it!Oh, and if you like the movie, check out the book (\"Rocket Boys\") too!",

But he perseveres, fuelled by an intense admiration for the science of his self-given project as well as the help from his friends to achieve something extraordinary.Bolstered by strong performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper as well as excellent work from composer Mark Isham, 'October Sky' is a moving and rewarding drama that lands its emotional ending.8/10",

Homer's father John (Chris Cooper) advances quite high in the company as a shift supervisor/foreman, and he loves his work. He's good at it. The film provides enough footage to educate us to a minimal level that working down here wasn't Hell, rather it's a job requiring hard bodies, tougher minds, and constant focus on what the flock one is doing. Slipups are easy, but teamwork and dedication bring success. (Kind of like a good football team.)Anyway, Homer's dad is a comparative VIP in this working-man world, and none too happy when Homer\u2014who is athletically challenged\u2014announces he's going to build a rocket. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009",

So, I journeyed down the sidewalk to the local theater, bought some popcorn, and prepared myself for a nice, \"boring\" matinee on an extremely cold day in Boston.My conclusion...I loved it. Admittingly, I'm a pushover for American dramas, and although this movie didn't involve the decorated war hero or the powerful statesman, it definately gives the viewer a warm feeling upon leaving the theater. Centered around Homer's struggle with his father and a determination to design a rocket, the film does justice in proving that the American Dream still exists. Furthermore, solid performances from a young cast and an emotional, thought provoking musical score added to its appeal.I am looking forward to more films like \"October\" in the future.",

The mining town is grittily realistic.Jake Gyllehaal gives a fine performance as the leader of the quartet of youthful scientists. Chris Cooper portrays his father, foreman of the coal mine. Their scenes together are moving and emotionally satisfying. Although the outcome is predictable, the finale has that lump-in-the-throat upbeat climax.This is a fine film for teenagers and young people. It's a shame they would probably rather see something like \"The Waterboy\". It shows a lovely film can be made for only 23 million dollars.",

Young Homer, the same as young Billy, grows up in a coal-mining area, his father works in the colliery, but the youngster is dead set on not having to dig out his living a kilometre or so underground. Billy wanted to be a ballet dancer; Homer was inspired on building rockets after seeing the first Sputnik fly across Virginia skies. Nicely filmed, with Isham again doing the musical honours satisfactorily, the setting of the film in the late fifties of the last century is magnificent with exactly right automobiles and clothing and the interiors of houses, as well as, I must add, correct concept of people's mentalities of the times.This is a film to admire and enjoy, even though you may frequently find yourself thinking you wrote the script, as the chain of events is rather foreseeable, and thus do not expect surprises. However, it is enjoyable watching films with a story to tell without a load of violence and sordid sex as excuses for putting anything and everything on celluloid. One does get tired of such trash, though it would seem that Hollywood does not.\nOctober Sky is refreshing and sober, though faulting in rather tweeish principles, the same as Billy Elliot at times; but in both cases the result is an entertaining and clean couple of hours.",

Even when it was in the theatres, the commercials and ads did not jump out and grab your attention like the other movies did. For this reason, I was not compelled to watch it right away until recently.October Sky is a true story about a small town boy's dreams and his father's hopes. Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young man in a small mining town that faces the very real possibility that he will grow up and become a miner just like every other young man in town. After the launch of the Soviet satellite, Sputnik, and witnessing it pass overhead one night, Homer becomes inspired to build his own toy rocket and have it successfully launch. Together with his friends and a local school nerd that he befriends, the group set out to build this rocket despite the ridicule from the rest of the students and town people. His biggest opponent of this little project is his father, which has aspirations of Homer becoming a miner. To his father's dismay, Homer decides that mining is not his future and with the encouragement of his school teacher, Miss Freida Riley (Laura Dern), he sets out to learn everything he knows about rockets to enter a science fair.Although the storyline sounds rather simple, Homer's personal plight is quite complicated. Throughout the movie you see the growing rift between himself and his father (and occasionally his friends) and there is a point in the story that he must make the very difficult decision of continuing this project or trying to please his father. The appealing thing about this movie is that this is a story that many people can relate to and understand.The acting in this movie was very well done, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal (Homer Hickam). The rest of the actors add a real genuine feel to it and throughout the film you get a real sense of the surpressive atmosphere of the father. This is also one of the few movies I've seen where there were very few slow spots. It is by no means an action filled movie but the story is told in such a way that you do not get a sense that there is information being given to you that you don't need. Laura Dern plays the role of Miss Riley fairly well although her involvement in the movie is relatively minor despite the way she's portrayed in the advertising (ie. her picture on the poster).The one thing that I do have to point out is that, throught this story, you get the sense that Miss Riley has a very large role in Homer's life yet the director never quite develops this relationship. In the end I felt the story was lacking a little in this aspect and you are left making assumptions to fill in the gaps that you sense.Overall, this is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. It doesn't have the spectacular special effects or the complicated action sequences but the story is very well told. This is especially the case when you consider the fact that this was a true story. The director wraps up the end movie very well by showing you photos of the real people that the actors portrayed and detailing what each of them went on to do in their lives. This is definitely a movie you should see.",

It stirs and then settles deep within and promises life anew and hope for the future. One can say that it is, after all, just a movie. But I believe that it is more than that.

That's not to say it's boring -- far from it. But this is a movie about life, specifically the true-life late 1950's story of a high-school boy named Homer who, inspired by world events and his teacher, found that his dreams were bigger than the tiny West Virginia town he grew up in. Those dreams were sparked by something that appeared in the October sky of 1957.Interestingly, rearrange the letters of the movie and you get the original title of the book the movie is based upon:\"October Sky\" <===> \"Rocket Boys\"This is not a video to rent. This is a video to OWN, especially if you have kids. You'll watch it several times, forget about it for a year, pull it out again, and then enjoy it just as much when you dust it off. If you're going to be watching it with younger kids, be advised that the film does contain some of what we in our family call \"rude language\" (nothing your kids aren't going to hear sooner or later anyway, or have already heard if they go to public school -- but a bit of parental discretion with younger kids advised)",

            "content": "Hmm. . .well that was refreshing. I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's \"October Sky\" I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\" also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that \"October Sky\" is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from \u2013 I know I did.",

            "content": "This movie really does soar.  I was one of the few people lucky enough to catch this jewel in the theaters.  It is pure joy to watch Jake Gyllenhaal (CITY SLICKERS), Chris Owen (AMERICAN PIE, SHE'S ALL THAT), Chad Lindberg (CITY OF ANGELS, MERCURY RISING), and William Lee Scott (THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, GATTACA) overcome the dragging small-town thinking to succeed in reaching for the stars.  These young actors more than hold their own against Laura Dern (CITIZEN RUTH, RAMBLING ROSE) and the always superb character actor, Chris Cooper (AMERICAN BEAUTY, LONE STAR) who plays Jake Gyllenhaal's dad.  Director Joe Johnston (ROCKETEER) has managed to take the autobiography of Homer Hickam, Jr. (aka ROCKET BOYS) and made it into a living, breathing organism of a film.  For younger people like myself, the concept of the Hoovertown/mining town (and its oppressiveness) portrayed in the film has always remained somewhat dead on the pages of history books. Mr. Johnston, through his cast, crew, and through Mr. Hickam's words, has breathed a life in to it.  This film belongs in the canon alongside such other modern classics (in the overcoming-adversity-and-generally-uplifting genre) as John G. Avildsen's ROCKY.  Rent it, read it, buy it (the DVD is gorgeous), but above all savor it with all in your family.",

            "review_title": "Dreams And Reality",
            "content": "I wasn't around for the 1950's, at the height of the Cold War, but I've read enough to know the sense of fear and even paranoia that those days inspired in people. Perhaps the height of the Cold War came in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik - the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth. \"October Sky\" opens with the launch of Sputnik, and that opening captures very well the sense of fear that overtook one town - Coalwood, West Virginia as news of the launch spread. But it wasn't all fear. To some it was inspiration. Coalwood was exactly what the name sounds like - a coal mining town, whose people were basically expected to live and die in the coal mines, with few opportunities to get out. But watching Sputnik soar through the sky overhead inspired high school student Homer Hickham (a wonderful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal) to want something more. He along with several friends become rocket enthusiasts, dreaming of escaping the dreary little town and of doing greater things, with the support of a sympathetic high school science teacher (played by Laura Dern).I wouldn't call this a riveting movie. It is - once again - the classic formula of the underdog striving to overcome. Coalwood isn't expected to produce rocket scientists. Aside from the odd football player, it produces coal miners, and Homer has to overcome the doubts of many in the town, and especially his own father (Chris Cooper), who is the boss of the local mine, whose life is dedicated to mining, and who naturally assumes that his son Homer (who, unlike his brother, has no football talent) will simply follow in his footsteps. The inspirational story aside, it's probably the uncomfortable relationship of father and son that's the centrepiece of \"October Sky.\" The relationship of father to the two sons who are so opposite in so many ways reminded me of an almost identical scene in \"Stand By Me\" as Homer strives for his father's attention, while his father is only concerned with talking about his brother's football games. That all takes place within the backdrop of a dying town completely dependent on one industry, whose people are scared - because they see the end coming and they see no future once the end comes. So, inspiring though it may be, there's also a sadness to this movie - a sadness at a way of life that's dying, a sadness for the people who have spent their lives and sometimes given their lives (or at least their health) for the sake of that way of life.It's impressive to see the dedication that Homer and his friends showed in the face of doubts and opposition from those around them, as their rocket science experiments finally take them to the National Science Fair, and gives them the opportunity to break free of what had seemed to be their destiny. And yet, while one understands that the story is the inspirational story of these boys striving for something bigger, one also gains respect for those in Coalwood. They're hard-working men, who give of themselves and who risk a lot for the sake of their families. Sometimes the dreary life overcomes them, with sad results, but there's still a measure of respect for them. So I thought this represented a good look at both sides of the question - those who dream of bigger things, and those who may have lost that dream, but who still do the best they can with what they have.In the end, it becomes a bit of a tear-jerker in a number of ways. It may not be a riveting movie, but it represents a good slice of life movie, and it seems to depict the thinking of the era and that particular environment quite well. (6/10)",

I was eight years old when Sputnik was launched, so the movie had that added appeal for me. Also, I co-founded a rocket club when I was about 15 years old, so, again, the movie had added relevancy to my life. But I don't think these elements are necessary for anyone who believes in following their dreams. The acting is very good (anything I've ever seen with Laura Dern in it has appealed). Kudos to the musical soundtrack which hit all the right notes for me. And if the idea of soaring to the heavens captures your imagination, you will likely find this movie time very well spent.",

He certainly carries the movie as best anyone could, and proves his talent - I'm glad it was able to serve that purpose for him, because he's given us many great films at this point in 2020. However, I can't say the same about October Sky.I'm sure this true story was very sentimental to the people involved, but WOW does it make a dull film. It's really by-the-numbers all the way through - it all feels so formulaic and bland. Even Laura Dern doesn't get the opportunity to bring much to her character - really it could have been any actress - it feels more like a money job for her, which I would never hold against anyone for taking. Chris Cooper is almost entirely unlikeable as always - that's his specialty, but even with his usual menace, his character was far more uninteresting than his others. It's a tastefully done film, it's just really quite boring all the the way through - and the tone remains...consistent.This feels like a movie you would watch in class in junior high...only it would be one of the less good ones. Mississippi Burning is more my vibe guess. Would not recommend this to anyone really. Sorry y'all!",

There is a distinct sadness to it despite its uplifting mood of telling the story of Homer Hickam's success in following his dream and getting out of the miserable situation in a 1950's West Virginia coal town.The sadness is ever present: in the hopelessness and eventual end of the coal towns and the toll they took on a generation of workers; Frieda Riley's Hodgkin's disease; the struggle to overcome an unfortunate hand dealt by economics, society, and location; the lack of understanding between the generations all combine into a truly unforgettable movie.And yet, overall it is these very examples of the sadness that raises this movie into one of the most inspiring and uplifting films of the past quarter century.This was the very first movie I ever purchased on DVD back in 1999 and it has remained one of my absolute favorites for 21 years.And I 'm certain that the next time I'm channel surfing and happen upon October Sky, I'll definitely stop and watch it even if it is the 50th or 60th time I've seen it.",

            "content": "October Sky (1999): Dir: Joe Johnston / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott: True story about the freedom to dream and avoid tradition. Jake Gyllenhaal dreams of going to space and builds miniature rockets. After he and his friends wreck his mother's white picket fence, he turns to the unpopular book worm for help. The rest consists of rocket launching tests to enter the science fair. Filled with stereotypes including the unpopular class nerd, the supportive ill health teacher, the hard nose principal, the popular girl, and Chris Cooper with the dreary role of discouraging father. Director Joe Johnston establishes the 1957 setting with fantastic rocket launching footage but unfortunately he launches a screenplay full of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. This is a different type of film for a director known for Jumanji and The Rocketeer. Gyllenhaal basically goes with the flow playing the boy who must prove himself and gain his father's approval. Cooper's role is equally xeroxed as his father. Watching a sitcom father and son is far more interesting than anything these two do in this film. Laura Dern plays the teacher who is ill yet encouraging. Chris Owen completes the stereotypes as the nerd. The film is well made on a technical level but fails on the story front. Theme regards dreams within a screenplay that doesn't fly so high. Score: 5 / 10",

The movie uses a variety of common button-pushing/sentimental tricks like: good music (both powerful and sad), family stuff, underdog themes, dirty faces, dying young etc.  Although these scenes are very easy to spot, its tough to resist they're charm.  In particular is the finale which is button-pushing at its most, yet the facial expressions of the characters, especially Chris Cooper (fine performance) got me.  My button was pushed!!

It had so many stereotypes that are not there in life. For example the very concerned and dedicated high school teacher.The Dad, who I thought, Chris Cooper. did a fine job as,Homer's father.

Of Course it wouldn't be formula family entertainment , if Homer and Dad didn't come to a great but, unrealistic and unlikely peace in the end.Was this film a real slice of the life or real people, NO! It was touchy feel-good with those boys raising their launch pad flag, just like the Marines. Could any eye in the house stay dry? There were some stolen pieces from other flicks, the railroad scene from Stand By Me, for example.The over all message, this flick should be credited for is, hold on to your dreams, and attempt to see the good side of your difficult parents.I noted in the passing closing credits all the real supposed little people, who were doomed to mine coal, somehow went to college and became successful beyond the average.I would recommend this movie not for insight into real people, rather to inspire those with dreams, to hold tight and perhaps they will, with work and luck come true someday.",

            "content": "\"October Sky\" is alot of different types of movies rolled all together. It's a coal-mining movie.  It's a \"follow your dreams\" movie.  It's a period piece.  However, at the heart of the film is the most accurate and poignant portrayal of the father/son dynamic that I have ever seen in a film.Homer Hickham is a son who has been told since the day he was born that he was going to grow up to work in the coal mines.  That is what everyone before him has done and all of his contemporaries have resigned themselves to the fact that that is what they will do.  However, Homer wants to build rockets and he seesa first prize at the national science fair as a ticket out of Coalwood and straight to college.  Homer's father has worked in the mines his whole life and sees nothing practical or worthwhile in Homer's fascination with rockets, but, more importantly, he sees Homer's desire to leave as a huge insult.  He thinks that Homer wants to get away from the town so that he doesn't have to follow in his father's footsteps.The interaction between father and son is at once frustrating, hurtful, loving, insightful and bittersweet.  There are always kind words that can't be spoken and harsh words that can't help but be shouted.  This realism is at the core of this incredibly moving screenplay, which is only made palpable by the equally moving performances.If you are looking for a great drama that is family appropriate, smartly written and inspiring, I highly recommend this little-known gem!",

            "content": "-----ONE OR TWO SPOILERS AHEAD------Looking around the comments index and this film gets deserved praise. Inspirational is the best word to describe its main theme: small town boy and friends rise up against their pre-ordained careers as coal miners to pursue rocket science. Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as the seemingly not so bright daydreamer who one day looks up in awe at the vision of the Russian satellite 'Sputnik' (the first space 'vehicle' to be launched into orbit by man) and decides to reach for the stars. The townspeople are also fascinated and yet scared of this new thing streaking across the sky which some believe to be of imminent danger to them. But as they look up, a wonderful comment comes out from the crowd which to me sums up the hard pressed, struggling yet somehow joyous spirit of this community. A man says 'I hope they don't drop a bomb on this place.....it'd be a terrible waste of a bomb!' There must have been thousands of small yet spiritied communities like this in the US during the 50s. And it's from this essential ruggedness, and perhaps innocence, I suppose young men like Homer Hickam were launched into the world. Hickam's father's initial relutance to support his son's 'crazyness' is understandable considering the great sacrifices and suffering he and his colleagues down the mines have given in order to give their children a decent living. Gradually though, the barriers are worn down and perhaps the gifts of Homer inspire something different in his father as we are drawn to the inevitable conclusion.One thing that puzzled me throughout though was the attitude and respect given to a certain Wernher von Braun. Fair enough, the man was a rocketing genius but his full scale participation in and innovative designs for the V1 and V2 rockets of Nazi Germany led to the deaths of thousands of innocents (both rocket victims and the actual slave labourers). Perhaps one of the morals of the film is that greatness in human advance and technology can ultimately be born from the more malignant and terrifying aspects in our nature. Thus Hickam embarks on a career as a rocket scientist and his inspiration is a former Nazi rocket scientist! The other aspect to the film was moving too. The irony of a Soviet satellite inspiring a 17 year old American to go out and design rockets to launch into space. There's a profound lesson here for cooperation amongst different peoples and nations. Great film!",

If you can see Forrest gump with the same eye it's without sense but that movie also depicts the victory of human spirit over all overwhelming odds to have faith when everyone looses it.

Although my years near there occurred later than Homer Hickam's, I can see so many things in common with his experience in Coalwood and my own growing up.When an earlier comment about his movie said that it was just another movie about adversity and overcoming odds, I don't think they quite understand the point. Homer Hickam grew up in a place that was far away from anything -- even the math book he needed for building the rockets had to be ordered because although it wasn't stated, I assume that at that time there was no library around that carried such a book. Just think about that for a moment. It's very difficult for young people in that area to see anything more in their lives than what they see outside their windows. I'm sure the same could be said for some urban kids who live in depressed areas. But, I would be less impressed with this story if Homer Hickam grew up in suburban New Jersey or urban Chicago, for example, where so much of the world is just a few minutes away and finding people to help you is so easy. Remember, Homer had to walk 8 miles just to leave coal company property, and the men at the coal company who supported him did so even though they risked losing their jobs (and there were no other jobs to be had).Luckily, Homer had a teacher who recognized a student with a dream and potential. Homer was a student in the middle of the pack (academically and socially) who dared to defy the odds. Even Quentin, the brain, needed Homer. In fact, one of the things that clearly separates this movie from so many other stories of achievement is that it was done academically.While sports achievements are great, why do so many movie makers shy away from other achievements? Many people in Coalwood didn't care too much for academic achievements, but tackle somebody on the football field and you are off to college. Too many people glamorize sports, and as time marches on we have more and more examples of exactly how unglamorous (and felonious) some sports figures are. It's impossible to compare a touchdown with a rocket going to the moon (at least aimed at it). Homer didn't make a touchdown, but if he had it would just mean a trip to Disneyworld. Instead, Homer built rockets and there is no end to where he can go except in his dreams. Truly, an inspirational movie!",

Having just finally read it, I had to re-watch the film, which I'd seen over ten years ago. For those who don't like the movie, read the book, and watch the Bonus extras on the disk. You'll find they did an excellent job of extracting and displaying on screen perhaps 25% of this non-fiction story's elements. What you get is a sweet (not necessarily saccharin, rather \"sweet\" as in well-crafted), feel-good family fare flick, but not the gritty and far more real complete story, which included more characters and conflicts, and especially the interaction between the boy and his mother, and how she balanced out the tough-love family equation.In real life Homer's mother did a lot more than cook, wash, and gripe a bit about the company coal mine as June Lockhart from \"Lassie\" might have done. She could be, and was, scathingly, bitterly, ironically funny in the face of the daily potential for disaster, of the mine killing her husband and setting the family adrift. If the father was a force to be reckoned with, wait'll you meet Homer's actual mother, not the Mrs. Cleaver version they depicted in \"October Sky\" the movie. This is one jumping off place requiring a mini-series, and where the incomparable Laura Dern could have really done some serious work, had they cast her in that role playing opposite Chris Cooper but, this is an inspirational family flick, not reality.In the book, Elsie's got a husband devoted more to managing a deadly company town operation than his own family, an occupation thousands of feet underground, on call 24x7; an eldest son devoting himself to a potentially crippling sport which might or might not get him out of Coalwood WV and the inevitable life underground; and a youngest son who decides he wants to experiment in the basement with potentially deadly projectiles fueled by violently volatile chemical mixtures, testing them in the furnace of the coal-fired hot water heater and drying them out for days underneath it. Her sardonic, ironic response to him when he announces he wants to do this (and a few times thereafter): \"Don't blow yourself up.\" As she continually paints an idyllic beach scene on a canvas hanging on the kitchen wall...for several years.Homer could've blown the house up. Brother Jim could've been permanently disabled. Her husband faced death daily (either from black lung or a mine disaster) in which case the company would've given her two weeks to move the family out of Coalwood, who knows where.They didn't hit that one hard enough in this Disney-like film. I give it an 8 for taking a far more serious work and pulling together enough elements to create a good family flick. A movie the whole family can watch together...just not Homer's real family, who were if anything, more dysfunctional than most. Fabulous job of autobiographical writing, great job of movie-making based on it. The one is not entirely the other. That's okay, the movie stands on its own.",

I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957.  It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \"Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,\" questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, \"They're also the only ones who get the girls.\" Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. \"I want to go into space,\" says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, \"What do you want to know about rockets?\" Homer quickly anwers, \"Everything.\" His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement. His father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) believes that Homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. The coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film. Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. \"You can't just dream your way out of Coalwood,\" she tells Homer. Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. Despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. \"What are the chances of us winning that science fair,\" O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments. \"A million to one,\" answers Homer. \"That good?\" O'Dell replies, \"Well, why didn't you say so?\" The music, composed by Mark Isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood. Rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners. The film, photographed by Fred Murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. The town of Coalwood, actually filmed in Tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. It's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company. The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red. The red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of Coalwood to symbolize \"getting out\", but it is still subtle. The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of. Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. Homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. With the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations. Again, I'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? \"October Sky\" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.",

The film is very light, there are no big performances, scenes or acting; everything is just so average and uninteresting that I lost my attention a lot of times.

I strongly recommend it, especially because it really does feel like it comes from a lot of undeniable passion, a lot of true inspiration and a true interest in the subject, in a way that doesn't ring false or comes across as contrived or trying to garner emotion or sympathy that isn't warranted at all.

I read the book this is based on, and like this movie, it's best when it focuses on the science part.  It's careful and probing, and it doesn't overwhelm you with jargon talk.  And you get to see the many mistakes before the eventual triumph.  But the rest of the movie falls a little short.  The sentiment was there in the book too, but it wasn't as blunt as it is here.  There are too many cliches, and a few changes(like having the teacher being able to see the final rocket launch from her hospital bed; in reality, if memory serves, she had already died).

            "content": "Based on the memoirs of real life NASA engineer Homer Hickam, October Sky (an anagram for the novel 'Rocket Boys') was indeed a great family film. October Sky also stands for the date, Oct. 4, 1957 where Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 spark the Space race, and Homer Hickam's dreams of building rockets. The reason why October Sky was chosen by the studio over Rocket Boys is because they thought it wouldn't sell with women. Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience and thus it did work. Indeed, the title, October Sky has a little more feel to it, than Rocket Boys anyways. In the film, Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a coal miner's son sees this as an inspired to take up rocketry against his father's wishes played by the great actor Chris Cooper as John Hickam. Only Chris Cooper can load that much dignity in silence and fire off like rocket with his body language. Amazing. Just the way, that Jake and Chris's characters butt heads in this movie is intense. Both have fears and reasons to do what they do. Homer's father wasn't cruel, he was old fashioned. Homer was trying to break the mold, John had been in coal mining for his life and he came from a generation grounded. Homer wanted to fly and get out and John couldn't see it. Both characters love each other, father and son wise, but with careers, it was father VS son indeed. This movie is a capable-enough movie on its own right, and it's really serve as a great father's day movie as well. The movie teaches parents to be more open to their children's own plans for their lives, while also the world that is ever so changing. The scene where Homer tells his father who his hero is, is very emotion. Great scene, indeed. The supporting cast was great as well. Homer gets help building with his friends, Quetin (Chris Owen), Roy (William Lee Scott) and O-Dell (Chad Lindberg). It's weird in the book, Homer was more the nerd, and Quetin is the all-around kid and in the film, they change parts and looks. All likable charming American character with some background sub-plot story arches for themselves as well like Roy Lee's abusive foster father. Lot of laughs and smiles to go with their small scenes of their wacky high-jinx. Laura Dern is pretty good as the Miss Riley, the teacher that get them on the right track by helping with their math and science. However, the film does have some drawbacks. I don't think the film capture the joy and triumph of Hickham's original memoir; as it changes things up to make them more dramatic in the film such as Homer going into the mine to work, Homer meeting Wernher Von Braun and the issues with Miss Riley's health. In real life, she actually lived several years after the movie ended. It tend to jazz up the real life events way too much. There was also the fact that the boys were 8 to 14 at the time not 17. Parents would be complaining that the film is showing young children playing with rockets if they show 8 year olds. Also, Homer was more well-known by his nickname 'Sonny' in his hometown, but I think the movie change it for the better. The movie also has this predictable flat formulaic flow to it that you knew was going to happen. Still, you have to have a hard heart, if you're not moved by the film ending. You knew deep inside from the beginning that this will be a good feel movie with uplifting themes. There is great symbolism of how grounded, the community was in the beginning and how rockets change this area for the better. The movie was such a big hit, that an October Sky festival was host in the town, every year since then. One thing I love about October Sky is a warm, evocative soundtrack. Mark Isham did a great job with the main themes. The violin at the beginning gives me goosebumps every time. Also great use of 1950's to early 1960's songs as well to set the mood and settling. These songs just gives me chills and makes me happy and reminds me that from the humblest of beginnings come the greatest of men. Overall: Joe Johnston's film would inspired others to look into their dreams, while also entertain them with the rich intelligence subject matter mixed with the coming of age story drama. October Sky will continue to help launch new dreams for children and adults wishing to become future rocket scientists for themselves. It's a good watch, and worth checking out.",

In addition to having great common themes, i.e., don't give up, don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and don't be a victim of your circumstances, October Sky is an excellent example of what many fathers and sons go through together.I sat down with my son to watch this movie. He loved the pursuit of the dream, the adventure of the boys and at the end, when Homer's father comes to watch the final rocket launch and put his arms around his boy, my son turned and looked at me and understood exactly why I wanted to watch this movie with him. Not many movies can entertain and teach at the same time without being heavy handed. The Director's handling of the father/son relationship was right on.I also love Natalie Cannerday as the mom. I wish she had more opportunity to be put on screen because she has the best accent in Hollywood. I could listen to her twang all day.",

The acting is well executed, the story is excellent, the cast is great, the directing perfect...just an all-around superb movie!What makes this film so great is that it is based on the real life events of Homer Hickam and \"The Rocket Boys\".  The film is very inspirational and teaches you that if you truly want to fulfill your dreams, GO FOR IT!  Don't just sit around, MAKE IT HAPPEN!The cast is absolutely perfect in this film.  I loved every actor and actress in this film and thought all of them did an excellent job with their roles.  Jake Gyllenhaal is superb as Homer Hickam, I think he's really an \"up-and-coming\" young actor.  Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg, and everyone else really deserve some notice this film.  Job well done!  And let's not forget the directing of Joe Johnston! Joe doesn't seem to make bad movies (although I did have some problems with \"Jumanji\", but not much), can't wait to see his next work!I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that is interested in a drama about some young men trying to fulfill their dreams.  This really is a great movie, and I hope you will enjoy it too.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",

            "content": "I loved this movie completely. Jake Gyllenhaal, before his breakthrough role in Donnie Darko, stars as Homer Hickam, a teenager who in October 1957 decides to build a rocket. This is based on a true story, written by Homer Hickam, of how four friends start to build a rocket in the small city Coalwood, West Virginia, and how they inspire the people of that town by doing the impossible. Except from the story of the building of rockets and how people are both happy and unhappy of it, it is the story of a father and son relation, how a teenager really fights for his dreams, no matter what his father thinks or wants. A beautifully storytelling movie with all glorious moments... that it is a true story makes it more believable, but at the same time also unbelievable.Highly recommended, not only for the fine story but also for fine characters, great actors and a great photography. Forget visual effects - this is a great drama movie with a great story.",

They suffered setbacks, took many detours, and endured the scorn of their peers. In the end, they prevailed. The hero's quest is often a lonely one, but can end in success. The film portrays both the adversity and the triumph well.In reading some other reviews, I was saddened to see that people have become so cynical that they cannot imagine that the events happened as they were depicted, that the story was embellished with corny Hollywood cliches.

All the students either end up in the mine or if they're lucky, will get a football scholarship.  Homer is not stupid and knows the mine has no future even though his coal mining dad believes in it strongly.He suddenly sees an opportunity as the Sputnik satellite launch inspires him to build a rocket.  After some total bad starts he makes friends with an ostracized brain named Quentin in school in hopes of gaining success. As his experiments start gaining notoriety his teacher tells him that there is a local science fair and that he should enter.  If he wins he goes to the State Science fair and winners there get schoolarships.  Homer now sees what he wants to be in life and the science fair offers that: the chance to go to college and become an astronaut.  This a great film as Homer battles against all odds that seem destined to overwhelm him, his father's disaproval, the fact he lives in a nowhere small town where no-one does anything outside the mine, a principal who feels the communities students only future is shoveling coal, and no resources to gain knowledge.Great based on true story.  One overplayed scene prevents perfect rating but you love it anyway (the rocket being seen through the hospital window.)Rating 9 out of 10",

A boy has an interest in an activity not typically associated with his class.  He shows promise and is encouraged by an elder but his family doesn't understand nor support him.  A family tragedy occurs that threatens his future success but in the end he triumphs.  The story is familiar and success is in the telling.  How well do the film makers characterize the participates?  Do they seem real?  Do you develop empathy for them?  In this movie they were successful.  Other movies that follow the same formula aren't as successful. Billy Elliot, in my opinion, though of similar plot structure, (substitute ballet for rocketry), was a failure.

This true, refreshing coming-of-age drama is not only fantastic for its outstanding storyline and screenplay, but also for fine performances of Gyllenhaal,Chris Cooper as Homer's father and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, his favorite Ms. Riley.The story is mostly set in a time in the late 60s. And, through the course of the film, life of the common people in the downtown area is well featured. Good to see that the film contains very little amount of complex scientific details. Instead, the film mostly focused on Homer's life and his determination to fight back. It also succeeded to feature separate points of view of other supporting characters like Homer's father, mother, his friend Quentin and Ms. Price independently.

Not to be able to see some timeless classic movies when they first appeared on the big screen, but to have seen and heard some of the more famous events in our life time. \u0091October Sky' focuses on an event that I had never heard of, but If I was born in the right era, I am sure it would have had an influence on individual just like me. This is an inspirational story, that can and will leave you stunned on what you can achieve, if you put your heart and soul into it. In Coalwood, West Virginia, 1957, coal mining is king and no one can escape life underground. But when high school student Homer Hickam, Jr. sees the Soviet satellite Sputnik streak overhead, he aims for the stars and a new destiny in this incredible true story of hope, determination and triumph. With the help of his teacher and three buddies, Homer sets out to build his own rocket. How Homer overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles-poor education, a disapproving father and a series of misfires that threaten to flatten his dreams and the town- and fulfills his vision is the launching pad for one of the most timeless, inspirational stories ever brought to the screen.Jake Gyllenhaal was terrific as the main star of \u0091October Sky'. Homer Hickman, must be an extraordinary personality, and I am sure he would be proud of the performance Gyllenhaal did to this role in a film based on him. Yet I also feel that the boys that backed Homer in his rocketing adventures were also important to the make up of this film. The other young star I know in this movie is who played the character Quentin. He is a good young actor, who has been in the infamous `American Pie' movies. In this film he was completely different, in that he was the nerdy type of guy that everyone avoided at school, yet he also helped pull off what was an amazing feet by such young people.Chris Cooper is the conservative father in this film. In all his films I have found him to be an extremely stubborn character, and he does that in October Sky. He was born to be a very reluctant character. This role reminds me so much of the role he took in the brilliant, \u0091American Beauty'. The other good role in this film was that of Homer's teacher, Miss Riley. Out of all the hindrance the boys get to there dream, they have a help in a teacher that wants them to succeed. Miss Riley was portrayed well by Laura Dern.I really felt that this story, though it was based on true life events, was a great premise for a movie. Having the real Homer Hickman write a book really helps the story, then to recreate the time that it was set in, was extremely satisfying for me. I believe the director, Joe Johnston, got the whole mood of the  story just how it was meant to be. I also like how we get to see what the real characters are up to in the end of the film.\nTo say that October Sky \u0091is one of the better films that will uplift and inspire everyone' is pretty obvious. Yet this film also shows me that movies based on true stories can be extremely invaluable, as it can show how great some people really are, if they put their mind to it. This film also proves that parents are not allows right when it comes to knowing what there children want. Instead it makes me certain that parents need to help, rather than hinder there children, because if they don't it could result in people never knowing how great some young people can be. CMRS gives \u0091October Sky': 4.5 (very good \u0096 brilliant film)",

Instead  the story and characters make it a unique movie, about four young boys who live in a mining town in West Virgina during the launch of Sputnik.  One of the boys, Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal), dreams of making a rocket ship that can one day, go into space.  His father, played by Chris Cooper (my favorite character actor along with Sam Neil) disapproves of this idea and wants young Homer to take over the coal mines when he's older. Following his heart instead of his dad, Homer recruits his two friends, and the school nerd, to build and test rockets. To their surprise, the entire town becomes excited about their project. This is a movie that explains to the viewer that one should follow their heart for what they want to do.  This movie is emotional, both good and bad. I'm sure it won't win any Oscars next year, but it will be remembered as a great movie (like THE NATURAL).  A very entertaining film that is great for the family!",

            "content": "If I had to define this movie in one word it would be: aspirational. Regardless of whether it sticks to the truth in every single detail of the tale, there's no denying this movie portrays the inspirational story of an underdog kid trapped in a town too small and small-minded for his ground-breaking dream.Maybe it's because, as an engineer from a small town myself, I relate to this sort of tales too closely; but I strongly believe this movie succeeds in what it's trying to say even though it's based in a true story. I'm reluctant to trust all that a biographical picture shows about a historical figure's life, however if it recounted with little changes and it is focused on a positive outcome, I can't help but praise it.Something that caught my attention was that it doesn't idealize neither the negative nor the possitive aspects on such an initiative of the kids. There are folks trying or finding ways to stop them from carrying on or mocking what they are trying to achieve but it never goes too far in terms of stepping out of the realm of the plausible as Hollywood sometimes has. In real life no situation or person is entirely bad or entirely good, we are motivated by our own morals and interests. However, that doesn't mean bad things happen.As you watch the movie it's clear that it's based on a true story because the pacing and unfolding of events feels very \"self-controlled\" in the sense that it never romanticises many of the themes and tropes presented in it. And that only enhances the realism of the story it is trying to tell. But mainly the themes it presents may be its strongest suit. The theme of the father who has lived his whole life in a coal town and can't fathom the idea that his son wants to build rockets and go to space when such a thing was not only possible for a handful of people from probably bigger cities or with better education, but also impossible at the time. I believe the backdrop of the movie and therefore the story, is so inspiring because it was a time were very few believed in the reaches of technology. TV and radio was barely just invented a decade or so ago and it was becoming revolutionary.Surely, if it wasn't based on a true story, I'd find the fact that a coal-miner's son who suddenly develops an interest in rockets and is capable of learning the advance mathematics and be able to achieve what he does in the movie, very hard to believe. But because those aspects of the movie are taken from real life it is way more commendable and trully inspirational. And that's just it, this movie feels unreal for how far kids from a small town go in the space race and all that happens to them, and it makes you wonder why this story hasn't been told before.Additionally, the subplots are not romanticised like other 50s-based movies have because the true story takes center focus. However, the addition of the romantic and other supporting characters subplot provide more layers to the story and emotional weight on many occasions through out the film. Like I said before, regardless of whether those things really happened or not, they enhance the more dramatic or victorious scenes in their own way.But that's the beauty of it, while the dramatic and dream-obstructing scenes weigh down the aspirations of this young kids, these are balanced out by the victory scenes where the inclusion of many of not only the supporting characters but the whole town and other witnesses of the greatness this kids are achieving, elevates the sense of success and inspiration of this moments.IN CONCLUSION, I've tried to keep out of talking about many plotpoints and themes as I believe this are sort of expected from a movie with such a premise but also because I believe it is part of the charm of the movie, the messages it presents in every turn. I may have not being objective when reviewing this title, but that's because as an engineer from a small town in south Spain, I've lived in a town with close-minded people where I had some good but mostly unfortunate moments in my childhood. But I managed to get out of there and find a future for myself, and I don't look back at it with resentment as if I hadn't had the life I had there, well, I wouldn't be were I am now.This movie is deeply inspirational for those who dream of leaving their current life in pursuit of greater things. They don't have to be building the first rocket, becoming president of a country, building the next computer, it need only be a personal dream born from a passion and the perception of the world we live in. It is hard, I know, you may be drawn to believe everything is already invented and everything has already been done, but that doesn't mean you won't find something else on your way. Inspiration and ideas are born from not only what we know but the questions we ask when we know what has already been done. That's how it was done then, reading up books about rocket scientists, and that's how it works now. Know what exists to ask about what doesn't.",

This makes the movie all the more inspiring when Jake Gylenhalls character breaks the mold. It's a very inspiring movie, and shows how a little vision can enable greatness in ANYONE. Yes you heard it hear folks. ANYONE can be great. Good movie.\nMy one criticism would be a lack of character relationship development between certain characters.

In a way, it might have been a more interesting (but vastly more tragic) movie if Homer and friends had not won at the science fair, and they all ended up working in the mine after all. But this perhaps reinforces my point--for there are no doubt hundreds of failures, in real life, for every Homer Hickam success story.9/10",

            "content": "October Sky (an anagram of Rocket Boys, the name of the book the movie is based on and the fact that Sputnik flew over an October Sky -- pretty neat) is a story about a kid named Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who doesn't seem to have much talent and is destined to work in the town's coal mine, following the footsteps of his father John (Chris Cooper). The one thing he has going for him is determination.At a gathering to watch Sputnik, he sees that little dot move through the sky and is captivated. He wants to build a rocket and he's going to. That single-minded determination will ensure that happens.I think what's so wonderful about this movie is how things are stacked up against him and it's his will that allows him to succeed.\nHe's not initially smart. he's not into math or science.\nHe's from a family where his destiny seems set -- work in the coal mine with his father.\nThe principal thinks he's a waste of time.\nThe school kids think the rocket thing is a waste of time\nHis dad is dead set against the hobby. Why waste time on that when the coal mine is right next door.One by one, and with the help of some friends, he overcomes the obstacles. And, one by one, the adversaries turn into allies. The kids who ridiculed him start to root for him. the principal who thinks he's a waste now thinks he's got talent. One by one, he wins them over, by his sheer will to succeed with this rocket.Look, I know not everything is as simple as \"follow your dreams and you'll succeed\". But I also know more than a few people who wish for something but don't *want* something. They won't work at it, through good times and bad, day and night, over and over until they succeed. And that's what's so incredibly inspiring about this movie. This kid, with no seeming talent, no innate gift for math or science, had so much determination and will that he succeeded. And, while I'm sure there are some Hollywood liberties made, this is based on a true story, so it's not like this is some fantasy that could never happen.This movie should be required viewing for kids in high school. If you liked The Martian or Hidden Figures, this movie is in the same vein and we need more movies like this.",

His father should have been proud of him, but his shame was too powerful. He tried to conform his son in his own image, and a strong willed boy rebels against this. Life gives another \"parent\" figure (Homer's teacher) as a guide post. The shame Homer's father had is about his own father--pride is rooted somewhere in this story deep inside. Homer's father felt trapped in this mining career, and when he saw his son want to break free, he was gripped with his own fear of leaving; \"I had to stay here, so you should as well!\" \"I didn't get the opportunity, so why should you!\" \"I had to suffer, so you should as well!\" Few men are this aware of honest, but the message is clear.",

There's a fun little montage of them shooting, or trying to shoot of their rockets and failing over and over. The sound track was all 60's music which was enjoyable.

What all three films do have in common is well-told stories of people with dreams who struggle against the odds.The setting for October Sky is a small mining town in West Virginia. In October of 1957 the world learns that the Soviet-made satellite Sputnik has been successfully launched. It is at this point that high-school student Homer Hickam decides to learn all he can about rockets. What begins as a hobby soon becomes an obsession. With the aid of three of his friends, and the encouragement of one of his teachers, Homer learns how to build model rockets.As his passion for the subject develops, Homer senses a life-calling in the making. Unfortunately, Homer lives in one of those towns, where your vocation is determined at birth. Homer's father in particular believes his son is destined to make a living toiling in the coalmines, just like his father. This establishes the central tension in the film, and provides some opportunities for poignant interactions between father and son.This is not a new theme, and the film contains more than a few stock characters. We have already seen the high school teacher played by Laura Dern (think Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds or Barbara Hershey in Hoosiers. There is also the high-school principal as uncaring bureaucrat, and a chorus of townsfolk who, at first, remind Homer and the other rocket boys that they should accept their fate in life in the coalmines.In spite of the formulaic nature of the story, this story works. There are enough nuances added that the characters are, at the same time, familiar and new to us. There are no top box-office stars in the film, but there are solid performances by some excellent actors-especially Laura Dern, Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer, and Chris Cooper as Homer's dad.October Sky is based on a true story, and this is part of its power. The image of Homer shooting for the stars while his father dutifully toils in his subterranean world is rich in symbolism. Several years ago, while walking around a Hispanic community on the North side of Chicago, I saw a mural that said, \"there are two things we need to give our children-roots and wings.\" October Sky is about finding that balance. In the beginning of the film, Homer's dad only sees the need for roots, while Homer's thoughts all turn toward flying. Watching the struggle unfold is a richly rewarding experience that the whole family can enjoy.",

If you look at Gyllenhaal's profile and click on the genre section, you will see that \"October Sky\" is (so far) the only family work he has ever done. To me that is a sad but true illustration of the choices that some actors and actresses make these days and they should do these more often.

The story is about 17 year old Homer Hickam living in a coal mining town that's going through many crises's, including deaths, strikes, and ultimately shutting down. But Homer, the one kid who used to be the laughing stock redeems himself by bringing a dying town together on one dream, to go into outer space. Sadly I wish it could be the same for the Space Coast. I wish this movie could bring back the inspiration to these people here. But this movie is at my #1 spot. I don't care how epic \"Transformers Dark of the Moon\" was, or how awesome \"Armageddon\" was, October Sky, the movie that's not epic, the movie, that is my all time favorite. It's theme's, it's lesson exceeds all things EPIC and creates another level of EPIC it's self. Even though there isn't meteors or robots or explosions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.",

The true story of four boys, centered around Homer Hickam, who bond together to build a rocket as they try to win a science fair that will give them college scholarships and get them out of the coal mine town they live in. Using a cast of unknowns for the roles of the four boys, and Chris Cooper as the unyielding and demanding father of Hickham, as well as Laura Dern as the teacher who both inspires and encourages the boys, the makers of this film made something more than a congratulatory film about someone who made something of his life coming from less than ideal circumstances. To watch this movie is to see what moviemaking is supposed to be about. Telling a good story.",

The movie is a wonderful experience of the United States, the West Virginia coalfield to be exact, in the late '50's.  From the opening scenes watching Sputnik cross the night sky to family relationships to school settings and friendship between young men and women it has the \"feel\" of the era. The cinematogaphy, soundtrack, writing, and characters are all excellent.  This being a true story makes it all the more impressive.  The cast was great even though none are household names.  Not once in the almost two hours did I think of those I was watching as actors.  The story is truly inspirational in that does show what is good about people----hard work, goal setting, persistence, value of family, friendship, and community.  It also emphasizes the value of education.   This is a movie that should be seen by families. I would like to thank all involved from the real people to the actors and everyone involved in the making of this film.  If it were up to me October Sky would be required viewing.  Four Stars!!!!",

            "content": "An inspirational story based on a true story.  The movie focuses mostly on a high school student in the early 1950's, who lives in a small, poor mining town, trying to pursue a personal interest in model rockets.The story is sweet, uplifting, inspirational, and mostly predictable.  We do know it is based on a true life story after all, and they don't base too many stories on people pursuing an interest and failing horribly.I felt the real focus of the movie was the father, John played by Chris Cooper. He clearly was a \"responsible\" typical middle American person. I think it showed a person struggling with the responsibilities of his job, and his family and trying to make the best choices possible. His job was dangerous, but he was up every day working hard. He tried to channel his son's interests into areas that he (the father) was comfortable with, but the son was resistant to. The movie captures the conflict of a father trying to guide his son, while still allowing him to grow into his own. Ultimately he allows his son some freedom to pursue his own interests, despite the feeling as if his son may be growing apart from him.  In one of the touching moments of the movie, the son lets him know that, that could not happen, when the father says mockingly \"So, you met your hero, and didn't even know it.\" and the son responds \"He is not my hero.\" leaving the implied \"you are\" hanging on the air.",

The other thing I love about this movie is the persistence by which one should follow his heart. Watch it with your family and friends and celebrate life in the way it should be.

It makes you feel good for a few reasons: watching a family grow and struggle as they deal with each other's individuality; knowing that sometimes dreams do come true; and that even the most stubborn person can change. Here is a story of a second child who is lost in a family structure that focuses on the accomplishments of the elder sibling and rewards the younger sibling only when he does exactly what is expected of him (no matter how low those expectations may have been.) This is the true story of a young man and his friends who dreamed they could reach the stars (literally) and someday be the people they wanted to be. The story takes place in a small mining town in West Virginia where only a select few of the youth accomplish their goal of leaving the town's borders to follow their dreams. You will follow four of the town's youth as they learn about rockets, science, and life. The film does lack some depth in the area of seeking emotional ties with the audience, but that doesn't really hurt the film, it just doesn't enhance the quality of it. Bottom line...if you like films like \"Rudy\", \"Field of Dreams\", \"Lean on Me\", and \"Stand By Me\" then you should see this one.",

You ARE unselfish, humble, and undeniably deserving of every success.The director skillfully orchestrates an emotionally compelling composition. Most of the acting is understated and inoffensive.  Chris Cooper reprises his life role as a courageous but sensitive man pursued by personal demons. Laura Dern is miscast as the supportive teacher.  Jake Gyllenhaal soldiers through an uninspired performance.  The cinematography and plotting, however, is beyond reproach.  Every incident adds to the dramatic intensity and vividness of the picture.  Even if you don't buy the enraptured faces at times, the landscape, homes, and workplaces ring true.  People do help others out of the goodness of their heart and the film glories in these moments of real personal kindness.If you like Norman Rockwell, are over 50, and were caught up in the space race, see the movie.

One night, the citizens of Coalwood, West Virginia, watch the sky to get a view of the satellite. The event has a significant impact on young Homer Hickam.After seeing Sputnik, Homer becomes fascinated with rockets. He strives to learn everything there is to know about them. Joining forces with three other students, production begins on the first rocket.As time passes, the quartet's prowess in constructing rockets improves, and with the encouragement of teacher Frieda Riley, the boys work hard to earn a chance to go to the National Science Fair in Indianapolis.While Homer and his colleagues develop a popular following, there are some who oppose their work. The biggest critic is Homer's father, John, who is a supervisor at the town's coal mine. His belief is simple: Rockets are a waste of time, and Homer should go to work in the mine, which ultimately becomes the career of virtually all of Coalwood's male citizens. As one of the characters says at one point, it's either the mine, or possibly college thanks to a football scholarship.Since Homer cannot play football, it's either the mine, or rockets. He definitely does not want the first option. What will it be? The film has some solid performances, including Jake Gyllenhall as Homer, and Chris Cooper as John. The script is good, and a lot of the scenes evoke the right emotions. You cannot help but cheer for Homer, who has a dream and wants to achieve it.This film is an uplifting drama, and does show that if you believe, you can follow your dreams. Don't miss it.",

Children were primed and expected to work in the mines if they intended to continue to live in southern WV as adults.  This movie strikes an interesting and true-to-life account of a typical southern WV coal mining family.  While watching this movie, I felt transported back to my childhood days, remembering what it was like to wonder if I would be relegated to working in the coal mines.  But, like Homer, I too was able to choose a different path except that I had my father's blessing.

He\u00b4s a more complex (excuse my English) director than it seems, and I feel lucky to know it. All what he do is pure cinema, and he is one of the few directors that know combine \"quality\" and \"spectacle\" in a movie.I saw \"October Sky\" a few time ago because I\u00b4m from Spain and it opened here a week ago, but I knew since a long time it would be a GREAT movie. It has something special that also have \"Honey...\", \"Rocketeer\" and \"Jumanji\". Well, I only wish I can go to Anselmo in the future to tell this to Johnston personally. But I think it is a little difficult! Maybe in the future I will make a film that become me a famous director, and then I will be like a Homer Hickam who wants to know Werner von Braun as much I wish to know Joe Johnston.",

Maybe even great, but I don't believe that it's one of the greatest family masterpieces it's often made out to be. The story was relatively interesting, starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal as real-life NASA engineer Homer Hickam. After the Soviet satellite Sputnik was sent into space, it instantly caught Hickam's interests and he knew that this was what he was going to do. His family doesn't believe in him, his town doesn't believe in him but one teacher does and it changes his life. I'm sorry, I know this is a true story and all but this movie is very predictable, around the half-way mark you know exactly what's going to happen almost in the order that it ends up doing. That makes the movie feel much longer than it is, probably didn't help that I was also watching it with my family very late at night. They frequently asked me \"how much longer?\" It's by no means a bad movie, not at all. It's average-length but just seems drawn out as the entire story could've easily been told in the span of 10 minutes. Ah, well. Still pretty good family movie, one of the better ones I think I've actually seen and I'd recommend it actually. I liked it, even though a lot of my sleepy siblings didn't. It's quite an inspiring tale of believing in yourself when no one else would but it just falls a little short for my personal tastes. It's still an excellent family movie though.",

            "content": "From the opening of shots of October Sky, I knew that I was going to like this film. However, I did not know that I was going to love this film. In a year with stupid and ugly teen flicks that can only give us cheap jokes, October Sky stood out from the rest. Unfortunately, I did not get to see it in the theater because of commitments. Now I wish I had.October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhall) who dreams of leaving the dying mining town of Coalwood and doing something other than mining like his father. His father, John (portrayed by Chris Cooper) does not take kindly to this. His father spent all of his life working the mines, and as the movie opens, that life is crumbling around him. Homer is given inspiration when he sees Sputnik orbit over his town and he ends up wanting to become a rocket engineer. He gets a lot of support from his friends, mother, and teacher (played by Laura Dern), but almost no support from his father, who thinks he should take his place in the mines. Homer studies hard to reach his dream, but the pull of his father is strong. Later, he must learn that he must do what he wants to do..The acting in October Sky is top notch. The cast is mostly unknown actors, which I think helps in a movie like this. Gyllenhall did a good job of portraying Homer, who spent a lot of time with the real Homer, who wrote the book that this movie is based on. Chris Cooper is also excellent as Homer's dad, who struggles to keep the life he had for so long. The rest of the cast is strong, and they grow on you.This is a movie with almost no special effects. It has no crude dialogue and it retains old-fashioned values. Those reasons may be a reason why this movie was overlooked by moviegoers. They do not know what they are missing. This movie gets a good emotional response from its viewers without stooping to the cringing level of tearjerker. This movie does not become a tearjerker because it does not need to sink that low. It is just a good, simple story. It is something I wish more movies could achieve. It really recaptures the excitement I had with space flight and rockets when I was a kid.October Sky is one of my three top movies of '99, along with the original The Matrix, and the good old fashioned fun of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. I encourage anyone who actually has a brain to see this movie. Highly Recommended.***** stars (out of *****).",

The pre-machinery days of coal mining in West Virginia are explored here through the eyes of a boy who dares to dream of a life beyond the coalfields.This movie succeeds on many levels, and most of them have been noted in reviews.  But its greatest accomplishment is the evocation of the community and lives of a people who have other wise been written out of American history.While the U.S. was booming in the post-war, places like this small town of Coalwood, West Virginia were stoking the fires of the American dream. Required to contribute, but refused a piece of the great growth, these families are very much cognizant of their designation in society.  This film deftly shows us Homer Hickham's painful self-awareness as he tries to show colors to a people relegated to dreaming in black in white.However, this is not a film about drudgery or the downtrodden.  It is one about a town that was willing to believe in its youth, and it provides a valuable lesson for today's \"television-as-babysitter\" world.There are elements of Hickham's book which would have fit nicely within this film's framework.  The value placed on high school football over academics is but one such element, and would have helped to explain the community's mentality a little more clearly.But that is nitpicking, for this is the best of all kinds of movies:  It is one which respects it subject matter, its characters, and how their lives fit in the small frame as well as the big picture.  Kudos to screenwriter Lewis Colick for appreciating Hickam's humor and the dignity of the town's citizenry.  And bravo to director Joe Johnston for instilling this talented cast with a sense of esteem.  The collaborative effort of all involved in this film make it one for the time capsule.  It reminds us who we were, how we got to where we are now, and eventually where we are going.  This film joins Charles Laughton's \"Night of the Hunter\" and John Sayle's \"Matewan\" as accurate portrayals of West Virginia and its denizens.  Without condescension or unqualified judgment, Johnston joins these directors in celebrating a people who are often dismissed as insignificant cogs, but in reality they are the engines who create a prosperity of which they are never allowed to partake.A thought to ponder as in this movie we watch Sputnik streak across the \"October Sky.\"",

It is about perseverance of a boy in the midst of all adversities, misunderstandings, hardships and challenges. His desire to pursue what his real calling is and realise it. It is about inspiration and courage.Initially not a very bright student, his new born passion of building rockets sees him take on subjects that weren't his cup of tea (maths and calculations). When faced with lack of financial resources, he along with his friends take up to stealing old unused railway tracks. (That scene where they have just unlinked a rail from an unused track - or so they thought - and then they hear the train coming, is quite hilarious!)The most poignant part of the movie is his strained relationship with his father who wants to see him take over his job as supervisor in a coal mine and thinks his running after rockets is a waste of time. In spite of the animosity and difference of opinion, Homer acknowledges to his father that he is his real hero. At the end, his father understands him and appreciates his talent.The friendship among the four of them, each one of a different kind, is quite warming. All driven by the passion to build rockets together. Thus they earn the name 'Rocket Boys'.

            "content": "** This is my homework** October Sky, a film woven by the odds between father and son, and the dream of living oneself's life. Homer Hickam, the protagonist of the film, had an 'impossible' dream since he witnessed the launch of the first man-made satellite. Because of this dream, he befriended with the weird yet smart geek Quentin, and started the journey of rocket making with Quentin, Roy Lee and O'Dell. In Coalwood, high school graduates usually could not further their study in college, the only opportunity going to college is getting the football scholarship. But Homer did not surrender to his fate of being a coal miner. Of course,Homer's father, who was the leader of the coal miner and expected his son will be a coal miner, did not support him making rockets.There were many obstacles on the road of Homer's goal, he and his friends was accused as arsonists as they could not find all their rockets back, therefore, he was suspended. During that period, his father was injured as he tried to save the miners in an accident. The family could not afford the charge of surgery, so that Homer decided to work as a coal miner to provide for his family instead of his brother, who got the football scholarship, and would not be able to go to college if he dropped out at that moment. I think it is very responsible of Homer to prioritize his family , yet, it is upset to see him giving up his dream. There is a scene where they ignited the gasoline bomb and hurled it into the hut on there experiment site, it symbolizes the end of their dream.'Sometimes you really can't listen to what anybody else says, you just gotta listen inside.' The words of Miss Riley evoked Home's enthusiasm of rocketry and the passion buried deep inside the heart of the audience as well. I as an audience member, instantly asked my self, ' what's my inside voice's telling me? What do I want to achieve?' Similar to Homer, my school does not produce many graduates who can go to university, but I will not be tied and I know I will and have to outshine others so that I will have the chance to further my study in University and that I can fight against the fate I should supposedly live.Homer was determined to devote in rocketry after being inspired by Miss Riley. He studied very advance Mathematics twenty-four-seven, at lunch time in coal mine, at night on bed. He eventually figured out that the fire was not started by their rockets, they were not related to the arson! This is the twist I love most, as when I was watching the movie, I felt like I was walking in Homer's shoes. It gives me strength to move on. Finally, the Rocket Boys got the champion of the county science fair, both four of them got the scholarships to go to college. Still, they are proving nothing to others, they are just being themselves, whom they knew do not belong here or work in coal mines.Along the plot of Homer chasing his dream, there is another line of plot of the father-and-son odds. 'Father love the mines more than Jim, even more than you!' Homer groaned to his mother. Because of the pride of his father, he did not want his son to see coal miner as a not so classy job and expected his second son to be like him, a coal miner. 'Coal mine is your life, it's not mine. I'm never going down there again.' Homer confronted his dad, I believe his dad must be broken hearted at that time. It was harsh for Homer to say things like that, but I figure telling the true feeling would be better. After Homer came back from the science fair, there is a scene where Homer showing his medal while his father going down the mine elevator, we can see the eyes of Homer's father, the way he looked at his son, he was proud of his son. Homer was also jealous of his brother, as his dad never missed a game of his brother, but he had never come to watch him launching the rockets. In the very end, Homer's father was there to launch the rockets, the smile on Homer was sweeter than you have ever seen. This also credits to the actors, they did an incredible job on playing the roles. I have already expressed my appreciation to this superb film, another fact that impressed me most is that this film is base on a true story. I do not see why you and I cannot be the next Homer Hickam! What's your inside voice telling you?",

Much like The Last Picture Show, it deals with coming-of-age in a dying setting, but unlike Bogdanovich's film, it doesn't leave you cold in the end - it makes you feel ALIVE.",

I first watched (Rocky) in 1977 and thus began my #10 rated list that would fail to find an addition until 18 years later (8-Seconds). One night in Atlanta in 1999 I felt very lonely (being I was on a 6 month job that took me 600 miles from home) so I decided to go see a movie. I wasn't in the mood for an action type so the display of October Sky grabbed my attention. I watched in amazement as the stories events unfolded. I actually got lost in the movie to where my loneliness had left my senses. I liked it so much I paid to see it 2 more times the same week. I find it best to watch unknowingly what it's about. I hope you may find it on your own rare 10 list as well.",

Homer Hickham personal oversaw the construction of this film, so the \"based on a true story\" must hold it's own weight.Chris Cooper's performance in this film is just breathtaking. I don't think anyone could have played it better. The producers even said he was the only person they thought of for the role. But at first he turned it down! He said he didn't think the relationship between father and son was tough enough. He wanted to portray the character the way he remembered his own father. So in the end, they ended up rewriting some of the father/son scenes just so Mr. Cooper would accept the role.Brilliant family movie. Not just for kids. But a movie all ages can relate to in some way and enjoy. A+++++++++",

            "content": "OCTOBER SKY ****1/2 (out of 5 Stars) Starring-Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern and Chris Owen; Director-Joe JohnstonEveryone I talked to loved Patch Adams, and yet the critics completely lambasted it. Here is a movie that I'm sure the movie-going public and professional critics can agree on. They're saying that October Sky is the first great movie of 1999, and they're right.This is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young boy in a small West Virginia coal mining town who is obsessed with building a working rocket. His influence is the Russian satellite Sputnik, a landmark achievement that he sees pass, consequently, in the October night sky. His father (played by Chris Cooper), driven by generations of coal miners in the family, views Homer's rocket chemistry as nonsensical and wants him to follow in his footsteps. The only support Homer gets is from his friends and his teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), who eagerly assists him as his dream unravels.Joe Johnston manages to press all the right buttons that a director possibly could, turning this basic formula movie into an uplifting, heartwarming piece of modern day entertainment. It's absolutely no surprise that the movie is produced by the same people as Field of Dreams. It's that good.October Sky could have easily failed if everything didn't click appropriately. The first mission was to get a believable actor to play Homer, the young real-life hero who now works at NASA. This is where the filmmakers struck gold. In casting newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal as the teenager brave enough to follow his dream, Johnston made the best decision of his career. Young Gyllenhaal is a sensational find, and the movie simply glows whenever he's on camera. This puts everything to rest, because he's in nearly every scene in the film.Another wise move was to put Homer's rocky relationship with his father ahead of even its main story. Cooper has a familiar role and speaks familiar dialogue, but his situation is so believable that all signs of deja vu are quickly pushed aside. Laura Dern is also playing somewhat of a stock character. Her role may be the one weak spot the film has, but in the same sense she performs very well with the material she's given. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for making this movie.There's truly never an uninvolving moment in this two-hour gem, which has far more than the designated amount of laughs and smiles needed to register. If you're looking for something entertaining, you couldn't do much better than seeing this. October Sky is the best movie Hollywood has presented so far this year.",

Worth seeing for the several fine performances, notably Jake Gyllenhall in the lead role, who is absolutely marvelous.  But if you are looking for a really great film about a young person growing beyond his limitations, see The Mighty, now sitting lonely on the shelves of your local Blockbuster.

The music is marvelous.  And the humor is fitted in just the right spots so that it will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  But what I like most about this movie is the fact that teenagers are portrayed not as screw-ups, not as misfits, not as delinquents, but as instruments of hopes and dreams.  The kids in \"October Sky\" aren't senseless failures.  They are responsible young adults who have potential and strive to use it.  I think it's about time we had a movie like that. But of course \"Sky\" is not perfect.  One distinct aspect is how the movie tends to leave you clueless to some events. Also, since the movie is relatively dark and there is so much dirt on the miners' faces, it's almost impossible to tell who's who (And that gets downright annoying when a certain individual dies). But overall, \"October Sky\" is a blast.  I recommend it to anyone who's willing to sit down for an hour and fifty minutes of warm fuzzies.  And I mean that in a good way.",

But this movie, as anyone who sees it knows, has more than that one storyline.  There is the classic coming-of-age side to it where we see four friends finding out who they are and what they are passionate about.  We see one of them defying his father who seems to be heartless, but who later comes to the rescue of another one of the boys.  And we also see a true life account of one of the most remembered parts of our nation's history--the beginning of the Space Race.  The film opens with Sputnik being launched and seen flying through space over the small town in which the characters live.  From there, one boy gets an idea to build a rocket, and soon his two best friends and their brainy classmate join him.  We follow them through their greatest achievements and their lowest times.

So I'll tell you what I didn't like.It seems to me as if the director/writer tried to make every moment soak with emotion and sentiment.  This might be good, but it also makes it a little sappy and terribly predictable.  At one point, I predicated word for word what the next lines were going to be. That's pretty bad.In fact, October Sky is so busy trying to be inspiring that it acts like we already know the story.  For example, why does Homer all of the sudden like rockets?  Ok, so he saw Sputnik float across the sky.  But so did everyone else.  We never really find out exactly what his passion is with the sky. He looks up at space only three times in the entire movie.  Anytime we have as dedicated and committed a character as Homer, we need to know why he is as dedicated and committed(Contact does a fantastic job of this).Other questions:  why is the principal so biased against Homer's rocketry? No one else in the town, save Homer's dad, is.  And for some reason, after Homer sits down with Quentin, Quentin becomes everyone's best friend.  Why? Homer isn't THAT cool in school.October Sky is a great family movie for families.  It's nice to see brains triumph over brawn.  But I really wish they would've spent more time on the lure and the magic of space.  Otherwise, rocketry might as well have been bridge building or car building.",

            "content": "October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it\u00a1\u00a6s easy to see why. The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping, the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, the hero finally gets what he wants, and it\u00a1\u00a6s a true story. Frankly I think the director\u00a1\u00a6s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. We don\u00a1\u00a6t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters. We feel Homer\u00a1\u00a6s desire to earn his father\u00a1\u00a6s recognition and create his own future, and his resilience wins our respect. \u00a1\u00a7October Sky\u00a1\u00a8 reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy,\u00a1\u00a8 which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie. Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny, \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy\u00a1\u00a8 offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society. Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda, \u00a1\u00a7Rocket Boy\u00a1\u00a8 focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut, a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother (like what Homer feels in his family), and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea. The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them \u00a1\u00a7impossible.\u00a1\u00a8 To compensate for his lost ideal, Kobayashi (Yuji) works in the tour operator because it\u00a1\u00a6s called \u00a1\u00a7Galaxy.\u00a1\u00a8 When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him, he finally finds strength from his father\u00a1\u00a6s words, who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed. \u00a1\u00a7But I don\u00a1\u00a6t regret it,\u00a1\u00a8 his father told Kobayashi, \u00a1\u00a7at least I tried.\u00a1\u00a8 It is his father\u00a1\u00a6s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair. Kobayashi\u00a1\u00a6s effort finally fails, and he goes back to the travel agency. But his \u00a1\u00a7crazy\u00a1\u00a8 courage inspires his friends, and everyone loves him more. Just before the end of the series, Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts. After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree, unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: \u00a1\u00a7Astronauts Wanted for 2004.\u00a1\u00a8 Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs, just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland. Kobayashi may never get what he wants, but he dares his destiny and \u00a1\u00a7just does it.\u00a1\u00a8 This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds, but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy. Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings, this show enlightens us and teaches us something. Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream, and they do what they can despite other people\u00a1\u00a6s opinions. I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series. If you are a nine-to-fiver, you will feel more touched. I feel sorry that IMDB doesn\u00a1\u00a6t have its data, maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you.",

In this day in age of your \"American Pie\", \"Varsity Blues\", \"Porkys\", and just basically all of the teenie bopper films out there. I was happy to see a film that dug deep into the lives of 4 boys who used intellegence and a captivating story line, to make this film good. Unlike most films that have to do with high school, this film didn't bother with popularity and sex. It dealt with the life of Homer Hickam who wanted to make something of his life, and his inspiration was the sattelite sputnik. He got together a team of 4 boys who as well were interested in this feat, and nothing but controversy followed. Everyone in Homers town of Coalwood, usually would go work down in the coal mines and that was that. Even the school principle did not even believe in the value of an education, he sent kids out of school and into the coal mines, and he considered it an honorable trade. Ms. Riley did a great job of keeping these boys dreams alive. What I also loved about this film, is that they didn't completely dwell on one story. They didn't just dwell on the story of Homer and his dad. They incorporated so many other stories in the process that you had to follow. The high point in this film for me, had to be when Homer proved that his rocket did not make that forest fire, and he got up on the chalkboard and used Trigonometry to prove his theory. Most people would have scuffed this idea or at least laughed at it, but people liked it and were happy to see that a film about 4 high school boys used intellegence and not sex. What I didn't like too much about this film though was that it was predictable. I think that in order to make a good film that is predictable, you need a great and captivating story line that you can just get lost in. This film accomplished that well and a good example of that is the film E.T. which had a great story line but was very predictable. This is a great film, and reccomended for anyone who is sick of films like \"Varsity Blues\" and \"American Pie\".",

The circumstances the characters faced seemed impossible and all too believable, which made the movie gripping. In other words, it rang true.

The only thing that is stoping him is his father, his fathers is a miner and wants Homer to be one, he says that building and shooting off rockets is a dumb thing to do. But Homer and his 3 friends, O'Dell, Roy-Lee,  and Quentin build rockets anyway. The second time there town sees them, they get arrested at school for starting the Forest Fire near by. They dont go to jail. When Homers father got hurt in the mine, Homer went in so his brother Jim wont loose the chance to play football at a collage. Soon his father went back to work, but the next day, Homer quit, in the book his teacher, Mrs Riley gave him he was able to find where the rocket landed to tell his princebal, he and his friends didn't start the fire.

Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).",

With the dangerous nature of coal mining the injuries and after effects Homer Hickham (Jake Gyllenhaal) he knows he cannot follow the path his father took and what he wants for him. The way the director captured the lives of the coal miners and the plight of being under a ceiling of rock. The black faces and constant coughing of the miners constantly reminding us of the danger they are put in. What makes this film more captivating is the relationships between the different characters. The dad a classical hardened manly man, with a soft side deep down. We have a father who truly loves his son even with all there fights. The support and encouragement of the teacher is very important as well. After seeing sputnik launched homer sees it as a opportunity to get away from the town tradition even as he has resistance from people in his life. After he experiments on building his own rockets with friends and ends up winning the school science fair. Years later he ends up actually working for NASA which makes this even a more endearing film. Since there were some superficial flaws as with other true story movies the movie still came together where others have not, with good storytelling and real emotions and a period piece. When I saw this years ago when it came out I still remember the applause at the end and almost everyone staying to the end. It was just one of those films that stays with you. Even seeing this movie again it still got me choked up. Seeing how this kid with a predetermined future having a lot against him, showing nothing but his faith and desire to change his life path ends up making his dreams come true.",

The movie is not EXTREMELY sad, but it's just such a mass of emotions, I didn't know what to do with them.  It actually hit me the most AFTER the movie, during the credits.

But hey, there's always room for a well-played and well-written one. On more than one occasion did I feel my throat clutter up and my eyes go all stingy-like.We like seeing people overcoming personal and practical obstacles and succeeding at what they dream of. And it's also refreshing to see one which is n-o-t about the high school football/baseball-team that's at the bottom of the series inching their way up to the final - and guess what - winning it.Having just seen Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Donnie Darko\" and being blown away by his performance there, I was even more so after seeing this flick. He is a very talented young actor. A word of caution though, Jake. Please embark on more projects like \"Donnie Darko\" or you might become your generations Tom Hanks. Hate to see yet another great talent loose itself within the boundaries of \"happy-ending-land\".Chris Cooper does a very good job portraying Jakes father, but he is so typecast in that role that certain scenes almost becomes comical. Damn you Hollywood-people for not allowing actors to grow. Damn you.All in all, a very enjoyable film. A bit too much in the end though when he proves himself to the mining-community, reconciles with his father, realizes which girl he wants (and getting her) AND getting a scholarship.

            "content": "When I saw this movie, it had quite a large emotional impact on me. I realize that many people probably didn't notice it very much. I certainly haven't read all the reviews on here, but I understand where they're all coming from.I saw October Sky several years back when I was in high school, between 1999 and 2001. I've always been one of the better students at math and physics and such. Normally, you would think that a movie like this should appeal to me heavily. I've always loved space travel, whether it's Star Trek, or coming up with my own quirky ideas for science fiction and such.If I recall, the movie was shown one afternoon to 20 or 30 students who were involved in many different things, not simply those steeped in chemistry, etc. The idea wasn't to have us focus on the rocketry plot as much as the simple idea of motivation, to help us follow our dreams and reach beyond ourselves and pursue lofty goals.If I had seen the movie a few years earlier, it probably would have hit me fairly hard on that facet. However, by the time I saw it I was already well-directed in my own life. I had a pretty good idea where I was going. No, for me, the impact came much differently.I've skimmed about 80 of the 290 reviews on here and have only found the love story subplot mentioned twice, wherein it was simply referred to as being worthless or useless in the story. I understand where you're coming from. It's too clich\u00e9, too alike every other movie out there. But so what? If it's true, it's true. Why doesn't it deserve inclusion?In 1998 I fell in love with a girl named Dorothy. For some time she meant the world to me. Eventually, I realized our relationship wasn't going to work out. She ended up getting married in 2003 to another guy. Nevertheless, October Sky had a strong personal impact on me at the time. \"Dorothy\" was the name of the girl in the movie that Homer had his crush on. When the first scenes of the two of them came on in the movie, I couldn't help but put myself in Homer's place. If I remember, the room where I watched the movie had the lights out, but all someone would have had to do was look in my direction to see the bright red glow on my face. On the screen, everything seemed to speak to me personally and my own life. At the time I still hoped things between me and my Dorothy could work out. The movie made me consider more and more my own situation. Everything just seemed so parallel. I wondered, in fact, if someone had purposely shown the movie to see how reacted\u0097who knows, God, or a guardian angel, I don't know.So they fired off rockets. Our characters needed to find where one of the stray rockets had gone, so they used trig and scouted out through a forest until they found the thing. Cool stuff. I've always loved electronics, fuels, and all those nifty things. Eventually, Homer achieved his dream, becoming prominent in the aerospace movement. A new girl came along in the meantime. Did she really fill that void left by Dorothy? Who can say?October Sky was a good movie. While I can't downplay the importance of following your dream and achieving your goals, of research and study and sticking with something that's important; while October Sky was a meal on my journey that has helped motivate me to reach my own dreams in writing and doing some of the most important things in my own life, I can't deny that the more important place it held for me was offering me a strange and sad look at a girl that I loved.So, while some of you will undoubtedly continue to call the \"minor\" love story \"trite,\" \"clich\u00e9,\" \"not crucial to the main drama,\" etc, from my own perspective I would call your attention to the likely fact that Homer H. Hickam Jr. included that \"sub-plot\" for some reason, perhaps because it was important to him and had things not occurred as they did, his life would have been far, far different. Don't completely discount something without taking a deeper look.",

            "content": "Having a dream is normal and that is part of human behavioral science. I always felt that western societies are receptive and children have a freeway in searching and seeking their career path. This film was an eye -opener, that all societies mirror each other with slight differential. Further, it was revelation that your dormant mind dream can trigger with a slight spark. That spark was 'Sputnik 1' circumnavigating miles away in the orbit following its own trajectory. It is an old age tradition that children follow their parental profession. The parents lay the groundwork so that the children do least struggle, as it is a well-scripted route. Therefore, Homer's father was no exception. He prided his profession and earned the respect of his peers, sub-ordinates and management not a normal feat given the circumstance of the terrain he is working (coalmines). Any accomplishment is impossible without a stable schooling supported by enthusiastic teachers who make the student learn (Ms. Freida J. Riley). Childhood friends though having distinct mindsets but helping the crucial purpose (Rocket boys) and of course the society, that inhabits us. Their support system permeates allowing impossible tasks to be within our grasps just by perseverance. Except his father always, the small town people cheered him at each unsuccessful rocket launch. What really moved me was pain portrayed by Father and Son. They both have strong conviction and unable to convince each other. Their love distilled and filtered through the loving and caring wife/mother trying to mend each other to keep her family knitted. After winning, the competition when Snr Hickam taunts that he was unable to recognize even his idol Wernher von Braun (scientist). The reply given was very emotional explaining to his father that he wants to be a good human like him and though Mr. Braun is indisputably a great scientist but he is not his idol. In a very subtle message, he conveyed whom he wants to emulate in life. Father pressing the button for the final rocket launch was the icing that success with effort and pain is worth only with family, friends and society. This real life story teaches us some vital lessons for life. We should be affirmative in want we need in life. Our life circumstances provides us tussle that make us withdrawn in what you need most. We need to change those failures into opportunities and take 'baby steps'. Age should never be a factorial probably everyone can never be as blessed as 'Homer Hickam' but gets closer to your dream.",

            "review_title": "A Movie in Search of Itself",
            "content": "I had an opportunity to watch the DVD of October Sky (Universal, 1999) and came away somewhat disappointed.  I should note that I avoided the movie when it was out in general release for many of the same reasons I waited until now to review it.  From all reports, the story of a 1957 West Virginia high school students experimenting with rockets that subsequently changed their lives seemed laden with the heavy hand of \"individual triumphs over group expectations\" cliche common to these coming-of-age genre pictures.Based on a true story, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the high school student Homer Hickham, an actual person who currently works at NASA on the space shuttle program.  We join the film as the Soviet Union has just launched Sputnik and the radio and television reports are buzzing about the meaning of this technological triumph.At first, Homer and most of his classmates are seemingly non-plussed about the event.  This apparent reason for the lack of interest is that they are all trapped in a coal mining town, with all the property (including the school and everyone's homes) owned by an unnamed conglomerate.  Mentions of the \"company store\" abound throughout the movie.  The \"company\" is represented by Homer's father (Chris Cooper), who manages the local mining operation.West Virginia is painted as a place of unremitting gloom.  The weather alternates between heavy downpours of rain to overcast conditions.  One who has never been to West Virginia would be surprised to learn that the state enjoys occasional sunny days.  It is notable the only clear sky that appears comes during the one night when Homer glances above to see Sputnik flying overhead.  All of a sudden, Homer's future life course is set.The supposedly transforming experience of seeing Sputnik overhead does not ring genuine and the credibility problem for the movie begins here. Although depicted as a 1950s teenager, Gyllenhaal initially comes across as a prototypical 1990s slacker.  As his teacher Miss Reilly (portrayed by Laura Dern) notes, Homer doesn't even like math.Homer soon starts the arduous process of putting together a winning entry for the area science fair.  In doing so, Homer taps two of his friends, played by William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg and he then befriends the class nerd, played by Chris Owen.  Thus the \"Rocket Boys\" (the name of the book the movie adapts) are set.   The boys then enlist the covert assistance of a company welder and a black miner with knowledge of metallurgy (surprisingly, the film does not touch on the race of the miner despite the era) in the process of constructing their craft.Laura Dern appears as Miss Reilly, the teacher who inspired the real Homer Hickham to follow his dreams.  As the teacher, Dern's performance is etched with firm earnestness.  She wants these boys to dream despite their circumstances and, for the most part, she manages to overcome the character's earnest nobility and provide a credible performance.The movie proceeds headlong into a series of setbacks and hairpin plot turns.  Events drive the movie forward, not the characters.  The themes are persistently the same; opposition to the endeavor emerges from the authority figures and then being countered by the determined efforts of the Rocket Boys and their allies.  A scene at the national science fare where the demonstration materials are stolen is typical.  The theft leads to a plea to the community that resolves a United Mine Worker's strike which in turn leads to the replacement materials being delivered right in the nick of time.  It's one of the \"oh, come on\" moments that appear frequently in the film.As the lead, Jake Gyllenhaal spends most of his time trying to find his rhythm.  Chris Owen as the standard-issue school nerd doesn't manage to rise above the stereotype.  Rocket Boy Chad Lindberg manages to blend so effectively into the background that it's difficult to remember his performance.There are some good performances that rise above the material.  In addition to the above mentioned Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, portraying the tough father with a heart of gold, becomes the soul of the movie.  Natalie Canerday as Homer's mom likewise grabs the viewer's attention with the quiet strength of her character as well as the clarity of her voice.  Rocket Boy William Lee Scott (currently featured in \"Pearl Harbor\") stands out from his group through a very subtle and stoic performance.  A scene with Cooper and Scott and their encounter with the boy's abusive stepfather is brief, but is perhaps the most memorable part of the movie.The heavy-handedness of the period costumes, props and music (played loudly at every turn) is unrelenting.  These items can be effective to set an appropriate time and place, but they instead overwhelm the momentum whenever they appear.\"October Sky\" is in large part a roller coaster ride of events.  While the film attempts to be a demonstration of the nobility of youthful spirit, it's focus on incidents and repetition of themes leave the characters with little room to grow and develop.",

I should point out that it's the ONLY school on Earth where your teachers all had PHD's, and several of them wrote our textbooks. Dr. Von Braun lectured at many colleges, but only at ONE high school, mine. Newsweek's cover story in May, 2008 listed the BEST high schools in America. They had 100 schools listed, plus the Elite School List. Number ONE on the Elite list was Stuyvesant, and they said, \"Open Enrollment, BUT requires a VERY stringent Entrance Exam!\". As for the movie, it's a true story, beginning with the launching of Sputnik, the first satellite, and because we were mired in the Cold War, we were extremely jealous of the Russians. \"The Right Stuff\", a movie about OUR space program, had the line, \"Our Germans are better than their Germans!\" History has proven them not only correct, but prescient as well. Bottom line, I really enjoyed this movie. Having seen Jake Gyllenhaal in several other movies, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good he was as a teenager. The pivotal role was played by Laura Dern as a high school teacher who encouraged Jake/Homer to pursue his dream of being a Rocket Scientist. Turns out the real Homer Hickam became one of NASA*s top scientists, and was part of the team that sent Apollo Eleven to the Moon. If you have a chance to see it, please do.

            "content": "I guess the first thing I would say about this film is that it really brought me back to my own childhood as I watched the plot unravel in the theatre. I grew up in the sixties and seventies, in Virginia, but I remember going to West VA in the sixties and the feel that the place had (the poverty, the rusted old cars in the woods, etc.). I could relate to Homer Hickam, Jr. because I used to launch and design model rockets as a kid and in high school one of my idols was Mr. von Braun. I also liked the acting of Mr. Cooper as the father--but I kept expecting him to reach out and hit his son and was surprised when he never did. The home movie clips at the end of the film were excellent! I am now going to go out and read the book \"Rocket Boys.\" My only gripes are minor: Why was the teacher's illness sort of casually tossed into the film (or edited down)? I felt more could have been explained here. Also: I was not alive in the fifties, but from what I know of the region (Southern West VA), it seems the soundtrack could have included more hillbilly music, more country/western in it. I know kids had AM radios that would pick up powerful signals at night back then from far away stations (like in Chicago or Buffalo) that would play more R&B and Rock 'n roll, but leaving out all of the country or gospel or hillbilly music took away some of the regional feel in the film. For instance, you could have included George Jones' song \"White Lightning\" for the scene where the boys get the alcohol from the guy with the still. Or some Patsy Cline could have been mixed in, along with the Elvis and Buddy Holly. These are minor gripes though. The film was very very powerful and I am recommending it to all of my friends.",

Great, great movie.The main criticisms I have read in regards to the movie have been its excessive use of cliches, its predictability, and its sentimentality. However, I think all of them are unwarranted. First off, it's a cliche only when it's handled as such. I don't think any of the elements in the film (particularly the father played so well by Chris Cooper, who deserves an Oscar dammit!) were done in a cliche way. As for it being predictable, it's a true story--I don't know how one could avoid not being predictable. Anyways, predictability in of itself is hardly bad. If it is, then no one should ever see a movie for the second time, since we know what's going to happen. Lastly, people seem to confuse emotionality with sentimentality. Just because people may cry in a movie, it doesn't make the film sentimental. One of the great things about October Sky is its lack of excess fat--this is one lean, mean movie, clocking in at one hour and forty minutes, although the film is very much an epic. This is in contrast to other \"sentimental\" films--like Good Will Hunting, Patch Adams, As Good As It Gets, Titanic (although I love Titanic too)--that go well beyond the two hour limit with little of the story elements that October Sky crams in.",

            "content": "It's a cliche only when it's treated as such. And October Sky prevents these familiar archetypes from going down that route by imbuing them with respect and dignity.There's the class beauty who possesses a genuine interest in rocketry and is just as determined to leave the small town, but does not fully grasp the power she holds over the boy who likes her. There's the housewife who shows how you can hate a person, while maintaining one's love for him. There's the geek who is disliked by others not because of his academic aptitude, but because he lacks the social graces of others--but for him, that's the only way for him to succeed. There's the stuffy principle whose realist attitudes can be swayed when he sees an actual chance of hope being fulfilled. There's the inspirational teacher who is so determined to complete her destiny before it's too late that she walks away from a student in his greatest hour of need. And then there's the hardheaded and apathetic father who demonstrates the possibility that one can be both antagonist and protagonist all at the same time.It's to director Joe Johnston's credit that the film continually rings true when we have seen everything before. Johnston and screenwriter Lewis Colick do not provide any villains in the film because they truly get human behaviour--every questionable deed is given a motivation that allows the audience not to justify it per se, but to at least understand it. Even the abusive, drunken stepfather is included into this description. Such a compassionate view of humanity can hardly be considered a cliche, since it's employed so rarely in cinema.How someone can deride this film on the basis of its supposed cliches, and then prop up Dead Poets' Society, is beyond me. Perhaps Laura Dern could have fleshed out her teacher character more by making a couple celebrity impersonations? I love this movie--the best film of the year thus far. A ten.",

They should at least follow it up with percentages. Is it 10% true? 20%?, 80%? For crying out loud, how true is it?October Sky takes place in a dreary and dying coal-mining town. It's 1957, in a town named Cattlewood, West Virginia. The inspiration for this film is from a moment in history.On October 4th, 1957 the town of Cattlewood's eyes were fixated on the night sky. We see a single point of light that looks like a traveling star moving across space, as the other stars remain stationary. It is the Russian satellite, Sputnik.Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a high school student realizes, after witnessing the historical event, that his goal in life is to build rockets. He has to overcome the standard movie obstacles:1)The angry hardened father who is the coalmine supervisor.2)The police that wrongfully accuse him of causing a major forest fire from one of his test rockets.3)Forced to drop out of school to work in the mines, etc. (\"I'll be Back\")4)The principal (Chris Ellis) is against me.5)Family dilemmas: Mother support = yes (Natalie Canerday), School teacher inspiration = yes (Laura Dern), Father support = no (Chris Cooper), Older brother assistance = no (Scott Thomas), Fellow students and town = no then yes (Remaining cast), Total = ?Miss Riley (Laura Dern) successfully convinces Homer and his three friends that they should enter their rocket into the National Science fair.

I picked it up out of curiosity at the video store knowing it had received good reviews but suspecting it was the kind of conventionally sentimental movie I would find completely resistible.  What a pleasure to find such a strong movie.  Sure, it has a conventional basic premise and traditional plotting and is emotionally manipulative in familiar ways. But its strength is in its details--an appealing cast who seemed to have stepped out of life rather than Tiger Beat or Vanity Fair magazines; a dead-on sense of time and place; a respectful attitude toward all of its multi-dimensional characters; a multi-layered and believable story; sure-footed storytelling and solid cinematic technique. This film stands well above the pack and easily won over this cynic. My roommate, who sneered when I started the cassette, intended to watch something else in his own room but was totally caught up.  Beautifully done move. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Based on the memoir Rocket Boys by Homer H. Hickam Jr., October Sky emerged as one of the most delightful sleepers of 1999--a small miracle of good ol' fashioned movie-making in the cynical, often numbingly trendy Hollywood of the late 20th century. Hickam's true story begins in 1957 with Russia's historic launch of the Sputnik satellite, and while Homer (played with smart idealism by Jake Gyllenhaal) sees Sputnik as his cue to pursue a fascination with rocketry.\nComparisons to \"Stand by Me\" are unavoidable, since \"October Sky\" has a small-town intimacy, a group of close-knit pals and the kind of innocence seldom found on screen these days. What it also has is a predictable trajectory that works against such appealing simplicity. As adapted by Lewis Colick, the screenplay shifts busily among the boys' rocket exploits, Homer's family, conditions at the mine and the influence of a dedicated science teacher (Laura Dern), but each of these subplots plays out in familiar ways.The film watches Homer progress from accidentally blowing a hole in the family's white picket fence, which virtually adjoins the mine, to learning how to make a rocket soar. With the aid of his closest buddies (Chris Owen, William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg), Homer draws on limited local resources for his rocketry experiments. Since this means commandeering metal from railroad tracks and visiting a still for 100-proof rocket fuel, the story has its playful side.\nWhat I especially liked about \"October Sky.\" Even at its most bleak, the film remains hopeful. Colick's screenplay is filled with hope and dreams, and characters who dare to have both. Johnston has corralled an excellent cast to bring this story to life. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as Homer, whose youthful exuberance betrays a maturity way beyond his years. Gyllenhaal's emotional range is incredible, and he says so much with his eyes. All father-son tales need a strong father figure, and \"October Sky\" has one in Chris Cooper. It would be so easy for Cooper to reduce John Hickam to a cliche, yet he brings much depth to the role.but you know there's more going on than meets the eye. Likewise, Laura Dern is so sweet as Miss Riley you almost miss the small touches she brings to her performance. There's hope in her eyes. Homer's friends are all exceptional, while Natalie Canerday shows great strength as Homer's mom. Director Johnston and his technical crew have done a splendid job of evoking time and place. Even though the film was shot in Tennessee, it looks and feels like West Virginia. John Ford would have been proud of this film. Yes, the message and the delivery may be a little sentimental, yet it works in the films favor. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most of all, you'll feel good inside, and if that's a crime, then lock me up!\nOwen, bespectacled and goofy as the stereotypical math geek, suits the film's taste for typecasting as well as its quaintly 1950s look, which calls for studiously modest props and costumes, and for townsfolk who are often Rockwellishly agog.\nIn a film that appreciates the advent of \"Jailhouse Rock\" along with that of Sputnik, \"Ain't That a Shame?\" accompanies a montage of rockets gone kerflooey. A pretty girl is on hand to sigh, \"It sure was exciting watching your rockets go up!\"\nGyllenhaal does seem more like the Columbia University freshman he is than the rural West Virginian he plays. But he brings such sincerity to telling his science teacher that a book called \"Principles of Guided Missile Design\" is the best present he has ever received that his affecting performance is liable to breathe life into science projects everywhere.\nBut more often the film's tone is just right, and the spirit of adventure and invention is infectiously conveyed through Gyllenhaal and his well-cast fellow rocketeers, whose many failures gradually lead to triumph on their makeshift backwoods launching pad. Capturing time and place with impeccable detail and superbly developed characters (including Laura Dern as an inspiring schoolteacher), October Sky is a family film for the ages, encouraging the highest potential of the human spirit while giving viewers a clear view of a bygone era when \"the final frontier\" beckoned to the explorer in all of us.\nI loved this movie. It is one of the few movies that I have consistently recommended to friends to rent and have had all of them thank me for the referral. The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted.\nThis is not just another movie it's the one that inspires you to dream!\"A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities.\" ~ J.R.R.Tolkien",

I spent a rainy Sunday afternoon in Germany with not a lot to do, so I checked out the Pay-Per-View selections, and chose 'October Sky' over 'Tea With Mussolini', which I am still pretty confident was a good idea.We\u00b4ve seen this film before, and it was called 'Hoosiers'.  Or was it \"Rudy\" The same themes exist:  some backwoods youth or youths overcome adversity and do the un-do-able.  The same characters seem to ring in all these movies:  an overbearing father that thinks his kid is a dern fool; an inspiring role model and encourager...  But it was done much better than this in the aforementioned films \"Rudy\", and particularly \"Hoosiers\". \"October\u00b4s\" characters were one dimensional, the dialogue rivalled that of Titanic, and there was not enough detail put into the real rocket-making, in my opinion.  (OK, so I am an engineer... we tend to take the fun out of all science-related movies if they are not fully precise.)But please don\u00b4t think I hated it.  This film would be a perfect one to show to middle school and early high school students.  I would have found it inspiring at that age, especially since I was interested in science and enjoyed blowing things up.  So show this to your kids, they will probably enjoy it, and it is not something anyone would walk out of, although I found myself accidentally changing the channel a couple of times (remember, it was PPV!)  But please don\u00b4t think you\u00b4re about to see Lawrence of Arabia since it is rated in the top 250!",

If this movie speaks to you, and I feel it will to most who see it, regardless of age, you won't watch it... you will live it.  You will experience it.This movie is about relationships.

            "content": "\"October Sky\" derives its title from the crisp, clear night sky often viewed over West Virginia in the waining months of any year.  This particular \"October Sky\" sets the time of the movie as coinciding with the launch of Sputnik -- the first orbiting satellite, which was launched by the Soviet Union.  Because of the technology of the time, the satellite orbited the earth and passed over the United States about every 19-hours.  It could be seen with the naked eye on a clear night, and the wonder of man putting an object into space is keenly opposed to the fear such a device struck in the minds of many citizens during the Cold War.Based on a true story, \"October Sky\" also chronicles the diametrically opposed views of life -- the wonder of a young man who sees his future involved in the vastness of space and the uncertainty thereof, and the concern of his father for his son's future -- determined that it will be solidly anchored in the constant of coal mining (confined space and underground).This film celebrates the wonderment of dreaming and the freedom to both pursue and succeed at that dream.  It is an impremartyr of the human spirit in a world free to overcome restraints.  When you leave the theater, the viewer may feel pleasant contentment that nice guys CAN win.",

            "content": "Growing up in the coal fields of Virginia/West Virginia I was extremely impressed to see a movie that actually took the reality of life and put it on the big screen.  There were no big special effects, none of the \"hollywood glitz and glamour\" or any of those action sequences that leave you wondering what just happened.  The mines sequences were very realistic, and even the death of a miner was portrayed with the perfection.  It was a straight forward, wonderful movie about the life of four young boys growing up in West Virginia. The only problem I had with the film was the casting of Miss Riley as a glamorous blond, instead of the pretty brunette that she was (just look at her when they show the home videos at the end).  Of course, that only bothers me because she's my cousin, no one else in the world really cares.  Overall, the movie was one of those films that drew me in.  It left me wanting more. Although it was under two hours, the movie is well worth the six dollars you would have to pay to see it.  Go out of your way for this one.  It's probably the best of '99 so far.  And don't forget to read the book...it should also be a hit.",

            "content": "A few times a year a truly inspirational film comes out, this is the first of '99. It follows the true story of Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) and his obsession with building rockets to go out into space. His infatuation pulls in his friends and a nerdy social outcast (Owen) and together they all get the nickname \"The Rocket Boys\". Through all the turmoil of trying to break out of their small coal mining hometown these boys prevail. One of the greatest obstacles that Homer had to go through was the views of his own father (Cooper) who thought what Homer wanted was only pipe dreams and that coal mining was going to be his life. This is a true story of overcoming opposition by all this world's forces.Gyllenhaal does a terrific job as our hometown hero. His youthful determination and strength plows through the screen and into your heart. The reality of Homer just makes his efforts in this movie more of an homage to the real man than just another role. Gyllenhaal treats it with the perfect amount of dignity and pride. The other impressive performace came from Cooper in his portrayal of Homer's coal mining father. The sheer hardness of his attitude towards Homer and his dreams matched the very coal he pulled from beneath the ground. He did show some admirable qualities throughout the film which gave the audience just enough reason to not write him off entirely as an uncaring and ignorant hick. Then at the end he opens his character up to the true depth of the love between a father and son.The direction and cinematography of this picture was beautiful throughout in not only its scenes of Homer's exciting rockets but also in the bleakness of life in a coal mining town. Johnston truly captured the harsh and heavy nature of mining life and the effects that it can have on those people and their families. This detailed very well the hard sacrifices that some people have to make in life just to survive.Recommendation: If you are looking for inspiration then look here. You can walk of this movie feeling that whatever it is that you want to do with your life can be done. The fact that this is a true story shows that your own circumstances could be far worse and that anyone can follow their dreams to the end. This type of motivational power hasn't been seen since Rocky.",

But it has a clear storyline, excellent acting, a \"moral\", and some heart-rending realization and growth on the part of the characters.  What impressed me the most was that this was truly a film for an entire family that was not silly, or reliant on special effects.  It appeals on multiple levels.After a day or two thinking about this movie, I realized, what more can you expect from a motion picture?  Not much--which explains the 10 rating.I'm predicting this will be the sleeper hit of 1999.",

Ultimately, however, it is the story of one young man who reaches beyond the stars and succeeds.What keeps it from being  mawkish is the fact that is it grounded in truth and feels like it.",

This is a movie that reminds us all what it's like to have a dream and what it means to have the courage and determination to pursue the dream, as implausable as it may seem.October Sky has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  The story is simple, but beutifully told, well acted, and thought provoking. Many times Appalachia is portrayed as as isolated area with no chance of leaving, of following any dream. October Sky changes all that.  Sometimes, true stories are the best ones that make it to the screen.The realistic portrayal of Appalachian people is one of the film's strongest selling points.  It presents us in a postive, yet realistic light.  All the accents seemed authentic.  None of those dreadful Hollywood accents that reek with magnolia blossoms.  The conflict between father and son, the fear and excitement of leaving home, the bonds of friendship--all of these shine in this movie.  This film has humor, intelligence, drama and emotion. It is well deserving of accolades!",
