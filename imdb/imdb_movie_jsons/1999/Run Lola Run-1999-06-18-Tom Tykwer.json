            "content": "Tom Tykwer's clever \"Run Lola Run\" showed up on cable the other day. We had seen it when it first came out, and frankly, watching it for a second time, it seemed even better than the last time. Mr Tykwer made an excellent impression with this film, which introduced us to this talented director. Having seen \"Heaven\", and \"True\", \"Lola rennt\" is by far a superior effort from Mr. Tykwer.The premise of the film is a clever one. Lola, in twenty minutes, must solve the mystery in which she is drawn into. At each of this situations, Lola shows great resources about how to help her petty criminal boyfriend, who has lost 100,000 DM, and now must account for the missing money.Franka Potente is the main reason why this movie works the way it does. She is almost like the cartoon character one sees in the opening credits. Lola, is larger than life, and shows she can do anything she wants because of her resolve. Ms. Potente brings freshness to the role and she totally captivates the viewer in her no-nonsense approach to life, in general. The supporting cast does good work under Mr. Tykwer's direction.It's a puzzle why Hollywood hasn't made an attempt to remake this film, since the Americans are obsessed with redoing material like \"Run Lola Run\". Let's hope they don't try!",

            "content": "Run Lola Run is a very original film in its premise, it guarantees entertainment to the spectator from beginning to end, the film requires the spectator's full attention and because it is short, I suggest not to pause or divert focus, because I believe this film is made so you get lost between Lola's runs, in the end you end up staying what now? What comes next, and then, unfortunately, the movie ends.One thing I found funny is that Lola never gets tired and doesn't even want to pant, maybe the production should have paid a little attention to this detail since it's the title of the film.I believe it served as the inspiration for The Butterfly Effect (another classic), the plot is not so deep and fails to explain several things, a problem that would not exist if the film were bigger or had a sequel.Despite this, the soundtrack, setting, photography, editing, guarantee the adrenaline and action of the film.",

            "review_title": "Innovative Film That''s Always Fun To Watch",
            "content": "This is one of the more inventive movies of the last decade, I would think. It was new, fresh and very different when it came out in the late '90s and still is unique and enjoyable as of this review in early 2006.It's short - 81 minutes - but plenty long when you consider it's three versions of the same story, each version about 25 minutes after an opening introduction.That may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera-work and interesting angles on the same story. Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior, plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either, depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.Franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the \"Bourne\" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting. The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear. Added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film. The high rating I give this film could really be summed up in two words: DIFFERENT and FUN.",

            "review_title": "An exhilarating, upbeat journey",
            "content": "\"Run Lola Run\" is one of the most fun, involving, stylish movies I've seen in a long time. The suspense is high from the get-go, with Lola's boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn't get 100,000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes, a gangster will kill him. Immediately, Lola sets off running through Berlin in a frantic attempt to locate the money. The fun part is that we see Lola's journey three times with three very different outcomes, determined by little things that happen to Lola as she runs.Lola (the engaging Franka Potente) manages to be both an iconic, super-cool heroine, and a believable young woman who just wants to get her boyfriend out of trouble. IMDb ratings show that this is the rare action movie that appeals to girls more than to guys, probably because Lola is such a strong character. This is exhilarating film-making, with a propulsive soundtrack, a fast pace, and many flashy effects like animated and black-and-white sequences--in addition to the most stunning use of split-screen that I've ever seen. Incredibly for such a young director, these techniques are employed with great assurance. I also like how although the film is \"hip\" and sometimes amused by the crazy things that happen to people, it's never cynical. Instead, there's a sweet optimism to it, a faith in karma and love.Occasionally, \"Run Lola Run\" is a bit too clever for its own good. The rapid-fire montages that show the fates of minor characters are superficially amusing, but unnecessarily hammer home the theme that \"little things can have a huge effect on a person's life.\" However, the movie's philosophies are still ambiguous enough that there's a lot to think about when it's over. Furthermore, \"Run Lola Run\" is an extraordinarily good time; it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen whenever Lola's on it.",

            "content": "The concepts are simple. How do our actions affect our own lives, as well as those whom we touch? What part do chance and random events play in determining an outcome? Can we select a different result by making different choices? In short, what is reality? Well, maybe it isn't all that simple, but while others have plowed these same fertile fields, as recently as the film \"Go\", and also in \"The Music of Chance\", based on Paul Auster's novel, no one has dealt with such cosmic existential questions with more brilliant originality, fast paced action, and a pulsing score than in this German cinematic masterpiece.In a compact ninety minutes, combining snips of animation, cinema verit\u00e9, quirky characters, situations and dialogue, and a pace that makes most music videos look like they've been filmed in slow motion, three versions of the same story sequence unfold, and each time conclude with a jolting finish that defies convention, and keeps the viewer guessing until the final frame.This is one of those rare cinematic events that is entertaining, satisfying, and absorbing, as well as flawlessly acted, staged, edited, produced and directed. I thought that Lola ran her race with flair and style, and left all others way behind in the dust.",

            "content": "I have seen the movie several times, and each time I find new details and nuances that add to the story and the movies as an audiovisual delight. Friends of mine introduced me to the sound track at first on a high quality stereo system. It was amazing. I went home and ordered the CD. I am no great fan of techno music but that first track made me hold my breath because of its beauty. It felt like sitting in a cathedral and listening to a simple choral. I know, awkward comparison, but...A few observations of my own. Lola's first \"run\" reveals that her father believes she is not his biological daughter, calls her a \"cuckoos egg\". And it's quite possible, since we see her mom in all 3 \"runs\" talking on the phone with someone other than her husband. Lola is devastated. All three \"runs\" feature the bank security guard, trying to calm down Lola, giving her support. Every time they have intense eye contact, some silent understanding. He once even greets her with \"Da bist du ja, Liebling\" (\"there you are, darling\"). Quite strange for a bank employee to call his boss' daughter that, don't you think? We also see early on that he might have a heart condition. In the last story segment, we see the guard again, in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Lola caught a ride, for a change, to her meeting destination with Manni. Miraculously, the guard's heart condition improves as his hand reaches toward Lola's. The medic, at first annoyed (\"what the heck are you doing here?\") is puzzled. Lola's answer to his question, as she reaches for the guard's hand is: \"Ich gehoer zu ihm.\" Very important, I think. Call me silly, but somehow I have this feeling that he might be her illegitimate father. As bank employee he might well have had contact with Lola's mother, and even time to have an affair with her, considering the workaholic dad being gone so much. \"Ich gehoer zu ihm\" is badly translated in the subtitles as \"I'll stay with him\" while the German would better translate into \"I belong to him.\" And that is something Lola could well have realized after her dad abandoned her with the accusation of being a cuckoo's egg. The guard is also in the beginning of the movie quoting famous soccer coach Sepp Herberger's \"the ball is round\". It's in the league with Yogi Berra's famous word creations. The ball is round meant for Herberger, that anything can happen as long as the game is on. Expect the unexpected. Since this is a movie that wants the viewer to \"think\" about possibilities, why not go all the way?",

            "review_title": "Right place at the wrong time or wrong place at the right time?",
            "content": "The film has an unusual format in that it presents three versions of a twenty-minute episode. But unlike Kurosawa's RASHOMON these are not different perspectives of the same incident by different eyes. Instead it offers 'It could have been this way, but for\u0085. or if only\u0085' scenarios. The film thus attempts to define what people loosely refer to as the luck factor. Luck, the film tries to say is being at the right place at the right time or even the wrong place at the wrong time. Or it could be the right place at the wrong time, or is it the wrong place at the right time. It is this clever scripting around the space-time permutation, that makes this film such a delight to watch. The scenario, in which the young lovers emerge triumphant and richer, makes out a strong case for being proactive and for taking risk. It is also amusing to see how wrong conclusions can be drawn from partial information. But the film offers more than an interesting case study for management students.  Cinema buffs would notice that time compression, which is so common in film idiom is not resorted to\u0085. the action is nearly in true time. The quicksilver editing and the pulsating background score embellish Lola's running and make sure that the repetitions do not get jarring. The film is an unalloyed delight to the mind and the senses.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run is a riveting, heart (and pavement) pounding epic choose-your-own-adventure.  Written and directed by Tom Tykwer, Run Lola Run is the story of a girl, Lola, who receives a panicked phone call from her longtime boyfriend, Manni.  Manni owes a mobster 100,000 marks and doesn't know what to do.  Lola, desperate to save his life, reassures him that she can get the money to him by noon, when he must meet the mobster (that means, she has twenty minutes), or else Manni would rob a grocery store.  From that moment on, the movie takes us through three stories of Lola's trials trying to get Manni's money in 20 minutes - and with every person she comes into contact with, their lives take on completely different forms, as shown by 30-second photo flash montages.  On an originality scale, this film ranks a ten.  Franka Potente, the actress that portrays our flame-haired heroine, does an exceptional job.  From the first frame the film plunges into action and adventure with breakneck speed, and we find ourselves cheering for Lola right to the end.",

The job was just to deliver a bag of money to him with 100000 DM which roughly translates to $20000 or $25000 US. Unfortunatly Manni leaves the money on a train and is totally screwed unless he can get the money back in 20 minutes. So he calls his girlfriend, Lola (and no, she is not the girl from The Fifth Element), for help. From here the film follows Lola choosing three paths, each going for 20 minutes, to getting the money for Manni.\nRun Lola Run is a wonderful study of how life consists of the paths we take. Some say there is no right and wrong paths to take in life, but Run Lola Run seems to illustrate that the right path is the best. Franka Potente (Lola) does a wonderful job and must have lost about 10 pounds for all the running she does in this film. But the real star here is Tom Tykwer (the director), who vison for this film is so fantastic and cool.In terms of coolness, this has to be one of the coolest movies ever made. It contains black and white camera, animation, three or four different types of slow motion, fast motion and the most amazing still shots taken for a film which is enough to keep anyone interested. Plus this film is only 80 minutes long, but luckily it feels about 20 minutes longer than that.\nAfter being one of the most talked about films of 1998, I would safely say that Run Lola Run has inspired a large number of film makers. Run Lola Run is a modern masterpiece and should pave the way for the future of films.",

            "review_title": "One of the best circular narratives!",
            "content": "This modern German film from 1999,that was so stunning and brilliantly edited won many awards at the Sundance Film Festival. The audience was taken away on this fast pace exhilarating ride which in turn warrants those watching to think about the circular narrative and its elements. All elements of the film including soundtrack and opening credits are incorporated into this them of a story being told through three different threads and three different experiences. The opening credits are displayed in cartoon form, as well as some of the traveling/running that Lola (Franka Potente) does through out the film. The soundtrack fills the film with a fast paced feeling and adds to the heart-pumping adrenalin rush that element of limited time creates. Fast camera angles, the use of panning, the incorporation of cartoons, the use of outdoor scenery ( no sound stage used), and close face shots are some of the main filming techniques used to make what I can only describe as an MTV video style of film making. The use of high speed camera shows areas of the plot that remains constant while the hi 8 camera is used in portions of the plot that changes in each of the 3 episodes. Also the use of red tinting shows a difference from real life and inside the characters thoughts. The audience is placed into the middle of the plot, there is no real introduction to the main characters, Lola and Manni, ( Moritz Bleibtreu) until after the main crisis of a loss of a bag filled of money that is suppose to be in the hands of a crook/ gangster with in the next 20 min from the time of the main character's conversation. This discussion is repeated 3 times until the characters successfully complete the task that lays before them. They either have to produce a replacement bag of money, or find the missing sack. In each of the 3 episodes the same characters are present as well as the same events but they either are incorporated or interact differently. For example, each episode has glass shattering. If the red ambulance does not crash through glass that is being carried across a main highway, then glass is broken by Lola screaming. Each episode also has elements of time, breaking of time, the different use of fire arm, running, and the use of the same script by the characters. The episodes are broken apart by either Manni or Lola dying, and in these deaths the audience is brought into the head of the characters to where they talk of love, life, death and loss. The audience is shown a place where the characters have a choice, which in turn is how they can relive the same morning events. This allows the audience to discover new interactions amongst the characters, discover new pieces of each story and how fit into one overall tapestry of a day in the characters lives. This film grabs the audience from the very beginning and proceeds to take them on an intense ride filled with lows and highs. One that can be watched over and over again due to the lack of information or images that is constantly being discovered. The complex and layered tale that unfolds in Run Lola Run is amazingly and almost unbelievably made better through the editing, film footage style, and soundtrack. The unusually dramatic images and different style than other films of the latter 90's sets Run Lola Run in a class of it's own",

            "content": "People seem to get to easily impressed by films these days. No, I'm not a grouch, and I did like this film. Quite a bit actually, even though I'd basically seen the same film a few years ago: D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner, an HK film, predates Lola and is quite similar for the running throughout the film to live/save life etcetera aspect. Not to mention films like Flirt which deal with the same roles in different situations or Sliding Doors with the 'what if...?' aspect.So this film, though interesting, was hardly new. It takes ideas already seen and twists them just a little bit. But it lacks the characterization and plot that made those other films so interesting. We learn very little about Lola, just a few snippets from her encounters with her 'father' and the bed sequences with her boyfriend, who we learn even less about. And the plot is all about cinematography and film style, there's little essence to it. In other words, it's eye candy and little more.What that means is that we see great colour with little flavour. Experimentation with technique and style, sometimes it works other times it gets quite sloppy, and not enough attention to fine detail or story. (the cartoon part is cool though). And I would have liked a less Hollywood ending from a film that tries so hard to be contemporary and non-Hollywood.Overall: Fun to watch. Some of the experimentation really worked. It's hardly a classic though, not even a terribly solid film. But it's interesting, and doesn't drag *too* much. I almost gave it a 6 but relented and instead give it a 7/10.",

            "content": "On his way to the drop-off, Lola's boyfriend Manni loses a bag containing 100,000 marks, belonging to the local gang, on the subway. Desperate and exasperated he calls up his girlfriend from a phonebooth and she is determined to help him \u0096 and now Lola has 20 minutes to run, find the money, and deliver them to Manni before he robs the convenience store.There are precious few films to which I award the perfect 10/10 \u0096 and \"Lola Rennt\" (1998) is one of them. I think German director Tykwer has done something really cool here to fit our fast-paced generation; he has tailored the perfect adrenaline-pumping ride, filled it with interesting characters, philosophical notions and overdoses of flair and fury. Sure, it's mostly style when you think about it, but it fits the concept \u0096 it's simple and totally brilliant. The film has Lola (an energetic Franka Potente) run across the city, bumping into strangers, falling prey to detours and diversions \u0096 such as the typical huge sheet of glass plate carried by construction workers, the group of nuns, the woman with a baby carriage \u0096 but always keeping her focus on the task at hand. She loves Manny, and she WILL help him. This way, Lola is an extremely likable heroine. So does she succeed? Well, the film reaches its culmination alright \u0096 three times. As Lola makes her way to Manni for the first time, it pauses, interjects a meaningful flashback, rewinds and starts all over again, zooming back to when Lola received the call from Manni. Each time her journey is different from the last, fantastically navigating the \"what ifs\" and \"should have, could have, would haves\" of the situation. Sometimes her journey is subtly different \u0096 the smallest thing, the butterfly effect, giving rise to some changes in pace and sometimes it brings about a new scenario altogether. This part is so exquisitely well-crafted that if you study the background elements you will find differing details such as the position of the train in relation to Lola in the beginning, the careful timing of vehicles and the fated movements of the people she encounters \u0096 it's a meticulous piece of film-making.For all its subtlety in craft and setting, Lola Rennt is first and foremost a very vibrant and alive film \u0096 and dare I say \u0096 very in-your-face. I really can't stress this enough. This vibrancy manifests itself in the hectic adrenaline-boosting pace of the run, the vivid colourizations, Franka Potente's flaming red hair and high-pitched screams and the fast-beating techno music that plays furiously in the background. It is so fast and alive in fact, that once a pause is inserted it becomes both poignant and welcomed, giving depth to the story by exploring Lola and Manni's love (in the flashback between the journeys). Aside from the cartoon device (in which the live-action cuts to a poorly-sketched cartoon figure of Lola) which I felt was redundant in an already interesting film, Lola Rennt really is a lesson in style (that Tony Scott could benefit from taking, by the way). Tykwer goes all the way here \u0096 especially for the third journey which is more aggressive and determined, and the result is something glorious that easily makes my top 20 films list.10 out of 10",

Manni (Bleibtreu) frantically calls Lola (Potente), who has the wildest color red hair in history. She was supposed to pick him up but didn't arrive in time. Because of that, Manni had to take the subway and lost the 20,000 marks he picked up to bring to a mobster. He has twenty minutes to replace it or it's curtains. If Lola can't help him, he's going to rob a nearby grocery store.Lola starts running. On the way, she stops at the bank where her father works. She finds her father with another woman, who has just told her father that she is pregnant. Dad tells Lola that he's not coming home ever again, and he doesn't give her any money. Lola keeps running.Director/writer Tom Tykwer has taken up the question -- is our fate always the same, despite the decisions we make? Or do the decisions we make shape what happens to us? How much is fate, how much can we control? The film goes on to show three twenty-minute sequences of Lola running and, depending upon what she decides to do, depending on whether her timing is just right or a little off to reach Manni, different things happen that decide the ending. The sequences are done in real time, not compressed as many films are.Underneath Lola's running is this amazing rhythmic beat written by Tykwer and two others - \"Running One,\" \"Running Two,\" and \"Running Three.\" It is fabulous.This is an exciting, suspenseful, compelling film, one of the best ever. Potente doesn't get to do much but run. The poor woman could not wash her hair for seven weeks of filming because if she did, the insane color would fade. A wig might have been a good investment. Bleibtreu has the emotional role, and he's excellent. Both of them have the youthful energy necessary for such a thrilling movie.See it! It's great. And that rhythm is hypnotic.",

The script is quite unique: a straightforward narrative told in three parallel timelines, with minor differences that create butterfly effects. The brilliance here is that the story is extremely catchy and entertaining on a surface level, yet allows for plenty of deeper meaning about cause-and-effect, existentialism, and destiny. The acting excellently unites this combination of excitement and depth by bringing ample doses of urgency and emotion. Specifically, Franka Potente (Lola) is an absolute force as she sprints, screams, and takes control.Still, the true gems of Run Lola Run are in its filmmaking. The movie is blazing because its camerawork is exhaustive (using overheads, arcs, and radical movements), its soundtrack is rhythmic, and its editing is utterly electric. Run Lola Run especially optimizes the editing medium with jump cuts, inserts, and longer emotional takes. Plus, effects have variety, sound is surreal, and production includes symbolism. Overall, Run Lola Run is a potent shot of adrenalin that will thrust viewers to the edge of their seats and leave them with food for thought.

            "content": "In his last feature, WINTERSLEEPERS, Tom Twyker constantly undermined the ostensible romantic tragi-comedy with grand Teutonic intimations of controlling Fate and Nature.  Twyker laudably abandons any notions of naturalism, realism, plausibility, drama or character here in a film which raises formal gamesmanship to a remarkably populist level.  I bet Hal Hartley's kicking himself.Everything a mainstream movie is supposed to have is denied here - linear plot, resolution, character motivation etc.  The film's flagrant artifice is not just signalled formally, we're told so, by a couple of gloriously pretentious epigraphs, and by one of the characters himself, who blows the whistle and kicks the ball to start.  At no point does Twyker indulge in illusionism - the film is a textbook in Brechtian alienation: cartoons; jump cuts; the idea that every plot we see is just the TV programme Lola's mother watches; implausible situations, coincidences, chance; elastic time etc. There can be no tension and drama because we know the director has stacked everything against us and Lola, and can pull any rabbit he likes out of the hat and does (which makes a mockery of those critic who see the film as dramatising the freedom of computer games or DVD).And yet we ARE thrilled with the drama and tension.  Because cinema has never been about character in the novelistic sense.  Syd Field may be discredited now, but he was right about one thing: action is character. We don't need to know anything about Lola's backstory - the geometric fact that she has a goal is enough.  We positively beg Twyker to wipe out the last story as a mistake, and begin again.  It is cinema's urge towards denying death, because death=inaction=The End.  And still Twyker even denies us this - death IS the film's motor, it causes it to keep going; success and reconciliation lead to inertia, alienation and finish.So what does it all mean?  Without in any way overestimating Twyker's artistic worth, LOLA bears many similarities to the works of Vladimir Nabokov, with its playfully sadistic master of ceremonies (author/director) constructing an elaborate labyrinth, letting his hapless creation loose in it.  There is something cruelly godlike in this, and the film's dilemmas ARE existential.  Twyker mocks Lola throughout, constantly emphasising the circularity of her quest; fast-forwarding and affirming others' futures while she is trapped so lethally in the present, her future oppressively to be created by her.The inverting of life and death, however, are only possible through art, and this is where the film's melancholy lies.  Twyker has justifiably lost faith in cinema as a medium of observing, revealing and experiencing reality. Nabokov can take his traumatised professor in 'Bend Sinister', and give him the saving grace of madness - those actually living in Russia weren't so fortunate.  We usually only get one choice, and we're stuck with the one we make.  In this light, the film does work on an emotional level.  Despite the variations on Lola's plot, things remian desperately similar in its context. Are we really that important, or, like Mannie, do we fear we'll be forgotten as soon as we're dead.  This isn't IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, where one life is inseperably bound up with the happiness of others.There is progress.  It may be misogyistic of the film to suggest that all Lola's seeming mobility is useless, that it's only when Mannie takes control that danger can be averted.  The other viewpoint is thast Lola working on her own resulted in despair and death, but once Mannie starts doing his bit, and the two work in tandem, that resolution becomes a possibility.  Isn't Mannie's flip relief at the end of the third story so brilliant, so true?Each story, for all their technical inhumanity, has masterpiece flashes of human comedy, largely focusing of Lola's gleefully unpleasant dad.  This is the ultimate film of late urban capitalism, where mobility is a Maxwell's Demon overloading in information, yet hurtling towards inertia, where a life is worth as little as a craps risk and a clock.  While critical comparisons with Godard and Fassbinder only reveal how standards have declined in arthouse cinema; and the danger of monotony isn't always averted, the surprise of LOLA is that a film so light and polayful, so impatient with angst and death, should have been made by a German.",

Lola has 20 min to raise this amount and meet Manny. Otherwise, he will rob a store to get the money. Three different stories may happen depending on some minor event along Lola's run. With this simple plot, but a great imagination, screen player and director Tom Tykwer gave us an excellent and frantic movie. There is no way that the viewer does not like it. This theme (the same story been repeated in time in a different way) has been already approached at least in '12:01', an excellent Sci-Fi action movie (1993) with Jonathan Silver and Helen Slater. In 'Groundhog Day', a movie also from 1993, where the characters are trapped in time and it is a romantic comedy. 'Sliding Doors' is a beautiful dramatic romance of 1998, where is shown the two possible lives of Gwyneth Paltrow character depending on getting (or not) a train. But in 'Run Lola, Run', the viewer will find almost a video-clip in high-speed, with some cartoons, with rave music and lots of action. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Corra Lola Corra\" (\"Run Lola Run\")",

            "content": "Tom Tykwer has truly proven himself as the filmmaker to watch. The little known German director has produced a modern-day masterpiece; a dazzling technical film about how life consists of the decisions we make.Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. (Moritz Bleibtreii) Manni accidentally leaves a bag carrying $100 000 on a train, which is picked up by a homeless man. This leaves Manni in quite a predicament. He is supposed to deliver the money to a gangster by noon, if he fails, then he is likely to be killed. Lola has twenty- minutes to save his boyfriend. Twenty short minutes to somehow find the money and get it to him.Run Lola Run is a film you expect to see at a Independent film festival, or in a Professor's office at a film school. In no way do I mean that in a negative way, I mean not to intend that the film is of a lower standard with lower production values, rather that the film is a beautifully mastered technical film that uses every filmmaking technique in the book. It is refreshing to see a film like this in the midst of the commercialised, dry-cut, 'traditional' filmmaking that we see on the silver screen so regularly.As stated before, the film attempts to use a wide range of filmmaking techniques to help get the director's meaning and vision across to the audience. Some of these include speed-up, instant replay, black and white, and even animation in some parts.It may sound strange, but the film is twenty-minutes long. Well, not really, but it is in context. Tykwer focuses on the twenty-minutes that Lola has, and shows that twenty-minutes three times over, each time with small differences will affect the outcome of the characters. The danger with this kind of technique is that it can threaten to be repetitive. However, the new additions added by Tykwer are very clever and link in perfectly, which will have you gasping for more.Tykwer wrote and directed this film, and while doing this, he never lost sight of his meaning. His meaning that he is trying to express is that life consists of the decisions we make. While watching the film, this becomes increasingly evident. He also likes to emphasise that time is against Lola during the film. This can be seen when a young woman walks past and Lola asks her for the time, the next shot shows a much older woman answering her question, hence showing the importance of time.Franka Potente gave a good performance as Lola. Yet, it is hard to say that she was fantastic, because it is a role that requires a great deal of physical acting and we didn't get to know a lot about Lola, hence the film wasn't overly-focusing on her issues, rather her boyfriend's problem. The real standout performance from my point of view came from Moritz Bleibtreii. He actually took on a quite challenging role and pulls it off successfully. He achieves his objective of getting the audience to feel sympathy for the position that he is in.Run Lola Run is without a doubt, one of the best technical films ever made. A profound, exciting, new age masterpiece that has well and truly left its mark on the film industry.Five out of Five.",

The film was 80 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it. Franka Potente's first film I've seen was The Bourne Identity, second: The Bourne Supremacy and the third was Creep. So I looked forward to Run Lola Run and the three main things that made me inspired to the film was:1: That the film has been rated #164 of the top 250 IMDb movies & got 25 awards.2. Franka Potente plays Lola & she is one of my favourite actresses.3. One of The Simpson's episodes that I have seen before Run Lola Run is inspired from the film its called Trilogy of Error but it's slightly different it has three stories told one after the other all happening at the same time. **SPOILERS START HERE** While I was watching the movie it was a bit confusing when the whole story was repeated for the second time and then the third in all different ways & the question was that which is the real ending? But I managed to understand that the fate changes by the choices you make. In the first two perspectives of the story they both realised that if one of them died then they will know how much they love each other but in the third one was successful Manni got the money from the tramp and Lola got money without committing a crime so Manni got away from his boss plus Lola has the money to herself but she did not seem happy and Manni attention was on the money. So basically it's like a video game if you fail you try again. **END OF SPOILERS**The only complain is that Lola is too good for Manni that guy looks like a shaved goofy monkey. Otherwise this film is a perfect thriller and I gave it a perfect 10/10 because it deserves it.",

The concept of choices (timed choices at that) is interesting enough, but enough MTV power is thrown on the screen to make that point a secondary tool--if necessary.It's startling to think this was made on a $2 million budget, it doesn't look that way.  As opposed to Tarantino, whose work always looks cheap, this has an exhilarating sense of motion and style to it.  Plus there is the addition of seeing every event a different way each time, a detail I love watching.This is a technical film, better than others in its class, but a technical film nonetheless.  It's made for the sole purpose of flaunting style.  Most of the style is from MTV, but I appreciate that kind of honesty compared to the ripoff duo: Wachowski bros.  Other \"technical\" films include 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Strange Days', 'True Lies', and 'Star Wars'.Technical films rely on stripping down plot elements to a minimum in order to showcase the effects.  Since their are no \"effects\" in the traditional sense here other than animation, camera tricks, split-screen, and other optical or editing tricks, the film is extremely focused.  In that sense you can place 'Lola' next to '3 Kings' and notice many similarities.  Since it's so refined and simple, a plethora of tricks can be implemented without damaging the story.Perhaps the most unique element is the \"reset\" function.  Hollywood should learn how to utilize it because such an option makes this far superior to Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, or Mario Bros.

It is 11.40 a.m. and Manni who is into smuggling diamonds across Eastern European borders has to turn over 100.000 DM at 12 o'clock sharp to Ronni, a 'gangster' par excellence, who would kill anyone for stealing a bottle of beer from him.Unfortunately, Manni forgot the money in the tram and is now more desperate than ever. He calls the one person who has always taken care of him: the love of his life, Lola. She asks Manni to wait for her as he is going to rob the 100.000 DM from one the shops in town as he knows that turning up at Ronni's without the money would be his immediate death. Lola starts running immediately thinking of a million different ways how to help the man who is the most important person in her life and she runs and runs.....The quality of cuts and camera shots, innovative techniques at the top of modern filming practically unknown to German viewers up to now will hopefully make 'Lola rennt' a blockbuster in the cinemas as it fully deserves it.Like 'Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin' (City of Angels', Ryan, Cage') and 'Bandits' this film is surely to be copied by Hollywood. A symbol of the emerging new strength and innovative qualities of German film-making. You HAVE to see it :)) The world-premier screening on 15th August, Cologne, Germany at the chocolate-museum Open-Air-Cinema had a 1,000-strong audience screaming and laughing, breaking into applause on several scenes as the story unfolded.

Lola has 20 minutes to raise the money and get it to Manni.  However there is no room for error and her decisions are life or death.I, like everyone else, had heard this film's reputation long before I got round to seeing it and didn't need to be encouraged to see it when it came onto network tv.  I didn't know the detail of the film and I had an open mind but I did expect it to be worthy of the praise garnered on it.  Sadly the film disappoints on almost every level except one \u0096 style.  Visually the film is energetic, with running and a race against time being the key and a pumping techno style soundtrack the film shamelessly goes after the youth market \u0096 and gets it.  The mix of cartoon and live action sequences is not well done but adds to the (false) impression that this is something new and daring.  Even with the constant fast cuts edits and visual tricks I still wasn't drawn in by the action, it is all quite flat and lifeless \u0096 vans drive through plate glass for no other reason than to allow a slowmo shot of breaking glass etc.A big reason the action fails is the total lack of characters.  With almost no development I couldn't get into any of the characters and could not care about them \u0096 they were merely dolls that the director took delight in throwing around as part of his visual melee.  The plot itself is also pretty weak \u0096 it makes me laugh to hear it described on these pages as daring or fresh \u0096 it is merely an old chestnut twisted to be 3 or 4 different version of the same old chestnut.  The twists and turns are simply absurd and the film doesn't even try to explain them \u0096 excusing them as merely part of the hyper-kinetic film being delivered!Potente tries hard as Lola and is pretty good looking running around in her small vest.  I imagine the ability to shift posters of her in this film to student bedrooms around the world has helped this film no end.  Bleibtreu's is a non-character and his plight stems from his own stupidity.  Support characters are non existent and exist only to be a plot driver to allow things to happen.Overall this is not an awful film just a hollow and pointless one.  Style is important in any film and sometimes style can cover the weaknesses in substance, however here the substance has no weakness \u0096 it is a black hole filled by fancy editing, split screens and other such tricks.  Characters are nowhere to be seen, genuine tension or excitement has left the building and the plot is a very simple set up which tries to hide it's ordinariness behind the time jumping gimmick.  I honestly cannot believe that this is in the top 100 at the time of writing and I will continue to read other reviews and listen to other opinions in an effort to understand how anyone could consider this anything other than flashy nonsense which is forgotten before the end credits roll.",

Franca Potente is good as Lola, a young woman who receives a frenetic phone call and takes three different journeys , all controlled by fate . The screenplay comes roaring and is then repeated with various outcomes based on small changes in Lola's way with different style to match . This film contains about 1581 transitions (edits, dissolves, fades, wipes, etc) in 71 minutes of action (i.e. excluding the credits, and pre-credits sequence). This equates to an Average Shot Length of about 2.7 seconds. Interestingly, the editing is relatively slower towards the end of the film , for most contemporary films, the opposite is the norm. There are many spirals in the film (stair cases, bar behind phone booth etc) , this is because director Tom Tykwer was a fan of 'Alfred Hitchcock''s V\u00e9rtigo . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Frank Grieve who subsequently had an excellent international career , the colors red (Lola's hair, numerous cars, telephone) and yellow (the phone box, supermarket, tram) appear very often in the film, these colors were selected by the cameraman and director to signify danger , the reds are mainly in Lola's scenes and yellows in Manni's . This is Tom Tykwer's first international breakthrough and was a hit with both audiences and critics alike. Tom's energetic style helps push this exciting and brilliant thriller . The film garnered many awards and was the most successful German film of the year. Subsequent projects filmed in creative manner and technically developed by Tykwer include the followings : The princess and the warrior (2000) ,Heaven (2002), the successful The perfume (2006), The International (2009) and the ambitious epic Cloud Atlas (2012).",

It can be interesting for viewers who haven't seen a lot of films done in this manner, but has a way of cheating the person invested in a specific outcome, whether good, bad or indifferent. It's the same with the cuckoo bird cited in my summary line, which was a quote from Lola's (Franka Potente) father in the first segment when he ushered her out of the building. The female cuckoo will deposit her eggs in the nests of other birds so she doesn't have to tend to them herself. Good strategy for cuckoo's, not so good for humans.For whatever reason, probably in an attempt to provide another novel approach to this project, the director inserts additional scenarios in which ancillary characters are fast forwarded to their ultimate destiny as a result of being 'touched' by Lola during her sprint. These have no effect on any of the potential outcomes to the story, nor do the dreamlike visions of Lola and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) while on the verge of death following the first two chapters. Oh yes, and there's also the animated patches spliced in as Lola starts her heroic runs, another concession to novelty that comes at you rather unexpectedly.Even with my criticism, this isn't a bad film by any means. Actually it's rather entertaining and clips along rather swiftly in it's hour and a half run time and you could probably do worse. Just be prepared to watch a film with no definitive conclusion unless you provide it for yourself. For my money, I'd go with the last reel, and if I was Lola, I'd dump Manni and keep the hundred thousand marks for myself.",

By today's standards, it's still being a very original movie but nothing that comes across as anything revolutionary. But you perhaps more need to put this movie and its perspective and go back to 1998 to see and realize how revolutionary and fresh this movie was at the time that it got made at.The storytelling and its overall style is the main reason why this movie works out and why it's also such a refreshing one. You could say that it's visual style, with its camera-work and editing, inspired many later movies, especially within the action genre, even though this movie by itself is not an action movie.It's a fast paced movie, that yet feels a lot longer than its 81 minutes. It's because this movie has 3 stories, with each a beginning, a middle and an end to it. These 3 stories however are also all about the same. Basically it's 3 times the same story, each with some minor difference to it, that eventually change the outcome of the story. It doesn't always feel very natural how one small thing can change the faith and outcome of certain people and events but it at least is fun to watch all.The movie also did another thing; it launched Franka Potente's career. And really, she also is the heart and soul of this movie and mostly has to carry the movie on her own. She did a great job with all of it and her performance is worthy of all the praise.A very refreshing and even revolutionary German movie, that helped to change cinema.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Maybe it's just me, but I don't visualize this movie beside \"Casablanca\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" in movie history.Just like \"El Mariachi\" this is another import/experimental action flick in which style (massively) outweighs substance.  This is one of those movies I would've been impressed with if it were entered as a student film.  Its visual style is the kind you would spot in a student film, and I would give it top honors if it were submitted as a project of an amateur filmmaker. But when you view it as part of mainstream cinema...it's far from impressive.The lightning-fast pacing and sequence of events is reminiscent of Doug Liman's \"Go,\" but that film--though a bit cheesy--enabled us to get to know the characters.  In \"Run Lola Run\" the characters are no more than players in a video game.  The film's use of split screens and other techniques is fun at first, but just like the original \"Thomas Crown Affair\" it causes it to wear out its welcome.  The makers of this film were just trying too damn hard!  Constantly bombarding us with gratuitous visuals, as if this whole film would crumble to pieces if the audience were to get bored for one split second.  And why was Lola running?  I guess...because it looks better on screen!  Sure, being a guy, I love to see the beautiful Franka Potente running around the sidewalks in a low-cut top.  I've never traveled to Germany, but I'm sure she could've been able to find some sort of transportation!  It's elements like that which cause you to ponder, \"Why is the filmmaker trying so hard???\"  There are visuals in this movie that have little or nothing to do with the scenes they're placed in.  That's not stunning; that's what you call \"pretentious.\"I have to admit that the soundtrack is excellent.  That's one of the things I liked most about the film.  And I can't say there's an actual \"dull\" moment--tiresome, sometimes, but never dull.  \"Run Lola Run\" seems like what would happen if the editors of a film were to leave their 5-year-old sons or daughters in the editing room by themselves and permitted them to play around with the different devices and have as much fun as they want.  A film of this kind would've been better off as a video game.  A motion picture should at least require plot and/or characters.  If neither are present, what do you have?Exactly...\"Run Lola Run.\"  Not a movie, an experiment.  A great technical exercise, but barely a motion picture.My score:  5 (out of 10)",

            "content": "Lola rennt or Run Lola Run as we say it, is a German thriller written and directed by Tom Tykwer. This Film will contrast your emotions as it shows you how one little event in somebody's life can change there's, and other peoples lives forever. This rollercoaster ride of emotions will keep you gripped all the way through as it jumps from soft, dimly lit emotional scenes, to the completely contrasting scenes of running and constant action. The music used in this film complements the scenes very well, when it's a slow scene our ears are graced with soft classical music like when Lola is falling to the ground in a slow motion shot. The complete opposite of this is used in the fast paced running scenes, as we get pounded by constant techno beats. I believe that the director has used techno to try and get us inside Lola's head as she is running and stressing about Manni and all the other events that happen throughout this amazing film. Lola's Determination to save her boyfriend Manni is very well projected as she enters the bank that her father runs, and throughout the three different versions of the story uses different techniques to try and save him. This involvement with the characters and the three different storylines is very unique to this style of film. I think that the actors have delivered a very memorable and exciting performance which will leave viewers wanting to watch the film over and over again.I think that this director has used this style of film very well, he is one of this first to successfully use this style and create a very interesting and exciting film. This film is almost the only one of its kind, other than the film 'Sliding Doors' but even in that the character is living two parallel lives but in this film it is replayed over again. This film used interesting techniques that I had never seen in a film before. I think that the snapshots into the peoples lives gave you a good view of how one little event can change your life forever. By replaying through the same sort of events three times the director lets you really get a sense of feeling for the characters, especially Lola and as the film progresses you actually start to care about the characters and I think this was a really good quality in the film. Overall I really enjoyed this film, and think that it is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time, and would give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises. In this case, a heart-pumping, action-filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, this German-made film is infused with a quality normally seen in the cars this country produces. Tom Tykwer wrote the script and directs (as well as contributing his voice and music to several songs/remixes), and gives us a movie that contains more than just artsy material. He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola. She's a dye-dipped redhead with a high-pitched, soprano voice that can shatter glass. And she has the ability to change her future. Problem is, though, every time she changes something, everything changes, not just the one thing she wants. So when her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 Deutsche marks that are owed to a local mob boss, Lola has to save him. But she's only got 20 minutes, and everything doesn't go as planned ...the first time. Or the second. Or maybe even the third.Not being very familiar with German cinema, I'd rarely watched anything from this country. But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out. And I'm glad I did! The film opens up with a bang and doesn't stop until the final scene. Franka Potente stars as the hair-color-enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre. In short, a great combination. Her boyfriend, Manni, is played by Moritz Bleibtreu, and his ridiculous behavior is pulled off well, especially when he loses the money and calls Lola in a blubbering panic.I loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.Connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it. And so did Franka Potente. The European beats mixed with old American titles were laid down in topnotch fashion.This is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time. But it's one you'll be glad you visited.",

Lola starts running to her father (a bank manager) in order to save her boyfriend. She keeps on running the whole movie. Seldom did a film title give such an accurate summary of the \"storyline\".\"Lola rennt\" has a dynamic, video clip style. The association with music clips is enhanced by a prominent sound track. On her way Lola passes by different people and sometimes a fast forward of the future lives of these people is displayed by a compilation of snapshots. All in all the visual style of the movie made me think of the work of the \"Cinema du look\" directors (Luc Besson, Jean Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax) who were active in France during the same period.The story of Lola running to save her boyfriend is told three times. On leaving her home Lola meets an aggresive dog. Depending on her reaction to this dog, she leaves the appartment building a minute earlier or a minute later. This has great consequences for the situation at hand when she enters the office of her father and ultimately also for the way the story ends.The three parallel story lines from \"Lola Rennt\" are not to be confused with the multiple story lines in for example a film like \"Rashomon\" (1950, Akira Kurosawa). In \"Rashomon\" there are different memories of the same event, although at the end of the film the question if the objective truth regarding this event really exists lingers on. The point of \"Lola Rennt\" on the other hand is that reality can develop very differently depending on small differences in the starting situation. The idea that the wing stroke of a butterfly can cause a hurricane in another part of the world due to a chain of totally unpredicatble cause effect relationships. This applies to the main characters but also to the casual passers by. Their lives develops very differently (as shown by the compilation of snapshots) depending on the fact whether or not they are knocked over by Lola. It is no coincidence that in the last story a casino plays an important part, because in the world of \"Lola Rennt\" life is ruled by pure chance.Pure chance is not the only important thing in \"Lola rennt\". Pure love is another important theme. After all Lola is willing to go to great length to save her boyfriend, who objectively speaking is not likable at all. This love is discussed in bedroom conversations, that form the resting points between the three parallel storylines.",

You can certainly tell that this is not a Hollywood movie; if it was, Lola would probably look like Julia Roberts.

Indeed, he works for a dealer and has forgotten a substantial amount of money in the subway (100 000 marks!). If he hasn't given this amount to his boss before midday, he is dead. So you can imagine his state. But his girlfriend, Lola is well decided not to give him up and to get him out of this tight spot. And fortunately, she has an idea to find 100 000 marks. But she must be quick. She has only 20 minutes in front of her to get the money and to save her man.Someone who didn't see \"Lola rennt\" (1998) and reads the basic topic might think that he deals with a movie with a hackneyed subject. However, if he is told that the treatment is drastically different, then we may incite him to watch this movie and he probably won't regret it. Indeed, following the starting point, the movie puts forward 3 solutions to solve Manni's trouble. Either, Lola's father refuses to lend her money, either Lola holds up the bank, either, she can't get through to her father. So, this will give birth to 3 different stories which will lead to 3 different conclusions. Inside these stories, a detail, a little moment is sufficient to change Lola's running in the street and it can also modify the course of things. For example, when Lola leaves her flat, there's a young man with a dog in the corridor. Will he trip Lola up? Will she hesitate a moment because of the dog? Will she jump over it? If she chooses one of these three solutions, it can lead to dramatic consequences for others characters (her father's colleague in the car).By adopting a clip side \"\u00e0 la MTV\" in the making, by using all the possibilities offered by a camera (succession of pictures filmed in a fast way or scenes in slow motion), by including wild extracts of animation film, through precise camera angles \"\u00e0 la David Fincher\" and with a sharp sense of detail, the director Tom Tykwer makes us really share her heroin's state of stress and the fact of knowing that to save her boyfriend is a matter of life and death strikes right at the heart. Lola's uneasiness is heightened by the fact that every time she meets someone in the street, odd sometimes spooky thoughts come thick and fast. Rarely has a director has so well combined anxiety and excitation to the spectator. We allow ourselves to be led astray by Lola's unrestrained running with frenzy while bearing in mind, the fear of time which inexorably passes. It is also relevant to note down that Tykwer's camera nearly never stands still and finds moments of break between the three stories when Lola and Manni are lying side by side.Franka Potente with her loud red hair (which I interpret as a symbol of hope mingled with fear) in the wind, wearing a tank top spends most of her time to run in the film, hounded by the camera which continually follows her everywhere she goes, either it is a little street, an avenue or a building site but she also capable of emotion (when her father refuses to give her financial help, she starts to cry). Let's just regret heavy effects (when she screams, she can break glass.A movie with such a treatment was to be destined to make a beautiful career abroad. Lola had run with enormous success on numerous German screens, she had to run on plenty others foreign screens a bit all over the world to satisfy a lot of viewers.The clip side of the whole, the sustained use of the techno music will probably fail to please certain film enthusiasts but will surely perceive \"Lola rennt\" as a lively and a really great exercise of style. An exciting experience which is worth the trip and after the projection, Lola keeps on running in the mind of the ecstatic spectator.",

Though I doubt anyone will plow through the other 500+ reviews to get to mine, I still wish to express my love for this movie and submit it to the infinite void of cyberspace.***SPOILER ALERT***Besides the multiple medias (B&W, animation, hand-held cameras, etc.) that made it visually appealing, what I liked was the message. In \"Sliding Doors\" like fashion (btw, interestingly, these 2 films were made the same year) we get to see 3 (as opposed to 2 in 'SD') scenarios, each beginning as Lola has hung up with her boyfriend, Manni, who has lost 100,000 marks and is facing certain death from those it belongs to, and is pleading with Lola for help. Since I imagine the whole story has been given away in other reviews, I'll just get to the moral of the story. In the first scenario, Manni makes a poor decision and Lola pays for it with her life. In the second, Lola is the one making the bad choice and Manni pays for it with his. In the final scenario, and what we are led to believe is what actually happened, (at least that's my take on it) Lola runs out of options and even prays for divine intervention. Good fortune comes to both Manni and Lola, Manni is able to deliver the lost funds, and they both end up better off than before. The message of the blessings that follow when people make the right choices was loud and clear. Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.My only complaint was that it was too short!

The speed of the film is quite frenetic and intense--and this was its greatest asset. However, there are two problems with the film that keep it from achieving greatness. First, the characters are completely unlikable--the \"heroine\" is living with a drug dealer and she is trying to prevent his being murdered by his boss. In one scenario, she steals a gun and robs a bank and in another she helps her boyfriend hold up a store. This is certainly NOT The Adventures of Ozzy and Harriet! Despite this, though, for some reason I found myself actually caring what happened in the movie. Secondly, the movie is HIGHLY stylized and has a sort of \"new wave\" feel to it (though it was made after the new wave films of the 70s and 80s).",

Her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) has screwed up, leaving a bag of his dodgy dealing boss's cash on a train and the boss will not be pleased when he finds himself 100,000DM light. Lola & Manni have 20 minutes to find the cash and this is Run Lola Run's ace card. The clock. The music ramps up, the camera's cut and spin, we transition into cartoon Lola running, it's like a video game. Lola has a plan, asking her dad, but she doesn't get the answer she expects, quite the opposite in fact and before we know it, Manni has dragged the pair into even more trouble. It's a real car crash. Now when I said it's like a game, it sort of is. The situations are real, but once one timeline plays out, we hit reset and go again. Lola back in her home, taking Manni's panicked call. While Lola runs through the streets of Berlin, we get literal snaps shots of the people she encountered, flash frames of their lives. With each reset, the photos change. Time, chance meetings, the ever changing world around us, it all factors into the events of our lives. I'd forgotten just how much running there was with all the time replays, but it works. Partly because the backbone stays the same, keeping us anchored, but the details switch, keeping it fresh and drip feeding more narrative threads in and weaving them through the timelines. It does feel quite dated and I'm not sure it plays as well on a second watch, but it's a nice piece of indie cinema and worthy of its almost iconic cult status.",

            "content": "I rented Run Lola Run (or Lola rennt, if I want to be proper about it) expecting nothing more than shots of the lead actress running accompanied by throbbing techno music. That is a part of the film, but, as I discovered while recently watching it, not the only part. The film is mainly an exploration of choice, showing three different versions of the twenty-minute window Lola has to find 100,000 marks and deliver them to her boyfriend before he is killed by a crime boss. Are two of these versions simply imagined? Are they the same situation shown in parallel dimensions? In a wise decision, the director never explains how these three different versions are possible, or even which one, if any, is real. They all simply are, and exist side by side to clarify how extraordinarily one choice made in one second can affect your whole life. Further emphasizing this is a series of snapshots illustrating what happens to many of the people Lola runs into, showing how the slightest difference in the way they interact leads to a chain reaction that completely changes their futures. This brilliantly and concisely imparts the idea that even the strangers we merely glance at on the subway can impact our entire lives from thence forward.I think the thing that delighted me most about Lola rennt was that, as a crime thriller, it didn't have to include gratuitous violence, gallons of blood, and superfluous profanity. American filmmakers seem to think that these elements are required in generous quantities, but Tom Tykwer sprinkles them on sparingly, which results in maximum impact when and if they do appear. It's sort of the polar opposite of Reservoir Dogs, in which one becomes numb to the whole experience before the credits roll. The rest of Tykwer's directorial decisions aren't bad either. The film's visual aspect is vibrant and colorful (though maybe that's just the eye being naturally drawn to Lola's fire hydrant hair). The dialogue is thought-provoking, but sounds natural rather than just characters spouting textbook philosophy. The film finishes in eighty minutes, but is packed with more ideas than most blockbusters of twice that length, which is why arguments of the film being nothing more than a long music video really hold no validity. And, of course, the soundtrack complements the movie perfectly. I imagine I'll have to shell out more money for that in the future.Don't let the fact that this is shelved in the \"Foreign\" section intimidate you. The subtitles are well translated and not annoying to read, and it's normal enough to be within the comfort zone of most people. And I was certainly relieved that the film never took any cheap potshots at American culture.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run starts out with a flurry of activity, and within a matter of minutes we are brought up to speed on Lola's (Franka Potente) predicament. She must find a lot of money, and deliver it to her boyfriend\u0097all within twenty minutes. Tom Tykwer has wound this film incredibly tight with his fast paced editing, dazzling special effects, and innovative use of film stock, thereby enhancing the narrative. This is evident in the way Tykwer approaches the look of the actual film on which the movie is shot. The color and quality of the film separate Lola and Manni apart from the other characters as well as scenes from the film.After the initial prologue which introduces the viewer to \"the game\", we are thrust into the dynamic world in which Lola lives and the problem which she faces. Manni, her boyfriend had a responsibility to deliver some money, which he lost on the subway. This entire flashback sequence, reported to Lola by Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) via payphone, is brought to life with black and white flashback scenes that seem to have an extra edginess to them. These scenes play almost like a video, seeming to run at slightly faster than normal pace. It's as if Manni has played these scenes over and over again in his head, like the permanence of a bad accident or horrible event. The black and white symbolizes in viewer's mind the unchangeability of this event, which contrasts to the rest of the film that seems to have changeable outcomes. The rest of the movie launches from this \"base\" which serves as a solid checkpoint for the characters as well as the audience.Contrasting with the black and white is the recurrence of red throughout the film. There are two main scenes in which the characters are submersed in a red glow as they interrogate the other with deep philosophical questions. The red provides a contrast and a way of transitioning between \"attempts\". Like the black and white of the beginning, the red signals to the audience that this scene isn't part of the \"game\", but more of an intermission or pause. Special attention is paid to these two scenes because of their complete contrast to the rest of the film. They are slower, with more dialogs, and more thoughts to ponder.The final aspect of the film that separates Lola and Manni from the rest of the world is the quality and format in which the film was shot. Becoming especially apparent in the scene with Lola's father, Tykwer uses this technique extremely well to contrast between the world that Lola sees, and the world that she doesn't. Instead of wide or large shots, the scene between Lola's father and his mistress is an incredibly intimate one, and therefore shot on digital film using extreme zooms, setting it apart from the previous wide, sweeping shots of Lola as she's running. Because of this zoom on the digital camera, a slight graininess becomes evident which gives the audience a sense of displacement, as if perhaps, they shouldn't be watching this scene because it doesn't contain Lola or Manni. This is also noticeable in the scene containing the biker and bum. Again, the same technique was used to shoot this scene, and creates an uninvited effect for the audience.At first glance a viewer could deduce that Run Lola Run has very little in the way of narrative or character development and focuses much more on the use of special effects and film techniques. However, because of the careful consideration put into how the special effects are used, Tykwer has been able to create a connection between the two and has been able to impact how the audiences distinguishes Lola and Manni from the other characters in the film.",

I've never seen a movie so interesting and revolutionary in basic concept. But besides that, several other flicks like superb background music (and in right sense each case), set designing, brilliant camera angles, use of animated portions have made this movie an allover champion, we'll come to the acting later.Actually, the movie is an indirect example of the chaos theory. Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend Manni who left a bag of hundred thousand DM in the subway but without it he's doomed. But Lola says him to wait until she comes and she has only 20 minutes to reach Manni with the money. And so Lola runs.....Now director Tom Tykwer explores the situation's limitless possibilities by defying time and space. In each of Lola Rennt's three scenarios (with three different endings), subtle changes in Lola's run instantly affect the lives of random strangers encountered on her path. Every action has significance and every second counts. Such a fantastic idea was not easy to describe in the movie. But Tykwer was magnificent at that... he finely applied the theory but without making a slightest reference.Besides running wildly, Potente had many other things to do and she offered a pretty good performance. She looked younger and energetic in that bright red hair. Bleibtreu as Manni was also good. But the real hero of the movie is itself, or more precisely, Tom Tykwer. I'll rate his movie 5/5.",

            "review_title": "A Moral Action Thriller",
            "content": "\"Run, Lola Run\" is an action film that has a moral focus. In three different shorts, three different possible outcomes of the events are explored. The film is dominated by the figure of Lola running, who is a young girl trying to save her boyfriend's life in 20 minutes by bringing him 100,000 Marks, which was to be paid to a thug her boyfriend is afraid of. The fact that Lola believes she can rescue her friend made me like her from the beginning, but the tension is created by her boyfriend's statement that if she is not there in 20 minutes, he is going to steal the money... so Lola is running in an attempt to save her boyfriend's moral standing as well as his life. Good use is made of animation in tying the scenes together, and the effect of switching from a live actor to an animated one, then back to a live one gives the whole film a surreal quality. The moral consequences of various actions she takes are explored in differing plots with differing outcomes. For example, in one sequence Lola dies, but in another one her boyfriend dies. You get the feeling that you are viewing the same scene over again, but you quickly realize that the action is different, so the movie is exploring differing outcomes from the same basic plot. The fast pace of the scenes and the repetitious techno soundtrack adds to the suspense in the movie, and the effect is heightened because the audience is able to consider the action three different times.One of the interesting ironies in the plot is that it repeatedly explores the nature of romantic love in the tensions that exist between Lola's dependence on her father and her need to help her boyfriend. This is the classic formula for romance, yet it is set in the context of an action film. This is one of the aspects that makes this film unique. This is not your average psychological drama.The idea of a circular plot, where the same scene repeats itself with different outcomes is a creative one and works well within the setting that the director of the film has chosen. I liked this film more because of the conventions it breaks than because of the conventions it keeps. Yet there is a good mix of the expected and the unexpected in this film, with a nice mix of camera angles to keep the film exciting. The effect of repeating the time sequence is to allow the audience to more deeply consider the moral impact of Lola's actions, and how a simple thing such as bumping into a stranger might mean the difference between life and death. I never stopped feeling Lola's urgency until the very end, and the surprising conclusion.",

Which sounds OK, but it is just the same film, with rather minor differences. So its just being pointlessly stretched. Just imagine if Citizen Kane played 3 times with a what if his last word wasn't roesbud alteration.

Very little characterization leads to viewer apathy, and whenever the filmmakers try to inject witty situations/dialogue into the mix it fails miserably. An example would be Lola's shrill cry that effects a situation's outcome; it isn't funny, witty, or pertinent to the story -- it's just plain annoying.

Whether it be in from the family relationship perspective e.g. alienated someway by your parents, the feeling of being shut out, or the feeling of wanting hold onto someone so desperately that you'll do anything for them in order to try and stay with them. But surely the most common theme throughout this film is the essence of TIME. How TIME controls everything and no matter what the normal human being does, we cannot stop it, alter it, or change its course. Time has a knock on effect on the series of events that follow. Ever missed a bus on the way to work, thus you were late for work, imagine the most extreme circumstances and that you were fired for being late, and you were late because you missed the bus and the thought that comes into your head\u0085' If only...' And this chain reaction is exactly what Tykwer is trying to defy. Time. Time and fate. By the end of the film Lola is in control of her own fate. Each time she meets someone on her journey she changes his or her fate.A weird and wonderful twist of make-belief through use of a fantastic melange of cinematic techniques, like a timeless bubble. Is it a music video, a computer game, or a 'groundhog' type film? It's all free for interpretation. Tykwer put a lot of thought into the use of medium to keep the audiences attention, to convince them that this is a mixture of make-belief and reality. Shown through the use of cartoons verse hand held camera, photographic evidences verses red scenes (reflection time). Possibly we believe by the end of the film\u0085if Lola can change time, change a sequence of events, can we?This is a film that I never tire from.

It's a pure masterpiece of German cinema.I remember first learning about this movie a few years ago, being fascinated after skim-reading the Wikipedia article, and completely forgetting about it. However, having since become a film enthusiast, I remembered it again and decided to give it a watch, wanting to break out of the confines of the Hollywood-centric worldview about films that I held.I love this movie so much. It's a thrilling, gripping story of a race against the clock. There is never a static moment in the entire film, with beautifully cut together action sequences that will keep your heart pounding well after the movie has finished. My heart rate was so raised whilst I was watching it felt like I was the one running. Since the movie happens in real time, with each 20-minute run happening in exactly 20 minutes, timing has never been quite as vital - and you can feel it in every single microsecond of this movie.This real-time structure creates a fascinatingly different and refreshing atmosphere - since minor events along Lola's run determining the consequences, you start to think about determinism and how every choice that you will ever make can have potentially fatal consequences. And those beautifully crafted split-second future flashes of the people Lola encounters for fleeting seconds extrapolate this effect further. I loved the unconventionality and campiness of it all - a relieving breath of air from all of those blockbusters, and it condenses an entire movie's worse of suspense and action into every single second.People have seriously got to get over the subtitles because then they can access the much wider world of cinema, like masterpieces such as Run Lola Run.-Sasha.",

(Both films, allegedly, owe a lot to Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's \"Blind Chance\", but I cannot comment as I have never seen that film). Both films present us with alternative versions of the same story, with a seemingly trivial difference early on in the course of events leading to a very different denouement. \"Sliding Doors\" presents us with two different versions of the same story, with the film cutting between them; the initial difference between the two stories is that the heroine catches an underground train in one version and narrowly misses it in the other.\"Run Lola Run\" contains three rather than two versions of the story, and the three versions are shown one after the other, with no cross-cutting. The film begins with a young woman named Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Manni, a petty criminal who has lost 100,000 Deutschmarks belonging to his boss. Afraid of what his boss will do when he discovers the money is missing, Manni informs Lola that he will rob a nearby supermarket, but she begs him not to and tells him she will get the money. She intends to ask her bank manager father for it, but only has 20 minutes in which to obtain the money and get it to Manni. The film then follows Lola on each of her \"runs\" through the streets of Berlin. Each \"run\" develops differently and leads to a different outcome for Lola, for Manni and sometimes even for the various people she meets or bumps into in her journeys.Roger Ebert compared the film's structure to that of a video game and Lola to the avatar in such a game- \"Lara Croft made flesh\". (The film was made before Lara herself became a screen heroine in the form of Angelina Jolie). Ebert was referring not only to the film's fast pace- it dashes along as quickly as its heroine- but also to the way in which Lola in each run appears to learn from her mistakes in the last, like a player learning to play a game.I think that Ebert's comparison is a just one- \"Run Lola Run\" also struck me as cinema for the video age. It is a clever concept, fast-paced, witty and well put together. (And what a change to see a German film about something other than the dark side of that country's history). I would not, however, rank it as highly as \"Sliding Doors\", which dealt with its basic concept in an equally ingenious way but which also presented us with sympathetic characters, especially Gwyneth Paltrow's heroine Helen, with whom we can identify. It would be difficult to identify with the selfish criminal Manni or even with Lola, a spoilt middle-class girl who seems to have taken up with a low-life boyfriend in an act of rebellion against her bourgeois background. \"Run Lola Run\" may be clever, fast-paced and witty, but it is also rather lacking in heart. 7/10",

Does he love her? Does she love him? Words don't cut it, how can they be sure? Again certainty, being centered. There's a superficiality in the exchange like in Godard's cocky youth years ago; but I accept this as part of the life shown, the questions are deep after all. How can we know someone, make ourselves known? Hiroshima mon amour was about this, some of the deepest cinema.So, forget about the plot of having to come up with money in 20' or the boy dies, this is so we can have a reason for the girl to desperately run to him putting herself in harm's way to be there even with empty hands, a reason for him to wait for her before he throws away his life. The twice repeated scenario so we can mull over the fragility of different pathways to love, love as certainty. The first time she's too passive and gets there late, the second time too aggressive and overshoots the mark, the third is meant to ground us; a metaphor used is an ambulance that at first screeches inches short of a glass divide, the second time shoots right through, the third she latches on to it and finds inside someone who needs her to hold his hand, who she can be there for; this is the center, loving-kindness.But all this growth is a schematic scenario, a mere tinkertoy that repeats, the quest reduced to a mechanical game. The money comes from spinning the roulette, magical reward for having 'followed' the right path. Once it's handed back they walk away smiling as if that has taken care of everything. So the initial shallowness is not overpowered by the depth of what they discover about each other, the rushing and waiting merely shuffles baggage to fit in the trunk and presents this as journey.More Tarantino than Resnais, pity.",

Complete with three \"guys\" and a reset button.Using animation, video, photography, and a host of other devices, director Tom Tykwer uses the film to show off some pretty impressive film techniques. It's a picture that's very slim on plot, yet very lush with design and pop. Set to a techno score, the film is rarely slow, only stopping to set up the next 20 minute Lola run. I like the energy, I like the silly and half-baked camera moves. But don't you remember a time when people and critics used to hate films this slight? I do, and in the end \"Run Lola Run\" doesn't add up to much.Tykwer has fashioned a bizarre experimental film. A flick that's being praised for it's shallow characters and disposable hipness. Tykwer tries mightily to make the film resonate with a limp opening sequence in which is explained that whomever we touch in life goes on to live theirs. We see this philosophy in action as Lola runs into people during her rush and we watch (in a series of photographs) what happens to the person, good or bad. Each run shows a different resolution for the strangers she encounters. That might seem cool, but when these \"strangers\" have more depth than the title character, something is wrong with the film. When you leave the theater all you really know about Lola is a mess of red hair and a scream that would make a vase nervous.Like clockwork, \"Run Lola Run\" has been branded the \"cool\" art-house film of the year. It's all very reminiscent of the \"Trainspotting\" run two years ago. I cannot whole-heartily recommend the film as a satisfying night at the movies. I can appreciate the candy coating of \"Run Lola Run\", but like the best desserts, it's wonderful going in, but not as filling as you were led to believe.--------------- 5",

            "content": "Rarely do foreign films receive the notoriety of \"Run Lola Run\" and turn out to be funny and entertaining rather than dramatic and difficult. Tom Tykwer's film works for all audiences in part because it sets up a simple premise: Lola must help her boyfriend Manni come up with 100,000 Deutsch marks in 20 minutes or his \"employer\" will kill him. With our eyes not transfixed on subtitles, \"Run Lola Run\" works in some crazy visual aesthetics and suddenly, Tykwer's breaking all the rules much to our delight.\"Run Lola Run\" doesn't quite start out that way: a scene out of a Fellini movie with wandering people and a narrator posing existential questions doesn't exactly set the tone for the thriller (mostly) that will follow, but when combined with the other radical visual choices, when the story does violate expectations (and reality), the audiences is already on board. Tykwer invites his audience to jump the ship of convention and we couldn't line up any faster.In truth, Tykwer's film is an existential love story slathered in bright and fun distractions. There's a definite contradiction between the ideas he wants to convey and the film's breakneck pacing. Interestingly, the high-speed plot actually enhances the effectiveness of the occasional slow and dialogue-heavy scenes and draws our attention to them. Two scenes in particular are single takes of Lola (Franka Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) lying in bed questioning each other's love. They're completely different in tone than the adrenaline-filled scenes of Lola trying to get to Manni with money in time before he holds up a grocery store, but in a strange way they color the characters with surprising depth and humanity.If you can avoid getting caught up in the extensive coincidences and video game-like plot and can focus on more traditional aspects of the film such as character motivation, \"Run Lola Run\" starts to reveal itself. We barely get to know Lola before she takes off down the streets of Berlin in hopes that she can come up with a ridiculous amount of money within the course of 20 minutes. Clearly she can't imagine life without Manni and is willing to risk it all as she does in the film's three \"trials.\" Contrast that pure devotion to the scenes where Lola and Manni can't seem to communicate their love and that says it all about true love.Tykwer simply relishes the chance to make his film blow our minds. Every single moment of \"the run\" that he constructs has been carefully thought out like any good thriller, only he sends the story into radically unexpected directions. Despite a repeating pattern, you never know what's going to come next and the occasional atypical camera movement or surrealist choice \u2014 or Lola's \"superpower\" that allows her to shriek and shatter glass \u2014 amplifies that intensity.Although on the whole the film aims for satisfaction over complete understanding or true closure with the purpose for Tykwer's madness, the effectiveness of the whole experience is unparalleled by most films that break from convention.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "SPOILERS.This is a German movie and I was gratified to find that the years I spent studying the language were not entirely wasted. I couldn't follow all the dialogue, of course, but every now and then someone would say \"okay,\" and I understood the word perfectly.If you want to see Lola run, then this is your movie. Lola runs. Man, does Lola run. She runs a lot more than Dustin Hoffman did in \"Marathon Man.\" She runs through the whole picture and when she stop running for a brief conversation or something she's not even breathing hard, whereas I lost ten pounds just watching her.I missed the first fifteen minutes or so and it might have been a fateful error. It seems Lola's boyfriend, Manni, need one hundred thousand marks desperately or he's going to commit armed robbery maybe. About three different scenarios are presented in which Lola tries every which way to get that hundred thousand for Manni. They all start the same way, with Lola rushing out of the house, leaving her drunken mother behind, dashing down the stairs, an event we get to see as a cartoon on the mother's TV, then through the city streets. Each of the episodes ends differently, although the same characters are involved in one way or another. Sometimes she bumps into the old lady, sometimes she stops the same old lady and asks for the time, and so forth. Sometimes Lola helps Manni rob the store and she gets shot and dies. Sometimes Lola robs a bank herself and Manni dies. The last episode ends -- I want to say \"happily\" but I'm not sure that's the word. Lola gets the money honestly but it turns out Manni doesn't need it. Between episodes we get shots of Lola and Manni in bed having an idiotically abstract conversations about love. I don't know exactly what it's supposed to mean. I'm inclined to take the final, happy episode as the \"real\" one but I'm not sure. Any other interpretation would be acceptable too. Maybe, like \"Point Blank,\" it's all the last-minute fantasy of a dying woman -- or dying man.Lola is a sight to see. She's not particularly beautiful but has real strength, in every sense of the word, as well as these ruddy great black boots and fuchsia hair. And she doesn't seem to sweat, even after those lung-busting sprints of hers. Manni, on the other hand, is a thick-lipped plug ugly who doesn't seem especially bright -- certainly not worthy of all the effort Lola puts into getting that Gelt for him. The other characters really don't have that much to do, although we see them enacting their roles in slightly different ways in the separate scenarios, but they have faces too.The music will exhaust you if nothing else does. It's all up-tempo tuneless trochaic electronic percussion: BUM bum, BUM bum, BUM bum.... There are mutliple dazzling directorial tropes. The camera is almost constantly in motion. It circles in exactly the same way around drunken Mamma sitting in her chair in each episode, so that it comes to rest on the TV cartoon of Lola running down the stairs. But it also circles at other times, for reasons I can't figure out. There is slow motion of course. There occur also a series of stream-of-consciousness images from (I am guessing at this) inside Lola's head as she encounters the same characters in the episodes, imagining, or wishing, that their futures take them in a certain direction. Confused yet?Here is a novel idea, for which I demand at least a footnote. This movie has got everything that a trashy American action movies has. People get shot (in slow motion), they get run over and squashed, they rob banks, they run like hell, they go through all sorts of melodramatic confrontations, guns go off accidentally, there are multiple car crashes, bicycle crashes, ambulances smashing through huge plate glass windows, screams that are loud enough to smash glasses (and they do). In other words, this looks a lot like a typical American piece of schlock. I see no reason why Germany should rip off American garbage. Therefore I suggest an American remake of \"Run Lola Run.\" After all, shameless ripoffs have a distinguished cinematic lineage. Kurosawa ripped off cowboy movies, but we got even by making a cowboy movie that was ripped off from his imitation western, which in turn the Italians ripped off, after which we ripped off the spaghetti westerns. So that, say, \"High Plans Drifter\" is an American imitation of an Italian imitation of an American imitation of a Japanese imitation of an American western. It's the idea of remaking \"Run Lola Run\" as an American action movie that I want that footnote for. And a hundred thousand marks too. I need them at least as much as Manni.",

            "content": "I am a big Tom Tykwer fan. Between his latest, Perfume, his short in Paris, je t'aime, and the wonderful directing of Heaven from the late Kieslowski's script, I must say he is unafraid to use any technical ingenuity he can think of. This type of delving into mixed genres and cinematic senses needs to start somewhere though, and that start is Lola rennt. This film is an adrenaline rush for the entire duration being driven by the pulsating techno/electronica beats behind all the action. From straight film to animation to freeze-frame montages of photographs, Tykwer never lets the viewer get bored. Even the script stays witty and poignant at the same time, portraying the love between our two leads as well as the crazy situation they have been thrust into. The film knows it is unbelievable, yet never uses it as a crutch. It shows us early what we are to expect and it never disappoints.The crux of the story is that Lola's boyfriend Manni has lapsed during his getaway from selling stolen cars. He gets scared on the subway when he sees the cops and accidentally leaves his bag of 100,000 marks on his seat to be stolen by a street bum. Blaming Lola for not being where she was supposed to be to pick him up, he calls her for any ideas on how to save his own skin. The problem, though, is that he needs to get the money before twenty minutes are up or his boss will kill him. Here begins the film and Lola's running to get the money from her bank manager father before Manni holds up the grocery store he is at. During her journey, she passes strangers and learns secrets from people she thought loved her. Tykwer brilliantly shows what happens to these people in quick-paced montages of photos on their activities in the near future. Depending on what happens when they encounter each other, though, this look into the future is not set in stone. How do they get to meet for the first time more than once? Let's just say Tykwer is not afraid to mess with life, death, and time in order to get his point across of love conquering all.Besides the innovative camera techniques and the humorous dialogue and plot situations, the acting doesn't falter either. All the supporting players know their roles and play them to full effect in order to complement our two leads. As for them, Moritz Bleibtreu fully encompasses the role of the up-and-coming criminal who's fear and lack of confidence seem to get in the way of his lofty goals and Franka Potente never slows down in her portrayal of Lola. Potente is that girl who has rebelled against her more stuffy family, dyed her hair bright red/orange, tattooed herself, and fallen for the bad boy thug. Despite the lifestyle however, both of these characters are very much good people at heart, willing to do anything for each other in order to stay together. The cut scenes that bridge both moments of time travel help show this humanity. In bed, probably after making love, the two talk about what they truly mean to one another and whether love is true and if it will last after death.Tykwer has crafted a film that was totally fresh at the time it came out. This German gem could be seen as a precursor to films like Crank and The Transporter. By no means are they similar in subject matter or violence and action, however, the use of music and fast editing in order to create a non-stop ride for the audience is prevalent in both. Lola rennt is an amalgam equal parts romance, comedy, action, and thriller, but also a 100% fantastic spectacle.",

You'll be glad to know that they are indeed correct; it's a great film with some very interesting ideas. But more of my drivel later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please just take a jog around the block while I write the next paragraph).Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend Manni. She was supposed to pick him up but was late because her scooter was stolen. He had to get the subway and accidentally left a bag containing 100,000 Deutschmarks on the train! The trouble is he owes this money to Ronnie, a really nasty character. Lola must raise the money and get it to him in just twenty minutes, and the clock is ticking! If she doesn't get there in time, he says he will rob the store across the street\u0085 and she doesn't want that.This is a very inventive film with many techniques used to tell the story; even animation is employed to great effect. Add to that a great soundtrack and a very clever story and you have a rather good film. As far as performances go, both Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu were excellent.I love the way a possible future is played out every time Lola bumps into someone, a great idea brilliantly executed. A little trivia I noticed in the credits; some of the songs used have vocals by Franka Potente\u0085 talented girl! I should point out that the film is in German with subtitles, so if you're put off by that I would still watch it, trust me, it's worth it. Over all, it's easily the best film I've seen (so far) this year\u0085 Highly Recommended.My score: 8.8/10",

There are a number of novel devices and spectacular cinematography that make this movie an intaglio of innovation.Part of the magic of this film is that the plot is played out in such a way that you are forced to consider the consequences of not only the main characters, but also secondary personalities that would normally remain static in the movie.

It's all good because the viewer is there with her every step of the way, internally urging to not tire and to run faster.

It was a huge hit domestically, but somehow I couldn't muster up the desire the spend 16 marks to go see it.  I'd heard what it was about, and for the life of me couldn't imagine finding it interesting.  Finally, two years later, having passed on it during its cinematic runs in the U.S. and other countries, I decided to go see it in Hungary.  I suspect it had taken so long to arrive because German films almost never get distribution here, at least not since Fassbinder died.  This, despite the fact that Hungarians are eager consumers of 'art films,' and those from other European countries, notably France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Poland and the U.K., do good box office in this country.  In the meantime, I had worked with Moritz Bleibtreu ('Manni'), 'Lola rennt' had found phenomenal international success (by German standards), and I thought 'why not? I might just be wrong.'  In the end, while I didn't regret spending the money (only two dollars were at stake this time around), I emerged with pretty much the feelings I'd expected to have when I'd opted not to go two years earlier: fine, Lola's running, she's got 20 minutes to solve this problem, the 'Sliding Doors' gimmick is thrown in to make a feature out of it, but... who cares???  Is this a story?  Lots of people like to talk about the 'style' of this movie. Sorry.  This kind of style you can find at any film school presentation or short film festival, at least in Europe. The ambient music is okay, the more abtrusive numbers are completely irritating (through no fault of my own, I got the soundtrack CD for free; other than the Thomas D cut, it's torture). The only actual acting in the film is to be found in the few seconds Lola's father and his mistress are on the screen (sorry Moritz).  Everything else is going through the motions, 'high octane' though those motions may be. Like I said, it wasn't a movie which made me curse the time and expenditure, but I really couldn't recommend it to anyone who expects more than 90 minutes' worth of popcorn-munching diversion from a film.  Tykwer's previous film, 'Winterschlaefer,' was a high-gloss soap opera, but ultimately far more thought-provoking and capable of holding one's attention than was the case with 'Lola' (the last half of which was -- let's be honest -- dull). Some choice cameos for German movie fans, the photo-flashbacks were good for a few nice laughs.  For my tastes, a better-than-average, but nonetheless quite typical late 90s German movie: trying ever-so-hard to be 'cool' and 'stylish' (i.e. un-German), giving us too little to think about, either while we're watching or after the end credits roll.  And, yes, it flopped in Hungary.",

Now on first glance that looks very thin and it also looks like the plot for a very generic and bland action film. But that's where the viewer can get misled. This film is all about the themes that the director/writer is trying to explore and I find it to be immensely captivating.'Fate', 'Alternate Realities', 'Butterfly effects' etc. are primarily the themes that are dealt with here. These aforementioned themes can sound pretty daunting and heavy, but it is due to the director and writer Tom Tykwer's brilliance that even though the themes are larger-than-life, the film itself is packaged and crafted in the most exciting and enjoyable manner possible. Most parts of the film take place in real time which heighten the tension in the air. It kept reminding me of that brilliant montage in David Fincher's 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' which beautifully underlined the concept of the Butterfly Effect which basically deals with the fact that little, subtle and seemingly minor day-to-day events can have a huge bearing on and can alter the fate and destiny of a person's life. Well 'Run Lola Run' is pretty much the film version of that scene revolving around this concept. A connection can also be made with 'No Country for Old Men'. The basic philosophy that drove Anton Chigurh in his gruesome deeds was his belief that everything depended on chance. Free Will and an almighty superpower do not exist. 'Run Lola Run' also explores that very concept of chance and its effect on life and fate through the Butterfly Effect. Similar to 'No Country for Old Men', this film too in a way towards the end hints towards the idea that maybe human decisions borne out of our own will can have some bearing on the outcome of our life and our destiny, and maybe, just maybe there is someone up there who has a hand in shaping our lives by judging the choices that we make. But that's just my interpretation and this film is open to multiple interpretations.Tom Tykwer's vision and his direction has to be admired here. He showed a lot of boldness to make such an experimental film and still make it a film that has an effect in the minds of the viewer. This film is philosophical, but it is also impeccably stylish. The screenplay is influenced by Groundhog Day. The whole film looks like a prolonged 90s music video. The soundtrack comprises primarily of techno pop and percussion based scores and it completely complements the visual style of the film. The cinematography is also admirable. The film is very colourful in nature with colours being used to convey certain themes. Tom Twyker skilfully maintains the speed and the tension of the film throughout the runtime. Another important thing that helps the film is that it is only 81 minutes long. The short length helps it because the novelty of the experimentation and Tykwer's visual style does not wear off.'Run Lola Run' is not only snazzy and exciting, but it is also philosophical and will encourage debates and analytical conversations. I think it is extensively re-watchable too. Highly recommended.",

I'm a bad guy so I must wear black and leather; I'm a civil servant so I must wear a suit.   Rebelliousness is Lola running, in public.  Lola's boyfriend Manni is a dim-bulb.  How could anyone trust this moron with a bag of cash.  And why when he went to go back into the train did the cops stop him?  They didn't arrest him since he was free soon after.  What did he do? Break some rigid rule of not walking the correct way. Obviously this was just an essential plot device. That whole train thing seemed flimsy and the rest of the  movie was built on what happened on the train.  And what was the screaming about.  Lola and Manni seemed to be a couple of pampered kids playing at being rebels. Nonetheless the rest of the movie was fun.",

Nor is there an explanation why he didn't tell Lola sooner. There are two ways this movie could have gone, story wise, but it didn't go in either direction: 1. The whole movie could have been told in a single point of view without being divided up by three possibilities with the point of view being, of course, Lola's. This way it would be less predictable by the second or third act of the movie. 2. Another possibility is if the writers go with the multiple scenarios, but not just through Lola's eyes. For example: The first act could work just fine as it is, but the second act could focus on what her boyfriend is doing the whole time Lola is running to him when she isn't on camera. Then a third point of view could be what her parents are going through at the same second the first and second acts of the film take place. This way, it won't repeat the same thing almost exactly the same way. A much better movie that deals with different possibilities like this is Rashomon. In that one, it's the same story told from different characters. No necessarily repeating the same story with a slightly different ending.",

            "content": "This movie is soon 20 years old and is still among Germany's most famous ever. For Franka Potente, Lola is still easily the most known performance of her prolific career. Together with \"The Bourne Identity\" maybe. For Bleibtreu, it is probably still \"Das Experiment\" as he is the undisputed lead there. \"Lola rennt\" was a BAFTA nominee, but lost to Academy Award winner \"All about my Mother\". At the German Film Awards, however, it won all the categories it was nominated for: film, direction and both supporting categories. Potente did not get in, however. There are many slow movies out there, but this one here is probably the exact opposite. And that is not only because it runs for just 75 minutes (without credits), but mostly because something essential happens all the time. A lot of it is thanks to its great cast: Knaup, Rohde, Petri, Monica Bleibtreu (Moritz' mother), von Borsody, Kr\u00f3l, Pistor and Ferch belong to Germany's acting elite to this day. The film's director and writer is Tom Tykwer, one of Germany's most famous directors in Hollywood. Maybe you have seen \"Cloud Atlas\" not too long ago. He was also in a longtime-relationship with Potente when \"Lola rennt\" was made.I liked how future events were told when Lola was running by people. But in the core, it is all about her fate. And about her boyfriend's. Both get killed at one point, but Lola gets the chance to relive certain situations in order to avoid disaster. Will she manage to get 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes? Does she even have to? The story is always a bit different. One of the most lauded things about this film is probably the music. Heil, Klimek and Tykwer worked on several projects together and scored a BAFTA nomination for the previously mentioned \"Cloud Atlas\" as well. The main theme from German rapper Thomas D. and Potente herself is used repeatedly in this film and never impressed me really. I remember it was a big hit back then, but I personally would have been happier with an exclusively instrumental soundtrack. In the end, we watch three different scenarios until the two protagonists finally find happiness. I like how they did not include a fourth and kept the film very short and essential instead as there certainly would have been the danger of becoming a bit repetitive and starting to drag. However, why would Bleibtreu's character give the gun to the homeless guy. That did not really make any sense to me. And I found the casino scene a bit random and could have done without it, but I actually liked the ending and the final shot/question. Nicely done.While I enjoyed it, I cannot really see the big impact this film had, but nonetheless I give it a thumbs up. Potente and Bleibtreu were in their 20s when this was made and it is one of the best examples of new wild German cinema. I don't think it is necessarily great movie making, but it's a very creative approach and idea and good execution of it, which makes this film so memorable. It is certainly a fairly unique piece of movie-making. Recommended.",

Movies that glorify (I.e. not villianize) criminals. The main characters worked for the mob. In two of the three scenarios, they engaged in violent crime.

I always pass the foreign film section at my video store, but something just told me to check it out real quick to see maybe if there was a film that looked interesting and I saw Run Lola Run and just grabbed it. Now, while I'm still confused about how this movie is on the top 250 on IMDb, I still found it to be very entertaining and an interesting way of making film.Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend who lost a sack of one hundred thousand dollars(American) and the mobsters he was supposed to deliver it too are going to come and kill him if he doesn't have the money with him. Lola has 20 minutes to get a hundred thousand dollars, in three scenario's, the director gives us different ways of seeing this story and also some different endings that keep us going and wondering what might happen next.I would say that maybe because I am very used to American film making, maybe I just didn't get it as much as others to where I would give it a ten on the rating system. But it's all good, I still did enjoy the movie, it had great action and kept me going into a different ending three times!

The plot is here is very simple, it's about a girl name Lola running all around town in order to find 100,000 dollars for her boyfriend so he wouldn't get killed while time is ticking away. Because the money he owes goes missing. Watching this movie is like watching a cool music video from the 90's that lasts about a hour and 20 minutes. It's like watching a blend of something cartoony and something all over the place, but again in a good way. This movie theme is how even the smallest change in time can make all the difference. While also delving into the existential elements and the distance people will go for their loved ones. And what would happen when that loved one would suddenly pass away and what they would leave behind. How no one wants to be forgotten when they leave this world.

I saw it for just my third time last night and was again blown away by all the little quirks and zesty ideas going on here. From the heavy dreamy shadows and quotes of philosophical weight before the credits to the the recurring images of Lola running, and running, and running, the twists never end. And I don't mean twists of plot, which this movie also has. There are narrative storytelling devices at work, completely fun, almost little movies of their own, at every turn. There are several different shooting formats (video of different quality and film, plus cartoons). And there are those brief sweet flashbacks (or are they dreams?) of the two heroes talking in bed.Lola is the star and heroine, for sure, played with panache (and a terrific glass shattering scream) by Franka Potente. She's a spoiled rich kid whose boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) has screwed up a major crime by losing the money on the subway. (This is all made clear in the first few minutes.) So then there are twenty minutes to find some replacement money.That's the thrill. And do they do it? Sometimes. Maybe. You certainly don't need to make sense of the three main plot options. Just sit back, or sit up, and watch. And be amazed.And wish we all could redo our worst moments and fix them.The director? Tom Tykwer, who is one of the handful of really inventive directors making mainstream movies out there. If you like this you should consider \"The Princess and the Warrior\" which was his next film, also terrific. And even \"Heaven\" which came next is first rate. The more mainstream \"The International\" with Clive Owen may have crossed your radar, and has a great ending scene (see my review of that one) but is in someways a let down for Tykwer. Most of his work has been in German, but don't let the subtitles stop you. Especially with \"Lola\" which is so much about what happens visually.",

The sequences of Lola running through Berlin, accompanied by a pulsing electronic soundtrack, would be invigorating enough on their own, but the tension keeps piling up. The film shows terrific visual imagination, with a great title sequence, animation, split screens, and what appears to be videotape photography (the dialogue scenes with Lola's dad and his mistress look like a daytime soap).

But when it was released I found \"Lola\" so surprisingly good and fresh, with its clever structure, game of chances, lost opportunities, what-if's and feel-good tone, that I can overlook its roots on fashionable cinematic techniques and sounds, which will probably hurt it in a future test of time. It is a definite product of its time, with a tender heart instead of guns and cynic babbling among hustlers and killers, and as such it will have to be evaluated, even if future audiences may find its concerns outdated or irrelevant.

Some have criticised it for being nothing more than a glorified video clip. I'm inclined to agree, but if it's just a video clip then it's a brilliant one and that's nothing to be ashamed of. Its style is very \"Berlin\" - snappy, daring, eccentric. A large part of the film depicts nothing but running redhead Lola underscored by euphoric techno music, interrupted by fateful encounters with strangers, just like the honest original title \"Lola runs\" suggests.

If you want to root for underdog losers, there are better films. Two examples that come immediately to mind are Boogie Nights and Trainspotting. At least the characters start as victims of circumstances beyond their own control who are mostly hopeless, but they aspire to do better. These characters are just fu**ups who are in a pinch because at key moments in their pathetic lives they couldn't control simple reflexive actions such as getting a pack of smokes, or running from the cops while forgetting the loot!

Oh yeah, he needs it in twenty minutes. So Lola leaves her house and runs to try to raise the money.The genius quality of the film is that it's one movie in three different takes. Quick cuts from an object to another (2001: A Space Odyssey, anyone?) and awesome, quick-tempoed music keep the heart pounding and the eyes open. We don't have one story. If Lola trips on the steps down from the apartment, she has a limp and thus the entire section is different.All the actors are incredible. Potente (last seen in The Bourne Identity) stands out with her bright red hair (which she couldn't wash for seven weeks) and her fast running. Bleibtreu, who'll rob a store if Lola doesn't have the money by noon, also is great, no other words to use.It's fast-paced, fun, and heart-pounding. I love movies that don't have \"one\" solution; here, there's three. Once something happens at the end of twenty minutes, we know that that won't happen later. If there is one aspect of the film I didn't enjoy so much were the scenes where Manni and Lola were in bed. They did add depth to the characters, but dampered a little from the quick pacing. But maybe that was to calm us down, only to jump us up again.Run Lola Run is a must see, with great acting, great action and suspense, and a quick runtime (75 minutes).

Yes, film is not immune to our infatuation with larger than life personalities, without much regard for their true contributions.Otherwise, in terms of story, characters, and pure cinematic magic, it beats pretty much anything out there including recent darlings of critics, such as Tarantino or Nolan (ugh). In terms of photography, storytelling, performances, and how it is all put together, this is really an example of \"how to make a great film\".I saw \"Lola rennt\" when it first came out. Since then I saw it a few times, but only now do I realize how well it holds over time, how well it deals with its subject matter, how well it pushes the story, and how the director weaves it all together with incredible attention to detail. Add to that wonderfully creative new approaches which combine animation, video, hand-held, Polaroids, what-have-you, and you will be in cinematic heaven.

Even as I write that, I realize that there are some elements toward the end that are a bit fantastic. Yet they didn't seem to me to be absurd. It fit in so well with the overall theme of the film that I didn't even think about it being a bit crazy. It was sincerely exciting. You are seeing the same basic plot three times, yet you do not have any idea what is coming. One of the elements of the film I like the best are the dialog scenes between Lola and Manni. There are two of them--one for each of their perspectives. The dialog is simple yet meaningful. They talk about everything while talking about ostensibly nothing. It reminds of some scenes from Goddard's \"Breathless\". This is a very good film",

A running German girl?\" and I was so disappointed. It was brilliant. Good that I give it a shot, and now I'm hooked.Run Lola run isn't just movie itself. Lola is representing us, human beings on how we can do things in such a short time. If you did a bad thing, a bad thing will also happen to you, if its good then its good. In 20 minutes, Lola did her very best to help Manni: She helps him rob the grocery, Hostaging her own father and screaming in the casino to win 100 marks.Run Lola run is an amazing piece of cinema. Its a Gem that is hard to forget. It's the very first classic German film that came out in the late 90's. Try it, and I'm sure you'll love it.10/10",

            "content": "This is possibly the most energetic film that I've seen, it certainly lives up to its title as Lola spends most of her time running. The film starts with Lola getting a phone call from Manni, her boyfriend, begging her for help. He had been carrying 100,000 Deutsch marks for some local gangsters and had accidentally left them on the train and needs her help to get that amount of money before the gangsters arrive to collect it in twenty minutes.Without giving too many spoilers the story from the time of this phone call repeats three times during the film, each time slightly different occurrences lead to them getting the money in different ways and thus the stories have radically different outcomes. One might think it would seem repetitious seeing the same events three times but than doesn't really happen as the slight differences in timing mean we learn different things about the characters each time.The reason the story is shown three times is never really explained, it is up to the viewer to decide if we are merely being shown how a trivial change in ones life can lead to drastic changes later on or if Lola is in fact being given a chance to live those crucial twenty minutes over again.The acting is good throughout, especially Franka Potente as Lola, she made it seem like she had been running almost non-stop for twenty minutes at the end of each story, I felt tired just watching her run so much. The techno music also added to the sense of pace in the film so worked very well even though it isn't the type of music I'd choose to listen to. Given the quality and high entertainment value of this film it surprises me that there aren't a lot more films from Germany appearing on the on the screens of English speaking countries.",

            "content": "The German title of this movie is \"Lola Rennt\" which translated means \"Lola Runs\", and that is what she does, almost continuously, for most of the movie.Franka Potente who was in her early 20s during filming is Lola, and the other main character is Moritz Bleibtreu , in his late 20s, as her boyfriend Manni . He is being given a trial assignment, it isn't clear to me if it was a legitimate (legal) job or not, but he botches it, leaving the bag of money, a large sum of money, on the train. As a result he is told to get the money or they will kill him. He only has 20 minutes. That makes the plot pretty simple.Whatever attraction this movie has lies more in style than in substance. Lola has to think up a way to help Manni, and since she doesn't have any time to spare and no transportation, she runs. And runs. And runs.The novelty (style) in this movie is seeing several versions of what happens, each slightly different. Perhaps a good way to look at it, different alternate universes. In some ways it reminds me of \"Sliding Doors\", where a few seconds, earlier or later, can make all the difference in the eventual outcome. In this story it makes the difference in life and death.I enjoyed it, I saw it years ago on VHS, and recently I re-watched it on DVD, this time selecting the English dubbing so I could avoid reading subtitles. Although I studied 5 semesters of German in college and was once fluent.MAJOR SPOILERS: We actually see three versions of \"what might have happened\". In one at the 20-minute mark Lola gets shot and dies. In another at the 20 minutes mark Manni dies. But in the final version they gamble and win enough money, and also recover the lost money, so Manni is out of trouble plus they have a nice cash reserve for themselves.",

I only knew there was a hot redhead running a lot. Fortunately, I decided to expand my horizons and gave it a rent on video when it was released. I brought it home, watched it, and went right to the mall the following day to purchase both the DVD and CD soundtrack for \"Run Lola Run\".I'm a fan of dance/trance music, so the soundtrack certainly worked for me. I'll say no more on that.As for the film itself, the story is told three ways with three endings and three series of events that occur during the 20 minutes in question. The third one, it would seem, is the happy ending. Of course, one can decide for him/herself which may have been the \"real\" ending. Whatever the case, and whatever the choice, you are taken on an 80-minute thrill ride the likes of which you have never been taken on before. Between the frantic pacing, the constant running of Lola, the thumping soundtrack and the race against time, this is simply a film that will leave you exhausted when it's over. And then you'll want to see it again.The DVD does have an English dub, and it's actually a good one, but see it in German, read the subtitles and experience this film the way it was meant to be experienced.

There's no answer without a question, but there are infinity of questions without an answer, which makes any quest for universal truth totally pointless \u0085 so what's the point in pointlessness? Simply to find the right questions that convey the right answers, but when the question is about what is right or wrong, you go back to the start, and you realize that the quest of truth is cyclic and circular like a balloon or a roulette, and life shouldn't consist on finding where the ball or the roulette begin and where they end, after all, it's all a matter of perspective and the beginning is the ending of a life seen backwards and the middle never differs wherever you project yourself, this is the condition of the universe, something governed by the absence of a beginning and an ending, a series of new beginnings for endless endings, no \u0085 the truth is : to find the answer, one must not consider the ball, not the roulette, but only the limits of the game and what is left to him between these limits, these are the only parameters, and whatever you have to do, you know, how, when, where to do it, and as I said : \"it's not over till it's over\" ...PHASE 1 : TRY AGAIN \u0085\"Run Lola Run\" is the illustration of the idea that our lives are governed by the succession of little hazardous points constituting the chain of events that progressively inserts itself into an accepted reality, bad or wrong, it doesn't matter. Time is a cold and objective master that can either play as your ally or your enemy, and its treacherousness is that you can never tell until you determine all the consequences, until the GAME is finally OVER. \"Run Lola Run\" illustrates the video game-related aspect of life, with only one game to play. In a self-reflexive aesthetics, it features a heroine that looks like a manga version of Lara Croft, but with a vulnerability that makes her profoundly human. Lola's mission is to find 100 000 marks for Manni, her boyfriend who might get killed by his 'employer', it's a matter of life an death. And what makes the couple so appealing is the love both have to each other, and the mission works like a test of this love. And Manni is not a passive character as he also tries to find a solution. Lola must think, and fast, she knows which door to knock at, then she runs, and runs and runs. She's not an athlete, she's not the kind of character with a healthy condition, and her reaction is almost of pure panic as she embarks us in this exhilarating quest for money. During her crazy journey, she encounters many random passing-by characters, and we get to know what will eventually happen to them. And if you might take these realities for granted, think that it's a video game, and something even deeper than that.PHASE 2 : WHEN GOD WANTS TO BE ANONYMOUS \u0085 He calls himself hazard. Not to make \"Run Lola Run\" a metaphysical introspection into the true meaning of life with so many divine interventions, call them the work of providence or again, purely hazards, but the movie shows with a cold detachment combined with a clever cynicism how life is made of unexpected little details that condition our futures. One day, you buy a lottery ticket, or you take the wrong turn in the road, or you have an accident and fall in love with the nurse, etc etc. And your powerlessness, in this succession of events is that you never know what will come at you and where this will lead you. The movie is inter-cut with brief flashbacks showing the love between Lola and Manni and how both are aware of the random aspect of a love that'll never stop being a hostage of the future. But life is also about the awareness of that passive condition and the heroic struggle to overcome it. This is why Lola is one of the greatest cinematic heroines, she embodies the inspiring strength of someone who refuses to give up, even with twenty minutes left to her. She must succeed, she's flawed, she's not confident, but God knows that she'll try, even when struck by that panic that make her scream her lungs out with that disturbingly shrill sound, as the cry of despair to get off this \u2013vulnerable yet so universal- condition.PHASE 3 : CINEMA, CINEMA, CINEMA \u0085 \"Run, Lola Run\" is a cinematic little gem that reminds us of that sacred period where the video-games were a biggest trend than the Internet, where the Marks weren't replaced yet by the Euros, the late 90's with their crazy exuberance and delightful creativity that brought up so many masterpieces of editing like \"Pi\", \"Fight Club\" and \"Run, Lola Run\" a movie that gets better after each viewing, thanks to Franka Potente's unique appeal, and her believable chemistry with Morriz Bleibtreu as Manny, but also Tom Tykwer's stylish and flamboyant direction, served by a top notch editing, with a repetitiveness that makes the choice of Techno music absolutely relevant, like the musical allegory of that adrenalin-loaded action structuring the whole narrative, with each viewing revealing a new detail. It's all about repeating an experience, until you get to the right point, in a way, it's a sort of \"Groundhog Day\" with a shorter time loop but I don't want to ruin the experience for the new watchers.CONCLUSION : \"Run, Lola Run\" is an amazing experience that works on the double level of life's predictability and the unpredictable way to domesticate it. It's not over till it's over, but is it always over? And here we go again",

I'll explain why later.The film begins with a philosophical question: \"How do we know what we think we know? Why do we believe anything at all?\" It immediately states an answer: \"The ball is round, the game is 90 minutes. That's a fact, everything else is pure theory.\" In other words, \"no reason.\"Lola's boyfriend, Manni, lost 100,000 marks belonging to his hoodlum associates. Lola needs to get that amount of money and meet him in 20 minutes, or they'll surely kill him. So she hurries to get there. Along the way, she runs into various people; the film shows flashes of what will happen to them in their future without explanation of how or why.But things go very badly for her. She is killed, so the events start over, showing a different version. This time, things happen a bit differently, including different outcomes for the people she encounters. Again things turn out wrong, again it starts over, again different results, this time with success for Lola and Manni. There's no reason for it, no different choices anyone made; it's just random. In fact, she turns 100 marks into over 100 thousand in two rounds of roulette at a casino (as if that ever happens when you need it).The movie is filled with unlikable characters. Manni is a crook, apparently a thief and smuggler. Lola joins him in armed robbery of a grocery in one iteration, then robs her father's bank, holding her father at gunpoint, in another. In the third iteration where things work out, the two behave better, not because they're better people making better choices, but because they simply never had the opportunity to rob anyone.In between the iterations, Manni and Lola are lying in bed, discussing things that have nothing to do with anything, further underscoring the fact that this is a pointless, meaningless, random, plodding movie, which is philosophically corrupt and only barely entertaining. But the music rocks, which is why I listened to the very end: I didn't want to miss the only thing good about this film.",

It is an exhilarating, energetic and amazing experience - but the best part of it is that it leaves you with so much to think about after. Similar subject matter was tackled by Tykwer in 'Winterschlafer' but without so much emphasis visual style. Tykwer's follow-up film however, 'Der Krieger und die Kaiserin' comes highly recommended as a film both as stylish and deep like this.",

            "content": "Tom Tykwer's rather unique and groundbreaking film 'Run Lola Run' is a film chock full of just about everything and it works on many levels.I remember once hearing someone say, upon noticing the vast array of different transitions available on a digital edit programme; 'Why would you need so many transitions? 99% of them are either useless or look bad anyway. You don't need these visual gimmicks to tell a good story.' This struck me halfway through watching Run Lola Run as this eye fest of colour and energy has just about everything you could throw into a film, bar goofy transitions, and it actually works - in a strange way.Everything is thrust into our faces early on. The animated credits sequence, the rather weak attempt at creating some sort of philosophy using the football quote and the visual manipulation of colour as we fast cut from yellow phone boxes to Lola with her red hair and then back to black and white flash-forward's of what might happen to another character all occur within the opening minutes. To this, the animation feels unnecessary and the flash forwards that follow which show what will happen to various people Lola bumps into on her sprint journey are confusing and disorientating; they are not always clear either and some are far too quick. They felt like they were there for comic relief which wasn't good.Another bizarre thing is the principle of the hero; Lola. She's a freak, an out and out freak. She has unnatural red hair, she has lungs the size of God knows, and her scream is, quite literally, 'cracking'. This may detract from the experience, you'd think, but it actually adds to it. We realise this film is different; it's almost 'art-house' with its fast edits and audacious way of telling a story so why not have an abnormal hero in an abnormal film? If she was plain looking, and everything else, would we like her more or less? Probably less.With good scenes throughout, including a tense heist scene and a rather impressive, intimate, bed scene with a message put across through dialogue; Run Lola Run works on more levels than you'd think. The thing is, when the films good, it's great. When it's not good, it's a little sour. The bank scenes trail on when Lola begs for money and a lot of the tragedy is sapped away from the death scenes as they pile up given the multi P.O.V. thing this film has going on.The film isn't bad, in fact despite the things it has wrong with it, it makes up for in energy, pumping music and a wonderful atmosphere of chance throughout along with its ambiguity. These are good things and these principals add up into an entertaining, fun film.",

The employment of techno music and animation and other MTV style tactics is used well, however, what is the point??  None sadly.On the negative side - This is nothing we haven't seen before, just a wildly mixed bag of stolen pieces from Bresson to Godard, to Antonioni to Gunter Grass!!! The acting is amateurish at best, and only enhances the distancing we already feel for these characters.  We don't understand or like them, how on earth can we care about them?? The multi veiwpoints become achingly dull and banal before the final freeze frame shot.  It isn't even smart enough to be interesting on a Rashomon-multi-story level.

However, the theme of different realities and the possible outcomes following cause and effect relationships is a common theme in theatre, literature and film and so for one this film cannot be considered completely unique as it is by many. Yet this is of no real concern for me, if it's a good film then it's a good film despite it being formulaic.The problem with this film for me is that it is not particularly interesting. We simply see 20 mins of action repeated back to us three times with slight variances. By the third time of seeing such events one is bored and really not that interested in the outcome for the characters(besides, the third time around it seems as if everything is too contrived and unbelievable, with plot elements such as time dissolving). In fact I found myself caring very little for the characters and I believe this was in the most part due to the lack of roundness to the people involved in the story. We are shown stereotypical two dimensional characters eg . lola - headstrong young female who has trouble with parents. The father - aggressive,untrustworthy executive. Then again I suppose we cannot expect much more from a 'concept' film. To me it seems that the filmmakers knew they weren't dealing with anything particularly brilliant here and so did their very best to make up for it in post. The fast paced nature of the editing makes the film like one long music video and most of the time succeeds in hiding the lack of depth to the film and keeping an audiences attention. Moreover there is a constant thumping drumbeat soundtrack to create tension which would be non existent otherwise.As such i recommend this film to any young filmmaker as it would surely provide inspiration on the editing sides of film and perhaps even highlight the worth of a good editor which is something that is sadly often ignored. For everyone else this is a fun but pointless film that relies on form and not depth.",

It's an entirely original film with a great soundtrack, a movie I don't think has been recreated since. The closest equivalent I could come up with are the Crank movies, though I think those are a little more crazy in how they build that bullet train pacing.Lola is a pretty good movie all around though I didn't feel a real connection to it. The characters are built up a bit but ultimately didn't come across as three dimensional to me and the plot was only there to service the action.

            "content": "Loud enough to shatter glass.There are three keys to the success of this remarkable German language film (with English subtitles): originality of conception, crisp direction and editing, and two attractive stars to play the leads.The stars are Franka Potente, who plays ruby red-haired Lola, daughter of a banker. She is smitten with Manni, handsome young man played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who forgot to keep his grip on a bag containing 100,000 Deutsche marks belonging to his mobster boss. He is to hand over the money in twenty minutes, but he lost it on the train. (It was picked up by a homeless man.) Manni calls Franka and tells her the desperate straits he is in. He says his only out is to rob a store. She says no wait, she can come up with something. What that something is is dear old dad. She looks at the clock.It's twenty minutes until twelve. So Lola starts running to get to the bank and then to Manni before the stroke of noon.If you've seen Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coup (1959) then you know where director Tom Tykwer may have gotten the idea of showing us a Lola who runs like the wind. Truffaut used a sustained shot of his young hero running to convey an uplifting sense of freedom amid action. It worked for Truffaut and it works for Tykwer. Franka, running in nicely fitted pants and tank top (with her white lace bra strap discretely showing) really is a delight to watch. And like Truffaut, Tykwer does not let us see the runner sweat. There is a kind of effortless release, without any straining of our lungs. It is like running in our dreams.What Tykwer does with time is even more interesting. He has Lola run from her home to the bank to Manni three times, each time with a slight difference in the early events, leading to differences in the events to come. In the British movie Sliding Doors (1998) starring Gwyneth Paltrow, something of the same sort was tried with Gwyneth playing out two different permutations of her life based on decisions leading to differing scenarios. I'm also reminded of the brilliant American film, Memento (2000) directed by Christopher Nolan in the way some of the events are played over again. Here the scene as Lola runs by her mother on the telephone is the same three times, but then the differences begin. It might also be said that this movie is the \"many worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics brought to cinema. Or perhaps Tykwer was influenced by complexity theory in which a slight change in initial conditions can lead to large changes later on.The story (or rather stories: there are three of them) strain credulity at times. The awful things her \"father\" says to her in the first accounting seems too harsh and stupid to be real. The co-incidence of Manni's spotting the bum on the bicycle in the third tale seems a bit too lucky to be believed. And the allotment of twenty minutes of time in the three sequences was a bit off. However some of the other events seemed to me to be plausible or at least very clever and therefore allowable in an artistic sense. That the man in the ambulance regains a steady heart beat because she holds his hand is something this old guy can believe. And the cops mistaking her for a bystander in the bank robbery seems like credible cop behavior to me. And for those who think that the casino event was too much to believe, consider this: Assuming that the roulette wheels in Germany have both a zero and a double zero, the odds against betting on the number twenty and hitting it on consecutive spins of the wheel are 1/36 times 1/36 which equals about 77/100,000 or about 1300 to 1. It's a long shot, but nothing like winning the lottery. Incidentally she had in the bag 115,600 Deutsche marks (her initial 100 marks x 34 x 34).For those of you who haven't seen this remarkable film, consider this: it lasts 80 minutes, but it will seem like fifteen. The \"throbbing techno score\" is haunting and there are some nice action sequences. This is the kind of (R-rated, however) movie you can see with your teenaged son, although he would probably prefer to see it with his buds.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

I can completely see that, for the target audience of this movie are modern young people and you can see it, while you watch the film. The dialogue, the music and the characters, just everything aims at young people.\nI must admit, that the story, is not what makes this film great, but it is the approach of the director. I mean he answers a very interesting question in this movie. A question everyone has asked himself once in his life I guess. What if? He does not only answer that question numerous times, but he also shows us what happens to the people in the movie, which are actually only \u0091supporting actors'. But as in real life everyone has a fate and he shows us that fate even if the character just appears on screen for a few seconds.\nSomething else which makes this film interesting is, that it is never predictable and always fast paced. Almost a perfect 10 you must think now, but it is not, for there are some minor faults in this movie. All the cartoon parts suck (as in badly drawn), all the people in the movie are too nice, Lola is too lucky and that high shouting voice really makes no sense, especially not in the last scene in which it is used.

            "content": "Lola Rennt is a German thriller about a young girl, Lola, whose boyfriend has lost 100,000 marks. She has 20 minutes to find the money or else he will rob a supermarket. It sounds like a fantastic premise for a thriller, but it is put in the entirely wrong hands.Let me state right now that I never have and never will be a fan of the MTV generation of directors (the only exceptions to date are Ridley Scott and David Fincher). As a result, I just couldn't stand Tom Tykwer's direction. In particular, the endless, long shots of Lola running everywhere become extremely boring.Here is the strangest bit of Lola Rennt for me: something goes wrong and the situation does not end happily. Suddenly, the film cuts back to the beginning of Lola's run, and the entire thing repeats itself, but with a twist. I enjoyed the second run far more (mainly because this had the least amount of running in it, and actually delivered a few thrills), but there is positively no logic to this move. It takes away from the film, because the viewer is left wondering \"WHAT is going on?\" The question is never answered.When it comes to acting, I couldn't stand Lola (played by Franka Potente). Her sole existence in the film is to run, find money, and scream (in an extremely high-pitched way which hurt my ears). The viewer never gets any background information on Lola or her boyfriend or anyone else for that matter: we are left with a film about strangers. The result? No sympathy, no hope for Lola to emerge victorious, no thrills\u0085The Verdict: Currently with 8/10 stars on IMDb, I am quite surprised at this film's high ranking. It is technically well-done, I guess, but can only be appreciated by those open to the MTV generation of film-making\u2014 which I am not. In the end, Lola Rennt is nothing more than a boring run. A good premise for a thriller, but the direction ruins it.Overall Rating: 3/10",

Manni is dead if he doesn't bring it in, and Lola has only 20 minutes to raise that money for him. Otherwise, Manni would rob a grocery store near the phone booth he's hiding in.\"The ball is round, a game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory.\"\nTwo things set this film apart for me. First, it's principally a film of small changes that cause larger consequences. Each time Lola bumps into someone, their life flashes before our eyes and we see how that a couple of centimetres alters the dynamic of people's lives drastically - for better or worse - \u00e0 la butterfly effect. Thus, it's a film that rests upon a theoretical pillar, not an arbitrary one.\"Man... probably the most mysterious species on our planet. A mystery of unanswered questions.\"\nThat said, it also acknowledges the mysterious and sophisticated nature of our feelings and, consequently, gives Lola and Manni more than one chance to shake off any qualms they have for one another regarding true love, devotion and fidelity. Actions speak louder than words, let alone when such actions are of 'fate-defying' proportions and those words are of ineffable emotions.Running at a breakneck pace and merging multiple styles as diverse as animation and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Run Lola Run is an adrenaline rush in every sense of the word that's cool and innovative in equal measure, and one that overflows with thematic significance, compressed into a compact 80-minute film. However, I think it would've benefited from a tad longer runtime to earn its weight.",

Where other directors normally fail in relying on different techniques, Tywker shows that he is master of control.Tywker never forgets that he has a story to tell as well (3 stories in fact). Not only the story of the main characters is told (helped by good performances); also - and  few directors do this - the stories of the \"bit characters\" are told by way of  what might be called a technique of slides.The picture starts with terrific credits, so be sure not to miss these.Let's hope that Tom Tywker can withstand any offer from Hollywood and that he will remain a European (German) director.",

Her boyfriend Manni has lost a bag containing a lot of money belonging to his boss, a tough, pay-or-die gangster, who doesn't want to hear any excuses. Lola must come up with the dough in 20 minutes or start looking for a new Manni. The director, Tom Tykwer, visualizes this simple enough scenario in three alternative versions. Playing fast and loose with time, Lola runs uptown, downtown and crosstown in an effort to scrape together the DM 100,000 to save Manni's life. Lola is one of those \"what if\" movies, in the same vein as the less successful, but very good, Sliding Doors, replaying the same story in decidedly different ways.

            "content": "Before watching Run Lola Run, I was absolutely sure it was an incredible film and that I was going to praise it; well, it surprised me even more and now I worship it! It is really one of the best films I have seen in the last two years, just beside Almod\u00f3var's All About My Mother.What's so great about this German film? Well, everything is. Starting with the directing by Tom Tykwer. A masterpiece, a work of art. The movement of the camera is striking, yet it blends in with the story perfectly, and these movements are clearly needed for the story (it's NOT a director trying to impress you with his originality!). The best thing I thought was the editing; it reminds me of the cinema of Hitchcock, Bu\u00f1uel or Eisenstein. The enormous amount of details that Tykwer conveys through editing is extraordinary and just this makes the film very worth watching. Also very interesting and appealing are the very strong screenplay by Tykwer and the faboulous cinematography by Frank Griebe. Not to mention the soundtrack, an incredible medley of different styles, that blend in perfectly in every moment of the film.The structure of the story is definitely not one you see everyday, but the strength of it doesn't merely lie in the fact it's very original; it truly is a perfect screenplay, not a second of film is wasted, not a second is eraseable. It reminded me very much of Julio Medem's The Lovers of the Arctic Circle. As for Franka Potente, I think she is a great discovery; I hand't seen any of her work before and she has quite an acting capacity, same as supporting actors Herbert Knaup (Lola's father) and Nina Petri (Jutta).So, I truly think you should watch this excellent film.",

            "content": "Outside the cinema where I saw this film, a promotional poster for it used, among others, the adjective 'post-human' to describe it.  And of course I raised a skeptical brow at such daring, laughing a little at the prospect of 'post-humanity' and wondering if it would be nearly as impalpable as postmodernity.  It was a bit of a bias, I suppose, and set expectations for what the film would offer: a character study beyond characters?  A complication neither created nor solved by human nature?As it were, the adjective proved insufficient.  While I thought of a handful of issues, the foremost regarding the 'humanity' of destiny and how consideration of different possible fates is at the same time innately human and entirely impracticable, I found that the film was much more 'consumable' when seen as an advanced display of technical facility and not licence for the cineaste to synthesise cheap philosophy.  Thus, the introductory monologue, which stuck with me for, at most, two minutes into the film, seemed a bit misguided and possibly optional.  Once could choose to remember it if one wished (I did not), because the basic idea of the film was made clear enough when its story began.What followed, apart from a silver-shirt-clad, dyed-hair, slick storyline that had outgrown its days at the mall and moved on to Doc Martens and headshops, was surprisingly effective cinematography, sound, and montage. Lola is faced with a not-impossible situation, and the camera never lets the viewer forget its urgency.  It did lapse into triteness at times, such as shifting of time-flow (namely into slow motion) in dramatic moments, but for the most part the camera followed a jarring and uneven course of action that, ironically, made the heroine's mission plausible.  And while the music was what one would expect-- up to the second, icy, almost anti-emotional synth-drone, it is really the only thing that would work so dramatically: it understates the overload of emotion in the characters but simultaneously adds to the atmosphere of frustration.  The desired effect of constant, relentless motion was easily achieved through masterful guidance of these elements, and where the mind was diverted (through montage, in the bizarre and often grotesque parallels) from the intensity of focus that the storyline demanded, it rarely had time to register any impact before it was forced back to its higher priority.As far as other criticism is concerned, due to its juxtaposition of three parallel stories, many have awarded it the 'Pulp Fiction Label of Bland Unoriginality.'  This was one, though, that actually seemed to draw greater comparisons to Kieslowski's 'Blind Chance,' in that it showed remarkable consequences and intricate complexity stemming from simple actions.  It also compared in presenting the idea that we don't necessarily have control over what we do, and that the notion of parallelism is a system whose workings and consequences aren't affected by us as people but rather as 'instigators.'Perhaps that is 'post-human' after all.",

            "content": "Run Forrest, run!! Wait...wrong movie. Anyways, what happens when you only have 20 minutes to recover a lot of money in order to save your significant other's life? We have ourselves a short movie. This kind of concept couldn't possibly work unless you run the complete thing in slow motion or you provide enough backstory to create another film entirely. Despite the circumstances, Tom Tykwer crafts one heck of a film out of a sure-fire failure design. Using a lot of camera shots, tricks, and angles and using a well-written and drawn-out script, Run Lola Run is unique, yet groundbreaking and suspenseful to the very end.Lona Rennt is a German film that picks up from the moment a soccer ball is thrown, and refuses to slow down from the point on. The only moments of slow-down occur in the only moments of backstory, which even then doesn't last long. They are more like little breaks the audience gets to take after surviving the latest heart-pounding sequence of events. Like previously mentioned, the plot is Lola is a tough yet sensitive girl that must find a way to save her boyfriend in 20 minutes or the inevitable will happen. Facing the death of a loved one in 20 minutes, she has to come up with something, fast. And, she has to run\u0085fast.This is easily a film that can be destroyed if given to the wrong hands. Tarantino, Leone, and Martin Scorsese are directors that would have trouble with this idea, since its short and straight to the point, and demands a total lack of long shots. Tykwer on the other hand, handles it so well, that despite the length and the repetitive instances of Lola's run for her life, the movie never becomes tiring. Its even presented in so many different ways, ranging from speedy to slow-motion, to a plethora of camera angles, to even animated sequences. These techniques are all used three times (watch the movie, you'll see why) but never once does it become a chore to go through.Acting isn't exactly a necessity in a film that barely clocks in at 80 minutes and also requires nothing more than a lot of physical stunts, but it gets the job done nonetheless. Our heroine in the story (or is she?), Franka Potente underwent a lot in order to portray her character Lola, and the payoff is great. She sends the movie the unnecessary extra bit of spark that makes the audience root for her all the way, even if her choices aren't exactly worth rooting for. The other noteworthy performance is that of the victim, the boyfriend, Manni. Played by Moritz Bleibtreu, he makes us sympathize with him despite him getting into the predicament in the first place.Bottom Line: With a bolt of suspenseful electricity, Run Lola Run presents the conflict within the first five minutes, and then shoots out like a bullet out of an automatic, with no signs of slowing down. With only a few breaks in between, you'll be at the edge of your seat as Lola and Manni attempt the impossible and resolve a major money issue within the length of a sitcom episode. A sitcom episode length of time in the plot being stretched into a feature film is nowhere near easy, but thanks to some plot twists, plenty of action, thoughtful themes, and hyperactive cinematography, Lola Rennt is a must-see. No need to bring food into this picture, because you'll usually be totally out of breath.",

But did I want to see her running for 60-65 minutes out of an 80-minute movie? No way. I also agree that Tykwer put in a lot of cool camera tricks and technical wizardry, but gimmicks don't make a good movie. Take away the running and the gimmicks and all that's left is a short subject. To make matters worse, the bare-bones plot line (Lola runs to save her boyfriend) is repeated in three similar scenarios with different choices along the way resulting in different final outcomes. This movie has a lot of style with little substance and sparse dialog. I find the butterfly effect (a small change at one point in time has a large effect later on) to be as fascinating as some of the other reviewers here, but a much better movie on the subject is the under-rated 2003 movie, The Butterfly Effect. Some other thoughts: Twice Lola screams so loudly that she breaks glass in the room around her. Her ability to break glass by screaming has nothing to do with the plot and seems to have been put in just to make the movie a little more peculiar. Lola apparently has other unusual abilities as well, like telekinesis. She seems to be able to cause the ball in a roulette game to land on a certain number. And depending on how you interpret the plot, Lola may even be able to go back in time to prevent her own death. However, the movie never explains how Lola is able to do any of these things.I give Run, Lola, Run 4 out of 10.",

Tom Tykwer has created a unique and utterly compelling masterpiece and one of few movies I can honestly call a must-see.Franka Potente is an average-looking German actress (no disrespect to her or her acting skills), in my humble opinion, but she is stunning, absolutely stunning, in this high-energy flick. Franka perfectly brings her off-the-wall, red-haired personality to life and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the titular character. And her singing voice is great, as well! Of course, a movie as explosive and unapologetically entertaining and engrossing as Run Lola Run will have its detractors; this is not a film designed to appeal to as many people as possible. It is unique, no thriller made before or after it has ever come close to its intensity and thrills. \"Run Lola\" has been accused of being everything from shallow to stupid to pointless to \"MTV-styled\" (I can only shake my head at this complaint - you people have obviously never witnessed the horror that is MTV). Calling it pointless is to miss the point. This movie is meant to be stylized, roaring fun and nothing else. It's not meant to change your life, but it might be one of your best ever movie experiences.The film is, like I said, utterly explosive, with the rather more silent moments needed to help the film from becoming a noisy mess. Tykwer's direction is fantastic and his style incomparable. The movie is well acted, well written and often wickedly funny. The interesting idea of splitting one opening into three endings works brilliantly and will leave you asking yourself how much of what you just saw was real, and how much was just fantasy.

He then tells her that he is a dead man unless he or she can somehow come up with 100,000 Marks before noon when Manni's boss, Ronnie, comes to claim the money. Bursting with adrenaline and fear, Lola begins to run both to prevent Manni from doing something outrageous and to get the 100, 000 marks from her father. It is at this point that the film starts to become interesting. Cutting a beautiful figure as she races through the German cityscape, the viewer is able to witness the futures of several minor characters whom Lola encounters through a series of quick still frame images. To make this concept even more interesting, the twenty-minute segment is shown three different times with slight changes. However, these small changes make for drastic changes in the lives of people that Lola encounters. One person, a bike thief, is accosted in one scene only to meet the love of his life at a hospital while in another he becomes a vagrant. Such small things as bumping into someone or not or a slight alteration of words can change the future so much.I originally watched this film back in either the year 2000 or 2001 after a friend of mine watched it in his honors German class. It struck me then as a very entertaining film with an interesting concept. However, now after studying film and literature for a few years in graduate school, it has become apparent to me that while the film has become a must see for a number of hipster crowds it does hold a number of themes that are quite profound, especially the importance of chance in ones life.",

            "content": "ALERT - This review may contain what some people deem to be spoilers... although I don't really think they ruin the surprises of the plot. So if you don't wish to have the movie spoilt, stop reading now!Meet Lola. She's the one with the bright red hair and disgruntled look on her face. See her yet? Yeah, not hard to miss. Meet Manni, Lola's boyfriend. He's the thuggish looking one with the tattoos and confused look on his face. Spotted him too? Good. Manni's in a bit of trouble, which means that Lola is going to be in trouble. It's time to get used to the domino effect idea, because it's the basis of our story line. Manni is in strife because he owes Ronnie (just look for the bald guy with the evil look on his face), 100,000 Marks. Unfortunately for Manni, a bum has that money. Manni needs the money in 20 minutes or he's going to hold up a supermarket to get the money. Lola needs Manni, so therefore she needs money in 20 minutes. Lola's Dad has money, Lola's Dad has a mistress, Lola's Mum has alcohol, the security guard has a heart attack, and the bank tellers have S&M, whilst Ronnie has a very convincing evil grin.\nFeeling confused? You should be. This film doesn't only aim to appeal to audiences, but also aims to make them sit in the cinema scratching their heads. It isn't all bad; Director Tom Tykwer lets his audience see the story three times. Granted there are subtle differences each time. In any case, if you walk out of the movie feeling like you need to have your brain syringed, you won't be the only one!With so much confusion, one would hope that there is some kind of deep and meaningful reason for this visual attack that puts Baz Luhrmann to shame. And there is. Along with the camera angles that have been technically termed `Drug Induced', Tykwer hints to messages dealing with fate and destiny, chance and time. Don't worry, you're not spoon-fed these, so if you don't want to think whilst watching the movie, you don't have to!The most symbolic sections of the movie are the `red' scenes. How does a guy who has spent the entire movie pressing every button on the side of his video camera, add meaning to it? Have the two main actors lying in bed talking about life, the universe and everything else, whilst someone holds a piece of red cellophane over the camera lens. Obvious, wasn't it? This is surprisingly effective. Not only does Tykwer give us a chance to blink, you are also able to draw your eyes away from Lola's hair. In any case, we are left with thought provoking questions from these scenes. Is reality really real? Do the relationships we have, hold any meaning? Does fate control us, or do we control fate? Doesn't Lola's Dad look like Agent Smith from `The Matrix'? Most of these questions are answered in the `red' scenes, which are, unlike the rest of the movie, direct shots taken from above the two actors. This technique is used for contrast. It's quite entertaining to see that Tykwer can actually hold a camera still, an amazing feat, considering the `home theatre' style filming of the only other \u0091calm' section of the movie, those involving Agent Smith, I mean Lola's Dad.\nYou can excuse me for taking some `trava-calm' before these scenes. With jerky camera motions, you feel as if you're a fly on the wall looking into the sordid life of Lola's Dad. I have nothing against this. `Yay voyeurism' and all that. Personally, I'll take `Survivor' if I want reality T.V. For some reason, I think having half the audience woozy may not have been number one on Tykwer's list of goals. The calm scenes are in great contrast to the other scenes in the film. The providing a startling counterpoint to the otherwise manic fashion of the movie. The other point of the calm scenes is that there is acting. Tykwer startles us all by having real, `true to life' acting from both Lola's father and his mistress.Now, I've made a few references to the manic way that this movie is filmed. Is it manic! I mean, if you thought that a ferret on pixie stix directed Moulin Rouge, I'd hate to imagine what kind of tripping animal was behind the camera in this movie! (An Ocelot on LSD perhaps?) In any case, Tykwer's visual onslaught is mind blowing. The cinematography in this movie has everything! There's animation, shifts between perspectives, photographic essays, this is a film with the lot! Each different style lends it self to Tykwer's themes (remember them? Fate, Destiny and all that?)Now the one thing that I haven't mentioned is the soundtrack. It's loud, it's techno, and it's brilliant. That's it. I'm not going to elaborate on that, the soundtrack was great.Okay, crunch time: My final opinion. This was a good movie. It was a strange movie. It was a confusing movie, but it was very good. Tykwer has put in more twists and turns than most `Young and the Restless' episodes. The quirky nature of its structure is brilliant. There are references to time, destiny and fate. Acting, when it's there, is outstanding, whilst Lola, well\u0085 She can run! Tykwer's achieved what he has set out to, a powerful movie, which is clever, thought provoking and visually amazing. If you haven't seen this movie already, get up and go hire it. Go on. Stop reading and start walking! Otherwise, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this movie rocked.",

Franka Potente possibly turns in her best performance as the redheaded punkster Lola trying to save her boyfriend from a drug deal gone sour due to unforseen circumstances.  Each retelling of the story has different implications on all characters that are either directly or indirectly involved.  \"Lola Rennt\" begs the question about time and circumstance itself.  Do our own actions if changed completely alter things to come?  Is destiny already plotted out for us or is it what we make of it? Tom Tykwer (this is his best film) only raises the questions and it is our own responsibility to draw the conclusions.  Overall, I think this is the best film I have seen from Germany since \"Der Krieger\".  It is quite possibly best schizophrenic, fast-paced film of all time.  Well-written, well-acted, well-filmed, and with cool music and animation, I give this film 10 out of 10!Destiny is a very touchy subject.  Draw your conclusions about it.  Here ends my rant!",

            "content": "Run Lola Run is the best use of style over substance that I have seen in at least 20 years. It's a stylish epic told at a manic pace, and director Tom Tykwer masterfully controls the tone of all of its myriad different sequences. It careens chaotically through choices and the paths of numerous people's lives, going so fast at many times that the audience is barely even able to keep up. Oftentimes it is unclear why the choices that have been made affect others' lives so deeply, but still this doesn't matter. What this film is is a frenzy of lavish camera moves, superb use of tension and recurring motifs, strange twists, feverish philosophy, and just the right amount of quiet, still scenes to keep the audience from growing fatigued (Neveldine & Taylor could learn something). While many have dubbed it a \"no-brainer\", I would argue that this film goes deeper than that, though by how much I can't be quite sure. It is incredibly fast, but also grounded by fleshed out characters, a complex web of narratives, and excellent performances all around. It's opening sequence and the narration over it give hints of some vague philosophical undertones, regarding the hustle and bustle of nameless persons and the strangers whose lives you affect in ways which you cannot begin to imagine. And with its interesting narrative structure (which would be a spoiler if I elaborated on it, but trust me, it's very interesting) leaves some contemplation; how much of the film was real? Was it all real? Is multiverse theory real in this universe? (Okay, now I'm right up against it, so I'll stop) I'm not sure if even Tykwer knows the answers to these questions, but the fact remains that this is a superbly directed, ridiculously fun and idiosyncratic film. While it is very similar in themes to the 1987 Polish film blind chance, it is the style that manages to give Run Lola Run an entirely original, gleefully fresh feel. While I fear that this may be Tom Tykwer's magnum opus even at the age of only 50, this is a spectacular, whirlwind, layered, and passionate legacy to leave.",

            "content": "Run, Lola, Run is a thoroughly postmodern film. Stylistically, the film uses a variety of visual devices and storytelling strategies that are increasingly common in postmodern films. In theme, the film captures the essence of a postmodern worldview by treating life as a series of random occurrences devoid of any central meaning. Run, Lola, Run is really a short avant-garde film told three different times with variations on theme.Our central characters are Manni and Lola, a couple living on the fringe of underworld life in Germany. The story begins with Manni calling Lola in desperation. He had taken an assignment to deliver some illegal materials in exchange for 100,000 deutschmarks. As manning is riding the subway home, after the exchange, police board the train. Manni is so unnerved that he exits the train leaving his bag of money behind. He has twenty minutes to find and deliver the money of his life is forfeit. Lola tells him to not do anything rash, slams down the phone, and takes off running.This is the starting point of all three acts of this three-act play. Each time through something slightly different occurs at the beginning. This seemingly trivial event changes the trajectory of the action, which affects everyone, and everything involved in slightly different ways. The message here is that the significance we attach to our lives is the result of random events over which we have little control. It is fitting that the most positive of the three different endings involves a casino and a game of chance. This film is not exactly inspiring, but it is profound and very well done. This is not a film to build a life around, but it is an important film about the postmodern milieu, and Tom Twykwer's writing and direction are creative and engaging.",

But to be serious...Much of it is, as others have noted, just a rehash of ideas first used in 'Sliding Doors' and 'Groundhog Day'. Tykwer, however, isn't interested in being twee or slushy, preferring to subject us to an intense beating soundtrack, and an editing style which makes Russ Meyer look like a first-year film student with ten thumbs. Yes, the narrative repetitions risk becoming boring (and thank goodness the film is so short), and there are moments which seem to have been slotted in to pad the experience out for a decent length of time, but the way the narrative plays with temporal and spatial concepts is brilliant, albeit in a flashy way. The mixed media (conventional film, video, animation) again may not be new (Natural Born Killers, even Annie Hall, for heaven's sake) but, darn it, it works.This isn't a profound film, and it would be easy to criticise it as gimmicky.

Please see this movie in its original language.'Lola Rennt' is one of the most significant films I have seen.  I can (and often do) analyze and praise it for hours on end, but rather than repeat a lot of the good comments made by others, I'll just bring up a few things many seem to have missed.The single most important point is that the old \"butterfly effect\" theme isn't simply being picked up and used, but rather subjected to an interesting and novel analysis.  Lola learns in subtle ways from one timeline to the next; thus, the timelines are inherently ordered, and not, as some have suggested, just three options that the viewer gets to choose between.  For example, in the first timeline Lola doesn't know how to take the gun's safety off, but in the second timeline, when her father says, \"You don't know how to use that thing,\" she coolly shows that she does.We see that Lola has a special relationship to chance, not only through this strange process of learning from \"previous\" (ponder that one!) timelines, but also through her screams, which she uses to gain control over a situation spiraling away from her.  In the third timeline, of course, it even directs the course of the roulette ball.  Something else, rarely mentioned, is that she seems  able to make the guard's heart stop with her focussed anger (an \"evil-eye\", if you will.)  In the ambulance, she shows the opposite power as well.The overall impression is that she is a contemporary kind of \"witch\", living in the world of chaos through a kind of mystical energy.  I'm reminded of the ever-increasing set of stupid dance movies, whose climaxes turn on the energy of the dance breaking down personal and cultural barriers, and I'm thinking that Tykwer put his finger on this weird (religious?) hope that many of us are prone to, that will and control can manifest themselves if we just \"run\" hard enough.There are so many interesting questions to be mined.  The bedroom scenes, for example.  Obviously, Lola is the one concerned about mortality, transience, and insignificance in the timeline following her death, and Manni in the one following his. My question is: are these timeline-specific flashbacks, such that each of them foretold their own death, or are they something else, like biased memories, or what they wished they had said?What's even more amazing is that all of the topics I've mentioned are integrated so well from a stylistic standpoint.  The music, the running, the use of split screens, the effect of the screams to slow things stylistically, the \"breather\" effect of the bedroom scenes, contribute to a movie that stands apart from other much-discussed treatments of chance and complicated causal chains, like the forgettable 'Sliding Doors', or the very moving 'Amores Perros' and '13 Conversations about One Thing', which present chance as a force independent of us, along which we are carried.",

Basically Lola (The Bourne Identity's Franka Potente) is phoned by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) who is panicking, because he has lost 100,000 marks after leaving it on a train next to a homeless tramp. He needs this money which belongs to a gangster, so naturally there will be consequences if he doesn't give it back, and Lola has only twenty minutes to somehow raise this money and meet him outside the convenience store he is considering robbing. Lola drops the phone, and runs through the street of Berlin to go and ask her father Vater (Herbert Knaup) for the money, and on the way she causes an innocent passer by to have a road accident. She reaches her father at the bank, and he refuses to help her, saying that he feels unappreciated, that he is leaving her mother for his mistress, and that he is not her real father. Manni meanwhile has indeed robbed the convenience store for the money he needs, and Lola running catches him in action, and the only things she can do is help, and then they both escape, and she ends up accidentally shot by a cop. We see a quick scene of Lola and Manni in bed together as she is asking him how much she means to him, and this is when the story rewinds back to the point when she drops the phone. This is the start of another alternative run, where she again runs to her father for the 100,000 marks, and on the way she again causes a road accident, but it is instead her father's business partner. She had the same dog on the staircase on the way down barking, and this time she tripped, meaning she is a little later due to a limp, but at the bank he again refuses to give her money. So this time she steals a gun and robs him for the money, the police outside mistake her for a fugitive, and Manni spots her before he plans to rob the store, but he is hit by an ambulance in the middle of the road. It again shows a quick scene of Lola and Manni in bed where he is instead asking about her feelings for him, and it rewinds again back to the point where she drops the phone. This is the final alternative run, where Lola misses the dog on the stairs, and there is no road accident, her father and his partner go in a car together before she can get to ask him for any money. So she enters a casino and buys a single 100 mark chip to bet on the roulette wheel, and the first time she is happy to win, but the second time on the same number is extraordinary to everyone, giving her 126,000 marks to help Manni. She hitches a ride in the ambulance (that would have killed Manni), and it is her father and his partner who have a road accident, while Manni has coincidentally found the tramp who stole his money. In the end Manni got the money back, Lola gets to the meeting point and is worried something has happened, but they reunite after the gangster have been paid off, she is obviously still clutching she won for herself. Also starring Ludger Pistor as Herr Meier, Armin Rohde as Mr. Schuster, Nina Petri as Jutta Hansen, Suzanne Von Borsody as Frau J\u00e4ger and Sebastian Schipper as Mike. Potente gives a great frantic performance as the girl running against the clock, but it is the three runs that make all the difference, as they are repeating familiar scenarios to give the idea of how a small change can determine the fate of the characters, an idea later imitated in films like Sliding Doors, with clever use of jump cuts, colour turning, speeding and blurring, all adding up to an exciting crime drama.

Admittedly it is THE German film of recent times worth talking about and made a correspondingly large amount of money, but ask yourself - what is it comprised of? three simple remakes of possible endings to a \"my boyfriend is in trouble and i've got to save him to prove my love for him\" scenario. Are these the girl's fantasies about how to save the relationship, rerun, replayed and re-edited. It might hit a spot for women, a central female character with a 'feminist' vocabulary, but if that is what it is and why it is popular then I for one am glad that more like this are not made. View Winterschlaefer instead, a much better piece by the director. Even Mary Poppins watched seven times in a row, followed by seven-of-the-best from A Sound Of Music is more satisfying, and more likely to keep me awake than this once she starts running, again.",

            "content": "Run Lola, Run is a fast-paced kinetic thriller that doesn't waste a second of your time. It tells the story of a young woman called Lola who has 20 minutes to get hold of 100,000 German marks for her boyfriend Manni, who desperately needs it to appease a violent gangster. The story is completely unremarkable. What makes the film standout is the way in which the simple narrative is told. It uses the ideas of the chaos theory to tell its story three times. Each story features Lola running from her flat to her father's office and then to her boyfriend Manni. The subsequent re-tellings deviate from the one before, beginning with outcome of the decision Lola makes in how to avoid a lout and his angry dog in her stairwell. The seemingly insignificant differences here become bigger and bigger as Lola's high-speed run is knocked out of sync, resulting in enormous differences further down the line.With a name like Run Lola, Run perhaps it's unsurprising that this is a movie that moves along at a very fast pace. There are three alternate realities explored crammed into the film's short running time. It's tight film-making with no excess fat. The pounding techno soundtrack is highly appropriate in that it reflects the high-tempo pacing; and it's nice to see a film where techno music is used with some degree of purpose. The various camera trickery used throughout also does not feel forced either. The jump cuts and kinetic nature of the cinematography feels right in this story. Together, the soundtrack and visuals work very well together. I also liked the little cartoon segment that began each run. It was a nice and humorous stylistic addition. Acting-wise, Franka Potente is particularly good as Lola. She puts in a highly energetic and athletic performance. Her striking red haired look is great too. The rest of the small cast are effective too and director Tom Tykwer holds things together nicely.The central idea that our destinies often hinge on the smallest, most seemingly insignificant decisions is explored excellently in this film, with style and some humour. It's a trip well worth re-taking.",

Plotwise the film deals with parallel universes,as referred to with the promotional slogan, `Jeden Tag, jede Sekundetriffst Du eine Entscheidung, die Dein Leben ver\u00e4ndern kann.'  Thisdoesn't bog the film down with metaphysical debate, and is shown onlythrough plot.  It comes up as Lola passes people in the street and aseries of images of their future lives strobe across the screen.  Ineach of the three scenarios the flashing images change slightly. Parallel universes is a good way of dealing with the movie beingsubstantially longer than the amount of time the drug dealers giveLola's boyfriend to get the money.  Basically this allows the incidentof Lola trying to get money to be shown in real time multiple times.\t  This was a good film, because the philosophical content was notdelivered in the form of a melodramatic monologue and hence cannot beedited out and doesn't seem crammed in.

As the title suggests, the film is centered around Lola, a spirited red head who's in love with her boyfriend, Manni. Sadly for her, Manni has gotten himself into a great deal of trouble, and she has only twenty minutes to avert disaster.Although the plot seems simple, it is how it plays out that is really interesting: The story is repeated three times with subtle changes affecting the outcome. Each time it shows how the simplest moments of interaction, (e.g) Running into a woman), can change how an event pans out in less then a second, and it's very entertaining to find out how it ends. Although it may seem boring to show what is often the same events over and over, it is the kinetic visual flair and cinematography that makes it worthwhile, with even animation being used.Even though it is highly enjoyable, it is still unlikely to be one of those films you can come back to, and apart from this the plot is quite shallow. Also, the tech-no music may seem a bit uninspired for some, but this still succeeds because of it's originality and style. Definitely worth a look.",

And I believe it's a true fact that even what can seem the most insignificant of things can affect the world in so many different ways. It depends on what way to perceive this notion because some will say most things only have a very slight influence on life, while very few things can actually change a whole situation around you. It's certainly a concept that has been studied many times in the media, but Run, Lola, Run sums it up perfectly and helps prove the fact that the tiniest thing can change everything.The film revolves around a woman called Lola who gets an urgent call from her boyfriend, Manni. He explains that he's managed to lose a bag full of \"dirty\" money that he needs to deliver to his big-time gangster boss and if he fails that's an end for his life. So Lola has 20 minutes in which she has to get the money or Manni will be forced to rob a supermarket\u0085 At heart Run, Lola, Run is a German action film that feels like something Luc Besson would fall in love with. At the start of the film I felt the film looked trashy and over-stylized. Yet, as the film went on it started to delve into becoming a literal and rapidly fast drama that revolved around action to grab the viewer. The film works around an image and that's an image of a women running, I interpret this image as a metaphor for the fact that life is one big rush. Run, Lola, Run is a roller-coaster that'll keep you engrossed from the unique distinctive opening to the over-used ending which lacks a needed resolution.Technically speaking the film is stunning and has some better technical aspects than pretty much every \"big-buck\" Hollywood film. The editing is the deluxe factor of the film as it helped grabbed the viewing in the engaging plot line. For a film that relies on what you could say was \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" it manages to not be repetitive. There are so many techniques scattered throughout the film that manage to be intelligent \"eye candy\" for the viewer. It's a film to appeal to the Generation X who might perceive lots of stylized film making creates a masterwork. The film is far deeper than just highly-intelligent film making skills, though it does work as perfect visual entertainment. The only style I disliked was the animation sequences which seemed highly irrelevant. Another one of the film's high points is the music which fits flawlessly in accompaniment to the scenes it's used in.I've always been a lover of films that are visually impressive to eye and technically absorbing, but that is not what just makes a good film. So it's an accomplishment that there is an intelligent and underlying tone to the film about how everyone should use time wisely. I highly recommend Run, Lola, Run, certainly a must-see film that will particularly appeal to anyone who likes their fair share of high-octane cinematic delight.",

Ingredients include a grinding techno soundtrack; a gorgeous, athletic heroine; cartoon-style action (sometimes actually rendered through the use of real cartoons); the special abilities of the character (\"the scream of death\"); a ferocious pace; the real-time depiction of the action; a variety of endings; and the way that \"winning\" depends on manipulating a limited series of elements in exactly the right combination.  If every film was like this, I'd give up watching cinema - but 'Run, Lola, Run' is refreshing and fun, a movie of pure adrenaline.Aside from the originality of the presentation, the film is more successful than other movies that similarly show alternative endings ('Groundhog Day' and 'Sliding Doors' both come to mind).  It lacks the sentimentality of the former, while the latter really gave us two completely separate stories.  In truth, life is too complex to imagine \"what if?\".

And continue doing that until you finally make it through. And that's exactly how the events depicted in Run Lola Run unfold.Presenting 3 different alternatives of a single event, Run Lola Run begins with Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Manny who lost 100,000 Deutschmark which belongs to a mob he was working for. Lola has 20 minutes to raise that money & meet him or else he goes to rob a store. As Lola starts her run, we see her bumping into different people & how their lives are changed for better or worse through this minor encounter with Lola.The direction by Tom Tykwer is as stylish as it is brilliant. The script has an engaging complexity & the lush cinematography plus clever editing makes the drama even more compelling. Plus, Lola is one hell of a character who can break glasses with her screams, has the running stamina of Forrest Gump & is superbly played by Franka Potente. Even the guy who plays Manny is good and the little animation present in the film is wonderfully carried out.Another amazing thing I loved about this film is the little flash-forward segments depicting the aftermath of the people's lives Lola keeps bumping into & how she has affected them all.

            "content": "Lola Rennt / Run Lola Run (1998) :\nBrief Review -Fails as a Time-Loop thriller but makes a solid texture of modern experimental cinema. German Cinema once used to rule World Cinema, and there was no one to compete them. Well, that way back, almost 100 years ago, in the 1920s decade when German filmmakers gave birth to so many genres like Sci-Fi, Horror and Fantasy with films like 'The Golem' (1920), 'Nosferatu' (1922), 'Metropolis' (1926) and many more. Then the talkies era began and Hollywood took over the cinema world and is still ruling- both content and box office wise. German Cinema made many great classics over the years but haven't been able to rule that specific genre or theme. That's exactly what happens with Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run too. Hollywood has been through with this Time-Loop concept already, besides, British, Korean and Japanese cinema were also done with it. Tom Tykwer's film came too late to be called a modern classic or pathbreaking cinema, but it is surely one hell of a experimental film. Experience the experimental cinema at its experimental best. After a botched money delivery, Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks. Just about 80 minutes long and rightly so because it doesn't give you any chance to take your eyes off screen. It's too pacy to miss any glimpse. An experiment of showing picturised graphics works absolutely fine. You know, in Time-Loop films you already know what's gonna happen when the events happen in repeat mode but in this film there's a trick. You see the same characters but they come with different proportions in every loop. Every frame has something to show and every time something different. The film fails to make sense in Time-loop segments as some things go terribly wrong and especially the climax, which is too predictable, but nonetheless, it's a gorgeous piece of artistic and experimental cinema.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Now he's desperate because he know he'll die if he can't get the money within about 20 minutes. Too bad if you're a criminal!The movie is stupid because there is no explanation to the three parts. You're simply left to yourself to figure out what sense this all makes. In the end, you have seen three movies, so to speak, and then you can choose for yourself which part, which ending, you like best.

Sometimes artistically so like Metropolis and sometimes dramatically, like Lives of Others and Fitzcaraldo. Run Lola Run is striking too. It is hip, funny, clever and has incredible energy. Sometimes that is all a film needs.The plot begins with a phone call. A young man in a phone booth calls his girlfriend Lola, and tells her that he is gonna die in twenty minutes. He owes a hundred grand to some mafia guys, which he had earlier, but he lost it on the subway. Now he is considering robing the grocery store across the street, but Lola tells him to stay put. She drops everything, and takes off to try and get the money. What follows is three different story approaches to how she gets that money, and each time she encounters the same people in slightly different ways.The first film that came to mind when Run Lola Run ended, was Jackie Brown. Both are crime related stories which offer multiple points of view, but while Jackie Brown was slow, plotting and uninteresting, this one is strait forward, fluid and offers characters that you actually care about. One of the more important motifs of the film is the way that society runs on time. Here is an extreme case, because it presents a life or death situation, but that is why the film is so cleaver. Equally impressive is it's photography. The camera is always moving, and rarely stops, plus the director uses great angles. If there is a problem with Run Lola Run, I didn't catch it, with comedies, you tend to let plot holes pass by. Run Lola Run is highly improbable and sometimes impossible. But if it wasn't, then it may not have been such a great comedy.",

Run Lola Run is an action packed film and all it has is Lola running.It's great film-making to keep the audience interested, when you are telling the same story three times and the main character is doing the same actions over and over again, with a tweak here and a tweak there. The film has animation in it as well, which adds to the unique aspect that the filmmakers were going for.The main element the filmmakers use to keep us concentrated on the main character is colour. We see her red hair running through the streets and we know it's her. She is able to stand out in a crowd of thousands. Red is used numerous times in this film. The first time we see the colour red is the phone that Lola answers, she is delivered bad news, the bag that Lola carries is also red, as well as the ambulance.One of the recurring themes in the film is choice. We see how our choices affect our lives and the lives of others in the matter of seconds. The choices that Lola makes create different outcomes in each of the scenarios The film reminded me of Man With A Movie Camera (see above), both films have the same quick paced editing style. The film is constantly on the move. The film also uses a cartoon sequences in each story, which adds to the unique and fast paced style of the film.I highly enjoyed this film because it managed to keep my interested despite it telling the same story numerous times.",

I love to watch any films with time traveling! However, I tried not to get my expectations very high because I didn't want to be disappointed but that somehow didn't work because I was a bit disappointed after viewing this movie. God, never shall I read reviews again.Anyway, after learning that lesson, the movie was good, but I expected better, like more recent time movies, like \"The Butterfly Effect,\" which, in my opinion, did it much better. What I was disappointed in this movie is that once you see a person run for a while with the same song in the background, it's spinning its wheels a bit.However, the movie is quite short and each story is short so everything in here is tolerable. I was also annoyed by some comedic things in here because I didn't expect the movie to be entertaining AND funny. I expected it to be serious but I went along with the bland and sometimes unfunny jokes throughout the film.Franka Potente's plays the main character. She had a breakthrough role at \"The Bourne Identity.\" She was great in that film. In here, I guess she was decent. Nothing great though. This is one of those movies which had a great and sophisticated idea but had a mediocre-like execution.Don't expect much from this film or you'll be disappointed. This film is fun yes, but it sometimes spin its wheels and I expected much more from this movie. However, it's still a good movie to kill 75 minutes of your life.",

            "content": "I liked Lola Rennt for what it said about the nature of art. It works on a lot of levels. It comments on all sorts of things, incl. the art of movie-making. In artistic fiction, apparent realism is not an admirable goal; we have to have some kind of structure that makes sense and provides closure (as is also asserted by the opening T.S. Eliot quote). It's like someone once said: \"The difference between reality and fiction is that fiction has to make sense.\" That's why most (not all, but most) works of art have to have happy endings. If things don't go well, it symbolizes the breakdown of everything that is meaningful and rational. Happy endings, on the other hand, symbolize and demonstrate that it is possible and desirable to develop a rational and humane society where things work and people can be happy.Lola Rennt also shows how art accomplishes its goals: By learning from itself over time. Art paints pictures of the possible developments, over and over, in artwork after artwork all the way up through history, and reality then learns from these so that, over time, artistic substance accumulates and truly helps make things turn out for the best.The movie also symbolizes the artistic impulse itself in the form of Lola. It's interesting that modern times are so chaotic and confusing that art has to run really fast and be really smart in order to help the positive social developments along and ensure that all society doesn't collapse in a tragic apocalypse. Art is tremendously important for our large-scale self-knowledge.",

Lola Rennt is like a `Choose Your Own Adventure', only we as the audience don't get to choose \u0096 we just have the various outcomes laid out for us.  There is no depth to the story really, but the way the film is as a whole could not have handled anything more involved than the simple foundation, because there are so many layers to each scenario.  Each segment starts out simply and routine enough, but then we realize that something as simple as stumbling on some stairs and therefore slowing down even by mere seconds creates completely different outcomes to a situation. Not only is this revolving storyline somewhat rare if not innovative, but the way the `stories' of the inconsequential characters are told are just fascinating.  In `don't blink or you'll miss something' 10 second scenes, people that Lola either bumps into while running on the street, or in a building have their fixtures told in a series of flashbulbs and photographs,.  Each time the story begins again, their futures change. Tykwer also employs several stylistic techniques to give the film its frenetic and creative feel \u0096 there is a pounding techno soundtrack playing throughout much of the film, there are different film media involved, (animation and hand-held camera in addition to the `regular' cinematography) and then there is Lola herself.  Franka Potente as Lola is like a live action cartoon character with her shock of clown-red hair, various tattoos and jewelry.  In short, she is positively radiant, and a very engaging figure.Lola Rennt is a fantastic film that on the surface is a fun, unusual piece of art.  When one peels back the layers a bit and looks a little closer at the film however, there is amazing depth to it which warrants multiple viewings.  Not only that, but it's one of those great films that don't really have heroes.  Even Lola is trying to get her boyfriend out of trouble because of a crime gone bad \u0096 a crime that she was originally supposed to help him with in the first place.

There's no time. It's just 3 twenty minute segments of pure suspense. Director Tom Tykwer knows what he's doing. He uses pulse pounding techno music to ratchet up the tension, and then he supplies a number of twists and turns that are actually quite surprising. The actor's do their jobs well, but this is Tykwer's show.In many ways, \"Run Lola Run\" is like \"Speed.\" The same single premise that's expanded on and directed by someone who knows how to ratchet up the tension.One could argue that this is a commentary on the chaos theory, and much of what happens (including the trailer) would suggest that, but this is not an intellectual movie.

He needs the 100,000 Marks he has lost or he'll be killed by the mafioso he has to pass them on in 20 minutes. Lola has a plan to find the money, and take it to Manni on time so he lives. She's on the run.The movie starts with two quotes selected by director Tom Tykwer. The first, by poet T. S. Eliot, says, \"We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time\". The second, by German soccer coach S. Herberger, says, \"after the game is before the game\". Unlike other movies, these are not pedantic quotations, but are really directly linked to the way the story is presented and filmed.The story is shot three times, with slight differences regarding the positioning of the actors, slightly different timing in the action, and changes in the possible scenes, which produce dramatically different endings and future predictions for all the characters. Only the scene regarding Lola's mum, shot in pastels while she's talking on the phone, does not change in the movie. Unlike other movies of the sort, this is not a pre-deterministic movie. The message of the movie, to me, is that the fact that you ran faster doesn't mean that you're gonna get there earlier. For that to happen, you'll need to run in the right direction, at the proper pace, and have a bit of luck. Life is a game, a net of chances, and minor changes bring dramatic different endings. Lola has three different ways of approaching the same challenge, and has three lives, like in a video-game, to succeed.Although the movie is action-packed, its core is grounded in the deep love the couple has, which is explained in infra-red colored flashbacks with both characters in bed talking about their relationship. Without that, the movie would have been just another ran and catch story. Another great thing is that the roles are reversed in this film: the hero is a woman trying to rescue her man from trouble, not the opposite; she takes the lead, she is the one running and making things happen.The movie was shot in three different formats, steady video-cam for the running action scenes, 35mm movie cam (color, BW and infrared) for the settled steady scenes, with an important animated clip that serves as credits opening but then becomes part of the story. The movie contains present, past and future action, and uses split screens effectively to show relevant events happening to both Manni and Lola.Colour is very important in this movie, but not overwhelmingly so. There are very bright color enhancements that break the visual monotony of the urban settings and the settled interior scenes: Lola's red-orange hair perfectly matches her blue-green pastel outfit, the orange ambulance, the men in yellow carrying the big glass, the blood-red telephone, and the infra-red scenes, among others. Moreover, the flashbacks are shot in B&W, while the flash-forwards of the secondary characters are shot in subdued colors, very much like a worn out movie of the 1970s would look like.I loved the OST and selection of songs, whose lyrics perfectly describe what is happening in the story, and the mood of the characters and scene at the precise moment it is playing. The beat of the movie, the one that gives its pace and rhythm to it, is the techno-song sung by Potente, a catchy powerful and repetitive piece that also matches perfectly Lola's determination and angst; it has also something of video-game music, in a way, as the running without the music would look somewhat deflated.Franka Potente honors her surname and has a great energy in this film. She runs with a great easiness and power. She is also able to stop and act dramatically, be sweet, nasty, crazy - always fresh and believable. Moritz Bleibtreu shows a great dramatic talent to showcase his character in the few minutes that he has on camera. The rest of the cast are also good in their respective roles (Herbert Knaup as Lola's father; Nina Petri as Frau Hansen, the mistress of Lola's father; Armin Rohde as bank security guard Schuster, and Ludger Pistor as Mr Meier, among others).Two main flaws. The opening of the movie after the credits, with hundred of people moving around and some questions being posed to the spectator, is really pretentious, and I thought does not add anything to the script or the movie in general, especially because the two initial quotations already establish the concept around which the movie revolves. There is goof, too, in the scene of Lola talking to Manni trough the glass window of the supermarket, which has no verisimilitude; however, the mood and energy of the film is such at that moment that this does not matter or bother the viewer, who believes it.A great action movie, super-entertaining, with more depth that one can think at first sight.",

It's fast paced with lots of quick cutting and wonderful editing that really captures the rush these characters are going through (well, just Lola really) it's something I've only really seen in \"Requiem For A Dream\" where the editing is so brave and frantic, only here it's used for very different reasons. Let's just say thanks to the unusual editing and directing, \"Run Lola Run\" never gets boring.The screenplay is very solid and focused, if not a bit far-fetched, would bumping into a woman really mean that she'd end up kidnapping her baby but not bumping into her cause her to win the lottery? No. But this doesn't really matter, the whole point of \"Run Lola Run\" is to give you a fin and entertaining experience and it certainly succeeds in doing that. Each scenario has edge-of-your seat moments and should maybe have your heart racing if you're unfit.The music sometimes feels more like a trashy German pop video (which comes as an extra on the DVD wahay!) but luckily for me I quite like that, but it might bug some people. The acting is quite good as well, the poor woman who played Lola must've had a hard time running all that time and having not to appear too much out of breath, I know I would'nt be able to do it.All in all, \"Run Lola Run\" is a fun and unusual experience. This type of edgy film-making is very rare and it's obvious to me why this is such a cult classic. It's a little masterpiece that offers more than most big budget American productions. Get a few friends round, open a bottle of Cava and watch \"Run Lola Run\". It's a short, swift thrill ride and you'll be doing the most exercise without ever leaving your seat.",

            "content": "I'd say it's virtually philosophical -- the film started out so: the prologue poses various questions -- not after two quotes were initially presented. Writer-director (w-d) Tom Tykwer's RUN LOLA RUN kinda hearkens to what w-d Peter Howitt's SLIDING DOORS gave us -- the What Ifs in life. And Fate, perhaps? Tykwer's seems to be more of a scientific mathematical calculation, where molecules disintegrate and collide -- almost metaphysical chance. No, no, it's not complex at all -- in fact, the film is very visually presented, along with a soundtrack that propels the pace and urges you on running along side with Lola. And by the third time round, you pretty much expects (or let be) what you (Lola) would do when the third option occurs. It is cleverly done. Where one segment ends, a question rises to begin the next. There is animation, too, appropriately applied for the particular section of the story -- hm, giving Lola a physical break or breather?Good performance all round, from Lola (Franka Potente) the central character, to Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) her boyfriend, her father, the lady in his office, the bank security guard, the woman with the cart, the biker, the man in the black car, the three guys/gansters in the white car, the homeless person, the ambulance driver, etcetera, etcetera. Yes, quite an involvement of supporting casts -- isn't life full of little coincidences and people of all sorts -- so Tykwer is pointing out to us.By the third round, we're pretty relaxed, we're ready for chuckles and Tykwer introduced humor along with suspenseful sequences, yet in a paradoxically calm unhurried pace -- in spite of the acute awareness that the clock is ticking towards noon alright. He even 'paused' to include a literally touching scene -- by reason and psychology, what Lola did was actually possible and if people can take the time to do what she did (and it was only a minute or two), the world can be a more beautiful place and filled with human warmth! Or, you just might think by now Lola can (has the power to) do practically anything!You will feel good after this film. Subtitles are easy read. You can pretty much guess what they're saying after two rounds. Well done, Tom Tykwer and company. Cheers to Sony Picture Classics for distributing this. It's refreshing to see a production of such zesty efforts. It's theme sure prompts us that there's always a way -- a solution to a problem; it may not be exactly 'your' way, but despair not, keep an open mind and a solution there'd be. Just be.",

It also gives insight into the true true nature of the human condition-- people may be one thing one moment and another the next -- it depends upon them time & place you meet them. Also, appearances are deceiving: the scene with the nanny is classic. Lola's visit to the bank and dad are compelling as the eyes of the security guard seem to be the only ones paying attention to the depth & pain portrayed by Lola as she interacts with dad & mistress.

            "content": "Way back in 1998, I remember watching a German program on the local TV station, it was there I saw the making and I heard the director and film critics comments about the film. I was also opportune to see clips of the movie Run Lola Run, and a music video featuring the star.Well I never forgot about the movie, but I never thought I could one day find German movies. Well thanks to the global world becoming more unified I did and it was a good price to pay to see Run Lola Run finally after 14 years.Mind you it is a German movie subtitled in English.The movie stars Franka Potente, who you can remember as Jason Bourne's love interest in the Bourne film series and as Eva Heissan in the British American show on BBC America Copper.Run Lola Run shows the place of determination in human life.The thing that I like most about this flick is the use of chaos theory's butterfly effect, which tells us how small inputs in the initial condition of the lives of the people in the movie, like running into someone, or distracting them resulted in a drastic change in that individual's life in a large scale in the near future.To show these butterfly effect flash-forward sequences of still images showing the future effect in the future lives of those Lola come across.The Runs in the movie had different implications in the future of each person Lola's path crosses; some were devastating while others were beautiful.The movie plot is straight forward simple; Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) have a problem.Manni lost 100,000 German Marks (which is about 50,000 Euros) belonging to his crime boss by accidentally leaving it on a train. Lola was supposed to pick him up but she failed because she got sidetracked.Now Manni has to deliver the money in the next 20 mins and he knows if he shows up without it he is dead.Telling Lola all this on the phone caused her to worry and she promised to meet Manni up with the money in 20 mins.So the \"Runs\" begin and Lola is seen running to her father hoping to get the money.The film features 3 runs with each different from the first and each presenting a different outcome based on how she reacted to things around her.The movie is directed masterfully by Tom Tykwer who will be working with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the 2012 movie Cloud Atlas.If you like a movie that leaves you to pick how it ends then this is for you, like wise if you like an exciting movie just join the band wagon.

But where as la Femme Nakita didn't really impress me, Run Lola Run was great the first time I saw it, and even better the second time.The plot is actually three short stories, inter cut with little parts involving Lola and Manni discussing their relationship. The scenes where Lola and Manni are talking about that are interesting, but the main reason this movie works for me is how it just gets my adrenaline pumping. This is a fun, fun movie. I loved the main character and wanted to see her save her boyfriend. It's pretty much told in real time, which you may think is a bad idea and may get boring, but the running scenes are shot very well, there is a little shaky cam, but not too much and I can still tell what's going on.The soundtrack is great, this is what really makes the running scenes thrilling. Maybe it's because when I exercise I'm always listening to music, but I really liked the songs they used.And the movie is really interesting, as it shows how one little change can completely alter the events of your life.

In the most touching of the movie's many highbrow guest appearances, Joachim Kr\u00f3l plays Norbert van Au, a homeless person. Featured most prominently in the third and final episode, Norbert can hardly believe his luck when Manni, a small time crook running from the ticket inspectors, leaves behind a plastic bag with 100.000 Deutschmarks on the subway train. But it doesn't last. Norbert barely gets to flash the cash at his favorite takeout joint before Manni hunts him down and retrieves the money (which, of course, wasn't his to begin with). Norbert parts easily with his new-found wealth; he knows no fortune in the world could make him a rich man. Manni gave, and Manni has taken away. But Norbert doesn't come out entirely empty-handed. He takes Manni's gun. Robbing the robber, he teaches us a karmic lesson in the power of patience. There is no way to fortune. Fortune is the way.",

This at least explains to me why some people can hate a movie that others rave about and love. People are seeking in art of all kinds of duplication and a validation of their thoughts and feelings of whatever stripe, and a pleasurable discharge of emotion that enables them to leave the theater feeling all is right with the world or at bottom that somebody finally 'got' what was bugging them all along.'Run Lola Run' is a film I can understand. It starts out on an unabashedly philosophical tangent and presents a heroine who has to solve a problem in twenty minutes or else it's curtains for her boyfriend. So she starts running to a rock and roll beat to piece together some kind of solution. As in a game, she gets three turns that display novel scenarios and a different result each time. Every now and then she will employ a tactic that defies logic, but you go with it because the Lola as played by Franke Potente is so obviously at her wit's end and pulling out all the stops.This is a film that is baldfacedly about Time with flashbacks and flash forwards galore and all sorts of 'what if' speculations about the nature of 'once in a lifetime' chance encounters. This gives the film a visual richness that is absorbing even as all that running that Lola does gives the film a driving pace.There is something beautiful just about seeing someone running that is an aesthetic all it's own. It is an expression and assertion of youth that always believes it can solve its problems with bursts of the abundant energy it has at its command. Add to this someone running to solve a Life and Death situation and what more is needed besides high angle bird's eye shots that zoom in to close shots of great detail at just the right time?The characters of Lola and her boyfriend are not particularly admirable, and yet are affluent enough to consider criminality and the role of an outlaw as suitable lifestyle choices. You never get the feeling that poverty or want is forcing them to make choices; only their own angst and boredom. One of the ways of viewing this film is to imagine Lola running in three parallel universes toward a different outcome. The other way is to take the viewpoint that '- if at first you don't succeed - ', well, you know the rest...There is something that is really Eastern about this film that any Hindu would appreciate, but it has a Western drive that is exhilarating rather than enervating. Something to do with guns and money and clocks and Casinos and roulette wheels. But at least you will not be pondering why Lola runs.",

The film pumps on a techno soundtrack which competes with the best works by the best DJ's, and the spirit of the movie is the one of a rave party: \"live it up\". In this video game, Lola must gather a lot of money for her boyfriend who is in danger, since he lost his boss' money, forgetting it in the city subway. The result is that Lola has 30 minutes to get the money somehow, and here we get to watch three ways to do it. The premise to be explored here is that \"every decision we take affects the whole our lives\", and here we get to see the changes Lola makes one people's destinies, as she crosses them on the street. Like the title predicts, a new concept of \"human speed\" is coined during the feature-length. And although Franka Potente says she ran at least three times more than we see in the movie, we get tired just watching as she crosses the streets of Berlin in search of a quantity of money she doesn't know how she will get. All the visual resources entitled to these narrative and cinematic characteristics have their moments to appear, including split-screens, black and white, slow-mo and animated sequences, which makes it look like a video game where Lola is the puppet, confronted with three different fates. I could maybe notice a few pretension too many in that far-fetched opening, but once I saw the picture, I could not complain. It is obvious that director Tykwer was like a bomb anxious to explode, and he gets to explore all the bits and pieces of his personal \"boom\". The result is not for the ones with cardiac conditions, and can only be compaired at what would happen if we could transform techno music in 90 minutes of film.

Does it show that we are all connected I'd certainly say so as Lola tries to make things right (listen to the soundtrack). She loves a man and that is what it takes to make things right. Feels very Trainspotting in places with the background music and pace. Believe me you will not be bored.Lola loves her man and she has all the answers, well he says she does, so how does she fix the fact that without 100,000 DM her boyfriend that she loves will die in 20 minutes? Bit tricky, yes.Lola's strength is her inability to accept defeat for her or her boyfriend so when she meets it she says \"NO!!\" In the film their is a parable that says \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", it almost slipped by me.Where the film drops short for me is what makes the individual special? As we never get to know the main characters intimately why are they any more or less deserving than anyone else or does their love for one another stand them tall? I saw the intelligence of the movie running through the square missing the cracks in the pavement but would have liked to have seen the detail in the characters more instead of snapshots. In this area the film misses the mark as it sees everything in the third perspective so is a voyeur rather than a provocateur.After watching the movie I'm still asking myself the question why is anyone special and what makes the characters worthy of a second or even third chance. That's not bad, as if movies can't make us think why do we watch them?",

This movie turned more than a few heads in many independent film circles and for good reason. It doesn't serve much in the plot department but the amazing direction and great performance for the always entertianing Franka Potente make it worth your while. It is the story of Lola who one day gets a phone call from her boyfriend Manni telling her that if she doesn;t get 100,00 franks to him in twenty minutes he will be killed. The story is told three times with something different happening each time. It is amazing to see the irony between each time Lola takes her journey to find the money and how the interweave into each other. All in all the film is not for all tastes and the fact that it is not in english will turn away most modern day movie fans but the fact is that even though it is short on logic it is highy entertaining and ofter very thrilling. This could very well be the strangest romance movie ever made but it digs a lot deeper than most pointless romances in action movies today and although this isn't exactly an action movie it is very orginal and much credit is due there. So if you like independent films or just dig it because it is very bizarre Run Lola Run is an 81 minute thrill ride that even though may not be understood by everyone it sure isn't boring.",

It tells the story of a girl, Lola, racing to help her boyfriend who must deliver a large sum of cash (which he's lost) to his dealer before 12:00 or else get whacked. The movie's trick is to tell the story 3 times - each time with a slightly different version of events. And the trick works well.The best thing about \"Run Lola Run\" is it's sheer energy. At just 80 minutes it's never going to outstay it's welcome but the speed at which it rockets along can almost leave you breathless. This is, obviously, helped by the fact that Lola is running as fast she can, but it's enhanced by the use of various techniques - fast motion, slow motion, freeze frame, animation. There's also a neat trick of showing how Lola affects someone's life through her interactions, demonstrated in a series of photo montages that show what happens to them next.There's nothing particularly amazing about the acting though Lola is played intensely with her flaming red-hair, by Franka Potente. In some respect the actual script is quite weak .. but the magic is in the different interpretation of how a single few seconds can have a chain of consequences for your future. Aided by great direction, and a fast-paced dance track, \"Run Lola Run\" is a great way to spend 80 minutes of your time. 8/10.",

            "content": "Time as the leitmotif of a film can be versatile and engrossing and almost certainly makes for a pleasant viewing experience, but in the hands of an aspiring and talented young director/writer/ composer, it can actually yield one of the best German films of all time and that is Run Lola Run.Tom Tykwer, the imaginative mastermind behind the project, not so much astonishes with his peculiar usage of the butterfly effect, but rather with all the technical accomplishments embodied in the 80 minute picture. Centring on a young woman that has to scrape up 100,000 Deutsche Mark in just 20 minutes due to a failed criminal deal and spends most of this time running through Berlin, Tykwer makes use of virtually all filmmaking possibilities concerning cinematography, editing, sound, and storytelling. Match cuts, cross-cutting, split screen, slow motion, speed-up, animation, tracking shots, shaky cam, close-ups, distance shots, bird's-eye views, worm's-eye views, and flash forwards \u2013 in short, everything that would make cinephiles salivate \u2013 are used to make Lola's mostly ordinary sprint through the city an exciting and unforgettable adventure.Detractors may see all of these measures as a means to cover up an otherwise bland plot \u2013 a stance I can't really argue with \u2013 but these little details and imaginary shots are the crux for Run Lola Run being such an extraordinary film. For an overall assessment of its quality, factors such as the surrealistically random plot contrivances, unnecessary silliness (Lola's glass-shattering screaming, for example), and acting that is continuously hammed up just a trifle can't be ignored though, and significantly reduce the worth of the excellent cinematography, editing, and score (hectic German electronic music that fits the story perfectly).The result of that is a recommendable film that shows just how much you can pull out of an everyday story and may even make you want to direct yourself, which is likely the biggest compliment in cinematic terrain. Run Lola Run is far from perfect, yet proves that what you need for a good film isn't money, but creativity.",

Back to Lola. It is a very simple idea with very simple story. The whole movie just showed 3 versions(or reincarnations) of 20 minutes' series of incidents, accidents and outcomes. I was awed when I saw those supporting roles being encountered by Lola, each of their futures was shown in snapshots series. And when Lola was wrong for twice as to reach the 100,000 detchmarks, the outcomes just became unacceptable, the first time Lola died from a gunshot, the second time Manny died of a car accident. The last time, things really went right to where they should be. So, Lola and Manny finally accepted it happily (ever after?), or...maybe.Lola is a movie for the younger generation, but will also entertain the elders in some way. Even though the main characters are just little criminals in the edge of the big city, they are pretty remarkable because their commitment with each other as lovers. In my opinion, even though I don't quite accept the idea that, you can pass your life repeatedly until someday you achieve all you want to, I just enjoyed this 72 minutes flick.8/10",

Agood movie will touch you, a masterpiece of a movie will moveyou, thrill you and carry you, all of you, to places you havenot been before. This movie is nothing less than a masterpieceof our times. lola rennt is the most innovative movie since theFrench rebel movies of the sixties by Jean-Luc Godard. Havingmade this association I have to distance lola rennt from theseexperimental movies: where you need patience to appreciate themovies of Jean-Luc Godard, lola rennt works for you and on youright from the opening scene... you know right from thebeginning that you are off on a ride. I could rave about this movie for pages on, but I want to getyou to watch it, so I need to lay the bait. Rave music is adriving force in the tightly woven fabric of this movie... atighter script you will hardly find. The story is simple and Iwould not be giving anything away if I give you the opening:lola misses her rendezvous with her boyfriend manni, who waswaiting for her to pick him up with her Vespa... someone stoleit while she was buying something. Due to that a whole slew ofdire consequences follow: manni loses a bag with a lot of moneyhe is to pay to his boss (some dubious character), who willsurely and brutally end his misery, when he finds out that mannilost his $50,000. manni calls lola from a phone cell and tellsher of his loss. Across the street a supermarket catches hiseye, he decides to rob it... he figures he has no other choice,because at 12 pm he is to hand over the bag with the money tohis boss... this is in 20 minutes. lola begs him to give her 20minutes to get him $50,000. After deciding what the best courseof action is to get hold of that amount of money and having nomeans of transportation she opts to run. The movie find three answers to lola\u0091s run; all having the samesequence of events but with differences due to timing. Eachsequence has a different outcome. So lola rennt (lola is running) to manni, for his life, becauseof love and against all odds. There is much more in this movie than you might assume and itall meet the eye, involves your mind and gives you a vitalizingheart beat. I almost always try to keep issues involved with a movie out ofmy reviews, but in the case of lola rennt I have to break myrule... I beg you to  bear with me It grieves me to see thatlola rennt has an R rating in the US. This I find unjustifiedand leading to a situation where the movie does not reach theaudience it was intended for. This is not to say that lola renntdoes not work for an \"older\" audience, but that it is young,full of life and meant to be experienced by young viewers.

Not reality and not even good filmmaking.

Lola wants to save boyfriend Mannia from the cutthroat mob and needs 100,000 German Marks and must run to a preset location in the next 20 minutes or else he will die. Already feels like a PC game.  Now throw in something that happens everyday, rushing to keep a late appointment, and you have the perfect mindset for today's generation. \"Run Lola Run\" is money in the bank, a no-brainer.  I will admit the film does have its moments. The energy throughout the film can only be described as manic and Lola's scream is as much satanic as it is primeval.

Over the next 69 minutes we're treated to 3 different pulse-quickening interpretations of what happens during Lola's journey.Director Tom Tykwer has created a visual marvel, and the soundtrack is this pulsating rave music that creates an air of suspense, urgency, and adrenaline rush.  Twyker uses animation fills and a wonderful little \"flash-ahead\" trick, in which the lives of people Lola comes in contact with are played out minutes and even years ahead.  I'm not going to get too much into the actors themselves, Franka Potente (Lola, a beautiful redheaded raver girl) or Moritz Bleibtreu (Manni, her boyfriend) except to say that these two do an amazing job carrying the story.  Lola's fear and sense of urgency are quite obvious and you feel the fear she must be as well.  Same for Manni, he is beyond afraid of being killed for this mistake, and plans to deal with it if Lola doesn't make it in 20 minutes.\"Run Lola Run\" is a firecracker waiting to explode, one of the most visually outstanding and throughly entertaining movies I have ever seen.  After 79 minutes, I was finally able to exhale with relief. Don't like foreign films? Don't like subtitles? Doesn't matter, you owe it to yourself to see this one.5 out of 5",

            "content": "There is a certain breed of European filmmaker, typified by Mike Van Diem of CHARACTER, the ZENTROPA-era Lars Von Trier, and THE CELEBRATION's Edward Vinterberg, who seems a sadly updated version of the old new-wave auteur. Where Godard and Fassbinder secretly wanted to be Sam Fuller and Douglas Sirk, these guys want to be...Michael Bay? (I would throw into that mix the Danny Boyle of TRAINSPOTTING--a guy who did tremendous huffing and puffing to get the world to notice, then turned out to have absolutely nothing on his mind.) Tom Tykwer, the tyro behind RUN LOLA RUN, is maybe the most frenetic and emptiest of the lot.The first half hour of this picture, massively hyped since its premiere at New Directors/New Works in New York last year, gives you a sensation generally only enjoyed by characters in Bret Easton Ellis novels: kind of like sitting in the lobby of a poshly designed Mid-Atlantic hotel, watching MTV with the sound turned down while techno Muzak plays in the foyer, and those two Vicodins you just chewed kick in. Then the Central Narrative Gimmick comes into play, and a slight but very recognizable Entertainment Value starts coursing through your bloodstream. The conceit is O. Henryish and old-hat: If you failed to bump into that old lady on your way to work today, she wouldn't have gotten nicked by that passing car, and wouldn't get the insurance payout, and so her son would've died of an overdose...you get the picture.\nHere, red-dyed Lola needs to get 100,000 deutschmarks to save her punk boyfriend from a deadly shylock. She has twenty minutes; and, through a device the movie in no way explains, her potential route from home to money to boyfriend is played out, then replayed twice.When Tarantino built a tripartite time-bending structure in PULP FICTION, he had a reason: spiffing up the shopworn-old- chestnuts-with-a-twist that constituted the plot. In RUN LOLA RUN, as in Doug Liman's GO, it's as if the filmmakers thought Tarantino's gimcrackery were a holy ur-text of new-fangled narrative. Tykwer way outdoes Liman's shenanigans: he has made a movie that's like a cinematic analog of a PlayStation game. If that sounds perfectly decadent and yummy, dig right in; I found it almost smotheringly hermetic and quickly wished to flee the theatre.What's stifling about the movie isn't just its emptiness, its total paucity of characters or any sense of life outside narrative gamesmanship. It's the director's frantic tap-dancing to show his self-styled virtuosity. The movie features maybe more directorial gimmickry than even TRAINSPOTTING, to even less effect: the tricks Tykwer thinks are dazzling us are strictly yesterday's news. The pounding techno beat, the emphasis on hysterical cleverness at any cost, and the general air of panicked, oxygen-deprived need for attention, might make you long for an observant, quiet, well-acted scene shot in a really boring master.",

I was impressed by it's creativity and energy. Director Tykwer uses color and B/W film, video and animation and a lively techno soundtrack that transforms a simple story into an engaging and highly entertaining film. Lola is a young single woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 German Marks (about US $60,000 back in 1998), in order to rescue her boyfriend from adverse consequences. This story is played out three times with different results.I know that a number of prominent critics gave this film lukewarm reviews. I agree that \"Run Lola Run\" is an exercise in style and technique over substance. I don't believe a film always needs a strong story (substance) to work. \"Run Lola Run\" is about fate, timing and circumstance in life. That element is something everyone can relate to. The acting of the two main characters and the number of supporting characters, notably Lola's father is good. Tom Tykwer wrote many of the film's techno songs, with actress Franka Potente (Lola) singing in some of them. The music is really a strongly supportive element in this film.I side with audiences on this film. It was a big hit here and in Germany. It was nominated for and won many film festival awards. I found this film to be the most entertaining art film I've ever seen. Here was a very creative, fun and energetic art film, instead of the usual slow drama art film. It's true that the simple story told in \"Run Lola Run\" is forgettable. What I remember about this film is that it is highly creative and fun to watch!",

On all of those levels, Run Lola Run works well.  However, the story is another matter. I've read several reviews praising the different nuances, stylistically and story-wise, which change as the story runs each time.  What I found was a crime-story version of the film Groundhog Day, or a more stylish version of an X-Files episode from several years ago titled `Monday', in which Mulder experienced the same botched bank robbery several times.  Run Lola Run definitely wins on its style points, but on those points alone.Vote: 6",

Because of this will, she will act and depending how she acts certain consquences come about through how others act in reaction- the domino effect. This is what makes the ending classic.

But I just couldn't deal with the \"Groundhog's Day\" repetitiveness.Essentially, Lola \"experiences\" the same thing three different times. The experience differs in small ways that lead ultimately to a larger difference at the end. That's a great idea on paper, but I have to say that by the middle of the second repeat I was fast-forwarding the tape through some of the running sequences, and in the third run-through I fast-forwarded through much of it. Yes, there are two or three differences each time, but really only one tends to matter and it usually is the last one, so all the running is just filler in my results-oriented brain.One device that I *loved* was the \"... and then\" sequences, in which a quick series of snapshots shows the viewer the fate of people who cross Lola's path. Sometimes the fate is good, other times bad. But it was a terrific device to tell mini-stories in the middle of a movie.Run Lola Run would have worked better if it had been 30 minutes shorter, or if there had been more meaningful changes in each of the three run-throughs. I'm still not sure which one, if any, of the three actually happened. Or were they all in Lola's imagination? No matter. The movie doesn't treat that question as important, so I won't either. The movie also doesn't treat the characters as important, as we know almost nothing about them and what we do learn isn't good. In fact, you know so little that watching the ending of each of the three runs really is more an act of analysis than one of any emotion or empathy. But I am looking for that soundtrack.

            "content": "Run Lola Run is an extremely fast-paced and stylized techno adventure that explores the nature of time, causality and freewill (Warning: Today's generation of ADD folk will be highly stimulated!!!). The film is broken into three alternative stories, each with Lola running against the clock. Time seems to be Lola's enemy because she only has twenty minutes to deliver an unlikely sum of money to her boyfriend, Manni, before all hell breaks loose. Failure to complete this mission on time results in Manni's death. If she is successful, Manni will live. Therefore, Lola's objective is to conquer time and save her boyfriend. Each story, however, interprets time differently. Some interpretations view time as favorable and optimistic, while others are fatalistic and even dreadful. The major dramatic question thus becomes: Will Lola make it on time? In the beginning of each story, Lola anxiously tries to figure out how she will manage to save the situation at hand. Her decision always ends the same: \"Ask your wealthy father to bail you out.\" As soon as her mind becomes transfixed, she runs as fast as she can to his office to ask the favor. However, the outcomes are always different in regards to whether or not she will be successful. Along the way, Lola runs into several casual bystanders whom each time are shown to have different destinies as a result of running into Lola. For example, the woman who walks the baby has the most significant character arcs: from winning the lottery, to dying in a hospital, to getting married. All of these outcomes are a result of whether or not she physically bumps into Lola along her path. When she does, her attitude becomes stubborn and hard, cursing Lola as she passes. Consequently, a flash of her entire life appears before the screen. I thought this was an interesting dynamic of how the people we run into on the map of time often trigger certain emotional responses within us. Time brings us together but also separates us depending on how we choose to react to life situations. Each story has its own \"what-if\" interpretation of how different things could be if people are roughly five seconds early or late to their appointed meetings. This five second difference, as the film shows, is the difference between succeeding and failing to obtain one's objectives. It is also the difference between whether chaos or harmony is created in people's lives. With this difference, the film seems to ask: \"Why does time sometime work for people and other times not?\" Let me explain what I mean by this question. In the first story, Lola's late arrival causes Manni to rob a grocery market. Consequently, the cops come and end up shooting Lola in the crossfire. In the second story, Lola arrives on time but Manni crosses the street at the wrong time and is hit by a speeding ambulance. The crucial time difference in both stories seems to suggest the harshness of time; or as the old saying goes, \"They were at the wrong place at the wrong time.\" In the last story, however, Lola wins the lottery; Manni gets the money back from the bum and gives it to Ronni, leaving Lola and Manni with 100,000 marks. Time here seems to have worked for them. Lola changes for both good and bad in each story depending upon whether time works for or against her. In the first two stories, time works as her enemy, whereas in the last story it becomes her friend. I believe Tykwer was trying to show that time is both friendly and villainous depending upon how we're living our lives and how we react to life circumstances. The film overall does a really good job at creating intrigue within the viewer, as if to ask: \"Could things ever have been different if given the chance to repeat the same day or experience over again? If so, how would you act differently?\"Throughout all three stories, the filmmakers ask a lot of curious questions about why things happen in life the way they do. Some of these questions include: Are the things that happen to us in life predetermined, or are we the authors of our destinies? Can time be manipulated? What is the causal relationship between time and choice? These questions, along with many others, are for the viewer to think about in terms of their own life situation. The significance of Tykwer's film-making style is that it demonstrates the chaotic and hyperactive society that we all live in. With the increase in technology and industry, people become more and more spoiled to want things faster and faster. We truly are the impatient MTV generation that wants everything now. The fast-paced techno beats, the collage of video footage (animation/35mm/and digital video) and the rapid editing are all compliments to how life moves these days. Aside from Tykwer's homage to amalgamating all the latest types of technology into one, I believe the film's overall style was a metaphor for how we're all drowning in a sea of information but starving for its meaning. It was hard, at times, to keep up with all the visual stimuli because it was all being thrown at you so fast. Nevertheless, this film is perfect for anyone that often finds themselves impatient with the so-called \"slow-moving\" films.",

I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life, for an entire day.  The documentary-like film had no stars.  The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day, an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier.  The short film isn't particularly a comedy, the Murray film is.Run Lola Run is not a comedy either.  Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni, Lola's boyfriend, needs 100,000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend.  Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing.  These differences result in major differences in what happens.  I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.  Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle.  I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects.  Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city, going from one building to another, across one scenic plaza after another, running at full speed.  In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios, her encounters with people, places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations, to excite me much.  Some might like it.  I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Its wonderful filmmaking but  very poor story-telling.",

Well, Run Lola Run was much more than just an \"entertaining action.\" Oh, yes, definitely...Scarlet-haired Berlin punk Lola (Franka Potente) is spurred into athletic action when her petty gangster boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bliebtreu) calls her in desperation at 11.40am; he's just left the spoils of his latest drug deal (100,000 Deutschmarks) on the subway, and is liable to wind up as sandwich filling when his somewhat anti-social boss turns up at noon to claim the loot. Lola has just 20 minutes to replace the cash and race across town to rescue her soon-to-be-dead lover. And if she doesn't, he'll rob the nearby convenience store, an idea likely to land the pair in even bigger trouble. Suddenly, just when you think the couple are done for, the film zooms back to the start and repeats Lola's journey, but in an entirely different way. Then, it does it again for a third time, again differently. Each story has some of the same incidents, but Lola always finds a new, unique way to grab the cash for Manni.Run Lola Run sucks you in deeper after every adventure. Every category is fulfilled here: the acting is unbelievably good, Franka Potente is a rare find, her red hair and feisty attitude really makes her a watchable heroin for the film, the script is brilliantly written, it is easily one of the most original and unique ideas of the 1990's. Tom Tywker's effort in this film is most breathtaking, his future films look promising. Run Lola Run filmed from many different angles, which made the cinematography beautifully stunning, while the idea of mixing cartoon and real-life action is classical.One of the best films of 1998/99 easily.I rate Run Lola Run 9 out of 10.",

I've seen plenty of \"running movies\" in which the actual running was of no interest.Her boyfriend Manni is marvelous: kind of dumb but absolutely genuine, and doing his very best.The \"what-if\" / \"possible futures\" clips that attach to other characters are marvelous. The action is non-stop, which is why I still spot new things, even on a fourth viewing. I always feel better after watching Lola.

The movie mixes together almost every filmmaking technique in the book- 35mm film, video, handheld, slow-motion, split screens, animation, computer-generated imagery- and the result is something that looks like a German version of a Michael Bay movie, only with wonderfully-realized characters and a solid, concise story. The movie takes full advantage of a simple concept: that a tiny change in a Lola's actions can radically change the fates of everybody around her. From the moment the opening titles zip across the screen and the driving techno-beat of the score begins, \"Run Lola Run\" starts moving and doesn't stop, even at the end credits. If there's any justice in the world, this movie will be a surprise hit at the American box office.",

You can deduce the score I would give THAT movie, if I were not brain dead and zombified after contact that leprotic creation. Although certain things cannot be unseen , they can in time be forgotten, as this one will be. This may be an IMDb first, a twofer in a single paragraph. Back to Lola. I think its alleged brilliance and experimental and avant-garde status rest on too few laurels to be warranted. I think the director took a leaf out of American police dramas of the time like NYPD and did a Euro version of hand held and repetitive slow-mo (like when the phone receiver gets slammed down several times in secession) to underline the importance of that one particular action. How clever that most of this sequencing, when used, occurs three times to underscore the triadic structure of the narration (SPOILER: Lola runs three sequences of events). Yet, in the end, the film manages to use this slightly innovative structure (though it wasn't the director's innovation) to good effect in creating and selling several interesting points about the postmodernisation and proletarisation of Germany that they had been undergoing since the 1980s. Okay, I got carried away with my rhetoric. Let's just say Germany was in the 1980s facing a new phenomenon, the emergence of an educated and not British soccer fan loutish underclass, to which this movie alludes in a clever way by underscoring the psychological dysfunction in Lola's family that, the film alludes, was partly responsible for creating punk culture out of bourgeois alienation. So, the theme is interesting, the casting good, and there is obligatory referencing to Kafka-esque surrealism, Gunter Grass anomie (repeated screaming) and Marquez mythologizing (the plot follows a mythic structure, in the style of A Hundred Years of Solitude), so why not praise this as innovative in its own way? Of course, culture snobs will never acknowledge that a lot of the allegedly avant-garde and experimental techniques that various obscure film festivals label as innovative were in fact pioneered by popular American television shows, but let it ride.",

There is just (among alot of other small) one problem with this film that I find alittle too much to forgive and is the only thing that is preventing me from going out there and buy the DVD and is also preventing me to call this a 'great' film. I am sure most of you had already find this out yourselves, if not, it will be obvious once I mention it.One of the most important thing in the film is the time factor. However, the director didn't do a good job to maintain this in a logical sense in all three versions of this '20 minutes film'. Have you actually counted the number of things Lola could do in each 20 minutes? What you may find is that Lola did way less things in the first version but she still managed to be in the same time frame as the 2nd and 3rd versions when she did way more!! To make it clearer...The first version Lola went to her dad and without the success from there, she ran to see her boyfriend. Her boyfriend couldn't hear her.The second version is Lola went to her dad and without success from there, she actually spent (in film rate) another like 10 minutes trying to rob the bank. What is worst, she WAITS for the bank teller to go in the cellar to get money. And after all that, she still manages to be ahead of time (compared to the 1st version) to call her boyfriend! Seriously, there is something really wrong with the time.The third version is o.k., similar in time frame with the 2nd, but the damage was done...the first compared to the 2nd and 3rd is way too painfully different in time.The only way I could convince myself is maybe Lola in the first version went for a cup of coffee or something during the way and waited alittle there before going to see her boyfriend.",

My preference is for \"art films\" and films with an important message or evocative of powerful emotions. That said, I loved \"Lola Rennt\"!Any of you reading this will likely know the basic plot - Lola's thieving boyfriend needs a large sum of money in 20 minutes or surely he will be killed.  He turns to Lola, who obviously has saved him from his bumbling ways in the past, and she literally runs to save his life.The movie is exhilarating, our suspense pumped up by the perfect soundtrack of techno-ambient music with a minimalistic driving beat.  In addition to the music, the director makes compelling use of techniques such as occasional animation, split-screen, and the quick spinning of intriquing side-stories for peripheral characters whose life Lola touches, if only to brush against them in her run.  The story line cleverly explores what-if scenarios and how each decision we make in our lives defines the trajectory for a particular reality.I am not a fan of needless vulgarity or violence, but I didn't at all find the film offensive - I am not sure why it was 'R' rated.  My only criticism would be the believability of the father (his having an affair was one thing, but I just can't see a father disavowing his daughter - and in the manner that he did it - like he did in the second go-round of her run). Clearly with a focus on 20 critical minutes there can't be significant character development, but the clever and humorous technique of the intimate conversation \"flashbacks\" (\"flashforwards\"?) of Lola and her boyfriend give us surprising depth of understanding of elements of the couple.This movie is destined to be a classic of contemporary continental offerings.  I can only hope that this director can offer another gem, different, but weaving in humor, urgency, sophisticated technical effects, and an exciting perspective as in \"Lola Rennt\".  Bravo!!",

In other words, here is the restorer of faith, the resurrection of film as an art form, and the next logical step in its evolution. Bound to be copied endlessly over the next decade or two, \"Run Lola Run\" is the MTV generation's bastard child that manages  to outoliver Stone and outquentin Tarantino, going beyond anything these two directors ever hoped to accomplish, and blending their now-tired mannerisms into a novel form. While it cannot be pigeonholed into any partiular genre, the movie centers around a grand theme of predestination, which in itself is not knew, having been explored by a number of world-class directors, most notably Kieslowzky. Other visual and aural allusions abound, from \"2001\" to \"The Tin Drum\", but no one in their right mind would accuse Tom Twyker of plagiarism. Jumpstarting the world's broken celluloid engine with a jolt that a hundred \"Armageddon\"s wouldn't do, \"Lola\" is overflowing with the kind of vital energy unseen in European cinema since the French New Wave  in the early 60's. An array of techniques is employed, including all types of cameras, snapshots, animation, and a brilliant electronica score designed especially for the film, and yet the style never obscures the substance. It's also the first picture in ages that dares to believe in Love, Love that's gloriously unfake, untainted by typical indie cynicism or Hollywood string-orchestra shmaltz. Franka Potente, the heroine, races to save her boyfriend from the pits of postmodern hell, and we feel her plight, not doubting her convictions for a second as her dyed, punkish hair bounces through the portals of time and space. Indeed, if this troubled decade will evoke any associations in the next millennium's movie buffs, it will be of two women: the twisting brunette (\"Pulp Fiction\"'s Uma) and the running redhead.",

Conceptually, Run Lola Run is a landmark and an evolutionary leap -- or least an evolutionary hop -- in the history of film. It's the first movie I've ever seen with three-dimensional and likable characters that also happens to take place in a video game universe.  It's also the first movie I've ever seen that makes a sincere, determined effort to NEVER STOP from first second to last.  Like Lola, director Tom Tykwer has a very clear and purposeful objective in mind -- to make the cinematic equivalent of the first Ramones record.  As a filmgoer who's sensitive to the importance of what he's attempting, I have one word for him:Oohsoclose.The idea of a maroon-haired girl streaking around Berlin like Flo Jo to the beat of incessant techno music is a brilliant one, but alas, Run Lola Run isn't what it could have been.  Most glaringly, the animation sequences are lifted from Natural Born Killers and are totally out of place.  You just cannot cut from a cartoon to the real world without jarring the audience. And this is only ONE of the problems with the editing, which would have needed a Spielberg or a Peckinpah to really sing.  For a film that lives or dies by sheer style the shot selection is awfully choppy.  It's as if Tykwer went out, shot two hundred hours of footage, and spliced it together randomly.  It's Michael Bay more than John Woo.Don't get me wrong -- this sucker is a cathartic, exhilarating rush, manna for speed freaks.  When it was over I felt like bolting out of the theater and sprinting down the street as fast as my spindly legs would carry me. In this sense it's like the best advertisement Adidas never made.  It's also the best of the recent rash of alternate universe, Sliding Doors-type movies about the fickleness of destiny.  In most of these movies there are only two possible alternatives:  win the lottery or get hit by a car.  Those fates, timeless popular favorites, are duly ( and dutifully ) represented in Run Lola Run.  But if Lola blasts past you while trying to save her boyfriend be warned -- you could also end up a heroin addict, a nun, or a sadomasochist. It's good to see Tykwer embraces the glorious variety of human experience.So Run Lola Run is a lot of fun and an absolute must-see.  But ultimately, it will be most fondly remembered for having planted the seed that grew into the vine which more talented directors plucked the fruit off of.  Phew.I just have one question:  When did Elisabeth Shue dye her hair red and learn to speak German?",

Set in a stark urban landscape, it proceeds at the same frenetic pace as its protagonist - scarlet-coiffured Lola - as she attempts to save her boyfriend's life.  Lola's frenzied desperation is echoed in the beat-driven techno-style score, and through the jerky camera work and rapid shot sequences. Instead of 90 continuous minutes of flowing film, Run Lola Run is split into three scenarios, with widely divergent outcomes.  Manni has inadvertently left a bag containing a large amount of money destined for a Berlin Mafia syndicate on the train.  He rings his girlfriend, Lola, in a panic, telling her that he needs 100,000 marks in 20 minutes or he's as good as dead.  Lola hits the ground running and the three segments follow her quest for fast cash.      The movie ponders the age-old question of how one seemingly insignificant action can alter the course of destiny; in this case it is Lola's differing interactions with a boy and his dog on the staircase of her apartment block (shown in a cartoon) at the beginning of each scenario that sets the scene for her subsequent varied modes of action.  Director Tom Tykwer lets the camera do the talking, and the sometimes overwhelming barrage of verbosity thrown at the viewer in so many modern films is thankfully absent here. Among the many interesting features of the movie is the use of the flash-forward sequence.  Minor characters are given depth by the use of a fast-paced photo montage showing what the future holds for them.  It is touches like this, which make this film a cinematic masterpiece and a contemporary classic.",

            "content": "Achtung!...spoilers...Technically, the piece is a bit of a marvel.  The thing is packed with incredible shots and perspectives, some of them familiar from the work of others and some like nothing I've ever seen before.  The shot with the nuns is just one that leaps to mind.  In fact, some of the camera and editing techniques are the kind that you see in TV ads, when the producer is pulling out all the stops to catch your attention.  It's definite fodder for those in film school, but it all kind of blurred together in my eyes after a while.  Maybe it was too much.  Maybe I just got tired after all of that stridency.  The fact is that I've never had any use for MTV - the fact of its existence or the incredibly annoying stylistic hallmarks, like jerky camera movement and a succession of rapid cuts, that have always been integral to its broadcasts.  And this is a film steeped in the MTV sensibility.  Maybe post-MTV...whatever.I began to suspect that this was not going to be a straight narrative when the cartoon Lola kicked in as she ran down the stairs and out of her home. Actually, the cartoon - changing each time, albeit quite subtly - is very fitting given that this whole movie has the look and feel of a video game. Methinks the producers and directors must've spent a lot of time playing such games, because it's apparent to me in everything from the cartoon sequence to her running around to pick up things that may be of use to the fact that she was given three \u0091lives' during which to reach her goal.  I don't know about you, but I'd love to have the ability to do three re-takes of various situations within my life.  That was a nice little twist, and the film is executed skillfully enough that the three different versions of reality each seem fresh and new.  Trying to keep it so, yet retain temporal continuity, must have been a challenge.  Then again, perhaps it wasn't all that much different than compiling the various takes normally required for any film, the only difference being that each take featured different dialog and action.  Regardless, the whole was flawlessly executed.  I definitely get the feeling that the postproduction staff pored over every frame of film at length, completing the vision that must have been firmly established during principal photography.  Interesting use of DV in some places, too, to contrast the mood with that filmed on film stock.  The use of \"What a Difference A Day Makes\" in one of the alternate-reality sequences was particularly effective, too, and a nice break from the overbearing \u0091techno' core.In some ways this movie's all about action and less so involved with character.  In particular, Lola's character is too busy running around to take the time to develop before us.  Then again, Franka Potente was so good that we could sense much of her nature without anything overt being revealed, and the elements that comprise her life can be glimpsed in interactions with her father and others.  And she can scream loudly, too.In some ways this film irritated me.  I'm not entirely sure why.  Sure, those rapidly-cut explorations of the various futures of ancillary characters were interesting and kinda cool, but they also seemed to distract and detract from the film.  To some extent I wasn't totally sympathetic with the characters, though Lola was basically appealing and I felt her anguish and rising panic.  I was disappointed in the ending, actually - if I were Lola, I'd have decked that SOB Manni.  On the bright side, Ms Potente must've really been in good shape by the time they finished filming this thing.  I do really get into the big-effects-from-small-causes thing, too, because the truth of such things never fails to amaze me.  And there's within a film a core conflict that's also explored in \"Forrest Gump\" - fate versus chance.  Deterministic versus stochastic.The bottom line for me is that it's a technically brilliant film, beautifully filmed, ingeniously plotted and twisted, and expertly acted...but it never really struck much of a chord with me where it really matters.  I think it was great but it's never going to make it to my considerable list of favorite films, and certainly not among the ranks of films that I could watch over and over again.  Maybe it was just too highly stylized.  Maybe I'm destined to forever remain immune to the charms of \u0091art films.'  Oh well...I'll always have \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\"",

            "content": "In my opinion this falls into the \"cool\" movies category. With \"cool\" I don't necessarily mean good (although all of the films I've seen in that category was good), but films that are kind of made the same way. Made so they look cool and all the cool people will like them, if I'm making any sense here...?! Movies that are told, edited and filmed kind of the same way. In a cool, hip, smart, fast and slick way. The music is also often synthetic electronic stuff or done by some Booker T. & The M.G.'s-wannabes (I prefer Booker T. & The M.G.'s though). I'm talking about movies like \"Boondock saints\", \"Dogma\", \"Lock, stock & two smoking barrels\", \"Snatch\", \"Oceans eleven\" (remake) & I guess \"Swordfish\" also falls into this category. I think \"Payback\" also tries a little to be in that category, but I don't really think Mel Gibson fits into the category. The actors are often those new young, hip actors. Don't get me wrong, I think all these movies were at least alrigth, but my biggest problem with \"Lola Rennt\" was that it was made in such a similar way to the others. I kind of expected it to be, as I could see by the cover image that it would probably be one of those. If you like the before mentioned films you'll most likely also like this film, although I of course will never know. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But all in all, I think this was a good movie and it was also exciting, but my only real problem with it was that it was so similar to the others in style. Some things are only good for a while before they get boring/annoying. I gave it 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Showing the same stretch of time in a movie several times over isn't new. And it's not just about Kieslowski -- I also need to think of Jim Jarmusch's masterpiece _Mystery Train_. Tom Tykwer shows 3 alternative ways of developing a story, and behind the seeming vacuousness of it all even manages to be positive and celebrate religious faith. The movie has a happy ending -- if you disregard the two foregoing endings; in juxtaposing the three, Tykwer ensures that the final happy ending isn't corny and conventional, but ironic. Probably the best decision on the part of the director was to make the movie sweet & short; the result is that the 80 minutes are so action-packed you hardly have room to breathe. Lots more nuances could be added to each of the 3 story lines -- but Tykwer wisely eschewed all of that. The action remains suspenseful literally to the last few seconds -- you can never be sure if a car doesn't come racing round a corner suddenly, mowing down the two heroes just before the final credits roll. One of Tykwer's messages seems to be that human destinies are entirely haphazard; this can particularly be felt in the photographic \"flash-forwards\" of destinies of some of the passers-by of Lola's desperate run. It's an astonishing feat that Tykwer manages to be moralistic -- unobtrusively -- in a hectic movie like this; his main message to the viewer seems to be, \"Play it nice.\" Once Lola basically decides (likely in her subconscious) to play it nice, she finally gets it right. _Lola rennt_ affirms the director's belief in the super-natural; Lola's wins at the casino are no gimmick; neither is her healing power in the speeding ambulance car; or the hint received by Manni from the blind woman -- all of these are Tykwer's assertions that those things are, in fact, possible; that spirit can overcome matter. The overarching message, \"Play it nice\", seems so powerful that the movie's other, starker message, retreats into the background; namely, _Lola rennt_ seems to suggest that whatever events happen in our lives, do not really matter; the only thing that matters is, \"Play it nice\"; and *whatever* (literally) happens to you whenever you play it nice, must be accepted as your destiny; therefore, it's not really preferable to live or to die at any particular moment; to find the \"money\" (or whatever, since this is just Hitchcock's famed MacGuffin) or lose it -- as long as you play it nice, or at least try to. (Such as in Lola's first two runs in which she *doesn't* play it nice, but at least is sincerely trying to help out a friend, a fellow human being in need.) And so, it's not *events* (or non-events, or any possible type of developments or non-developments) in our lives that are in any way important -- rather it's our *attitude* in life, and in every moment of our lives; we should be as focused on living our life the right way in each and every moment, as Lola is focused on her run and getting to the desired spot before 12 noon (her resolve being best seen in the moments just before she almost gets run over by a truck, and before she notices the casino building). _Lola rennt_ moves at an incredibly brisk pace -- as fast as Lola herself can be seen running through a myriad of Berlin's streets. The cinematography, very varied and dynamic in the style of MTV videoclips, is enriched by animation, even; the musical score is inventive, modern, with techno-beats, but non-obtrusive -- I fail to see how anyone could possibly fall asleep while watching a movie proceeding at such a furious pace. The allusions to Hitchcock's _Vertigo_ are much appreciated. While it would probably be too much to call _Lola rennt_ a crown jewel in terms of art of film-making, it's definitely a precious little glittering diamond.",

Think Tarantino and Ritchie collaborating on a movie in Berlin while flying on methamphetamine--sure to have some pratfalls, but who WOULDN'T want to watch it?The stars of this picture live up to the hyperactive energy of their director.  Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu pull off an admirable feat--they endear their characters to us with almost no time allotted to catch their breath, let alone engage in what we would typically refer to as character development. We get to know and even love Lola and Manni on the run, as it were, and that speaks volumes to the commitment and charisma of these two young performers.  (Not to mention their physical conditioning...I'd love to see some stats on how many miles Potente ran throughout the course of filming this picture.)True to its Euro-artiness, \"Run, Lola, Run\" is just as fearless (and shameless) in its confrontation of philosophical issues as stylistic ones, even going so far as to have an opening sequence discussing the questions of man's existence.  The whole film's rife with unapologetic symbolism, too (as opposed to Tarantino, whose symbols only really start to emerge after a couple of viewings), but I think you'll find that the overall charm and breathless earnestness will allow you to keep from rolling your eyes.In fact, the movie does have a valid philosophical statement to make, albeit one I find troubling: life hinges on the smallest of things.  Or, to put it less charmingly, our existence and its termination are determined by a myriad of tiny events, most of which are essentially happenstance.  Yeah, like the chaos theory that we all learned in \"Jurassic Park.\"  (Should I get some kind of award for working \"Jurassic Park\" into a review of \"Run, Lola, Run?\"  I think the answer is yes.)It's not a pretty thought, but movies don't have to communicate pretty thoughts to be valid.  Personally, though, I think the point would have been better made if the sequences were shown in reverse--with the first one working out just fine, the second one ending in Manni's death, and the third in Lola's.  To me, a happy ending (such as it was) is somewhat of a stretch for a film communicating such a bleak message.  Then again, perhaps Tykwer (like the security guard in the prologue) is simply saying to us, \"Hey, it's what you make of it--it can be good or bad.\"If I've made the film sound heavy-handed, I've done it a tremendous disservice.  Whatever its other issues are, it's among the least boring movies you'll ever see in your life, and it is genuinely thought-provoking.",

Manni has done a deal with a local hood to whom he must deliver 100,000 Deutsche marks, but stupid Manni has left the money on a subway train, where it has been discovered by a tramp. Manni knows if he turns up without the cash, in twenty minutes, he's a dead man. His phone call to Lola sets her off on a frantic race across the city to come up with the cash. She meets various obstacles, characters and scenarios during her flight including her Bank Manager father who refuses to give her the money. She finally arrives at the rendezvous too late to stop the now panicking Manni from robbing a nearby store.

The race starts once more.This frenetic and original film is a fascinating and absorbing study of cause and effect where we see the events of those twenty minutes unfold three times with three radically different outcomes. Characters rise and fall in prominence, and we as the audience learn more about almost everyone through watching the three alternate stories than the characters actually know about themselves from their own single perspective.Potente as Lola is mesmerisingly heroic and director Tykwer's use of frenzied and chaotic live action mixed with clever cartoon animation and rapid still photography galleries, accompanied by a pulse pounding techno beat, shows us, in what is only his third feature, that he is totally at home with and in control of his medium.This is a movie you need to watch more than once to pick up all of the all important threads and is one of the best and most innovative German films, if not one of Europe's, to come through in recent years. For those of you averse to subtitles there is an English dialogue track, but to get the real spirit of the movie and feel of the locale you should watch it in the original German, and to be honest, the dialogue plays a minor role in this fast paced visual roller coaster ride.

Say, there exist parallel worlds and the heroes are going through them, well aware that they are experiencing that, or at least that sonmething is wrong.

That is, try to envision a full-throttle sensory assault where rapid-fire cuts, quick changes of perspective and other assorted A-V tricks all serve a storytelling purpose rather than merely being employed to distract you from noticing that there IS no story.Can't do it, can you?Believe it or not, this seemingly impossible cinematic feat has been brilliantly pulled off by German new-wave wunderkind Tom Tykwer in his third feature, RUN LOLA RUN (\"Lola Rennt\" in German).  It was by far the most innovative of the six films that I recently saw at the Toronto Film Festival, and it also earned the loudest applause.The film starts with a phone call between a pair of young twentysomethings. On one end is Lola (Franka Potente) the obviously rebellious (she sports died-red hair and tattoos) daughter of a local banker; on the other is her brooding, small-time hoodlum boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu).  The situation is this: due indirectly to Lola not meeting him earlier because her motorbike got stolen when she went for cigarettes, Manni has lost a bag with 100,000 deutsche marks that he was running on a courier mission for his boss.  The boss has been known to maim underlings who steal so much as a beer from him.  Manni has to deliver the money to the boss at noon sharp.

            "content": "I know that it's hard, but try to imagine the following: an MTV movie ... with *substance*!  That is, try to envision a full-throttle sensory assault where the rapid-fire cuts, quick changes of perspective and other assorted A-V tricks all serve a storytelling *purpose* rather than merely being employed to distract you from noticing that there IS no story.Can't do it, can you?Believe it or not, this seemingly impossible feat has been brilliantly pulled off by German new-wave wunderkind Tom Tykwer in his third feature, RUN LOLA RUN (\"Lola Rennt\" in German). It was by far the most innovative film that I saw at the Toronto Film Festival, and it also earned the loudest applause.The film starts with a phone call between a pair of young twentysomethings. On one end is Lola (Franka Potente) the obviously nonconformist (she sports died-red hair and tattoos) daughter of a local banker; on the other is her brooding, small-time hoodlum boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). The situation is this: due indirectly to Lola not meeting him earlier because her motorbike got stolen when she went for cigarettes, Manni has lost a bag with 100,000 deutschemarks that he was running on a courier mission for his boss.  The boss has been known to maim underlings who steal so much as a beer from him.  Manni has to deliver the money to the boss at noon sharp. It's 11:40.Manni tells Lola that he has no choice but to rob a large supermarket near the pay phone where he's calling from. Lola emphatically urges him not to, telling him that she'll meet him by the store by noon with the money he needs.

To go into too much detail would spoil the exposition, but numerous touches (such as a recurring animated sequence and the notion of following future events in the lives of briefly glimpsed extras via \"And Then\" headed rapid fire Polaroid montages) should float the boat of anyone with half a brain.

The music sets the pace as we listening to a fast beating heartbeat. This film never slows down. Franka Potente - the main actress - is always in motion, she never gets a rest here. Same thing with the cinematography. It's a music video in MTV style really. Tracking shots, close-ups, sometimes the live action story switches to Lola as running cartoon character. When she meets, bump into or screams at a passerby, we get quick flashes of their lifes and how they will turn out after this butterfly-effect encounter. \"Run Lola Run\" is structured in three different processes of the same story with every single story showing a different decision made by Lola and how the story changes because of it. It's not only Lola who runs, it's the whole film that is running away and we have to be fast and coming along to don't lose track of Franka Potente and Tykwers swift style.",

Lola's boyfriend is remarkably (and somewhat unrealistically) dull-witted.  But the film isn't exactly going for realism. In any case, it's not often that I get to watch a German film at the theater, so if you get a chance, go for it.  It's only around 80 minutes long anyway.

Comparing it to other good movies is like comparing ice-cream with pizza.Well, everything in \"Lola Rennt\" is good: Franka Potente and all the cast, the story, the way the story is told and, of course, its visual. Watching Lola Rennt is like watching a big modern-art exposition or a big show. Everything is very colored, with different camera views, drawing used as real scenes, clocks, photos, the frenetic style... But the best in \"Lola rennt\", is that the story is told three times. No, not like we use to see, the same story being told by three different points of view, or ways. In \"Lola rennt\", basically, the stories are the same: Lola have to find $ 100000,00 or her boyfriend will be killed so, she runs to her father's bank. These are the points in common. In each one of them, the end is different, what happen to Lola's \"father\" (you'll understand if you watch the movie) is different, the way Lola get (or not) the money is different, what happen to the people that crossed Lola is different... \"Lola rennt\" is different!

            "content": "RUN LOLA RUN is one of the most inventive films of the last decade. Filmed in Berlin, Germany, on a modest budget, and written and directed by Tom Tykwer, it follows the story of a young woman, Lola, all athletic body and dyed red hair, who must run to meet her boyfriend Manni and save his life. Apparently, Manni lost a large sum of money (100,000 Deutsche marks, to be precise) he was supposed to deliver to his employer, a man who isn't quite law-abiding by any means; Manni must now come up with the money before his meeting with his employer in twenty minutes. Which leaves Lola exactly that amount of time to get to Manni AND figure out a way to get 100,000 DM to him for delivery to his employer. To add to that, in twenty minutes, Manni says that he will rob the supermarket across the street to get the money--unless Lola can help him. Sound easy to you?RUN LOLA RUN (in German, LOLA RENNT) is an inventive and fast-paced video-game style film, straight out of a techno-cyberpunk fantasy. Yet there is also something very philosophical beneath Tykwer's visuals. The film is cut into three separate stories, each with different circumstances and conclusions. Happy endings for some mean disaster for others. Tykwer succeeds in showing that everything--EVERYTHING--we do has a cause-effect relationship on everything else. Accusing someone of being a thief, for instance (in reference to the film), affects that person's future. Even bumping into someone on the street causes a chain reaction that may lead either to success or failure. But that isn't just Tykwer's vision, or Tykwer's view of life. That IS life.The two leads, Franka Potente (who is also very beautiful, and will probably move on to American film one day, as is the norm these days) and Moritz Bleibtrau, do a wonderful job in portraying hopelessly inept, hopelessly romantic young ne'er-do-wells. Potente, especially, shows a spectacular charm and desperation as the heroic Lola. This film was so visually and stylistically inventive that my college professor showed it, in its entirety (roughly 80 min.), to our film class. And yes, it was even spoofed on an episode of THE SIMPSONS! 8/10",

That doesn't mean that I cannot recognize the decadence of the Hollywood film.  Well thankfully Lola rennt is not a Hollywood film.  It's like a beautifully shot modern version of German Expressionism.  The fact that Lola feels alone in her quest to save her boyfriend is punctuated by the emptiness of the streets through which she runs.  In addition the geometric shapes motif in the film which is also reminicent of Expressionism.  The checker board that Lola runs through in the town square, the curvature of the road next to the curving train track, the perfect rectangles and circles in the casino.  It seems to show the harmony of the world that the film tends to dismiss at times.There is a great interplay of fate and choice within the film.  Lola seems to be the master of her own destiny.  Her sonic scream allows her to get what she wants; it is almost as if the laws of physics and psychology are thrown out the window for her.  On the other hand, fate plays a major role. She either gets somewhere too late or someone briefly prevents her from moving on (i.e. the security guard).  In addition fate plays on the lives of the people she runs into.  The \"And Then\" title card precedes a montage of what happens to passer-bys.  Each future, good or bad, is outside of the reach of the people.  It's all in the hand of fate.  The interplay, I think, says that, overall, what happens in life is part destiny and part what you make of it.  Fate throws in obstacles that can be overcome by careful choices.

Then she is stopped in her tracks by an oncoming truck, made aware that a casino is right across the street, then given the instructions on how to play the casino.It depicts immortality and free will in that she nor Manni die, even though it appears that they died, or they actually did die only physically in the ordinary 3-D reality.  Spirit is infinite.  Death is just a dimensional shift.The movie does an excellent job of displaying the fact that we, as human beings, have many options available to us at every given point in time and that each of those options create different realities, some similar, some not so similar.Lola continually strove to do the \"right thing\" and found that the right thing wasn't always what she thought it was or should be, i.e., the scene with her father wherein he attempted to invalidate her with his emotional abusiveness and cruelty.There are some Angels in the movie, which is not uncommon for this kind of movie.  Although, they do not identify themselves as Angels.  It is up to us to recognize them, if we choose, by their actions.The statements at the beginning of the movie by the later security guard spill just about everything we need to know to play the game called life.I noticed some references to Lola's screams.

If youhave had something horrible happen in your life it is at leastcomforting to imagine that you could start over from the last goodmoment before the tragedies started, and have a second - andthird - chance to get it right. Somehow it is healing to see Lola run -not for her life but for her lover's. She is totally selfless each timebut tiny errors ruin the outcome the first two times.

True it is a bit wacky at times, but it is a good movie with a good plot and as far as I can tell, good acting (they speak German, so it's a bit hard to tell, but from what I can tell, good acting).  At a post Christmas sale, i found this movie on DVD for $20 so I bought it. The DVD offers english overdubbing, but I highly advise that you don't watch it with this as it takes away from certain aspects of it, instead watch it in German with Englsh subtitles. Lola is a girl who has a problem - her boyfriend, Manni has lost   100,000 marks on a bus that was meant to be delivered to his mob boss, Ronnie in 20 minutes, (point of interest - many people say that Manni smuggled drugs through, but they are in fact diamonds) Manni has called her in a frantic state, suggesting the idea that he rob a supermarket to get the money. Disagreeing with this, Lola demands that he stay where he is (in a phone box across from this supermarket) and that she will somehow come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes and meet him there. Here's the twist - There are three versions of this story where a little change affects the outcome. This movie is an energetic feast, with a good soundtrack and some great scenes (one involving a roulette wheel particularly took my fancy). It is pleasing to see that this got in the top 100 films on IMDB's list. I give it 10/10",

So I thought I'd check out the rest of his films.Lola gets a call from her boyfriend that he's lost his crime boss' money. And the boss is coming to collect it in 20 minutes. So Lola starts running, originally to see her dad who is a banker. And then depending on how fast she can go or whether she gets held up or not, entire lives can work out differently not only for herself but also for people that she bumps into - literally. The movie shows us 3 possible scenarios.The action's obviously quite fast, because she's running just about the whole movie, so you are made to feel that things are happening. But it's all extremely shallow, the thrills and developments are very uninteresting.We are shown fates of people we do not care about at all. This is one of the main flaws of this film. It assumes that the audience will care about strangers. The only guy I cared about in the movie was the homeless fellow, I looove that beard. Even Lola and her boyfriend didn't really move me, though they looked like a lovely couple.The overall message of the film is also very much irrelevant. That the little choices we make, or even just pure chance, can have big effects on our lives and others'. No kidding! Give this guy a Nobel Prize! But I have a question: So what??? You go about your life doing things the way you see fit. There's no place for what ifs and what would have happened if my dad had chosen my aunt instead of my mum? Irrelevant.The annoying thumping music adds insult to injury, it is very poor, something you would expect at a brain numbing nightclub just to keep you awake.All in all, it's an interesting enough film, if only cos you are curious how it will end but apart from Lola's and the homeless dude's hair there's not much there to really care for or remember.",

He acquired money for a drug deal and leaves it on a train. Now, Lola needs to get 100,000 francs to him in 20 minutes or he will be killed.\"Run Lola Run\" isn't as childish as \"Sliding Doors.\" It delves a lot deeper.The story presents itself in three acts--three different situations leading to outcomes in which the couple can end up in.Lola runs to her boyfriend's location and encounters many things and people on her way. Tykwer, the director, will have Lola bump into a person and he will assault you with a dozen, one-second, photographs showing the life of the person after \"Lola\" touches them.These are the best moments of the film. These photographs are a story in and of themselves. It delves at the crux of the thesis being presented.Essentially, if Lola were to bump into you (or not bump into you) that can make you get to the grocery store at a different time--and when you get there you would either be glad or frustrated; because you bought the winning lottery ticket or the person in front of you did.\"Run Lola Run\" is a beautiful meditation on how we are all inextricably tied to each other.It shows us that we can not control destiny. We can have a say in it, and we can try to initiate it--but it is our surroundings that ultimately determine where we get to.And then there is Lola--who runs and runs and runs. And she runs to techno music; the music that is designed purely to move the body.The movie is about time and space just as much as it is about destiny and what better way to see a woman trying to take hold of her life then having her run to hard-hitting, kinetic electronica?Your mind will be expanded with the complex butterfly-effect theme and it's relevance, while bopping your head to Franka Potente's mad dashes.Tom Tykwer is to be applauded, for bringing a blazing new originality to the screen!",

Lola's dopey boyfriend Manni stuffs up a financial exchange with his gangland boss and is short 100,000 marks. Lola has twenty minutes to find the cash or Manni is dead. The film explores Lola's race against time to find the money by various means, along the way just shifting the clock back and forward a few seconds or so to show what might happen when some little detail is altered. This is Sliding Doors but with a much more deft touch and without the dough. It's a fast film, brilliantly paced by the director Tommy Tykwer, without any flagging moments or uncertain patches. The characters of Lola and Manni are drawn with a swift stroke and a great deal of sympathy. Manni is a lovable klutz, Lola a long-suffering but faithful girlfriend but they are a likeable and believable couple. There is a whimsical pillow talk scene which is very funny and touching. The minor characters are quite complex and suggest much more if one wants to probe. Franka Potente is brilliant as Lola, both in her role and her neon-red hair. She also has the best scream since Fay Wray.Tykwer's use of colour is just wonderful. Lola's hair will be long remembered, and the saturated primaries \u0096 yellow trains, red ambulances, blue signs, look just those overpainted objects one sees in postcards of the Greek Islands \u0096more real than real.

Tykwer asks a lot of metaphysical questions (generally along the lines of \"What's the point?\") but he's far more adept at simple crowd-pleasing cinematic tricks, most of which work.

The idea of chance was never shown so well before and the idea of `anything-can-happen' has reached its peak in this movie. The three parts are amazingly built and each detail can be important. Contrary to most of the movies the spectator can't expect everything; each meter Lola runs, each corner of each street, each character, and each second can be a surprise. And we run with her during the whole movie wondering what can happen next second although we don't really do that for our own lives! And this movie is just about life and about the fact that every detail can be important: everything can change something else, and we can choose some things but not all. In the movie Lola and Manni try to control their own `destiny' (but can we talk about destiny or fate in this film or about chance?); of course they can't: some things are not connected to them and Tykwer uses video system to film that, I mean every shots that don't involve neither Lola nor Manni. This is one of the numerous examples of well-used techniques in `Lola Rennt'. Do you need another example? OK let's talk about the way Tykwer uses photographies! They allow him to speak about the future, which is very interesting because photographies are generally about the past, about memory, about remembrance. And photos are still and Tykwer speaks about time with them. How can you better talk about time by mixing past, present and future at the same time like Tykwer did? Aesthetically and technically the movie is perfect for the story: Tykwer follows the rhythm of Lola's running by making a quick alternation of shots (with the help of editor Mathilde Bonnefoy), beautifully combined with the techno music he also composed with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil. Of course sometimes Lola stops or the story focuses on Manni who waits for her, and Tykwer takes advantage of that to make the spectators think more about what's happening... and also what happened and what will happen! Therefore Lola, Tykwer and the audience are all able to breathe again for a while before continuing their epic race for life! Roberto Benigni told us that life is beautiful, Tom Tykwer showed us that life is just life! So let's run and try to catch the Time!Conclusion: a huge 12/10 for everything!!!",

Quite opposite from the best film of the decade (the Matrix) which got a large amount of attention when it was out.  Of course, this is not the type of movie mainstream America can enjoy.  It's innovative, unique, interesting, and there are not any mindless explosions or big-breasted bimbos.  If you are reading this review, you must already know the main storyline, so I won't waste time with it.But for those of you out there that enjoy thought-provoking films, I definately recommend this one.  Unlike the remakes and sequels Hollywood has been churning out recently, this film not only has an original storyline, but is inventive in the manner in which the story is shown, mixing a small amount of animation with live action and video.  Even though the presence of animation is minimal (excluding the opening credits), that is one of the most important parts of the film, because even though you see it three different times, that is where the first change takes place (Lola getting scared, Lola being tripped, and Lola jumping over dog and boy).  And from there, the chaos theory takes hold and we see as the one small change expands and multiplies, sending our heroine down completely different paths each time.  Another interesting part of the film is that as Lola goes down different paths each time, so do the people she interacts with directly (her father, her boyfriend, the people she runs by on the street).  This film has been compared to Groundhog's Day, and the similarty of repetition is striking.  The subtler similarity is that Lola seems to learn from each run through the way Bill Murray does in his movie.  This is also one of the few films where music actually plays a large part of the film's tone, instead of just random noise as in so many other movies.One last note.  Franka Potente, who played the title character,  is an amazing talent and I plan on keeping an eye out on future films involving her.",

So there still is hope for the continental celluloid industry.And anyway, if you haven't seen \"Run Lola Run\" by now, you should finally go and do it.

I believe people affect other people and other things everywhere on the planet at the speed of light even when they don\u00b4t meet directly (or interfere with each other).Cause physically, I think, people when they move or breathe differently they cause different atomical/chemical/electric reactions to the atoms floating around them, and those reaction are spread in waves all over the world, or all over the universe at the speed of light.So I wouldn\u00b4t of thought for example that Lola would of had to push the man on the bicycle (and the man on the bicycle going to the bar place selling the bike to the man with the beard...) for Mani at the other side of the city to have to act differently.. But surely, with my theory it would have been very difficult to make such a movie and have it still make sence.Anyhow, this movie was great entertainment.. And some german with english subtitles is a nice change from all those mostly stupid Hollywood productions. So I look forward to much more of this kind. I rated this movie 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "What is the lesson to this film? It is that life is a game of chance and therefore you cannot foresee or predict the future, however you can make slight adjustments that will steer chance towards a more favorable outcome. The film has many scenes which link a series of shots together creating an overall story. The plot is based on a theory called the butterfly affect; for each alternative interaction created there is an alternative reality for the situation as well as alternative realities for those touched. This theory is otherwise known as the chaos theory; small differences in reality can cause an array of alternative outcomes. Lola in the film is taking this approach to try and perfect her reactions to the sticky situation by taking the more passive approach to things. The shots of people on the street were filmed to link into this idea which is that in each scenario, it may lead to alternative reactions to the situation. For instance the woman walking down the street that Lola runs into with a stroller can either become a greedy gambler or a saint depending on what reality was handed to her. One reality: Lola runs into her and a snipped of the woman's future flashes, displaying her leading a life of greed. The alternative reality shown later in the film shows Lola running past the woman which changes her reality and instead of becoming a gambler, she becomes a devoted Christian. So what is reality in this film? Reality is a game of chance; however the characters have the power to change their realities. This film throws your mind into a time warp, thwarting you from scene to scene, shot to shot, throwing your mind into an allusive world of chaos and order. The viewer becomes thrown in and out of reality and leaves you guessing \"was that real?\" That is the beauty of this film, the characters have the power to change reality and create a more favorable approach. Other films such as The Butterfly Effect have approached the same idea however Run Lola, Run takes a more cinematic approach to the idea is an exquisite proverbial display of the characters. The movie was a perfect concoction of action, suspense, drama, with a delightful twist on reality.",

            "content": "Lola rennt (Run Lola Run) is a refreshing reuse of the strong theme from \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Sliding Doors\" - basically, that events depend on each other, and we could imagine a sort of alternate version of a day, or a life, or (as in this movie) of 20 minutes, where things are slightly different at first but get more and more different later on.In \"Lola,\" the idea is this:  Lola has 20 minutes to get a large amount of money to her boyfriend, or he'll probably be killed by his gangster boss. (This bothered me somewhat... I liked Lola, but wondered why she cared so much about this guy who seemed like such a loser...)  And over the various attempts at the 20 minute run, all kinds of things happen.The crucial difference between Lola and the others I've seen which are like it is that Lola is an action film.  In Groundhog day, the repetition was all about doing the day \"right\" or something; the movie was a comedy.  In Sliding Doors, there was a single branch; the two sides of the movie basically are concerned with what the woman's life is like on each side... it's a romance.  But with Lola there's an excitement that theothers didn't capture... in those, the choices the character makes are more internally important, but in Lola, the things that happen are important for an external reason: someone's life is in danger.That being said, Run Lola Run was a lot of fun, but the ending left me a bit unsatisfied; it felt more like it was a big joke, and the ending was the punchline.  Also, the whole movie felt a bit like a video game.  But this is a solid film experience, very exciting, and mentally stimulating.  What more do you want, really?  8 out of 10.",

I was also curious how certain situations during the film could not be avoided. For example the Meyers car accident, either Lola or Manni came in contact with the homeless person who found the bag of money on the subway, and the guy attempting to sell the bike. But I also loved the Intermissions of the film. The progress of aggression during the film for Lola was also a great concept. It seemed as if she learned a lesson after every version of the film.During every version of the film Lola came in some kind of contact with the homeless person who found Manni's bag of money he missed placed on the subway. The film immediately explains the big question why Lola was running throughout the film. The films starts off with Lola receiving a call from her boyfriend Manni who has been out into bad situation when he misplaces $100,000 of someones else's money. Lola then tells Manni to wait on her before he makes any further decisions. In the first take of the film Lola arrives too late and Manni robs a grocery. During the robbery Lola arrives and helps finish up the job but soon after wards they are surrounded by the police and she accidentally shot.The second take of the film Lola takes actions into her own hands by going to her fathers bank requesting a loan for the money when he refuses she decides to rob the bank. After retrieving the money and on her way to keep Manni from making a bad decision Manni dies.The third take of the film is in my opinion the best take. Neither Manni or Lola dies based on the better decisions they make during the film. Lola actually goes to the casino and wins $100,000 while at the same time Manni comes in contact with a homeless person who found his misplaced bag of money on a train and trades the homeless person the bag of money for a gun. In the end of this version of the film the money is retrieved and they receive even more money by making better decisions. Manni is then able to give the money back to his boss and keep his life at the same time.During the film out of all three different versions of the film with all of the three different outcomes made the film very interesting and kept me wondering what would happen next. I was mainly curious how one decision could impact the entire films outcome.",

            "content": "After reading some of the assaultive tripe left here by other users, I was compelled to write my own review with the intention of defending one of the most thoughtful and well written movies of the last hundred years. This movie poses the eternal question, \"What if?\" and does so in such a way that a second and third viewing are almost mandatory. If you disliked this movie, then you missed its point.*POSSIBLE Spoilers AHEAD* The movie follows Lola (played with an inordinate amount of subtlety by Franka Potente) as she tries to find a way to come up with 100000 marks (about $50000, for you state-siders) in just 20 minutes for the expressed purpose of saving her boyfriend. Honestly, the only thing about this movie I found implausible was how utterly stupid the Manni character (played by Moritz Bleibtreu) really was. Lola's plan is to get her father (a hot shot at the Deutcshe Bank) to give her the money, but when that doesn't work, she ends up helping Manni rob a grocery store and ultimately takes a bullet to the chest.Here is where the movie loses people, I think. For those of you who were expecting a typical love story or a \"gangster/find the money\" flick, prepare to be monumentally disappointed. It is at this point the film lays its last two cards on the table: temporal mechanics and quantum causality. Unbeknownst to the viewer, Lola actually has the ability to restart the entire chain of events, with somewhat chaotic consequences to those she interacts with. In the end, the sequence is shot three times, and the \"answer\" is something that couldn't have been foreseen by any of the characters.In short, this movie is a part ponderous think-piece, part music video, and part scientific agenda. The cinematography, set design, and cut-sequences are masterfully placed and executed. If, after a second viewing of this movie, you still think it is one of the most useless pieces of cinema ever released, you may want to head to the video store and rent either \"You Got Served\" or \"Gigli\": I imagine those would be much more to your liking.My rating: 10/10Note: If you are watching this movie in fullscreen (4:3) format, you will miss Franka's reaction shot at the end of the movie, which alone is worth the cost of the entire DVD.

It focuses in on little details (like the people she runs by and all the collisions here and there) rather than the big picture (Lola has to save her boyfriend's ass from thugs).  I'm glad Tom Twyker didn't try to sugarcoat \"Run Lola Run\" with ILM-esque special effects.  I did like the techno rhythms and sudden scene changes though.This is a really good movie.

Period.This picture is a masterpiece of world cinema.Tykwer has invested what seems like years into every frame of this movie. The concept is layed out in utter brilliance and confidence. The ideas mesh into a cohesive whole and form a very complete and rewarding film. Not only is the picture immensely enteratining, it is done with the care of a true artist, a true lover of film and a huge vision of what can be accomplished in a motion picture.I give these accolades based on many scenes in the movie. I think of the scene in which Lola (played with remarkable kinetic energy by the always amazing Franka Potente) is trying in vain to think of somebody who can assuage her dilemna. She thinks and ponders, time running against her, hands pressing against her drowning mind. Tykwer throws in all of the people that cross her brain for a mere split second of on screen time as she sifts through them all one by one at light speed. This is train of though filmmaking done with bravado. I think of the pacing and all of the little nuances that contribute to the speed of the film, and yet give it some serious emotional depth at the same time. Think of Lola's rage and bitter anger when she finds her father in talks with his mistress at his office. Think of the way Lola and Mani lay in bed together and discuss life in its most simple and yet convoluted of terms. Think of the cartoons, the imagery, the casino, the music...Allot of people may not have noticed, but the bank security guard who comes with Lola in the ambulance when she is hit by the truck turns out to be her REAL father. Yep, it was alluded to earlier in the film by Tykwer when her original father calls her a \"cuckoos egg\", inferring that her mother slept around. Well, turns around her mom slept with the security guard, producing Lola. This may explain the moment of connection between the two in the ambulance and it also explains his reaction when Lola is outside the bank screaming for her father and responds by saying something like, \"I thought youd never come!\" or something to that extent. It is sub plots like this that bring this film over the top and just contribute to its sheer strength as a film. If you look deeper into this film, you will find allot more than running.When Lola comes into the casino towards the end, looking anything but posh and in contrast to the rest of upper crusties present, Tykwer captures what I consider to be one of the most powerful ensemble moments in film history, without ANY WORDS! Lola struts in, takes a gamble, screams her lungs out, and walks out (fair and sqaure) with a massive lump sum of money. Watch how after this happens, Tykwer pans the camera slowly across the room. Every face he captures is one of utter and complete shock. Where did he find these people? How did he capture such amazing honesty? Look again and tell me it isnt an awe inspiring scene.Tykwer makes films for people who want to get whatever they want out of them. They are not black and white and they are not maniuplating. They are what they are. This work resembles the high octane punch of Picasso's 'Guernica', while his other landmark picture, \"The Princess and the Warrior\" has a slow burning and amazingly effective dose of Monet's Giverny paintings. He is both versatile and proffesional. If Run Lola Run goes down as his signature work, I would not be dissapointed.It is the work of an artist and a genius.",

A deal goes bad, probably drugs, and Lola's boyfriend loses the money in a subway and he can't get 100,000 franks within 20 minutes he's going to be killed. The movies simple structure and plot makes it pretty accessible to anyone even in German. And that's what I liked about it. It sticks to its plot and style, and does what it does best. And it's only 80 minutes too. The style of the movie is based off of a video game and the people Lola interacts with change their destiny. It's unique for the time because it wasn't done to death like modern films have made movies from video games. Tom Tyker shot the movie well and fits the pace of the movie.

Any closet fan of \"Saturday Night Live\" will remember Myers as the Post-Modern German Expressionist Dieter in one of the show's most bizarre creations, \"Sprockets\", where the characters would be garbed in tight black spandex and would implore others to \"Touch my monkey!\"  Indeed even the Kraftwerk-like theme song of this skit in its own little way prognosticated the extent to which the Germans had revitalized themselves through their art.  Of course the Germans have always been on the cutting edge of civilized culture: how else can one explain the great Germanics Wagner, Beethoven and Mozart, and to another extreme, their Austrian cousins Freud and Schnitzler?  But recently their milieu has been stretching into a more experimental dabbling into the boundaries their art can push.   If anything, one can call \"Run Lola Run\" a satisfactory entry into this fascinating German subculture from which sprang technopop and such acclaimed directors as Wolfgang Petersen and Werner Herzog.\"Run Lola Run\" opens with a metaphor which would be considered cryptic if it were taken seriously: \"The ball is round\" and \"The game lasts ninety-minutes\" (well, actually only 81, but who's counting?) The gorgeous waif Franke Potente portrays the energetic Lola, a cross-blend of Japanese anime and post-modernist fashion whose frantic restlessness is called into action when her lover Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) runs into trouble when losing 100,000 DM to a subway loiterer.  The camera follows Lola on three alternate realities, each dependent on how she chooses to evade the snarling dog at the corner of her apartment stairway.  Whether she remains intimidated or barks back (which she literally does in one episode) determines the final fate of her ultimate destination.Of course the plot is a loosely hinged clothesline on which to display Tykwer's breathtaking imagery.  Manni owes this lost cash to a drug dealer, and it is up to Lola each and every time to bail out her boyfriend.  But as long as the film seems to be breaking the cinematic narrative standard, my mind began to wander through other propositions: what would the situation be if Manni had not lost his cash, or if Lola had been able to meet the original transaction on time?  All of these questions are basically fruitless, since the film's success is interdependent with the comic-book lyricism it aims for.  Tykwer amalgamizes the super-heroine archetype so often found in the pages of graphic novels with a similar German stereotype emphasizing the paradoxical pseudo-masculinity of their women (indeed Potente possesses a sort of luminously chic warrior ethic which shines throughout her performance).Indeed whereas most movies will only go so far, \"Run Lola Run\" relishes its own over-the-top nature.  Pulsating techno-beats, the lively animation of its main character made explicit in the film's use of mixed media, and a gimmick for a plotline all point to this film's reflection of an emulation of the impatient visual style of American influences.  Although this may not be a good sign for the artistic future of Germany's film industry, it certainly serves as a catalyst in comparison to the jaded assembly-line manufacturing of supposed American action movies.   \"Run Lola Run\" is essentially exotic eye-candy with an almost disposable atmosphere, but it winks at the audience with unabandoned glee.  As the film reached its third (and happiest) conclusion, I was again reminded of another Mike Myers project: \"Wayne's World\".  That film made fun of the contrasting tendencies that separates some cinematic patrons from others: some are fans of ironic, existentialist resolutions; others like everything wrapped up in a neat little bow; and still others get a kick out of a nonsensical narrative break in action induced probably more by drug-induced hallucinations than true artistic merit.  \"Run Lola Run\" has its cake and eats it too, and it expects its audience to do the same.",

While the first and second episodes were focused entirely on the breakneck quest for money, at almost any cost, the last segment concentrated on a higher force, which added humanity to the plot.

            "content": "Run Lola Run - ***Franka Potente stars as Lola, a young woman who has exactly 20 minutes to acquire 100,000 Deutsche Marks in order to save the life of her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu.)  It seems that Manni has been serving as a courier to a local gangster.  When he accidentally leaves a bag full of money on the subway train, Manni frantically calls Lola.  He tells her that the kingpin will arrive in 20 minutes - and he'll want his money.  Lola must not only get the cash, but travel halfway across town to deliver it.  This is the simple premise of director Tom Tykwer's 81 minute film.  But it is not as simple as it first appears.  Much like Groundhog Day and Sliding Doors, Run Lola Run presents us with alternate versions of reality.  In effect, we see differing takes on the same scenario.  Lola gets not one, but three chances to successfully complete the mission.In comparing the three scenarios, one finds that many of the elements change only a little.  For instance, Lola may barge into a room thirty seconds later in Take 2 than she does in Take 1.  But these little differences can have enormous implications.  By running into the street and nearly getting hit by a car, Lola prevents the driver from crashing into oncoming traffic. But if Lola is thirty seconds faster, and misses the vehicle, then an automobile accident may occur.  You can see the possibilities.  In other respects, the takes vary dramatically.  In Take 3, for instance, Lola attempts to acquire the money by gambling at a casino.  In Takes 1 and 2, she tries to \"borrow\" the money from her father the banker.  What are these \"Takes?\"  Are they alternate, concurrent realities?  Are they \"redo\"s of the same reality?  Interestingly, the picture hints that Lola actually learns things from take to take.  And the character of the bank security guard also seems to be aware that events are repeating themselves.As Lola, Potente creates a strong-willed, fiercely determined, and intelligent character.  As she runs through the streets, with her bright red hair flowing in the wind and her tattooed torso wrinkling with effort, the audience cannot help but root for her.  Stylistically, the movie is reminiscent of the recent work of Oliver Stone.  It contains scenes of cartoon animation, alternating film stock, and pulsating music.  Right from the opening shot, the film loudly and proudly declares its artistic intentions.  Perhaps the movie's most audacious artistic endeavor is its use of the \"And Then\" montages.  Occasionally when Lola will come into contact with an incidental character, the film will pause for a moment to flash photographs from that person's life.  These photographs show not what happened to the bystander in the past, but what will happen in the future. We learn that people's futures will change depending upon their interactions with Lola.",

I've seen it 4 times now, and every time I've caught something new. I love the soundtrack to it as well. The music in the movie makes it seem like Lola is running faster.

He's in a phone booth downtown. He's in trouble with a gangster and needs $100,000 in German marks in twenty minutes or else he'll be killed.So, what does Lola do? Lola runs, of course! But it's not that simple. Lola passes by minor characters on the streets and you'll see their lives flash before your eyes. The story of Lola's twenty-minute long adventure is shown three consecutive times, each with different fates.Those who don't enjoy reading the yellow subtitles at the bottom of the screen, they may still enjoy this one, simply because it's only about an hour and twenty minutes long.After watching this film, I had to watch it again on television, which was only about two hours after my first viewing. It still didn't make tremendous sense, but I still enjoyed it wholeheartedly. I have to get this one on DVD!",

            "review_title": "Fast Paced and Edgy",
            "content": "If you are looking for a fast paced, edgy flick, then you can bet you found it with this drama. This film could fall under melodrama as the characters and events are over exaggerated in a plot that repeats itself in a rippling effect way. Parts of the movie would even put it in a crime or romantic drama as the main character is going as far as committing crimes for the man she loves. The camera follows a German girl, Lola, as she tries to save her boyfriend, Manni, with a techno soundtrack which could also classify it as a music drama. There was an array of fast-cutting and montage transitions which were very appropriate for the film. It also included a lot of parallel editing to show Lola in relativity to her current situation and the other characters current situations. The editing was part of what kept this film edgy. The sounds used were very effective. It was synchronized with a great sound track. The songs were mostly original and catchy. There were very few silent moments, but when there were, they were perfectly placed. The score was fast paced with a techno soundtrack. It created a feeling of being in a rush and a bit of uneasiness. It keeps the audience wondering, \"can she make it?!\" or \"how will this result?!\" The cinematography included many different camera perspective positions, distances, and movements. The combination displayed the fast pace of the movie and life in general as Lola ran through the city trying to figure out how to get $100,000 within 20 minutes. This film was created in the late 90's in Germany, and the atmosphere and social context closely resembled this. The technology of the time such as cordless land phones and there still being a need for phone booths indicate that it was still in the 90's. The hair styles, clothing, and vehicles were also all realistic to this period in Germany. After watching this film there are a two different meanings that I felt could be taken away. The meaning of the movie could be that there are many different possibilities that can come out of a situation or choice, so choose wisely because the consequences could be detrimental and last a life time. Different choices will yield different results. There was a song in the film called, \"What a Difference a Day Makes,\" which really sums it up. Or based off of the last scene it's quite possible that the meaning of the movie is your best bet, is to just make a bet and that we really have no control over the outcomes. My own personal influences and biases come from this being a German movie. I lived there when I was younger, so most German movies, good or bad, resonate strongly with me. This film was enjoyable in the aspect of how it depicted the reality of how one small change can set off a ripple effect in not just one's own life, but many others. I did feel that the ripple effect could have been better thought out or explained though. I was very curious why the situation that was chosen was the one that was, rather than the situation that happened in the previous five minute or five minutes later. In many of the ripple scenes I felt like I was left wondering why and how? There were a few things that I found quite annoying though. For instance, Lola seems to be a screamer, causing glass to shatter. I felt these parts were a bit unnecessary and ridiculous. I did enjoy the \"what if\" factor the movie created though. I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes only, but it is not a movie I would necessarily consider \"GOOD\". Some of the repetitiveness also got old. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would probably rate this movie a 7.",

But for me, all at once just as entertainment it doesn't do very well.The plot is very simple, giving the film maker an opportunity to play around much more with cinematic techniques. And the techniques used here are well done and entertaining. So the story is pegged at 20 minutes, and allowing for some overhead with parallel scenes and scenes from another slot of time, the film is over in about 30 minutes. Except it isn't. After the story is told, it is told again but the outcome is different. Then the story is told a third time, but with yet a third outcome. By the end of the second telling it started to pall. By the time it was all over it felt like a bit of an ordeal.However, I very much liked various aspects of the film. For one, I found the lead character, Lola, very appealing. I like her. So I propose some changes. I would edit out the first two versions of the story and turn it from a fair to poor feature length film into a good short film. Why remove the first two versions? Because I liked the third version and I did not like the first two. I thought the third fit the general mood of this film much better.",

Seems that these days, Hollywood studios think that any movie running less than two and a half hours can't be a truly worthwhile experience.

You get the impression that things are always on the go and that time is of the essence.  There isn't a dull moment.  The director controls the rate at which time passes as if with a control knob, first slowing things down, then speeding them up, sometimes focusing on details, other times letting everything go by in a blur.The message here seems to be one of fate controlling destiny: that tiny changes in events can have catastrophic or wonderful consequences down the road.  This message is driven home by the eerie \"flash forward\" still sequences that happen when Lola bumps into a stranger during her run.Overall, an excellent, fast-paced film, well worth a rental or a viewing at your local rep theater.",

Though I never got into a problem Manni had specifically cause I think I was more responsible then to do something that stupid. Some people take chances like that a lot but I would never. Anyway that's not the point.My focus is on Lola and Manni's relationship. To understand where I am coming from maybe you need to put yourself in the mind of where I might be coming from and struggling thru life to make something big happen and you have to think Bonnie and Clyde partners in crime situation. Before I even saw the movie I my thoughts were the same. How awesome it would be to have a relationship where you could totally trust someone and they would help you in almost any way possible. Another favorite movie of mine is Natural Born Killers that captures this but in a more real life version where often times the relationship just goes very sour. In Run Lola Run the relationship really satisfies me but is it realistic? In real life I would say it is extremely rare. You would have your significant other maybe pocketing money on you, ditching you for another guy or girl with more money, and you always have others wispering in your ears creating romours to destroy the relationship and get your guy or girl.I think their love is so powerful in this movie that I can't help fantasize about how awesome it is. But in the end it's always the same to me, an extremely rare case.We can the focus away from a life of crime and still get the same result. For example how many times have people been married in love and one gets cancer so they cheat and dump on their signifcant other only to dump them like burger wrapper in the trash or on the street.",

I can imagine that twenty years from now people will point to this movie as one that represents the style of the 90s. This means of course that we are confronted with a lot of MTV style editing and pounding dance music - something which might be an instant turn-off for some people - but luckily these stylistic devices are used in a way that works really well in my opinion.The fast edits and the adrenaline-soaked soundtrack do help to get across one of the major points of the film. That the things that change one's life radically usually happen within only a couple of minutes or seconds. Actually this principle is quite effectively illustrated by means of multi-leveled (or you could say fractal) storytelling. What I'm trying to say is that a basic time frame of 20 minutes which at the end reaches a vital conclusion is broken down into smaller units that each branch off into similarly critical chains of events of their own. Then multiply those 20 minutes by three and you have a movie. This might not make too much sense to you now but you will know what I'm talking about once you've seen the movie.Still, I don't think Run Lola Run is as deep or philosophical as it is made to be in some comments here. It doesn't fail to provoke thought and does offer some rather interesting takes on themes like fate, the interconnectedness of things (as Douglas Adams would put it) and - you guessed it - love (and its power to change things). It's just that you don't walk away from this thinking about life from a completely new perspective.But then, there's only one film (max) per decade that achieves this, and above all this was probably never the point here in the first place.Run Lola Run is just smart and fresh filmmaking.

I almost cried, I didn't want to move, there had to be more!Pros: Exciting, fast paced thrill rideCons: Who really cares? Lets just say there are a lot, but it really doesn't matter!\n9/10! Sure it won't stick in your head for weeks on end, but hey, if you want to pay for entertainment, I cannot think of a better film",

That was a big mistake. \"Lola Rennt\" is an ugly film that tries to be \"hip\" by using funky camera shots, tech-no music, and a lot of other high tech trickery designed to distract the audience from the fact that the film has no artistic or other redeeming qualities. Half the movie is just watching this annoying bottle dyed redhead running through city streets, with subliminal-like flashes of disturbing images (aborted babies and murdered bodies, just to name a few), and occasional ear piercing screams from the title character. Why would anyone pay money to subject themselves to such rubbish? I threw my copy in the garbage and would recommend that no one waste their money on one.

Franka Potente stars as Lola, whose shock of bright red hair ignited a fashion trend across Europe. \"Run Lola Run\" was written and directed by Tom Tykwer, who also composed the techno soundtrack. \"Lola\" is the story of a young woman who finds out her boyfriend is in trouble with the mob and needs 100,000 marks in 20 minutes or he will die. Lola literally runs through the streets of Berlin at top speed tripping over cars, running into bicyclists and trying to avoid vicious dogs. The gimmick here is that Lola's race against the clock is shown three times, with vastly different outcomes depending on the small variances in her encounters. This movie is a dazzling display of post-MTV film style. Tykwer uses animation, split-screen, rapid cutting and every other visual trick he can come up with, all set against a relentless techno beat. Very cool looking movie. As for the key issue of language... yes, this movie is in German. There are subtitles which will keep many people away. But the visuals are so striking, the story so well told just with the camera and editing, there is little you would miss if you saw a print without the subtitles.",

A foreign film, set in Germany, language, German with subtitles, the main characters acted out their parts in the highly emotional fashion expected for the story line, frenzied and frightened and needing a quick fix to a dangerous problem they face. The fix to the problem is not going to come easy. The story, he is involved in smuggling and is to deliver the illegally gained money by a fixed time. Because of background occurrences, his ill gotten gains are haphazardly forgotten for seconds on the tram then stolen from him. The probable outcome, he will be killed because of his blunder. What to do? Emotions run high, the pace is desperate and though spoken words are in German I could have followed the story without subtitles. You can tell what is happening thru the excellent dramatization. The music in the background fits, there is voice with lyrics re-telling the story line, very subtle. Each 3 sets have tiny little background stories happening creating more problems to be negotiated as in a maze. The ending, a bit unrealistic but not totally impossible, just not quite probable. I rate this one an 8. I got into it as it was so unique. Would I tell you to see it? Emphatically yes, because of it's uniqueness. Would I buy it?

And it is VERY European, noticeably so.\nFor a German film, the budget must have been stretched, probably the greatest production costs of any German film, for while, if not ever. The mix of a brilliantly fast and intense euro-techno soundtrack and fast pacey shooting make for \"beautiful\" film... exciting as well. The script is on the edge and very intriguing, I only wish I could have understood the German better then relying on subtitles for the half the film.\nA highly energetic modern piece, that sets itself high above the movie-machine celluloid pieces from the US.

The \"alternate version of events\"-based story is not a new idea - see La Riviere du Hibou (\"Incident at Owl Creek\") from 1962 through to Wayne's World, not to mention Alan Ayckbourn's plays \"Intimate Exchanges\", \"Sisterly Feelings\" and \"Man of the Moment\".The film has its good points. The leading actress is certainly entertaining to watch; I gather from a recent interview with her that the director tried several styles of \"running\" with her before settling on the one in the film, and it works. Those scenes are most absorbing - not dissimilar from parts of Besson's Nikita.  She gives a strong performance fraught with urgency throughout.Good music too.  Plus, the film does not overstay its welcome, just as well given the repetitive nature of the narrative.Maybe the trouble is that I was expecting something more innovative. Forgetting the point about the plot/concept (see above), there wasn't much to get excited about on other fronts either.  Cartoon inserts? Big deal, roll on Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. Split screen - been around since the 20's.  And we've all seen rapid, clipped editing before. \nOverall, it would be nice to see this director and the lead actress try something with a bit more substance and a few less (old) gimmicks, because I suspect at least the actress would be very good indeed.\nWorth getting out on video though.

The German title of the film is Lola rennt, which means \"Lola Runs\". Run Lola Run is different in the way that it tells the same story three times, each with a different ending. Lola's boyfriend, Manni, is supposed to deliver 100,000 marks to the Mafia boss, Ronnie, by noon. However, the money is stolen and Manni calls Lola for advice as to how to get the money he needs. Lola swears that she will get the money to him by noon, but she only has twenty minutes. Reality 1: Lola goes to her father at the bank to see if he will lend her the money. Reality 2: Lola runs to her father's bank but instead decides to rob it. Reality 3: Lola goes to a casino, to try to win the money she needsRun Lola Run uses a lot of clever camera shots. A type of shot that is continuously used is the 360 degree shot (where the camera circles the subject). 360 degree shots are especially difficult because the crew cannot be anywhere near the camera or actors or else they would show up as the camera turns around. The camera cannot be set up on tracks either or else the tracks would show up. There are many other clever shots used such as, tracking, jump- cuts, and panning. The music used in Run Lola Run has a continuous heavy beat to it. The beat symbolises the ticking of the clock as Lola's time is running out. Time is a main theme of the movie, and every so often the movie cuts to a view of a clock to show how much time is left. The movie is in real time, which means the amount of time it takes to watch a bit of the movie is the same amount of time the characters take to do all the things they do in that part of the movie (e.g. it takes 20 minutes of real time between the part where Lola sets off to when she reaches Manni).I really enjoyed the movie. It is fast paced, easy to follow, and constantly exciting. The plot is very clever in the way it shows that the smallest differences can result in large differences in the future. I would give this movie 7.5 out of 10.",

This is the ultimate \"race against the clock\" film- and what a great film it is. The director uses every trick in the book to tell this story. The main story, centering on Lola and her boyfriend Mani, is shown to us in color whereas her memories are shown as black and white. Plot that exists away from Lola and Mani are show in a grainy type of film. These tricks are designed to subconsciously differentiate the perspectives of the film.

The viewer is sucked into the action, which proceeds non stop from the beginning to the end.I would also like to mention that the sub-titles did not detract at all from my understanding and enjoyment of this film. In summary, this is truly one of the best films of the year, and highly recommended.  It is a very encouraging to see really original films such as this come onto the market. Hopefully we will see more from this film maker, and the actress who played Lola.",

The sound track was good, for the movie, but I would never buy it purely for listening.  However, this movie definitely relies on style over substance, something I normally deplore.  The characters (not the actors) are boneheads.  If any of them had bothered to look both ways before crossing a street most of the movie would be gone.  Just the same this movie won me over and I recommend it, if for no other reason than to see Franka Potente's hair!",

From what I can ascertain the ridiculous continuity errors are part of the whole alternate-reality effect (I don't mean the fact that different things happen, but rather that in the first reality she doesn't know how to use a gun and in the second one she does; again this can be interpreted differently if you watch the film) My only issue is the fact that the film quality wasn't that great, but apart from that it's got an excellent premise and the film-making is very clever... sadly I don't know much German but the subtitles were enough for me to think very highly of this film, so 8/10 works for me",

When I try to describe Lola Rennt to my friends, it always sounds weird and nonsensical. Basically, it is the same 20 minute story told 3 times in a row, each time with a different outcome because of some small quirk of fate, some butterfly effect, some random chaos in the universe. At the end of the film, it really makes you think, what might have happened if...... Watching it again and again, it totally blows your mind when you start to recognize and remember background characters and action that later factor into other alternate realities. It really is fun and interesting, but to even add to this, Lola Rennt has this amazing and hilarious data-burst effect. For every person Lola comes in contact with, they show, in a rapid series of still fotos, what happens to them later in their life. If you have DVD, some of the still shot stories are very funny or ironic. Franka Potente is just so cool and pretty in this film too. This is just a well crafted and very different film. Therefore, yet another of my favorite films.",

In the opening scene, Lola is thrust into a crisis (the one unvarying element of the plot).  Her costume leaves her ill-equipped to surmount Manni's impending doom, yet she somehow slogs through it all.  Two other cryptic elements that appear in each plot variation are the vicious dog and the its owner on the landing outside her apartment door, and the pane of plate glass being carried by the uniformed workmen across the street.

            "content": "In Run Lola Run, a shady deal goes smoothly until the leading man (Manni) leaves a bag of money behind on the subway, forgetting it in a moment of panic when he sees the police headed toward him.  Manni calls his girlfriend Lola for help, desperate because if he does not get the money to his boss quickly, he will be killed.  With only twenty minutes to recover or replace the money, the adventure begins.  Lola runs off to seek help from her banker father.  Manni waits for Lola, anxiously watching the clock while contemplating robbing a store to replace the money.  The director gives the entire plot a twist by offering up three different endings, each with a very different outcome. The quotes and contemplations in the beginning of the film still have me guessing as to what they might mean.  I spent an entire weekend pondering their significance, and decided that their connection to this film is perhaps something only the director understands. This is a very fast-paced movie, exemplified by the fast beat of the soundtrack.  The events take place within a short span of time, and the choice of music sets the mood well.  There is only one scene where a slower song is used, and it too fits the moment. Seeing the various clocks throughout the film remind you of the urgency of time.  Lola tries her best to come up with the money to spare the life of her beloved Manni, whom she has been dating for the past year, before time seals his fate with death. In between the alternate scenario endings, you see a love scene that presents a bit of irony to the film in that sometimes those silly `what if' conversations you have with your mate can come true in a way neither of you expected, which is exactly what happens with one of the possible conclusions. The small amount of animation that is in the film conveys a feeling that would have been difficult to express otherwise.  As Lola runs from her room and down the stairwell, the animation depicts the stairway as being endless, which is how you might expect it to feel if you had to run down many flights of stairs when time is urgent. As Lola is running through the city, she interacts with a few people.  In these moments, we see a flash-forward of what is going to happen to each of the individuals.  In each variation, the outcome of her encounter with these people is different, showing that small changes of fate may have a bigger impact on your life than you might realize. Overall, I think that is was an interesting film.  The use of animation, black and white flashbacks and split screens provides some variety and interest, and the use of alternate endings is a technique that is sure to please everyone, letting you decide which ending is best.  It would have been helpful if there were an English-dubbed version to watch, because having to read sub-titles is a distraction.  You can't completely focus on all the visual effects, acting and scenery when you are trying to read. Potente and Bleibtreu are excellent actors, with very realistic emotional display.  If you've never seen a foreign film and would like to, but you are afraid of being bored, then Run Lola Run is perfect.  Its fast pace keeps you interested, and it is fun to say the very least.",

            "content": "I walked into this film with the hopes of it being good.  I had read the review in Entertainment Weekly, but skipped the review in my local paper because they are never good at predicting things anyway.  They actually got this one right though (It got three and a half stars).The film centers around Lola, a young rebellious German girl who needs to help her semi-seedy criminal errand-boy get back 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes.  Kind of a strange plot scenario, but it was still effective.  The first time 20 minute segment that you see is a bit boring, but you'll be able to stay awake because it moves so quickly.  After that first time through, you'll want to stay to see the rest.  While I do agree that the dialogue was a little cheesy, it didn't take away from the film because you weren't really supposed to be listening to it anyway.  It was quite effective and I feel much more cultured now because I just watched a movie with subtitles.  It also really helped that I had taken German in school for 5 years.  I was actually able to understand most of the dialogue, even though my German vocabulary isn't all that large.The best part about this movie was the music.  Every song during the movie effectively heightened the scene whether to make it more suspenseful or comical.  No matter what it was planning on doing, it worked beautifully. Usually when a movie has music this good, something else is lacking.  Most often, it's the acting, but everyone in the cast really fit into the role. Lola seemed to be a rebellious twenty-something and Manni really looked like a criminal lackey.  Everything really was put together wonderfully.  The only complaint that I do have is with the animation.  You see it in the opening credits and then again when she runs down the stairs from her apartment, but that's it.  There are several other times when it could have been woven into the story.  Even if you combine it with the real stuff. That is the only real flaw I found in the movie.  I also really love the soccer metaphor at the beginning of the movie.  The only things known are that there is a ball and the game lasts for 90 minutes.  The rest is theory. The same is true for the story.  The only known is that Lola needs to get Manni 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes.  The rest is again, theory.Overall, I gave this movie a high 9, just on the edge of perfection.",

            "content": "'Run Lola Run' or 'Lola renn' as its known in German, is one of the most hyperkinetic films I have ever viewed. It is a textbook definition of a movie that puts style over substance. The plot: A young woman named Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend who says that he needs 100 000 dollars or else he may be killed. What' more? He needs it in the next twenty minutes. Lola decides to go out and try to find money fast, RUN LOLA RUN. The film offers three different versions of the events. all with different outcomes. But the plot really isn't the point. The point is to see how director Tom Tykwer manages to produce a film so stylish and exciting. At times its like watching a music video but with an involving plot and a length of 88 minutes. But the film never bores, it may become wearying but then Tykwer has another trick from the book to throw at us and we marvel at the film again. The terrific soundtrack is easilly one of the best in movie history. It communicates the hurried, hyperkinetic action of the film. You could close your eyes and just listen to the music and you could get an understanding of the film.. Lead actress Franka Potente communicates the music visually: Arms pumping,hair flailing; voice screaming and cussing; Its like watching an alcoholic run to the liquor store before it closes. In asurprising move, Tykwer develops the characters that Lola meets by using several dizzying flash frames to show us what their future will be after they meet Lola, all set to the wild techno music.. This may seem like cheating but it isn't, it clearly shows these characters lives without slowing the frenetic pace of the film. Lola's family members and friends are startlingly well-developed for this type of film. Tykwer manages to make the characters seem real, fully fleshed out and human. The fact that he manages to do that in a hyperkinetic film like this is truly amazing. Extremely entertaining, extremely stylish film with one of the best soundtracks in history. Not one of the best films in history but still a notable achievement............3/4.",

            "content": "As has been frequently noted, and nobody seems to deny that, the main concept of 'Run, Lola, Run' is taken straight from Kie\u015blowski's 'Blind chance' (Przypadek, 1981), including some very minor details. But this is where all the similarities between these two films end.Kie\u015blowski's masterpiece tells three variants of the same story, all three beginning exactly in the same way with a frantic run by the main protagonist. All three are literally oversaturated with deep contents and meaning, each segment easily offering more to the viewer than most film directors are capable to convey throughout all of their cinematic careers. It is like watching in one sitting three parts of 'The Decalogue' acted by the same actors. Except that 'The Decalogue' is generally purer and leaner (not to be meant as a criticism).In comparison, Tykwer's three variants of the same story have nearly no contents, and even less meaning. Compared to Kie\u015blowski's real human beings who live their real lives through deep existential and moral dilemmas, pondering on the meaning of things, on the consequences of actions they take, Tykwer's characters are like colorful plastic bags: beautiful on the outside, and absolutely no contents left in them. They have as much depth and truth in themselves as characters of comic books.Paradoxically, this may be exactly what Tom Tykwer wanted to portray: how shallow and vacuous is modern western society today. He found a very effective way to convey this idea by his very entertaining use of comic books imagery, pop-art techniques, and techno-pop rhythms. And he does so with a great technical skill.For many viewers hooked primarily on a gripping sequence of images (as was calculated by somebody, the film contains 1581 transitions in the span of only 81 minutes which leads to an average shot length of 3 seconds!) the deeper message of Tykwer's film may be obfuscated. But this inescapable reflection will dawn on a careful viewer when the film is over: do we really want to live as a comic book characters?'Run, Lola, Run' has been often criticized as 'thin', 'shallow', containing 'cheap existentialism', 'overrated'. While it is easy to see what causes such criticisms, the critics may be missing that this is perhaps not be considered a shortcoming of the film but rather one of its strengths.And indeed, this film as a whole, besides its undeniable entertaining value, may be offering us a remarkably accurate glimpse of the current state of the western society, oblivious to its own progressing cultural degradation and spiritual deprivations.You will be disappointed by Tykwer's film only if you come to it expecting, by association with Kie\u015blowski's name, something serious, profound, and deeply moving. On its own terms, as a comic book pastiche, Tykwer's art is first class.Visually the most appealing are the sequences that show Lola running. Perhaps, the only scenes when she is indeed beautiful, beautiful as a human being. In my opinion, the film stands on these scenes. Fortunately, there are very many throughout the film.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run Review How many times have you thought to your self `what if?'  There is one word that everyone fears, fate.  Fate controls our destiny and we always worry what the outcome may be.  For Tom Tykwer, a famous German Director, he shows us that if there were just one slight difference in timeline, the outcome could be very different. In 1998, he released an amazing film called Lola Rennt or, for all those people who can't speak German, Run Lola Run.  Set in the German capital of Berlin, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a small time courier for big gangsters, mistakenly loses 100,000DM on a train.  Calling his girl friend, Lola (Franka Potente), from a phone booth in a square, Manni lays down the story of what happened and how much trouble he will be in if he does not find and return the money by noon that day.  Lola apologizes for not picking up Manni at the collection point but is willing to help.  She has exactly twenty minutes find the 100,000DM by Noon.  Having no mode of transport to get her there she runs, fast.  Sounds simple enough! Well, not exactly. This film is unusual because there are three stories, each depicting the twenty minutes up to noon.  Same people and same mission but a different outcome.  The first timeline is 'on time'; the second Lola is behind time and the third she is ahead of time.  Going into too much detail will spoil the ending, or endings if you wish, and in any case, there is just too much detail to describe. The characters are very cleverly created and orchestrated.  Franka Potente, who is now internationally known for her part as the leading lady in the Bourne Identity, plays Lola, a young woman caught in a world of love, hate and stress.  Moritz Bleibtreu plays Manni, the love stricken and anxious boyfriend. Tom Tykwer is not only a director but he is a music composer, (who recently wrote the score for Any Given Sunday).  He has a broad, artistic, talent and experience, which show through in his direction of this film.  The treatment is both exquisite and unique.  The montage sequences worked well and speedy cartoons were basic and short but added to the overall excitement.  Tykwer uses his musical ability to help create a soundtrack that suits the film brilliantly.  The score matches the fast pace of the action.  Clearly Tykwer's musical experience is evident throughout. This is the first film I have seen of Tykwer's and it had me hooked from the start right through to the very end.  The opening scene was of all these blurred people standing around but about four people are in sharp focus and they turn out to have a key part to play in this film.  'What part,' do they play you ask? . Well, you'll just have to see the film for yourself to find out.  If you ignore that the film is in German with English subtitles and you liked Sliding Doors, you will love Run, Lola, Run. Rating:  5/5 Stars",

This movie has a lot of Lola running, which works surprisingly well. The movie's attention to side and auxiliary characters, and the see-into-the-future technique is very good. The basic plot is a look at a particularly intense 1/2 hour or so of the two main characters' lives, and the consequences of each of their decisions. Even the small decisions, the small steps, turn out to have significant effects. I liked the actors and the acting, particularly Lola. It's hard to run without looking stupid, but she pulls it off, and it contributes to the overall theme of the movie.",

After all, it's probably one of those stupid foreign language films where your eyes are glued to the subtitles the whole time, right? Absolutely wrong.Right from the first 10 seconds of the film you are thrown into the action, as Lola (Franka Potente) is given the situation via payphone by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu): He was supposed to deliver 100,000 Deutsch Marks to his mobster boss, but carelessly left it on a subway, which he was forced to take after Lola's moped was stolen and she could not meet him. He now has 20 minutes to get it back before his boss kills him. The film then follows Lola through three consecutive 'realities': How a minor difference in the realities can change the entire outcome. Following Lola as she races through Berlin to get the money and save her boyfriend, is an awesome music score that just adds to the excitement.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. As stated above, I thought it'd be boring, but in the long run, I was afraid to take my eyes off the screen for fear of missing something. You can hardly notice the German, as the various flashbacks and whatnot are enough alone to tell you what is going on.(Spoilers from here on end) The only part I did not enjoy was the two flashbacks in between realities one and two, where either Manni or Lola questions their relationship before their respective death's. Though it helped character development, it took away from the action and was one of those things i almost fast forwarded through. However, those who are suckers for Drama will enjoy it.9/10 for me.",

Packing three storylines, which each start off slightly different and slowly these small variations manifest into much larger ones, into only eighty minutes, Tom Tykwer presents a film full of energy which never looks like losing its place.   Do not let the thought of subtitles scare you away. The film's cinematography takes it onto another level, with slow-motion, split screen shots, flashbacks of meaningful conversations in the relationships of the protagonists and flashcards of what the future weeks and months hold for some of the films peripheral characters (hard to explain, but it works flawlessly on screen). A sound track full of life helps this film to invigorate in a way nothing I've seen recently even approaches. I found myself willing Lola to be able to save her love.",

This is the third film this year that has been sold to me as something 'Trainspotting'.  The other two 'Go' (American Trainspotting) and 'Human Traffic' (Welsh Trainspotting), were equally only vaguely linked with 'Trainspotting' by drug content and dance music.  All had different aims and messages.The theme of 'Run Lola Run' is not new, 'what if?' has been used in many other films before: 'It's a wonderful life'.  However, this is an excellent addition to the theme.  I'm not sure about the 'Groundhog Day' similarity that has been mentioned.  That film, which I really like, was based on being trapped in a single day.  'Run Lola Run' is about the freedom and unpredictability of the future.The choice of only a 20 minute timeframe is very good.  It builds the tension even before the phone is put down.  How can anyone get DM100 000 in only 20 minutes?   Watch Lola try - three time.'Run Lola Run' is a wonderful film.  It has immense energy, is funny, and makes you think.

The movie begins with Lola, a Red Haired 20-something who gets a phone call from her boyfriend telling her that he needs 100,000 marks (60,000 dollars)in twenty minutes. She Runs and Runs and Runs desperate to save her boyfriend's life. The whole movie was also helped by a great fast-paced, raving soundtrack. The was the Best Action/Thriller Movie I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies altogether.  Grade- A+",

I had heard that this was a movie worth checking out, but nothing I had heard or read prepared me for the blazing, throbbing, exhillerating rush of Lola and her incredible journey through the German urban jungle. Not only was the movie a sheer joy to watch and listen to, it was an intellectual treat touching on the most interesting of philosophical, moral, and religious questions.  Great filmmaking, unlike 99% of the crap that comes out of hollywood this German masterpiece simply blows away ALL U.S. movies of the last 10 years.  I could go on and on, but nothing I can say compares to the incredible experience of actually watching this cinematic marvel.  See it, think about it, see it again - it's the kind of movie that doesn't get old with repeated viewings, but rather reveals itself in new facets of depth and wonder with each new viewing! Enjoy!",

The originality and passion of the film combined with a seemingly German obsession with social interconnectedness (think Wim Wenders' Himmel uber Berlin and Bis ans Ende der Welt) was an emotionally powerful experience. The film, a mere 86 minutes, threw my emotions into a blender and kept me on the edge of my seat for good measure. This movie packed in more meaning, passion and substance than any other romance or action adventure I saw in '99. All of which were over two hours long. I hope this film inspires others in Hollywood and abroad to wake up, and realize that truly original and inspiring movies can still be made, even with out marquee stars and 8 figure budgets.....",

Otherwise, he'll be killed. He calls her up to help him. She runs to find money and keeps running till she's got the money and till her boyfriend is safe.The movie is actually very short in 'real time', only 30 minutes. But then it takes a turn and it is told from three perspectives which are all 20 minutes long, and they are all three hypothetical. That makes this movie interesting, but the thing I like the most in the film is the music. All these techno beats give the exact dose of adrenaline to the audience to keep them interested. And the techno is parallel with Lola, with her body, with her feelings, and with the situation. In a few words, an outstanding movie.9/10",

The subtle links between the three possible histories are nicely done, and that's the only thing that genuinely surprised me as having a little more substance than anything else in the film. I was remarkably restless and uncomfortable for such a short film that tries so hard to be breathlessly fast-paced. Franka Potente is very good as Lola, but hers is the only character given any amount of real attention, and even that attention is superficial. Manni (her boyfriend) is nothing more than a catalyst, and other supporting roles are unmemorable.To sum up... I thought I'd like it a lot, or perhaps love it. Instead, I give it a 5 out of 10.",

The first time I watched \"Run Lola Run\" it reminded of those very books. Lola (Franka Potente) learns that her boyfriend lost some money that he owes to some gangsters and she now has 20 minutes to find the money or some other way to help him. So, like the title says, she starts running. The story line by itself might be interesting in the hands of an average director, but director Tom Tykwer is clearly no average director. The story unfolds quickly to what seems to be a conclusion, but then we are suddenly whipped back in time and we see things unfold again, this time in a different way. Like life, this is a situation with multiple possibilities and Tykwer brilliantly finds a way to show us these multiple possibilities in an exciting and effective way. He uses great visual techniques and editing to move the story along at a breakneck speed. The film score is basically techno music, but it fits the mood and feel of the film perfectly. And then there is Potente, she has such great charisma and presence that you can't help but be drawn in and cheer for her. All of this works together to bring home the message of the film that even the smallest things can have large consequences. \"Run Lola Run\" is an incredibly compelling and frenetic film with depth and a wonderful spirit. The only thing that may disappoint you is that it over too quickly.",

Like me, they are all filmmaking students, so I was kind of stimulated by what they were saying, and I saw it at last.  The screen was kind of small, but it was good enough for me to enjoy the film pretty much.  Because I read some reviews about the film that the main character 'Lola' runs a lot, so I was really looking forward to it.   Then, the film started...What a pure enjoyment.  Overall, I would say that it was a very fresh and different experience.  It was really ENTERTAINING.  It reminded me of few films that could go with it on the same basic idea.  For example, 'Sliding Doors.'  The structure is almost same , but the broken time line is different.  'Mystery Train' by Jim Jarmush came across my mind as well.  And 'Pulp Fiction' also popped in my mind.  What I was thinking of is that there could be more than one way of showing a certain story in terms of different points of view.  Unlike 'Sliding Doors,' though, 'Run Lola Run (just 'Lola')' takes another way of telling the Lola's story, which was putting three different stories with three different endings in linear editing base when the first event happens differently. Basically, anything could happen in more than one way because of all the consequences that might follow after.  Also, unlike we see both stories happening simultaneously after the kind of important juncture which distinguishes the totally two opposite lives of our protaganist happens, 'Lola' deals with a very linear base of storytelling differently, which honestly, a bit boring because of almost the same beginning of Lola running down stairs and streets in some parts, which were not that critical at all.  However, as I said, overall, it worked because of the rapid tempo soundtracks and very unique compound of animation clips. Also, I enjoyed the various shots of Lola running on the streets until the end.There are some techniques that I don't see the point of using them, such as too much crane shots and steady-cam shots. However, I have to admit that they were very well planned out in terms of dramatic storytelling progress.  I think it's worth seeing it more than once, but it doesn't really deal with the real issue which is where we go from here.",

You just don't see people running that hard, that much, in movies.Run Lola Run is what I would call an immersive movie.  The premise is fairly simple.  Without giving too much away, Lola is running against the clock to save her boyfriend Manni.  If she doesn't succeed, he's most likely in for mortally serious trouble.  The movie follows her on her task, with interesting twists involving the people she meets, and how she affects them on her journey.  It's fast-paced all the way, with the music pulsing and throbbing in the background.  Throughout the film, you get multiple aspects of the same storyline, told in different ways with different cause-effect relationships along the way, and hence different endings.  It seems mostly like a study in entropy, with a cinematographer's touch.  It can be confusing the first time through, but the theme becomes clear by the end of the movie.The reason I say that it's immersive is that it's best watched by immersing yourself in the movie, and letting it carry you along with it.  The soundtrack works really well with the pace of the movie, helping to propel you along with Lola through the streets of Berlin.  The cinematography is right on with the frenetic pace as well.  What's best is that the movie doesn't make the mistake of being too long.  You're on the roller coaster long enough to maintain your excitement, without being on so long that you get nauseous.  In short, this movie moves!  I really enjoy watching it, being carried away by it.  It is definitely a movie to be experienced, and has kept me spellbound through multiple viewings.

It's a true original piece of cinema, which is so surprising in the darkest days of the Film Industry (recent-times). The best thing about this film is without a doubt the marvelous direction by Tom Tykwer. He does things with that camera hardly even thought up before. The entire film really sings to you, the cast is even very decent. Franka Potente does a good job as the film's star, Lola. Another good performance was by Mortiz Bleibreu was her boyfriend who is in trouble with a Mafioso over money. The basic plot is that Lola needs to try to get a whole lot of DeutschMarks in order to save her boyfriend's life, all within a mere amount of time, and it shows all the avenues she could go to get that money. Some deadly, some daring, you get the picture.My favorite character in this film was definitely the bum that ends up with the money Manni was originally suppose to transport.

Go subtitle, it won't hurt that much. Go check out this movie, if you get a chance. \"Die Tasche!\" 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Usually when movies are hyped as much as \"Lola Rennt\" was, I get skeptical and when I actually see the film, I am disappointed by it.  But \"Lola Rennt\" proved to be a much different experience.  Going into the film with the usual negative attitude for, as some of my friends said, \"the best movie ever,\" I was soon blown away by the stylized storytelling.  Films of this nature usually split up the time frame to add confusion (as in Nolan's \"Memento\"), needless complexity (as in Lynch's \"Muholland Drive\"), or simply to tell many stories simultaneously (as in Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\"). But \"Lola Rennt\" takes on the time frame [the 20mins Lola has to replace the money lost by her boyfriend, Manni] in a fresh, new way...tell the same story differently, three times.  The question of what if? plays itself out beautifully as Lola confronts her father, Manni, the police, and past friends and acquaintances.The hard part of the film, as far as I can see, lies in two areas:  the soundtrack and the jump-cut.  For those who feel that a soundtrack is necessary to flesh out emotions and dictate a kind of meaning to the images, then Lola Rennt is your film.  The hard driven techno score literally pounds you as Lola runs through three possible fates.  I must say that I cannot stand techno music, and yet I found that I was very pleased with its presence in this film.  The second possible flaw is the jump-cut.  In an effort to keep the audience on their toes, much as Lola is, director Tom Tykwer often uses long series of quick cuts, which can be disorienting and, at times, remove the audience from the film.  For example, as Lola runs into various characters throughout the film, quick cuts reveal the possible future paths (often quite disturbing and in my opinion quite unnecessary) of these people.  Having little to do with the film, other than continuing to address \"what if?\" I found that these quick cuts were an interesting experiment that should have been fleshed out more.O.K. enough of the bad.  What I loved about this film are the small details and subtleties.  For example, the simple repetition of the opening sequence with the slight alteration of the dog/Lola interaction.  It is subtle, but one has to understand that in a what if picture little things like a dog attacking or sleeping are left to chance too.  Another aspect of this film that I truly enjoyed was the camera shots.  The high shot looking down on Lola's red/orange hair as she runs diagonally thru the plaza is fantastic. The synchronized shot of Lola running as the train flies around the corner is amazing.  Simple shots, but beautiful in their own right.For movie fans that don't mind a little reading (yes, there are sub-titles) \"Lola Rennt\" is a must.I would also recommend:Amelie;  Four Rooms;  Memento;  Vivre sa Vie (1962);  The Boondock Saints",

Every element in Run Lola Run- from the slowly progressing soundtrack (not a mindless techno drone- some of you apparently were not LISTENING), right down to the highlights at the tips of Lola's red hair (meant to make her look like a fireball), is focused on realizing Tykwers fiercely energetic vision. Run Lola Run is the ultimate fusion of sight, sound, AND STORY- the only true achievement of post MTV filmmaking. More than a mere \"technical achievement\" as some here have called it, this most stylish of films is, at it core, a humanistic tale that explores the forces of fate, chance, and the consequences of personal choice.That said, know this- contrary to popular belief,THERE ARE NOT THREE ENDINGS TO THIS MOVIE!!!Find out why yourself, or read on:SPOILER----------------------------------------------------------------During the flashback before the last \"run\", Lola is told by her bo that she could \"just leave\"- a choice that would (we know) leave her out of the whole mess.

They're too busy trying to cater to the top $$$ demograhic, which leaves us with films such as Teaching Mrs Tingle and Brokedown Palace.  You all know the premise, Lola must come up with 100,000 DM ($25,000) in 20 minutes, or her man will reach his evolutionary limit.  What transpires is 3 versions of how it will go down, occuring within the same time constraints.\nA pretty cool concept, with even cooler cinematography. Lola is one in-shape Fraeulein, that is not afraid to lay it all on the line for her idiot boyfriend.  Of the 3 versions, I guess it's up to us to choose which one we like the most.\nAlthough for some, if you do not get sucked into the story in the first 5 mins, you're in for a long movie going experience.  The story is simple in nature, with hardly any character growth.  But it is the subtle variations in the early stages of each vignette that makes the viewer wonder \"what if\", ala \"Sliding Doors\".\nThe inventive use of scanning a person's future through quick snapshots  is very refreshing and original (My favorite was the dominatrix banker). Although I enjoyed the fast paced style that RLR was shot/edited/sounds, i can see how this might turn away the mainstream audience, that is accustomed to the generic style of filmmaking that seems to be the norm. \nWith the exception of directors such as Tarentino, the Wochowski brothers, and the Blair Witch dudes, it seems that fresh, cutting edge films will continue to resonate from overseas and film schools, where we all know they will never see the light of american mainstream.",

This film has a lot of subtlety and wit, which only add to the overall effect.  My hat goes off to Franka Potente, who is absolutely perfect for this role.

            "content": "Run Lola RunRun Lola Run is an extremely loud and graphic short movie. The high-paced and action- packed film sets the scene as the audience hopes to catch up. For example, within minutes the audience is given a setting with a man that is in dire need of $100,000 within 20 minutes. The scene is reset every time Manni (the man that lost the money) and/or Lola (Manni's girlfriend) are killed. Lola is sent in a scramble to come up with the $100,000 before it is too late. Considering this is a German film it is not out of the question to consider the background of German Expressionism to take center stage in Run Lola Run. According to German Expressionism, German films are generally set in an urban setting and showcase anti-heroic main characters. The audience knows that Manni is most likely engaged in illegal activities because the abundance of police in the film. Manni and Lola aren't exactly everyday heroes seen on the big screen. Run Lola Run also fits the bill as an Expressionist film because of its overall storyline is complete mayhem from beginning to end. This adrenaline-fueled flick seemed like an hour-long video game. Lola was not satisfied with the rules of life, or the game, until she received her desired result. This writer's light bulb beamed brightest when she 'remembered' the safety switch was on the handgun. She did not have to be told how to use the weapon because she had fired the weapon 10 minutes earlier. The concept of breaking the rules to life also applied to the casino scene. Lola was able to will her way to win money at a roulette table even though the odds were completely stacked against her. The color themes used in Run Lola Run also captivated this writer's attention. The color was sequenced according to scenes. Firstly, Lola has red hair and is surrounded in an apartment predominately of a red nature. Not to mention, the bag of money that Lola and Manni stole in the first scene was also red. The second scene featured more of an overarching green scene that showcased a green moneybag, the green painting that Lola threw angrily at her father, as well as Manni describing how Lola would meet a man with green eyes after his unfortunate death. Lastly the third 'life' previewed multiple color schemes. This writer noticed the color gold throughout the 'last-life' scene. Most notably, the color gold was used as the final moneybag and the gold clock that signified the running out of time. Not only was the color gold used but also the color white in the 'final-life' scene. Some examples include: the audience finally seeing the inside of the ambulance, the white ball used in roulette, and the white money chips also used in roulette. These colors may not point to exact explanations in the plot. But it was fascinating to see the development of the storyline as well as the transformation of color throughout the film. On a final note, this film had this writer on-edge and engaged for the duration of its hour and twelve minute runtime.",

The split screen scenes crank up the tension; the photomontages provide brief flash-forwards over the future course of the lives of those into whom Lola bumps; the different film stocks (Lola and her boyfriend are shot on film, everyone else on low-contrast videotape) literally show Lola and Manni's life as Technicolor standouts in a grey world.The plot twist, as others have pointed out, is not very original - Groundhog Day and the X-Files episode \"Monday\" have used very similar devices - but Twyker makes excellent use of it.  The critical problem is not making the repeat segments so similar that they are boring.  This Twyker manages well, even working in a bit of morality into an otherwise pretty amoral film (don't forget, Lola is effectively a gangster's moll): only by not using criminal methods do Lola and Manni manage to save the day.\nThe dialogue is enjoyable and often funny - the English voiceover doesn't do it credit, so this film really needs to be seen in German with subtitles. As for acting, it isn't exactly a demanding film for the actors, but they do their job quite satisfactorily.  Franka Potente is striking and charismatic - she will, I am sure, have received quite a few calls from Hollywood since RLR became the most successful German film abroad after \"Das Boot\".  The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding - the director co-wrote it and Potente is the lead singer, in English too, for some reason.  Ordinarily this wouldn't exactly be a recipe for success but the brassy Euro-techno beat of the soundtrack fits the picture perfectly, and is a pretty good album in its own right.I wouldn't say that this was a particularly cerebral film - Wim Wenders doesn't have anything to worry about - but it's enormously exhilarating. It works well on the small screen but you really have to view it on a full-size movie screen (make sure there's a good sound system!) for the full effect. I can guarantee that you'll leave the cinema with a sudden urge to jog all the way home...",

            "content": "Lola Rennt is a film that revolves around the haphazard art of finding balance in life.  In a given twenty-minute time span, years of choices and temptations condense themselves to form a plot-line of action and non-action, the beginning and the end as one.  But this broad-sounding statement of holistic film spectating is not as idealistic as it may seem. The triptych that comprises the film is an anthem to the existence of non-linear time and the interconnectedness of events.  Seemingly unrelated events intertwine to the ruin or success of Lola and Manni, and mere seconds spell death or life. In the first episode and the second, Manni's role in the telephone booth is minimal, as he embodies a trapped life, a passive player in the game.  The game, although at the beginning of the credits might be understood as football, can also be seen as life.  Substitute a clock-face for the football, the city streets for the turf, and we have a film that runs just under 90 minutes, the length of a football match.  And the film, like the game, leaves us where we began, but with new eyes.  In the third episode, the positive turn of events is in part the result of a changing approach on Lola and Manni's part.  However, the original instigator for the changes is Lola, or, to be more specific, her shift in mental resolve.  When she is unable to reach her father at the bank, she must face her situation without the aid of a big business or corporation.  Without a handout, but also without the emotional turmoil of encountering her father on that particular day in the office, Lola calls upon deeper powers to come to her aid. Hence, the afore-mentioned emerging balance. In a sense, the main theme of this film then tends more towards a synchronistic portrayal of time and the possibilities of both life and filmic characterization.  Various simultaneous events all conjoin to find a universally peaceable solution.  Of course, this is a reading biased by the points of view of Manni and Lola.  But to portray this convoluted reading on another level, the passivity of Manni during the first episodes, which leads to purely reactionary behaviors and emotions, is in contrast to the canon of films which cast the female in the passive role.  It is the third episode in which both Manni and Lola are actively problem solving, and neither is confined to a phone booth, a house, etc., that finds an elusive common thread.  This un-named synchronization of destiny is evidenced when the security guard inexplicably says, `you finally came, dear.'With the density of action that Lola Rennt gives, it is difficult to step back and extrapolate a relationship to other films and character legacies. But the episodic nature of the film undoubtedly creates room for the filmmakers to test boundaries of characters and their agency, simultaneously creating in the viewer obscure spaces for contemplation and action.",

A simple effective storyline, where Lola (Franke Potente) is on a 20 minute quest to save her boyfriend, Manni (Mortiz Bleibtreu) from being 'done' by big-time gangsters, as Manni has left 20,000DM of the gangster's money on the subway train!

I quickly found out that the idea this film is based around is quite original and fun to guess what will happen.The film is based around Lola and her boyfriend Manni.  Manni calls up Lola and says that he is in big trouble, because he just lost 100,000 deuschte marks and has 20 minutes to get it back.  He then says \"You say love can do anything, prove it to me, help me get the money\".  What happens next is quite different.  Basically, the next 20 minutes are played through with Lola running a lot and trying to get the money to Manni before he does anything drastic to try and get it himself.  Along the way, Lola affects different people's fate just by interacting with them.  The audience then quickly sees the fate of the people she interacts with, from dying in a crash to winning the lottery.  After the scenario ends not favorably, the films seems to push \"reset\" as if it was a video game and Lola retries the 20 minutes again.  This happens three times and captivated me throughout the film.  I was trying to guess what would happen next and I was quickly surprised.  Things of note: the use of animation to fill in certain scenes and the use of techno music to capture the speed and feeling of Lola's running.I loved this film and have recommended it to friends.  I wish to get the DVD so I can listen to the English audio instead of reading the subtitles, but everything worked out with them anyway.  This film is a must-see.",

Quotes T. S. Eliot in the opening prologue also how life is a game set the stage for the action.

I didn't mind watching her run that much at all. But c'mon, guys, at least 1/3 of the film was actual footage of her running. This might be cool to look at for 2 minutes, to the upbeat techno rythms provided, but after that limit, it's just plain.....boring.

OH yeah, and another thing, Europe, enough with the horrible mid-movie cartoons. Give it a rest. But I digress. Lola's second journey leads, predictably, to changes in events which only occurred because of a fraction of a time difference! Wow!

They didn't convey any ideas, they were just three possible choices she could have made. So what? I know (at least I hope:) it wasn't supposed to stretch any brain capacity, but because I saw no point to the film, I didn't even enjoy it on a superficial level. I found myself waiting for something to click and bring it all together...I guess I'm still waiting.I think the main characters partly spoiled it for me as well. I felt no connection with them, no sympathy for them, and to be honest, I found Franka Potente quite obnoxious.I don't know, perhaps I was just expecting more because of all the hype, but in my books, it certainly failed to deliver.",

The movie is about decisions we make in everyday life: big and small.  It's a neat idea.  Haven't you ever wondered what would happen if you had done something, no matter how minute, differently?  Would that have changed your life? The camera works and imagery of the film is also very appealing.  The sound track is excellent, and it mixes very well with the images.My rating: 10/10",

This new age masterpiece by Tom Tykwer shows the pure confidence of the writer/director, which makes the film such a delight to watch.  It is like no other foreign film.The manipulation of music, editing and imaging are executed to perfection. The movies fast pace will keep you on the edge of your seat, and although there is not much dialogue throughout the film, the parts which see Lola (Franka Potenete) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) talking in bed, gives the viewers a chance to catch their breath.It all starts with a phone call.  Manni is in trouble and calls Lola for help.  Manni has been caught up in a deal which involves him to deliver 100 000 marks to his gangster boss at 12:00pm or that is the end of him. Manni does a 'Two Hands' with the money and has 20 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to take place, to resolve the problem.Lola, being the good girlfriend she is decides to take matters into her own hands and tries desperately to get the money for Manni. The movie is split into three different storylines that retrace identical settings.  Each time the story changes depending of the behavior of Lola.  With the story being able to take any direction, it will leave you guessing on what to expect.With her symbolic bright red hair and constantly exposed tattoos, they could not have picked a more suitable actress for the role.  Franka Potenete shows gusto and high energy levels, which were an essential part to the pacing of the film.Lola doing what she does best. Running.\nSurprisingly, the movie was only shot with three cameras and one part was shot on a normal digital camera.  The effect that music has on the film is incredible.  The mixture of bizarre, dance beats created by Tom Tykwer and vocals by Franka will stick in your head for days.  The music accompanies the fast paced imaging and produces a high adrenaline atmosphere when Lola is running.A main theme that is evident in the film is the concept of fate.  It is totally questionable.  In Greek mythology, three goddesses controlled human lives, this storyline could be related to the one in the movie.Overall, 'Run Lola Run' is by far the best foreign film this year and has set the standards for years to come.  Its a scream, literally.9.5/10",

The film begins when Lola (Franka Potente) receives  a desperate phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu).  Manni has lost a bag of  money which he's suppose to deliver and tells Lola that she has 20 minutes to help him or  he'll rob the local store.  Instant panic strikes Lola as she knows his last resort will lead to his  demise.  Lola's immediate burst into action introduces her as the high tech heroine as she bursts through the streets in a full out sprint.   `Runa Lola Run' diverges from most Hollywood films through its mis-en-scene, separation of  linearity in expressing time and in it's leading lady, Lola.  Though Lola does seem to have  supernatural powers as her screech can break glass and her stare can make people bow to  her command, she is unlike the comic book stars we have traditionally seen.  Lola is not  fitted in a binding costume designed to exemplify her femininity.  Apart from many feminine  hero's who have worn binding clothes, high heels and their hair done ever so perfectly Lola defies this trend.  In her loose fitting cargo pants, exposed bra and clunky boots she is not  objectified through her attire.  Lola's hair is an awkward shade of red adding to her super  hero appeal while distancing her from the typical actress. Lola also lacks make-up,  something rarely seen on film. Tykwer does not allow Lola to fall subject to the cinematic  gaze that usually determines the characteristics of the female star. Though the film does a great job at empowering Lola and exemplifying her as a true heroine  in the first 2 versions of the 20 minute segment of time, the final scene that we are led to  believe concludes the film removes the power from Lola.  As Manni is able to counter his  mistakes of the previous two attempts Lola isn't necessary anymore.  Suddenly the film  concludes and her actions seem frivolous as her efforts are neglected and the camera follows  the couple while they walk away hand in hand.   I thought `Run Lola Run' was a wonderful film in its exemplary editing techniques, incorporation of animation, digital video and film as well as the time manipulation.   It forces  its audience to distance themselves from the normative narrative structure leading to  increasing anticipation and thought provoking interaction with the film.  As far as Lola as the  leading character Tykwer made a great step in advancing the female heroine but we still have  a way to go as the film falls into the stereotype that the male is ultimately dominant and  doesn't need help from anyone, especially a woman.",

In this film, the viewers are confronted with a `heroine' that when not satisfied with the outcome, chooses to `do-over' her life, or only 20 minutes of her life. Lola is not the typical Hollywood heroin, always looking prim and proper; she gives off the more realistic side when confronted with an intense situation. Lola shows that the smallest decision can change everything from then on. Throughout the film, she takes on the so-called masculine role and takes action rather than crying and waiting for someone else to take charge. But when those 20 minutes are up, it seems as though her female lead crumbles and she once again takes the feminine role in the relationship. It seems questionable that her heroic attributes are only due to the framing and digital weaving of the film rather than the actual character. Overall, it was interesting to see a different side of femininity and the effects in which it had on the viewers.",

            "content": "Lola, played by Franka Potente, is a typical young girl who would do anything for her boyfriend Manni.  Tom Tykwer focuses on time in this movie. The movie begins by showing a clock, this concept runs throughout the whole film with the main conception of time is money.  Lola has three chances (three twenty minute episodes) to get Manni money that he has lost.  If Manni does not get this money to certain men before a certain time, he will die.  This movie deals with repetition with slight changes, and is very interesting.  Lola, right up until the last seconds of the film is portrayed as a hero.  She tries different ways to get the money for Manni, and does not want to screw up anyone else's life in the process.  This represents the Chaos Theory, which states that, the smallest thing in the world can change something on the other side of the world, or simply that the smallest decision in your life can have a huge impact on the rest of your life.Since this is a German film, Lola is not your typical American heroin. She is not a Hollywood heroin that is extremely skinny with long hair, and skimpy little outfits.  Lola counteracts these stereotypical heroin traits, when she runs through the German city in her clunky boots, a tank top that reveals her bra strap, hair that she did not brush to make pin straight before she left her house, and she also has a lack of make up on her face.Lola is, as John Berger would say, being surveyed by the male surveyors in her life.  Manni takes Lola for granted, he does not show her affection, yet in one of the episodes they are lying in bed, and he asks Lola if she wants to leave him, her response is that she does not know.  Manni relies on Lola to help him whenever he needs it, but does not feel he needs to return the favor.  Lola's father is also surveying her.  He does not really care about his daughter either.  He is having an affair with a woman who wants to have a baby.  When Lola goes to him and asks him for money, because he works in a bank, he is reluctant and could care less about the situations that his daughter faces or about her well being.  Lola is then forced to pull a gun on her father to get the money. This film is entertaining and portrays a collision effect between reality and fantasy, portrayed by the way in which Lola can stop time and do things over again.  Lola is portrayed as the action hero, which is rare when a woman is in a movie surrounded by men.  Yet, Lola is depicted as this action hero but not completely.  In the last episode, at the end, the camera zooms right to Lola and Manni holding hands.  Lola was robbed of being the hero by Manni, and the lyrics to the music in the background are `I don't need you' and ends on a shot of his face.",

It is the point at which a soccer ball is kicked into the air where you know you are dealing with a unique movie. Unique then at least since one could say directors have been picking bits off of it since it came out.I will not summarize the plot because, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey (to which it shares not a single similarity except for a heavy use of music) the plot isn't the point. The exposition is out in less than five minutes and it is this.. There is a chick named Lola, and she has to get somewhere... in 20 minutes! The movie is an hour and a half so something has to be fishy here.\"So what you are telling me Cory... is that you are giving a 9 rating to a movie where you watch a girl run... run A LOT?\" to which I say \"Hell Yeah! She also screams as a superpower!\" I've gotten so used to this movie I usually don't use the English Dub because.. well it's awful but subtitles are worse when you're legally blind.I could write paragraphs just on the influence of this movie on how we see cinema these days. Try watching Tron: Legacy after seeing this and tell me there's no connection. I could write those paragraphs but I'm not going to because talking about a movie's \"Influence\" brings thoughts of tedium and \"Required Watching\" that can be the death of an enjoyable movie. Whatever this movie is it is not boring.My mom described her first viewing of this movie with this eloquent and rather succinct statement: \"I started the movie and then it was over and I felt like I had been drinking well that night.\" Just to be clear... dead sober!

            "review_title": "Brief thoughts on the movie",
            "content": "I recently watched Run Lola Run, one of the most pioneering independent films ever to come out of Germany. This film contrasted the usual Hollywood blockbusters; not only on structure & narrative, but there was far more depth than your average action film. The movie opens on an old wooden clock (before the opening credits) and the theme of time is used throughout. Watching it, I could tell that the director cared for the film, and it wasn't simply another job he was working on - the animation used in the opening credits, and the start of each chapter or sequence aided the hand crafted feel of the movie. Filming sections in video showed grit and realism, while helping to maintain the \"home made\" appearance. Scenes with either Lola or Manni were shot using film, where background characters were shot using video. This was done to make the main characters closer to the audience, so that we could bond better with them. Conveniently for X-Filme, this would prove to work a lot cheaper than shooting the whole movie in film. Usually a production company, BBC for example in Fawlty Towers, would use film for indoors/on set and video for outdoors. This is because film cameras are heavier (and therefore harder to move around outside) than video cameras. In Run Lola Run, the transition between film/video is hardly noticeable in such a fast paced film. Although, I suppose the film needs to be fast paced, to fit in all the supporting characters, the sub-plots, the love story, the stunts and the action scenes... Three times... All under 80 minutes!Much like the TV drama \"24\", it's filmed in real time; as a minute goes by on screen, a minute goes by in real life. Time is not abbreviated, and this helps the viewer become involved - in each chapter, Lola has 20 minutes to meet Manni so we follow Lola as everything is happening, with the sequence lasting 20 minutes so we can see every action she's taking or decision she's making. At the start of every chapter, we see Lola pondering who to go to for help. The way this is shown is by flashing all the options of who to go to on screen- almost like the way subliminal messaging is used within video. I find this clever, as the subliminal messaging technique is used to let the audience see inside the character's mind, instead of the traditional way of the subliminal message getting inside the audiences mind. Despite the same situation being presented to Lola three times, the minor decisions she made in each attempt dramatically altered the outcome of {not only the story}, but the fate of the background characters. Depending whether Lola accidentally bangs into a woman in the street, or runs by her determines if that woman will die a happy reformed Christian, or have her kids taken off her and resort to baby snatching. These flash-forward sequences are done with Polaroid-like still frames, each depicting a key element in the character's future. Although minor actions could dramatically change those outcomes, some issues stayed the same. In particular, the heart condition of the security guard. When Lola robs the bank, the security guard is seen clutching his chest with a faint heartbeat in the background. Then in another chapter, as Lola runs out of the bank, there is a few seconds where Lola stares at the security guard and he stares back. Somehow both of them can feel what happened in the previous chapter, and the same heartbeat is heard in the background. Then in the final chapter when Lola enters the ambulance, there lays the security guard on the trolley after having a heart attack.It's the attention to detail, and the little internal references that made me enjoy Run Lola Run. Such as the ball landing on the number 20 towards the end of the film \u0096 the number 20 was used as that's how long each chapter lasted. While watching the director's commentary on the DVD, there was mention of a possible sequel. One can only hope. Overall I enjoyed the film, as it was presented in such an interesting fashion, totally different from what I'd seen before.",

Tarentino and company could learn a lot from RUN LOLA RUN about creating likeable characters and telling their story in a film that uses (as opposed to abuses) clever cinematic tricks to keep an audience both on the edge of their seats with suspense and howling with laughter. Filled with irony, sympathy and style, this film gives the lie to the old stereotype of Germans not having a sense of humor.  Enjoy America Enjoy.",

Well, not really, and in the case of 'Lola Rennt' definitely not.'Lola Rennt' is the third movie of Tom Tykwer, a young German moviemaker. His 'Wintersleepers' was remarkable, but everything in 'Lola Rennt' has become more mature, in better shape and most of all: compact.The emphasis lays on speed and its twin brother, time. Thus the fast music (of director Tom Tykwer himself) is an important factor of the movie. Tykwer once said in an interview that he is very scared if someone else would compose music for his movies. Tykwer considers movies in the first place as a symbiosis between image and sound. The montage helps very much to force up the speed of the movie. All sorts of image sources and techniques are combined: film, video, animation, photo sequences, split screen... The whole looks more like a long video clip.Therefore 'Lola Rennt' should be liked by the youth, but the \"matured\" audience can enjoy this modern masterpiece as well.",

I mean the scene from \"Trainspotting\" with the drug trip, accompanied by the excellent track \"For what you dream of\" by Bedrock featuring KYO. It also shares the surreality that governs most of \"Lola rennt\". Another scene that brought up memories showed the main couple of actors robbing a Berlin supermarket - reminded me of the hold up scene from \"Pulp Fiction\". \"Lola rennt\" also uses an idea seen in \"Groundhog day\" - excuse this last association - I'll stop now :-)The storyline of this film should not be taken too seriously, rather enjoy the strange scenery of Berlin and the interesting characters and the body-shaking music - I bought the soundtrack right after leaving the cinema.",

This movie seems like the atypical thriller film because Lola is in Germany, and has twenty minutes to find and bring 100,000 Deutschmarks to her boyfriend before he robs a supermarket. I thought that the editing was appropriate for this movie. If I was in Lola's shoes I would have the same kind of reactions and thoughts. The movie flashes back to the beginning of the story to where Manni has screwed up, and then leads you to what is happening in present time. There are also flash-forwards throughout the movie that show events that certain people are going to face in the movie. The fade in and fade out effects that the editors used between scenes made it very appropriate for the situation taking place in the movie. The sound use in this film was very effective because it made you feel like you were there and it really depicted the feeling of stress that the characters were going through. The scores used in this film were eliciting at some points but mainly appropriate at the times music was needed during the movie. The social context used in this film was present and understandable. It showed different stories and lives but also how they all connected in certain ways to one another. The social aspect of this film was short and to the point, which makes good use of social context. The film's cinematography was astounding. This aspect of film was what really caught and grabbed my attention the most. The camera angle in this film used all four views; birds eye, eye level, high angle, and low angle. The zoom in and zoom out technique in this film let you know that Lola was running faster and faster. By the time the camera would zoom out you would see that she wasn't running that fast. The camera angles help with this aspect of zooming as well. The close up shots were used at the correct times and made you really engage in the character that was talking. The significance of this film is that we always have choices in life. We can always break down different scenarios in order to make the right choice. This movie has had a lot of personal influences as to the way these characters feel in the film. I can relate to causing problems and screwing up much like this film has shown. This is what drew me into the film, along with other aspects. This film was very enjoyable to watch because it was fast-paced and kept you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this film to people that enjoy sitting and paying attention to films. This film is so fast-paced that you really have to concentrate closely to what is going on in the storyline. There are many plot lines and this is why you really have to pay attention to what is going on. I recommend this movie with an 8.5 star rating.",

Contrast with real life where only one chance is allowed brings ironic perspective; if only real life allowed us to go back and repeat our lives until we get them right. From this perspective real life seems totally unfair, but what can you do but laugh? I do have a question that I would like readers to respond to: in the third run-through, who is the man in the ambulance?  For plot reasons, I think the man is Lola's father but my son thinks it was Mr. Murphy.  It's often difficult to identify characters when  they're photographed  from the chin angle. Things must go better with father in this third act to keep it all consistent with the overall improvement, I think.

I can remember a specific scene where the movie becomes so well done, so moving that there is no choice for me but to love the movie. It's very seldom something sentimental.  It's usually a great shot, a well executed special effect, something of that sort.  The scene that did it in this movie was Lola running underneath the elevated train tracks for the second time.  Don't ask me WHY, because it's a subjective thing.So it's established that I love this movie.  One of the things that made me fall in love was that I thought this was a 'quantum physics' movie, where we get to see different possible outcomes of events, where tiny changes in timing can cause large-scale, life-changing events.  One of the interpretations of quantum physics is that everything that CAN happen DOES happen, creating an infinity of universes in the process.  This seemed to be what was happening in the movie.A few minutes later, I realized that it was not your normal quantum physics movie at all, because it became obvious that Lola was somehow resetting time, and then proceeding through the events that unfold with a knowledge of her previous actions and the results they produced.  She does this until, on the third time through, she gets the results she was after, saving her boyfriend and getting a pile of loot as a bonus!  So it turned out to be something more than the 'many worlds' plotline, a story about a woman who can 'see' the different universes, and choose the one with the results she wants.  And not only that, this great idea is presented in a movie with a pulsing, driving pace that never quits!  Can I say one more time THAT I LOVE THIS MOVIE?",

Given that, It may be surprising to learn that I liked this movie a lot.Although the story is not terribly original (think: Sliding Doors on heroin), it is not often that a small film like this commands the viewer's attention (rapt attention) so unrelentingly.  The combination of soundtrack, generous use of slow motion, and, yes, that HAIR, grabbed each and every one of us by the nose and told us \"DON'T BLINK\".  I think we would all be perfectly content to watch Lola run all day long.So the film is not \"genius\".  Its luck.  If you're feeling generous, maybe luck and a little bit of skill.  But it works, in the sense that a quickie in the bathroom of the restaurant works.  Its a hell of a lot of fun, but it sure seems like it's over quick, you're sweaty after, and there's not much heart in it.",

            "content": "Basically this is a response to two arguments ppl have against this movie which are pretty closely related. Namely, it is \"MTV-like\" without substance, or it is using a gimmick (the 3 repetitions) and is without much substance other than that. Granted the novelty of repeating the same thing 3 times is not really all that novel at all, it has been done b4. There is an important difference though. In Lola Rennt this technique (is it technically a technique? film isnt my medium) is completely integrated with the purpose of the film, and that is its strength and quite a phenomenal accomplishment. As those of you who have seen the film know the main theme revolves around the general subject of fate. Of course this is a broad topic which poses a lot of questions itself . . where was I? RIght well fate, the consequences of your decisions, how much affect your decisions have on your life, all that shit. Lola Rennt addresses this profound (for a movie that had reasonably wide release in NA) subject head-on but doesnt become didactic in the end. The 3 parts play out the question but it is left for you to think about at the end. The very definition of thought provoking. Case in point -- after I left the theatre with my friend we said goodbye to 3 other ppl and thought about which direction we should walk in (eg bar-home-whatever). We ran back into those 3 ppl a few minutes later and it was a bit of a \"trip\" since we were acting out the very point/question that was in the movie. If we walk this way what will happen? Ok i think Im getting lost here. My point is though that the subject addressed is substantial and the so-called gimmick of splitting it into 3 has a definite purpose and succeeds completely. As a traditional old-school teacher of mine used to day \"Repetition gives integration\". As for the claim that it is just an extended music video, well that is mostly answered up there. But the speed /music etc. of the movie is also integral to the 3 split device working with the purpose. The speed at which everything is taking place, time moving on, your decisions in time etc. are connected to the all that  aforementioned. It is best summed up in one of the perfectly apt philosophical quotes in the movie: \"Before the game is after the game\" (paraphrased from memory). It is really a very \"meaty\" subject if you think about it, and this show doenst just touch on it indirectly, it tackles it head-on.",

            "content": "\"Stay where you are. I will help you.\"With this promise, Lola flings down the phone and runs. She runs down streets, over bridges, across town. Lola runs in a wordless panic, charged with an impossible mission and accompanied by thumping electronica. She must somehow put together 100,000 marks to replace the proceeds of a drug transaction, or else her hapless boyfriend and nascent gangster, Manni, will suffer the tender mercies of heroine-dealing henchmen. Manni did not steal this sizable sum. He lost it on the subway.Lola must replace the money and get it to Manni in 20 minutes.These 20 minutes replay across the screen in what must be the most enthralling and emotionally charged film made in the last decade. The camera work is stunning and frenetic -- more like that of music video than a feature motion picture. Passive entertainment is shattered as what you see and hear mesmerizes you. You run with Lola.'Chase' scenes are usually momentary adrenaline-charged diversions. In \"Run Lola Run,\" director/writer Tom Tykwer deftly turns this inside out. Lola's panicked pacing fills most of the film's 90-minute running time, sustaining the exhilaration for much longer than you might imagine practicable. The few moments of respite suggest reasons for why Lola runs, and these quite tender vignettes only intensify the charge when we rejoin her in the street. Lola is kept in her paces by some familiar plot devices that have been given new legs, so to speak. The plot does not twist so much as it manages to unfold along multiple vectors.Other flourishes render the visuals inseparable from the tale. As Lola brushes past people on the street, we are given brief insight into the course that their lives will take as a consequence of these collisions. The effect is well accomplished with fast-shuttling Polaroid stills. After the initial jarring impression, the play of these images launches new plot tangents and softens what might otherwise have been heavy-handed existentialism for those less interested in such things.Those who are interested won't be disappointed. There are the inevitable comparisons to \"The Bicycle Thief\" and other cinematic touchstones for cinephiles to commiserate over, a scene with the best cut-shot since \"2001,\" and more possible interpretations of the lead protagonist's motives than have been seen since Bladerunner's Deckard. Is Lola a low-rent Messiah who inadvertently redeems all she bumps into? Is she a post-feminist heroine who must save masculinity from its weaknesses and whose primal scream can invoke the occult forces of nature? Or is she just the 'perfect girlfriend' who literally gambles everything to spare the life of a guy just smart enough to appreciate that she is, in fact, the 'best girl.'I hadn't intended to compose a valentine, but this film grabbed me. If there was one thing that could improve my home somewhat less than hot and cold running water, it would be \"Run Lola Run\" playing in a continuous loop somewhere.",

I suggest watching it only in the original German language to really get the feel for this movie, and the heart-racing emotions displayed in the actor's voices. Peticularly, Franka Potente, (also see, \"The Princess and the Warrior\" and \"The Bourne Identity\"), who has never been a let-down in any movie I've seen her in so far, regardless of language. Run Lola Run, (a title with an eerie reminder of the '70s classic Logans Run) moves so fast that it made it difficult for me to catch all the action on the screen as well as trying to keep up with the subtitles. However, as long as you've got the time, it is definitely worth a second viewing. Plus... it's much faster than learning the language. Don't do this film or yourself an injustice by watching it in the English version though, as my vote goes from a 9 to a 2 from the truly unemotional acting in the voice-overs. Aside from that, this is a genuine, fable of a film, chock-full of action that I couldn't take my eyes off of for a moment, even if I'd just dropped my last cheese nacho off one of my chins and onto my lap.",

Well after watching the German thriller Lola Rennt, you will have to answer many philosophical questions about your beliefs. This movie contains many great mixes of original filming techniques with reference to the occasional change from film into what looks like a five year olds drawing flipbook.The incorporation also of the fast rhythm and beat of the dance/techno music adds an emotional hype to the situation the lead characters find themselves `running' into. Franca Potente plays the emotional, high pitched screamer Lola, who has twenty minutes to save her boyfriend Mannie, played by Moritz Bleibtreu from the unlucky situation their choices have lead them to.The whole movie revolves around the clock and the Number twenty, as that's how many minutes Lola has to reach Mannie before he makes a very decisive decision. This modern Ground Hog day flick uses an unusual but brilliant idea. Each time Lola runs pass a particular person, based on the decisions Lola makes before they meet, we see a brief but exciting 10 second flash of future polaroid like pictures of that person's life. This movie includes many unique shots and spilt screen effects that are put to first class use emphasizing the reality of the race against time.Through some cheap but effective special effects the movie draws the viewer into its seemingly never-ending circle of running, and crime. Eventually reaching a resolution. I give the movie 7/10 as it starts to get a bit `stale' as you find yourself saying `here we go again' but overall not a bad sit.

            "review_title": "Trying to interpret...",
            "content": "I prefer to call a movie intelligent, if it keeps us glued till its end, as well as if it keeps us thinking after. With a running time of just over 75 minutes, Run Lola Run accomplishes exactly that! I will not go into the plot here, rather try to point out what I interpreted from the movie.You meet people in your life, whose life you have no influence on. You rarely matter in their life, and what happens to them is not at all related to your interaction with them. This is portrayed by at least 2 characters Lola meets in the movie, the lady with the baby, and the cyclist. In each of the 3 run's, the story of the lady (shown as snapshots), and the story of the cyclist is different, and bears no relation to her interaction with them. No matter what our interaction with the person, their life is not influenced by us! You meet people in your life, whom you certainly have a lot of influence on. The watchman in the bank is set as a classic example. In the 1st run, he teases Lola initially, and later on he is shown as a person with a good heart, when he says everyone has a bad day. In the 3rd run, after Lola's stare, he suffers a cardiac arrest, and while in the ambulance, when the doctors try to restore his heartbeat, she gets in, and she could help it make normal. Lola's father is set as another example, as in each of the run, his interaction with her is different, and is influenced by what she does to him.Now, to the two main themes covered, first one, the importance of chaos and random events in daily life. One such example is what happens to Meier in the 3 runs. In the 1st run, because he turns and looks Lola, he is a bit slow, and his car is being hit by another car. In the 2nd run, he does not look at Lola, and the other car comes and hit his car. In the 3rd run, he sees the running person is Lola, and he asks her if anything is wrong. Because of that delay, no accident takes place at that point, however, later in the movie; there is another accident which turns out to be fatal for Meier. Another character who is shown affected by random event is the man who takes the bag from the train. In the 1st 2 runs, he takes the bag and goes away. In the 3rd run, he buys the cycle, but Manni meets him in his bicycle, confronts him and takes the bag back. There are many more events in the movie attributed to chaos, like Lola spotting the casino, Manni seeing the homeless man on cycle etc etc.Now, to what I think was the main message behind the movie. The movie deals about how we can control the chaos or randomness that happens in our life. It illustrates that if we have enough motivating factors (here, it is love), we can, at least up to an extent, control what is going to happen. There are scenes in the movie where Lola asks Manni if he really loves her, and Manni asks what she will do if he is dead. They both want to be with each other, and when they realize that, they change their approaches, and decide to change what happens to them. The 3rd run, which ends on a happy note, is after both of them are shown realizing that they love each other, and after they decide to control what happens to them.On a lighter note, you can even think that the movie talks about relations, when Lola is ready to do anything to save her boyfriend; her parents are involved in extramarital relations. Ideally, it is a movie, left to the viewer's interpretation like any other. Watch it and see it for yourself.",

However, 'Lola rennt' hits the turbo charger and moves into a category of its own by virtue of its un-relenting pace.I went into this film a jaded movie addict and came out feeling like a child who'd looked through a kaleidescope for the first time. My hat off to Mr. Tykwer, Franka Potente and co. for taking a risk and furthering the art-form, whilst still being highly entertaining and (I suspect) very commercially viable.Lola is a sensory delight, who's message of love and spiritual growth pulses throughout the film, in time with the urban electronic beat.\nTreat yourself.

But on his way to to the transaction, he leaves the money on the seat of a subway, which is picked up by a bum.Now Lola has twenty minutes to get the money to Manni, and by doing so, save his life.  This fast, funny, and thought-provoking film, goes through three possibilities of what could happen, each of which have her running through the streets of a town, and going to her father's office, where she can get the money.  The film explores the simplicity of the chaos affect, but does it much more smoothly than \"Sliding Doors.\"Throughout the movie, you see inserts of animation, raw video, and quick bits on what could happen in the lives of people that Lola runs into on the street (a series of snapshots that show different possibilities of their lives).In a lot of ways, this film reminded me of \"Go\" (which I also highly recommend), because while you're watching \"Run Lola Run,\" you feel like you're being invitingly pulled along into this fast, wild ride.One other thing I loved about this film is Lola's spirit.  it goes well with her bright red hair.  Her glass-shattering scream and her will to run and surpass any obstacle are refreshing.  It's great to see a woman character who's not there just to be a love interest, or just to be stabbed at.So kudos to Tom Tykwer for creating this wonderful film.Grade: A   or    9 out of 10",

The trouble is, he left the money on a train and a bum made off with it. If her boyfriend doesn't deliver the money, he will most likely be killed. That's when he calls Lola for help.That's when the fun starts. We get to see Lola run through the next 20 minutes 3 separate times. Each time is different because certain events cause Lola to make small changes in her approach. These minute details lead to huge differences in the way things end. It's the butterfly effect: A butterfly flaps its wings in China, and it rains in New York.The innovative use of stop frame action, animation, a techno-beat sound track, and suspense, make for a truly enjoyable film. We all root for Lola, egging her on, hoping her quest will be successful. This movie will not change the way you look at your life, but will certainly make you glad you took 81 minutes to see it.",

Lola, the main protagonist, is handed the task of making it across Berlin to meet her boyfriend in exactly twenty minutes.

Even though we see the actions of the movie from three different realities, the viewer still tends to anticipate what twists and turns each reality will present.  Tykwer does an excellent job re-interpreting the same situation while keeping the audience interested.  He does not waste time with extensive character development, as it not entirely necessary for the rather thin plot of the movie.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie... if for nothing else than the filming techniques and the soundtrack.

So is this actually a science fiction film, time travel, parallel universes? Is it a romance? A dream?I was especially struck by the moment when in the third sequence, Lola arrives at the intersection. And there is no one there.

I had read reviews that all gave the same general idea:  \"a great, undescribable movie, a low budget action movie.\"  Low budget action movie, the idea today is almost laughable, with every other movie coming out with a $100 million plus budget for special effects and big name actors.  \"Run Lola Run\" breaks this convention with (in the US at least) unknown actors, a virtually unknown director, and a tiny budget.The budget the producers had went a looooong way.  One of the most important aspects of this movie was the soundtrack.  Most (if not all) of the tracks were original, and the thumping techno keeps the time that is so important to this movie.  The soundtrack is 77 minutes long, which is impressive considering the movie is only 81 minutes long.  The incredible soundtrack fills out the rest of the movie, which has one of the most intruiging storylines ever. Imagine that every possible decision is made, all possibilities do come true in some alternate reality.  Minor incidents affect peoples lives and the entire outcome of the story.  The idea is simple but urgent: Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 Marks ($1 = 2 DM approx) to her boyfriend, or else he will be killed.  The next 20 minutes occur three times, each with a different outcome, each with minor changes in Lola's course and speed. Slight modifications have major effects on the outcome of the story. Interjected in each of the three scenarios are snapshots of the rest of people's lives; again, minor differences in course change the lives of people around her.

Okay, now she's having the same conversation again, but this time she trips over the dog on her way out the door.  Ah-ha!  It was at this point, somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes through the movie when I realize the genius playing out on the screen in front of me.  Having watched many science fiction programs and movies in my time I'm used to the whole `space-time what if?' clich\u00e9, but I've never seen the subject covered like this before.  Seeing how just one split second can affect events in such a major way really gets the mind thinking.

The acting was very good, although I have not seen these actors before in any other foreign films. My only disapointment was the subtitling that blending in with the white background, so words disappeared,a bit annoying. Other than that tiny tiny fact, the film is a must see!!",

            "content": "Run Lola Run, must first be said, is one of the top films released in 1999. A visually striking, idea-filled wonder, Run Lola Run is a pure burst of random energy, even more so than another underrated film, The Matrix. For roughly 80 minutes, writer/director/composer Tom Twyker delivers the action movie goods at a non-stop pace in as intelligent a manner in recent memory.Everything fits together here, in the story and the film. The acting is first rate. The thumping techno score keeps the film rollicking. And the photography, editing, and direction are breathless. The film opens with a bravura shot of people in a crowd, as we briskly hear each of them spew out a philosophical remark on the nature of time before moving to another. This scene recalls Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire, and proves itself an incredibly effective way to open the movie. Twyker wants his audience to know exactly what they're dealing with, while keeping them desperately wanting more. He succeeds.The plot quickly unravels within the film's first few minutes. Manni, a German punk, is in quite a bit of trouble, owing some mobsters 100,000 marks in 20 minutes (mocking the generic 20- minutes-to-live plot staple) after preceding to board the subway (a la Sliding Doors), and in a bit of frenzy, leaving the cash behind. The only one he can turn to is his girlfriend Lola (who is partially to blame). She must think fast and race against the clock to save her boyfriend's skin. Don't worry, I haven't given away the whole plot, this is merely the set-up. What can Lola do? Where can she turn?From this point, Run Lola Run takes a turn into the fantastic. Director Twyker gives us a plot twist right out of the aforementioned Sliding Doors, Rashomon, or even Groundhog Day. We see the situation of Lola desperately running to save her boyfriend's life play out three different ways until it finally succeeds. Failure in the first two situations add another intriguing concept (one which I will not reveal), that recalls the premise of the 1999 film After Life. These scenes wonderfully illustrate the film's powerful message: love is stronger than death.The film never loses its speed, refusing to never drop below a blur for more than 3 minutes. One of the best aspects Run Lola Run has going for it is its sense of humor. There are little touches of it sprinkled throughout, including numerous recurring sight gags and that priceless last line. Also included are amazing wit, irony, symbolism, and paradox, that push the film into the category of those that demand multiple viewings. This is original filmmaking, that at several points, switches to animation. Don't blink, because there are fantastic themes and ideas explored here. Take for example the question, how might one little random happening in your day affect your destiny? The movie explores this, thrice over.What is time? What controls our destiny? The answers to these questions may never be uncovered, but at least Run Lola Run tries to help us on our way. Breaking the film down proves it to be a symmetrical, thought-provoking, hilarious foreign film masterpiece. Some call this nothing more than an MTV music video, with its quick cuts and zooming camera. I reply to those people, \"When was the last time an MTV music video explored the very roots of human existence?\"This is the second best foreign film of 1999, right behind Pedro Almodovar's classic All About My Mother. Tom Twyker has established himself as one of the top non-American directors (and writers and composers) out there today. Run Lola Run needs to be seen just as much as foreign cinema (well most of it, anyway) needs to be treasured. In fact, see it three times. It may just turn out differently each time.",

The story and storytelling technique make you shake your head in disbelief over and over.Franka Potente portrays Lola with power, sexiness and sheer strength of will. What a protagonist! With each act the viewer is pulled deeper and deeper into what makes her keep on running.I love this film. I look forward to seeing what comes next from Tom Twyker... And moreso, I look forward to the new direction this will take me in my own career as a filmmaker.Oh yes, let me not forget the soundtrack. Less overt than Trainspotting, but with possibly MORE energy. Solid beat driven techno... but when its broken for the first time with a jazzy, soul-y interlude at the end of the first act I could not for the life of me remember a more perfectly scored moment of film.

            "content": "I saw this movie as an exploration of our will, intuition, and how our thoughts and actions affect the karma of ourselves and those around us.Warning: minor \"spoiling\" statements follow, but nothing about the overall plot surprises.Lola is permitted to \"try\" a slice of her life 3 times.  She (and some of the others around her) seem to be aware, on some almost subconscious level, of the previous experiences.  I was strongly reminded of intuition during these moments - a feeling that there is a right action and a wrong action, and you KNOW which is which.  You KNOW what the outcome will be.  The question is, will you choose correctly?In Try 3, the bank guard knows what Lola is thinking, and he seems confused that he knows.  And Lola makes a conscious decision, relying on what she now knows is the better choice.  This idea of making a better choice based on intuition, no matter how small, repeats throughout the movie.I really love when she decides just to let go and not try to solve the problem all on her own.  She prays, while running - what a great metaphor for not giving up, but still asking for help from a universal power!  How that prayer is answered is startlingly random, but no more so than the myriad of other \"coincidences\" that sweep through our lives.All this trippy stuff, plus the movie just plain rocks!

The brightly decorated screen of Tom Tykwer's mind tells the tale of a couple involved in a struggle against time to reclaim both money and each other.The title suggests a neverending struggle for our \"hero-in-mind\" Lola, whose physical and mental endurance reigns supreme when compared to her boyfriend, Manny.  Just when Manny feels that hope has left his side because of his clumsy and impatient nature, the camera moves to Lola, giving us a new sense of hope (and color) to each of the three tales this movie has to offer.One of the nicer and calm moments takes us to this whispering couple, in bed, making us think about which one of these documentaries we are to believe happened.  Was Lola's father a cheating, daughter-denying miscreant or a cowering, daughter-fearing bank owner?  Was Manny capable of switching roles with Lola to ultimately save himself in the end?  And would the ambulance-driver ever see those people stepping out in front of his automobile and stop for them???  We are left to decide, which is the beautiful, more creative part.  And it's all done in such stunning color and quicker-than-quick cinematography.  An all-out joy to watch to say the least.",

If you enjoy going to the movies like I do, then you may be as bored as I am with the usual fare at the cineplex.  It is this sort of movie that gives me hope for future movies.  This was excellent, exciting and different.  I hate when you know the entire plot after seeing the trailer or commercial for the first time.  Lola was a thrill because it was unusual. The main reason this was a movie to see is because of the way it is told - which I will not give away.  Also, I really cared what would happen to Lola and her boyfriend.  They are not at all like me, but I could relate to them in some ways (relationship woes and family issues - who doesn't know about that?).  I didn't feel the need to walk away from the movie saying, she could be my friend.  She was relatable, but she wasn't forced on the viewer. She was also a refreshing (how over used) lead female character, but she did not lead as a symbol or as an icon.  She was just the lead, without any fanfare.  Another relief was that the movie was only about 90 minutes long, although, it was so good, I wished that it'd been longer.  However, I'm tired of egotistical movie makers who create these epic-length movies that could be told not just as well, but even better, in less then 3 hours. Lola was not just a movie, it should be sent out to all studios and their employees as a reminder to break out of the formulas they keep using and start coming up with some original ideas.",

It does, however, manage to sneak in plenty of angst, including father-daughter angst, boyfriend-girlfriend angst, and various other angsty bits that only serve the purpose of being looked at from three different angles and giving lola a chance to utter a scream that probably caused somebody's head to explode, somewhere. There doesn't seem to be a unifying message at the end of this film, but it is a well-presented ride to the end.  Here's what the movie is really about:  fast cuts, your obligatory matrix-style spin-around, some brilliant bits involving flash-forwards in time using polaroid photographs, some odd animation sequences, and an overall effort to disorient and bombard the viewer with different images.

The reviewer seemed to think the movie was  nothing more than a fast-paced escapist action film.  What seemed to be ignored, however, is the film's greatest quality: it makes you think.  Of course, with the lack of such films being produced by the major American studios, I guess it should be no surprise that some may no longer use that as a criterion when judging a movie.  What makes Lola Rennt a true diamond in an industry overflowing with cubic zirconia is that it makes you think about just how much every little thing you do affects everything not only in your life but also in the lives of others to proportions you could never imagine.  This movie rises above the escapist trend that has beset the movie industry in a way few do, perhaps in part due to its not coming from Hollywood.  If you dislike thinking, this might not be the movie for you. Otherwise, I'd rate it as a must see.  5 out of 5 stars, two thumbs up, and so on.",

Well after watching it first in English, then in German (with subtitles), and then again with the commentary track on (DVD) all on the same evening I knew that I had to add this movie to my collection.Run Lola Run is now in my top 10 of all time along with 2001, The Wizard of Oz, Fargo, Blade Runner, American Beauty, The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Moulin Rouge, and Silence of the Lambs. Out of these, Run Lola Run has been played more times than all of the others, even though I've owned it for less than a month.A movie is really nothing more than images, sounds and a story, but it seems that every aspect of this film has been so well thought out and executed that I can't imagine anything that could be done to improve it. The camera movement and soundtrack suit the action perfectly. The way that the score fits in with the editing points is superb.The DVD version is excellent in picture and sound quality....Sony Pictures Classics knew that they had a gem in this movie and gave it a beautiful translation to DVD. If only the English dub was a bit better...there's so much happening on-screen that it is distracting to read the subtitles. I've actually learned quite a few German words by listening to the German audio track with subtitles!The performances are great - The final scene in the movie is excellent - notice Lola's subtle facial expressions as Manni walks towards her.... what is she thinking? Maybe a sequel will tell us.Run Lola Run is a rare movie that combines action, suspense, black comedy, music and is also thought-provoking....(What if I had done this differently?) Everyone should give this movie a chance. Almost all (including foreign film haters) who've watched it could not take their eyes off the screen until the end credits....a masterpiece.",

If so, how would you approach the dilemma the second time?  Lola does this, she bends time and space for the man she loves.  Make sure you read the quoted text preceding the opening shot.

It's interesting to note that through Lola's initial animated reaction to the boy and dog on the stairs is actually what creates all the differences in the movie. A few of my friends didn't like the movie because they didn't understand why the sequence was repeated 2 times. I thought the director did a good job of making clear the, somewhat tired theme of \"love transcends all bounds\" (call me jaded) by showing that the sheer will of the two main characters is what makes them repeat the past 20 minutes. It's simply a way of saying, \"No, I WON'T let it end like this.' The acting was great and the visuals though not flashy special effects were wonderful. Overall I give this film an 8/10.(You may want to avoid the english dubbed version as it makes the original english dubbed Godzilla appear a masterpiece of audio editing.)",

This is an excellent movie with cool camera angles and contains some very innovative ideas. The movie reminded me of the famous rocky scene where rocky if going for his run \u0096 the movie is basically an extension of that, but with lots more colour and a plot. Lola Run is a very fast, technical movie about a girl, Lola, who gets a phone call from her boyfriend (Mannie) in this phone call, her life will change for the better or for the worse. He was required to deliver 100 000 marks in cash for a mob and in doing so, clumsily leaves the bag of money on the train. He is unable to recover the money and if he doesn't deliver the money in twenty minutes he is most likely to be killed. His only chance in getting 100 000 marks is through Lola (who's dad owns a bank) or by robbing the store across the road. Frightened Mannie says to Lola that if she doesn't come with 100 000 marks in twenty minutes he will rob the store. After the phone call, Lola begins to run... looking for solutions. I realise I have already made the point, and I will make it again\u0085The movie's Fast. Very Fast. It contains rapid jump cutting and speedy pan shots everything is fast in Run Lola Run. The techno sound track also gives the film a fast pace. The sound track reminds you of your heart thumping very fast when in a desperate situation. The music is playing constantly giving the film a backbone and giving the film a rather powerful sort of drive. Even though some scenes are quiet and contain almost no music at all, they still seem fast, because of the effective editing and because of the length of the scenes. When there is no music, the German dialogue takes over and basically substitutes for it. The audience is not given a big insight to the characters lives \u0096 not a great deal of dialogue is incorporated throughout the film. We are given a very shallow insight which leaves the audience asking a few questions about their lives. Much of the film is Lola running and trying to save her boyfriend from death. I believe Twyker was attempting to illustrate the sense of rush, tension and the desperate feeling in Lola. When those situations occur in the real world when life is on the line, not much thought goes into anything but trying to help out as much as possible. The use of real time is incorporated very well \u0096 it gives the film a realistic sense in some parts, yet creates drama and suspense in others. It's always seemed to me that real time in a film slows the pace of the film right down but not in this one \u0096 real time is used effectively. There was the occasional metaphor but they were rather difficult to comprehend \u0096 even after multiple viewings. The domino effect is an obvious one \u0096 every action has an opposite repelling reaction which can escalate. The turtle and the dolls were rather mysterious metaphors and I couldn't really work anything out\u0085maybe Twyker needed to fill up some extra time in his shot! Time is a major theme in the film \u0096 constant references to time are made visually as well such as split shots of clocks and Lola running, sounds of ticking clocks. These references along with the storyline say that time can be so critical and important especially when there's a time limit to something \u0096 like someone's life. Time can also be wasted and can go very quickly and when it does, you seem like you have missed a lot. Twyker also makes it clear that he believes that we only have control of our lives to a certain extent. Beyond the extent comes totally unpredictable events that none of us plan for. The reason for this is that any action we do, can result in a bigger action which can result in a huge event which can have a dramatic impact on not only our lives, but others too. Lola being the slightest bit late results in a huge impact to her boyfriend, and further more, it bac fires on her. If the homeless man buys a bicycle, everything turns out fine and everyone lives happily ever after. If Lola trips down the stairs, she becomes a little more late and her boyfriend ends up robbing a store \u0096 and in the long run she's the looser. A sort of underlying theme that I seemed to come up with was chance/luck. There were quite a few instances in the film where things happened just by pure luck (in the casino, the ambulance with the glass, Lola almost being run over etc.) this theme underlies the theme of fate, but it still has an importance. Twyker has a very good point, and the way he illustrated it is quite original compared to film conventions and traditional techniques editing.The cinematography is one-of-a-kind. It has obviously been thought about with high detail. The form of the shots, as well as the composition are really great. The way the editing was used with the pictures was quite original as well. One point I did pick up when watching the movie for the third time was that 99 percent of shots that contain Lola in a frantic situation not only contain her vibrant red hair, but also contain another red object either in the distance or the foreground: such as a man on a red bike with a red shirt, a red ambulance, a red sign or a red phone. After a great deal of pondering, I came to the conclusion that all of these red objects along with the red tinted scenes symbolise life out of control \u0096 resulting in death. The aspect of the film, which I was most curious about was the fact that Twyker manipulated the audience to sympathise with the \u0091bad guys' rather that \u0091the good guys' I say this because typically in a film the audience is on the side of the coppers or the FBI or whatever but in this film, the people going against the law are the characters that the audience is made to sympathise with. Twyker does this in a very clever manner. Even though we are not given a huge depth into Mannie and Lola relationship, we still sympathise with them on a personal level because Mannie's life is on the line and both Lola and Mannie show a reasonable amount of emotions. I found myself sympathising for the \u0091baddies' because I knew that they would succeed with what ever they do because they are the characters being followed, and because that there was a surreal element to the film and that by using surrealism, the characters would get out of any trouble because the film wouldn't be full on realistic. The film has a surrealistic element because of Lola's famous screams (in her fathers office and in the casino) and the luck and chance in the casino. I'm not sure if this was intended, but when the ambulance is meant to crash through the glass on the road, after watching the film many times, I notices that the glass actually shattered before the ambulance made contact. Maybe they had some kind of explosion to shatter the glass before hand so that no extra damage was done. OK. The film was great the first time but as I watched it for the second and third time, it kinda lost it's effect. I highly recommend it for a someone who likes an full on action pact film but not if you're the type who prefers the slower sorts of movies. It doesn't require a great deal of thinking to grasp the concept, it's relatively straight forward. I wouldn't recommend however if you were planning on watching it many times where as I said before \u0096 it looses it's effect. Great movie. Technically stunning and uses great innovative ideas. Contained a few themes but is was not overall a deep, meaningful film. You'll wither really like it or absolutely hate it. I will be curious to see what Twyker's next film will be.Five out of five.",

It is the philosophy of the film, how every insignificant difference in reality will have huge outcomes, given sufficient time. This is known as the 'Butterfly Effect' or Chaos Theory. The film debates fate vs. free will but is inconclusive on either - if Lola's actions are fated, why three different outcomes? If she has a free will, how come events outside her control or even knowledge dictates the outcome of her actions? This is the true genius of this movie and it is told in a clear and concise way, leaving you dazzled and thoughtful. The style may age but the message is timeless. It makes my top list, but I can't give you a ranking because such films are incommensurable.

            "content": "Run Lola Run is one of those movies that you have to see twice.  After the first viewing, you're sure to have missed something- and after the second viewing,the structure and themes of the film becomes clear. Time presents us with the clearest example of theme, but more subtly though just as obvious is the theme of fate.  Fate plays a major role by showing outcomes of the way Lola times her actions at the beginning of each 20-minute sequence.  The plot's setup before the furious 20-minute chase is well crafted; by explaining the exact situation Manni has presented to Lola, many variables present themselves as possibleoutcomes that keep the audience guessing what may happen next.  And witheach 20-minute segment, more is revealed to the audience in terms of patterns and plot.Patterns rule this movie, and with these patterns reveal an extremely structured story- a sort of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure storybook of modern cinema.Unlike the 80's storybook gimmick, Tom Tykwer (Director) presents us with three outcomes that by definition comes with three endings; those jaded enough can't say that the story has a fairytale ending since the other two are equally as fatal. Though patterns show the audience what to expect as Lola bounces down theapartment stairs to her running into or avoiding the baby-strolling mother as she makes her way to her father's bank.  But it is the little things that affect Lola's fate in the film.  For example, the way Lola runs down the stairs each or the three times is different, and by this affects the timing in the film's diegetic world and Lola's ability to catch her father on his way to his appointment with Mr. Meyer. These events of repetition are important because they show the audience thatever little thing Lola does effects the outcome after the phone drops and the race begins- everything up to this point is not time (or fate) crucial. For instance, the second 20-minute sequence shows Lola being tripped as she bouncesdown the stairs and therefore affecting the time Lola has by limping- she later jumps on the hood of Mr. Meyers car (rather then running in front of) which he then proceeds to hit the side rather than the front corner of the white car either way delaying the appointment Lola's father has with Mr. Meyer.\nThe patterns reveal more about the characters and the plot development aseach 20-minute segment comes to close.  An example of this can be seen within the interaction between Lola's father and her mistress.  The first episode reveals the relationship between him and his mistress- and his reaction to being a father to a child he yet to discover is not his until the second segment.  He is willing to give up the life he leads and deems unsatisfactory for a life with a woman Lola herself does not suspect as a mistress when he assumes he is the father of her mistresses unborn child but his reaction changes when asked to leave his life for a child he knows is not his.  This pattern is repeated in the first twosequences at roughly the same time- interestingly enough- when neither of the two main characters is present.  His reaction to each situation directly affects his mood and indirectly affects reaction he has when Lola comes to him for the100,000 marks. Each of these reactions is integral to the story and plot as they indirectly affect the main conflict of the money.The ending of each sequence reveals new things about both Manni and Lola.The impending death of each character at the end of each segment shows onefateful day (or night) while they are lying in bed discussing the future and the outcome of what may happen if they were ever separated- this reinforces thetrue and very real love that these characters have for each other- and further more structures the film in a way that after the second sequences, there is a general feeling that, well this time, Lola and Manni have to get it right. Right? They both cannot die like this?  Just like a lucky number: third time's a charm.It is only with tight organization would this film work- and it does.  The careful attention to detail that is given to the interaction between scenes reward the viewer since nearly all the elements of each variable is evident in everyepisode.  For example, the fate of each person Lola has direct contact with is visualized in series of snapshots that lead to an ultimate conclusion for each supporting character- a microcosm of the movie itself and further emphasis on fate as the theme of this film.  This highly stylized production of snapshots is effective because they show the extremity of each supporting character fate and in my opinion the relationship of how things are and how they should be.The first two episodes presents a rather fatalistic and even pessimistic view of a cause and effect outcome- the way things are.  And just about everyone canrelate to this when one says to himself, `.if only I would have done/said/made that instead.'   In a strange way, I think this movie is quite a fantasy in the realm of far-fetched films such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy simply becauseeveryone knows you can't change time, and there is only one outcome for every event; it is fantasy because we all wonder, `what could have been.'   The way things should be is a different story altogether.  The film raises deeper questions like, Is there such thing as fate altogether?  Are we really in control of our own lives?  Or is life just a series or random events and along the way do we really affect the lives of others the way that we think we will them to do so. But in the end isn't it always the same question and the same answer?  The ball is round, the game lasts 90 minutes. That is a fact. Everything else is pure theory.",

Run Lola Run is a fast paced, race against the clock action movie that genuinely out-runs most films I have seen lately. The movie begins when Lola's unimpressive boyfriend calls her in distress, saying that he has lost a bag of money that contained 100,000 deutschemarks, which had to be delivered to his crime boss. He pleads to Lola, asking her to somehow come up with the money. Here is the catch, she only has 20 minutes to find it or Manni is going to be dead man. The race begins. Lola ventures out on a frantic run all around Berlin in search of this large sum, her striking red hair resembling fire as she races through the streets. The end of the film comes running in a flash and you may glance over your watch and see only 30 minutes have gone by! It can't be over yet! Well its not. Tykwer then takes us for another run of the same scene though this time altering a few of Lola's movements to how it can change the overall outcome. So Tykwer poses the 'What if?' question into the movie. And so the marathon starts again with Lola off the blocks in a flash. But How many times will it repeat, you'll have to watch and find out!Although the actors only have a short amount of time to deliver the lines, they all do a fantastic job. Franka Potente creates a very believable character in Lola and stands out in every scene that she is in. Her heated confrontations with her father or her loud deafening scream are fascinating and she runs away with the best acting in the film. As for Moritz Bleibtreu, (Manni) he gives a solid performance with the time he has. He makes me feel sorry for him throughout the film and the chemistry between the two, although it may seem a bit awkward, is convincing.The greatest strength of the film would undoubtedly be its fast paced action. Tykwer produces a non-stop action movie without the use of any Computer-generated imagery to enhance the scenes or any studio sets; he uses actual locations in Berlin. This sets it apart from other action movies like the Transformers series that relies on pure fake and repetitive action to make it appeal to its audiences. Run Lola Run, is an adrenaline rush that keeps you on the edge of your set without boring you, even though it goes through the same sequence three times. Because each gives you a different consequence and many thrills so that it keeps you excited all the way through. Music is another high point in this movie, although it does not have a great orchestra, it uses fast techno music that incorporates some the movie's motifs. Motifs such as: Rhythm, (Lola's running rhythm), Repetition, (the repetition of the same scene) and Intervals, (the small scenes Tykwer places in between the runs). The most intriguing part of this film is the unpredictability of what could happen next. With each new run, they offer new possibilities on how they are going end and makes you juggle different possible ending for each part. And if you are wrong, you get another chance The one and only downfall in this film would be its basic plot, if you could even call it a plot, more like a hiccup. And also gets repeated three times! Although may seem lazy, I would think this is what Tykwer would have been aiming for. Because he does not really expand on any of his characters but concentrates more on how our and other people's actions can influence our future. So if you are in to long complicated plots and developed characters I would not recommend this to you. But if you are into guns, nuns, bums and lots of run-ning, I would suggest you check this out. Overall Run Lola Run is a fantastic innovative movie that catches your imagination and runs away with it.",

            "content": "The film entitled 'Run Lola Run' is anything but boring. From film structure to choice in actors, this film draws you in like a good book and makes you think. It is one that sucks you in from the beginning and keeps your attention until it is finished. 'Run Lola Run' is structured in such a way that I have never seen a film structured before. The same problem is solved in 3 different manners throughout the film and while the major events occur, other smaller incidents are affected by the change of solution to the initial problem. As the 3 different versions of how to solve the problem in the film are presented, the audience is almost being shown growth and progression in the main character; Lola. The dialogue, with the help of subtitles was easy to understand and the intermission scenes in the film where Lola and Mannie are actually presented as humans in love are scenes that help to keep your attention and to help keep things from going stale in the film. There was a moderate amount of cursing in the film and no nudity that I can remember. I felt like this film had just the right amount of action, love, and comedy in the way it was presented. All in all a great movie to watch.",

Something about the idea of watching a foreign film seemed to put me off but i've recently watched: Dead Snow, Run Lola Run & Amelie and all of these films were enjoyable and stylish. There seems to be a definite outlandish style when it comes to foreign films which makes me respect the directors and their vision.Enjoyed the idea of being able to restart life as if it was a video game and even though at times it got tedious it was still a brilliant concept, and because of this you can get over the tedious repetitiveness of the film.Overall brilliant enjoyed it, the storyline wasn't completely water tight but it is a good piece of escapism action",

            "content": "The Plot of the story is centered around Lola as a direct result of the actions of Manni losing the bag of money on the train. A homeless man on the train with Manni ends up discovering the bag full of money after Manni leaves the train as two security guards approached. Manni was to late to react to leaving behind the money and was stopped by the security guards as the train began to pull away setting in motion the groundwork for the plot. In the third take both Lola and Manni attempt to garner the hundred thousand dollars needed to save Manni's life in twenty minutes and each others action has a significant importance in the outcome of the third take. When Lola passes the bike rider, the rider ends up stopping at a small food stand where the homeless man is spending money on drinks he could not be able to afford and the bike rider ends up selling the homeless man the stolen bike. This leads to Manni discovering the homeless man on the bike as he is riding down the street and begins to chase him when he realizes that he has the bag of money. After a long chase the homeless man stops when Manni pulls his gun on the man and wants his money back. But when the homeless man asks Manni to at least give him the gun in return for the bag, Manni does cautiously so as to not get shot himself, but the homeless man is already planning on replacing the money he just lost by robbing a bank. That bank turns out to be Lola's father's bank where the security guard shown interacting with Lola in the previous two parts is shot in the bank robbery. Lola discovers the security guard when she gets in the back of the stopped ambulance on her way to Manni. She discovers that the shot security guard is her real father when she holds his hand and his pulse begins to calm down and return to normal as they meet eye to eye. This is a movie and not real life as shown by the director in numerous ways throughout the film but it does not mean that parts of the film do not resemble life. This is a film based on what ifs and the little things of daily life most do not pay significant attention to and the outcomes that result from them. I enjoyed the movie and got involved in the action but felt the film could have done more to tell about Lola and her background growing up as well as Manni and his involvement with Lola and criminal activity.",

            "content": "Lola Rennt (a.k.a. 'Run Lola Run') is a fast paced drama which can, at times, be slightly tedious. This is mainly due to the fact that time repeats itself several times in the movie. The story is essentially about Lola (played by Franka Potente) having to find 120,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni (played by Moritz Bleibtreu) to save his life from a group of gangsters. Lola finds herself running all over the city looking for ways to obtain this cash. Without giving too much away about the story, Lola makes critical errors when deciding how to obtain this money, and thus time repeats itself several times throughout the course of the movie. There are changes that occur in each timeframe which can make the movie seem tedious and drawn-out. However, the changes that occur in each timeframe are quite cleverly weaved into the storyline. Whenever Lola crosses paths with a person, a 3-5 second flash-forward of the person's life occurs. In each timeframe this flash-forward is dramatically altered, depending on what Lola has done prior to the encounter. After you see these changes, it will leave you wondering, 'what did Lola do so differently this time to bring on such a dramatic change?'. It seems that everybody she runs into eventually find themselves in some form of trouble, which scores entertainment points while losing some realism value. There are many people that cross Lola's path, and each sub-story is written well into the script. The music is excellent in giving you a sense of urgency about Lola's quest. The predominantly techno soundtrack provides a stark contrast between Lola running, and the tense scene between Lola's father and his 'patient'; the movie seems to come to a griding halt at this point. The visuals are nothing short of stunning, with many impressive shots. For example, there is a shot that starts high up in the sky and ends in Lola's face without cutting once, which is quite stunning. At times, it seems that director Tom Tykwer has tried almost too hard to make the visuals unique and complicated. Aside from this minor flaw, his directing was on-par with what you would expect to see from any Hollywood film.",

            "content": "I'm not sure if the 5/10 reviewer watched the film with any attention to the themes - apparently not.This is an impressively thought provoking movie, dealing with themes such as time, love, chance, the butterfly effect, fortunes, and most importantly.. life itself and the way we choose to live it. Oh, and morality. Look out for the many ways that the outcomes of character actions defy and contradict 'morality'.The fast-paced camera action, multiple angles and recurring motifs of time as realities shift and slide between one another are an integral part of the movie -  the film shows three possible endings to the same sequence of events, and the impact that tiny alterations that seem so arbitrary have on the lives of the characters.This is a clashing of worlds. The power of love. A middle finger to convention. A movie that will stimulate every neural groove and lift you out of your sleepy apathy toward the way you live your life. It's a movie that will do more than move you.. it will shake you up and it will also make you smile when it's done with making you wince.The music is funky and always on the pulse of the storyline. And the overall effect of this film on your psyche can only be positive: carpe diem!",

            "content": "My name is Haley Madison and I am a student at Sinclair Community College in Dayton Ohio who is currently attending a film appreciation class. One of the movies we watched and studied was this film Run Lola Run, and it has become one of my favorite movies outside of class. This movie envelops the idea that someone's fate can be ultimately changed by one little detail, and one's life could very well depend on those minor details. The story line is very unconventional and although the story is told three different times, it's the little details that change the entire plot of each event. After watching the same movie dubbed in English it is clear that the German language was best for this movie and added to the suspense and urgency through the movie. The use of cartoon animation also added to this movie's deep continuity and unconventional narrative structure. I would consider this movie to be a love story, however it is about much more than two people deciding if they love one another. Family dynamics are always complicated whether in real life or in movies and part of this movie is learning the broken dynamics of a young girl's family while she is trying to save the one person that is there for her throughout all the chaos. She learns that she is not her father's daughter and that he is leaving her family to start a new one, and this resonates with the audience because you can see Lola's pain through her angst and hot-headed mindset. The audience also learns the dynamics of Lola and Manni's love story. There are a couple of scenes, shrouded in red lighting to depict a very vulnerable and lustful situation, where Manni and Lola are discussing their love for each other. After learning that Lola might not know if she loves Manni or not drew me in as an observer and made me reflect on my own past relationships. Both Lola and Manni die in this film, each in a different scenario that ended differently than what Lola had planned, and in both deaths I could really see and understand that they loved each other. In the first storyline I was not prepared to see Lola die and was shocked by the outcome. I was relieved when the movie continued with her trying again to save Manni from his situation. In the and Manni and Lola live happily ever after and safe from debt, and with a bonus bag of money that Lola had won from her first, and very loud, experience with gambling. I find that I can really relate to Lola as a character and to this movie as a form of entertainment and art. To me, Lola glorified the idea of being angst-ridden, fighting for what you want and not taking no for an answer. Manni is a typical male who gets in over his head and asks for a woman's help, that Lola very quickly embarked to do. This movie doesn't give the audience time to breathe or relax and constantly kept me on the edge of my seat, hoping that Lola could save Manni and that they could walk away from the situation together. There were times during the movie I thought that the happy ending wouldn't happen. These elements make this a great movie and a movie that is hard to ignore and the use of the German language requires the audience to pay better attention to the movie which helps engulf them into the very fast passed story.",

            "content": "I watched this film without any prior knowledge of what it was about. I only knew a little bit from the synopsis on the back of the DVD case, and I must say that this is one cool movie. Cool is a very vague way to review a movie so let me elaborate a bit.The movie's plot is just so so. You really don't get to know much of anything about the characters, and the movie is fairly short anyways(around 80 mins.). The summary of the plot is Lola's boyfriend Manni was supposed to transport 100,000 Marks to a local gangster(Ronnie), but he loses the money. So as a last chance, he calls Lola and informs her that in twenty minutes he needs the 100,000 or he's a goner. Thus begins the roller-coaster ride. If you liked how that sounded, then by all means you should check this movie out! Now What you DO get though is a techno score through out the whole film(most of it anyways) that keeps the movie zipping along at a quick pace. I kept on noticing how the movement on the film would quite often synch up with the music score which was very nice. I've never been a fan of techno, but it really fit this movie well and, in my opinion, is a major contributing factor that makes this movie so \"cool\". The camera work is also excellently done. Lots of different camera angles that you usually don't see in films. All in all, if you're running short on movies to watch, or just want to see something different then by all means check this out!",
