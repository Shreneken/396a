            "content": "I finally gave into my curiosity and rented \"Wing Commander\" last night... and I found myself kinda... you know... liking it.It is NOT great cinema or great science fiction -- everyone likes to climb all over this movie for scientific errors and not being close enough to the Wing Commander games.  Well, scientific inaccuracies don't bug me (I'm an English major!), and I never played the Wing Commander game.  Maybe that's the secret to enjoying this movie -- if you take it completely on its (meager) merits, it's not all that bad.  It's nowhere near as good as classics like \"Star Wars\" or even somewhat similar films like \"The Last Starfighter\" or \"Starship Troopers,\" but it entertained me.  I dunno, sometimes you don't need your horizons challenged, you just want to sit back and watch aliens get blow'd up real good, you know?I consider this a guilty pleasure.",

            "content": "Well, I've seen it twice now.  I'm sure that says something.  The one thing that I told myself as I went into the theater was \"This isn't the game\". Too many people were expecting Mark Hammil, or Biff from Back to the Future, and were miffed that the movie didn't include them, or anyone that looked like them.  So far, I haven't heard anyone say complain that Val Kilmer or George Clooney didn't LOOK like Michael Keaton; the portrayal of their character is a different story...I'll admit, the movie had a cookie-cutter plot.  Young guy doesn't realize his potential, young guy is mocked, best friend stands up for him, young guy saves the day.  That, and the standard \"Have someone how loves and loses, and someone who falls in love at the end.\"  But, then again, how many movies have been made that have a cookie cutter plot?I was quite impressed with the acting.  I'll admit, I haven't been a big fan of the teen slasher movies, so this was my first experience at seeing a lot of these guys.  The young Blair was portrayed exactly as I would have expected, not too sure of himself, too willing to scurry into a corner rather than face confrontation.  Maniac was great; much better than the poor portrayal in the last 3 iterations of the video game.  I mean, let's face it, Maniac's character was completely re-done in WC3, to make him exactly like Biff.  And Paladin was excellent.  Not anything like the Paladin of the games (it took a while to get used to a non-scottish Paladin), but a very good, dark, but fatherly figure.The effects were incredible, especially when you consider the (relatively) meager budget the film was done on.  Yeah, the NavCom looked like a car battery, and the Kilrathi were lacking.  Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if the original intent was to NOT show the Kilrathi at all; someone decided this would be too artistic of a move, and created some cheesy looking aliens at the last minute.My favorite aspect of the movie, though, was how it abandons the standard \"Everything is bright and pretty and technological in Sci-Fi\".  The ships were beat on.  The cruisers looked like they had to be held together with bailing wire.  The bridges of the vessels were dark, cramped, and simple. The ships shot bullets, rather giving us bright and technical laser beams. Also, humanity wasn't portrayed as being perfect; there were factions, and racism, and everything else that we experience on earth today.I'm just waiting for the DVD...",

And for devotees of the games it kinda screws with history, but for all that it is a good ride. You watch it and appreciate it. Saffron Burrows is great. David Warner and David Suchet excel in their (small) roles. It's a shame John Rhys-Davis and Mark Hamill don't reprise their roles, but their replacements do well enough.You get caught up in the story, and the visual effects are fantastic, aided by good acting with the actors working well together.So overall I would recommend this film. Don't expect it to be fantastic, but just enjoy it. It's a fun film and a worthy addition to Wing Commander lore.",

            "content": "I was intrigued, after hearing many different points of views on this movie, to go see it. So I go to this used tape store, (why rent it for $5 when you can buy it for $2?) and buy it. I just wanted to see which side I agreed with. Most people that stated their opinions, said that this movie was a waste of time. Other people said it was the best movie they've ever seen, but I'm guessing they were fans of the video game or the 1977 version of this movie, both of which I've never seen. To go straight to the point and make it easy for those who don't know whether to see it or not, I'll let you decide for yourself based on my opinion. So to make it simple I'll just say the good and bad stuff about it.Bad Stuff:~Freddie Prinze Jr. sucks at acting. There's no other way to put it. I got very bored watching his one expression and monotone voice.~Right from the beginning, I thought the music was terrible. Music is supposed to drag you in from the beginning and give you a sense of what's coming, (think \"Jaws.\") This just made me feel like I was about to see Captain America.~The alien make-up was so extremely ridiculous that they looked like overgrown house pets. Not scary at all. ~I got tired of hearing people state the obvious. \"Hey! I think something's wrong!\" Well, aren't you the sharp one. The exploding bombs and loud \"red alert\" beeping didn't give it away, did it?~The story had it's boring moments. There were parts I didn't follow and soon didn't even care, because I had gotten so lost by then it didn't matter.~*This may or may not be a downside* I wasn't sure if the accents in this movie were taken from the video game or original, but it was way too weird. We had a Scottish guy, a ton of Englishmen, Americans, and some Asians. How did they all get on this one ship?Good Stuff:~Matthew Lillard did a fabulous job. I'm so used to seeing him act like an a**hole, (no offense, think \"Scream.\") that I wasn't expecting the serious performance he gave. It blew me away how serious he had to be in some scenes, and he pulled it off beautifully. (Although I gave the movie 5 stars, I would like to give his performance a 10.)~The plotline, although confusing, did have it's certain interesting moments. I don't know which came first, Starship Troopers or this, but I have a feeling one of them is a rip-off of the first. However, it certainly had it's moments that put you in suspense.~The special effect were great. It reminded me a lot of Star Wars. And the battle scenes were exciting.~The rest of the cast didn't do too bad a job of acting. I was able to feel sorry for most of them.I gave this movie a 5. If you have nothing better to do, I suggest you watch it. I certainly have seen worse, (read my review of \"Jeepers Creepers.\") If you liked \"Starship Troopers\" this is a movie for you. However, if you want something more out of a Sci-Fi movie of this sort, I suggest \"Pitch Black.\" *****/10",

            "review_title": "Strictly By-The-Numbers Space Opera/Coming of Age Potboiler",
            "content": "It's easy to forget the fact that \"Wing Commander\" is a decent film with professional level acting, writing and production values -even if this is strictly by-the-numbers hackwork - until you see a really dumb movie in the Sci Fi Space Opera genre such as \"Fatal Conflict\",\"Star Crash\" or \"Message From Space\". Compared to Grade D efforts like those turkeys, \"Wing Commander\" is at least smooth and easy to take and offers enough eye candy for the fan boy who can't get enough of his space fighters, laser beams and alien races. But in comparison to the Big Boys of the genre (\"Star Wars\", the \"Star Trek\" franchise) or even under-sung classics (\"Enemy Mine\",\"The Last Starfighter\", etc), \"Wing Commander\" is a nothing more than a wanna-be.Almost every story element and character of \"Wing Commander\" seems to be lifted whole from other, more original efforts. The Kilrathi seem to be taken directly from Larry Niven's \"Man/Kzin War\" stories. The Prinze character is a Rent-A-Center version of Luke Skywalker. His hotheaded best friend is an amalgamation of every sidekick EVER in Space Opera along with quite a bit of \"Mongoose\" from \"Top Gun\" thrown in. His flight commander is the female character from \"Top Gun\" and VERY little else. One of the battle scenes (where the Tiger Claw must hide from the Kilrathi fleet) is a blatant rip-off/tribute to every WWII submarine flick ever made. And the list goes on. There is \"A\" level professional level talent involved here (and yes, I count Freddie Prinze as a \"A\" level, even if I don't care for his screen persona), but they all seem to be in in purely for in it the paycheck. Seriously, how can you have Jurgen Prochnow, David Warner and David Suchet - each of whom have carried entire movies - and not produce something memorable? The answer: \"Paycheck.\" How can you have talented, interesting character actors like Lillard and Karyo in almost every scene and completely waste them? I don't know, but I suspect: \"Paycheck.\"Even as hackwork, though, the movie is OK...kind of the Space Opera equivalent of the dozens of \"Shaw Brothers/Golden Harvest\" martial arts pieces which the USA Network used to air on \"Kung Fu Theater\". Uncritical fans of the genre will still find all the standard elements they expect from these movies, and a few polished touches here and there:The clunky, bristly designs of the space ships makes them look like heavy duty battle-wagons, not space age toys. The script does generate a little suspense here and there with its depictions fleets manoeuvrings to get the best advantage. David Warner and David Suchet are incapable of delivering a dull or inept line. Tcheky Karyo's light touch and charming accent are almost enough to save any scene he is in. Lillard is his usual fire-hose of manic energy, even if his character is a complete tool. The depiction of the Kilrathi warships popping one by one out of the 'warp hole', only to be torn to pieces by weapons of the human fleet, has a nice heft and rhythm to it that is viscerally satisfying.But whatever you do, do NOT come into \"Wing Commander\" expecting anything new or fresh, or even very impressive.",

            "content": "Have you ever heard the expression \"so stupid it is brilliant\"? Well, you will see plenty of stupidity on offer here. So much of it, in fact, that you will begin to understand where the expression \"so bad that it is awesome\" comes from. Forget about Mortal Kombat, or even Resident Evil: Apocalypse. This is the film that video game adaptations get their reputation from. Every error of film-making you can think of, and even some you can't, is committed here. So many acting careers die here that the film should have been called Career Holocaust. You can bet that many members of the support cast neglect to mention this effort when discussing their CVs. About the only cast member who seems to have recovered from being in this abomination is Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, and I am sure even he would rather forget this one. Incidentally, since when do you cast an actor with a French accent as thick as pea soup to play a character who was known in the early video games for having a Scottish accent so broad that it cemented the games reputation as a collection of stereotypes. Incidentally, Angel was supposed to be the French accent.But this is all pure digression. The cast's collective heart was in it, and the crew did the best job they could, but the direction is so weak that the film winds up looking like it was intended to form the cutscenes of a video game. No explanation for the technology on show is offered. No reference to the time in which the film takes place is offered. Many references place the film in the time just after the declaration of war against the Kilrathi. But the scenario being depicted shows the Kilrathi imminently approaching Earth, which was one of the available scenarios in the third video game, which in turn is set decades into the war. Not to mention the stealth technology, which is introduced some years into the war, and yet the most prominent fighters of the Terran confederation look like rejected designs for World War II aircraft with shower nozzles stuck to their fronts.The spacecraft design leads me to believe that members of the crew might be at least half right when they say that the problem with this film is the budget. In a time when science-fiction theatre was costing upwards of a hundred million per film, a miniscule thirty million was spent on this production. It shows. Shots of the main enemy in anything other than spacecraft form are rare, and when we do finally get to see the Kilrathi, they look more like big turds than humanoid cats. In one memorable sequence, we get to see a wrecked space fighter, with its pilot still within, pushed off the runway by a futuristic bulldozer that seems to grip the tarmac using the traditional wheel arrangement. In zero gravity, mind you. Of course, the runway could have gravity wells, or the bulldozer could have magnetically-charged wheels, but this is something the director or the screenwriter is supposed to explain to the audience. Very little explanation of anything, even why the Pilgrims are so space-savvy, is offered. There is basically a whole lot of tell and very little show.Speaking of the Pilgrims, a subplot is added to this film that states the original Human explorers of space were a group dubbed the Pilgrims, who began to renounce their Human qualities. Apparently, a war started between the Pilgrims and the rest of Humanity, with the present Terran Confederation beset by a severe prejudice against Pilgrims. This is all well and fine, but it adds nothing to the actual plot, and only muddies the waters as to what the Humans are fighting about. All it really serves to do is give our central hero a Luke Skywalker sort of quality, and not a very convincing one at that. The idiotic game the Terran pilots play that dead pilots basically never existed flies right in the face of every convention set in the original video games. And it isn't like the crew have the excuse of not having played the games, because the director is the same guy who oversaw their creation. All this turns out to be is a very stupid attempt at a creative plot arc that, like the Pilgrim element, has no bearing upon the story whatsoever.Unlike most of the rotten films I have commented about lately, I gave Wing Commander a one out of ten. Watching the cast, respectable otherwise or no, trying to chew their way through boot-like dialogue is pure comedy gold. Realising that the director expects us to feel scared of these gigantic turd monsters he calls the Kilrathi is even funnier. Therefore, Wing Commander is not just so bad it is good. It is so stupid it is utterly brilliant.",

            "content": "I know this guy who works at a multiplex and is a movie maniac.  He insists that \"Wing Commander\" is the worst movie ever made, so when I saw that SciFi Channel was going to air it this week, I thought, \"Oh, good!  I will get to see it for free and see if it's everything my friend promises it is, because I've got a perverse obsession with bad movies!\"I will tell you how much I... well, I suppose the word is \"enjoyed\"... \"Wing Commander\" by describing my favorite part of the movie for you.The setting is a big war in outer space between Earthlings and some aliens called the Kilrathi (more about them later), and most of the action we are chiefly concerned with takes place on a big spaceship that is something like an aircraft carrier.  The hero's annoying best friend and his sort-of-girlfriend have disobeyed the leader of their team and, thanks to Cosmic Revenge, the sort-of-girlfriend dies when she crashes her little spaceship into the landing pad thing on the big ship.  Now, this is supposed to be the big, dramatic sad part.  We cut from a scene where the hero's annoying best friend is crying and begging to save his sort-of-girlfriend, to a scene where the sort-of-girlfriend's ship is being pushed by a little snowplow off the runway thing of the big ship.In the middle of Outer Space.In Zero Gravity.I suppose there's some B.S. about there being big magnets or something lining the runway so that the ships can't just float away.  But, you know, that's something that's supposed to be the screenplay writers' responsibility to tell us.My second favorite part is when we finally see the Kilrathi for the first time.  At about the forty-five minute mark, it occurred to me that we don't even know who or what the Kilrathi are.  We only know that they're at war with Earth and that they hate humans.  But for the first full hour and a half or so, we don't even know what a Kilrathi looks like.Well, the Kilrathi end up being something like an anthropomorphic Mr. Bigglesworth.  And they really like fog machines.  When the hero and his buddies invade the Kilrathi ship, the whole place is choked with green fog. \nOh, and for all this, we never find out why they hate humans.I came up with a theory.  The Kilrathi are the descendants of a bunch of hairless cats who were sent in a probe many years ago to a strange planet. This planet was highly irradiated, and the cats were sent there to see if Earthlings could survive on it.  Well, the radiation made the cats evolve very quickly, and eventually their descendants began to look more and more humanoid.  They built some spaceships and went to war against humanity, to avenge the fact that the humans never remembered to clean out their grandparents' litter boxes.  As for the green fog, that's to remind all the Kilrathi of the awful stench their ancestors had to suffer when their litter was left unchanged.But, again, this is the screenwriter's job.And I'm not even going to start on the whole \"Pilgrim\" thing.\"Wing Commander\" gets a three, because of it's parody value and because it isn't as bad as my friend promised but it's close.  VERY close. Essentially, this is the kind of movie that \"Starship Troopers\", as a *very* small part of it's agenda, set out to parody.  Go watch that movie instead. It's a great date movie.",

I never been so many times (5) in a cinema watching the same movie but with the same feeling when you discover a treasure, one of this films or shows (like galactica) with great characters, maybe not so good special effects. What's makes Wing commander a good underrated movie? The story about the war in the heart of the warriors, in this case Blair (before becomes the Wing Commander)and Maniac Marshall have to fight not only against the kilrathi, they have a little dark war with the own crew of the battlecruiser Tigerclaw, where the pain of the last civil war is still pounding in every heart. With this movie Chris Roberts explore a new vision of the space colonization(the pilgrim war) and at the same time try to bring feeling of the First world war as a model of this new war on the new frontier. Even when the acting is not so great Tcheky Karyo and Jurgen Prochnow, makes a good work and the soundtracks is wonderful.

And it did and that was by far the best part of the experience.This is the kind of movie that really bothers me.  Because when scripts or ideas are pitched to studio executives, they must sit around in a room and decide whether or not they are going to spend 40 million dollars on some film that they hope will give them a significnat return.  With Wing Commander, I would like to know how anyone could actually read the script and say to themselves \" Yea!!!!  We are going to make a huge profit off this one. \"  How exactly do executives do it?  How do they get paid the ridiculous amounts of money that they do and then give the green light to make unbelievably bad movies like this?  I know sometimes it is a gamble because you never know what will succeed and what won't ( remember the unbelievable success of Lethal Weapon?  No one saw that coming ) but at least when you gamble, there should be some educated reasoning behind it. And any educated person would tell you that this film was destined to fail right from the beginning.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Mathew Lilliard are not that big enough yet to carry a film by themselves, especially if they are working with the deck stacked against them.  And plus, another film sort of like this one was scheduled to get released in mere months after this came out, and that film is called The Phantom Menace.  And I think everyone could wait a few more months to get their fix than to catch some simple imitation called Wing Commander.I won't even get into the story because it is so simple that I'm sure you already know.  Some bad guys want to take over the world and some good guys have to stop them.The story is uninteresting, the acting is okay and the direction is a muddled confusing mess.  And to top it off they wasted Lilliard in this film.  He deserves better than this.  He has a presence on film and he makes almost every scene he's in better.  Even in this film he was good, but he can't help something that is this bad.Don't waste your money or your inteligence on this piece of garbage.  It is terrible.  Bad Bad Bad.  Awful....

            "content": "In the 27th century Earth is at war with the Kilrathi Empire.  During an attack on an Earth space base, the Kilrathi capture a Navcom unit that will allow their ships to jump directly to Earth and attack before defences can be prepared.  Earth turns to Starship Tiger Claw and it's small crew of fighters to stop the assault and ensure that the Kilrathi cannot attack Earth unannounced.I haven't played the game, seen the game or even know anything about the game \u0096 so I'm relatively open and had no images of what the film `should' look like. I've read other reviews and have noticed many focus on the factual errors (like the anti-gravity bulldozers) and the spaceship design. Yes, these were poor things but they are not the only reason why this wasn't very good.The `plot' seemed to require a history with the game \u0096 it was full of nonsense about pilgrims, wars etc, little of which was explained and made me feel like it was my fault for not knowing!  Secondly the film felt like a game at parts.  I mean that we had some action scenes then we had shots of Admirals talking that felt like it was an interlude between missions on a game.  It certainly didn't feel like a scene in a movie.The effects are a little daft but the WW2 designs are actually quite cool despite being totally impractical and unlikely.  The space battles lack tension and simply aren't exciting in the least.  The plot clich\u00e9s are all over the place , ranging from loser come good to a poor love interest aspect.Prinze Jr should not be allowed to make films if this is all the screen presence he can muster up.  He is as vacuous as the space around him and it's hard to care for him.  However he shines when beside Burrows who brings a new definition to the word `wooden'.  I hate Lillard but at least he brings some energy to the film \u0096 he's still irritating but at least he's trying hard!  Prochnow is actually alright and rises above the material. The WW2 theme continues in the mainly British cast.  This is a little weird because the leads are mostly Yanks.  It's also worrying to see actors like Suchet, Warner and several others hawking their wares in this sort of film. The support cast is deep in familiar faces from British TV and film \u0096 including the lead of Young Americans and Don Gilet.  The only actress that really caught my eye was Ginny Holder who played a sexy love interest as Rosie.  But she's black, and a side kick of sorts, and a love interest \u0096 so how long do we think that she'll survive?Overall who cares about the WW2 design or the fact that the ship design is silly or that factual errors are all over the place.  These are not reasons the film is bad \u0096 no.  The poor acting, poor plot and dull `action' scenes that lack tension \u0096 these are the things that make this film bad and well worth avoiding apart from the pretty Holder.",

The special effects are pretty good, the dark atmosphere gives the movie a \"grim and dark future\" look.The only negative thing is the fighting scenes, they look just unreal and penalize the whole movie.The plot is simple, they travel through quasars to save the earth from a Killrathi invasion, these aliens look like big cats wielding some technologically advanced sticks. The cameras are always centered on Lt. Blair, so the shape of the Killrathi is shrouded in mystery until the third quarter of the movie.Overall it's a really good movie, with a great atmosphere that will make you say \"Ok, i didn't waste these two hours\".",

I really liked it, and I've seen it even twice, after reading the bad comments; and I still enjoyed it.Well I've tried to find out why the movie get that bad comments, but I've still no clue. They say there is no story, but thats not true, the story is really complex (in fact, too complex). Or that sound can't be heard in space - haha, funny, why does nobody care about that in movies such as \"Star Wars\" ?My own main problem with the movie are those parts which doesn't get explained; for example, what happened with the commander after he get wounded ? Suddenly he's just gone, and never appears again. Or why didn't they tried to save the fighter pilot who had crashed on the gangway ?!?!?And the fights itself as well as some of the starships looked too much just like those in the game, that could have been far cooler. On the other hand, the Kilrati - didn't they looked like lions in the original, much bigger than human beings ? Here they are black and are just same size, and they look more like rats.I somehow missed Rachael Leigh Cook in this one. Freddie Prinze Jr. played again the Prince Charming, but he had no real counterpart like in She's all that. Saffron Burrows is really good looking, but simply too old for taking Raechael's part. Matthew Lillard was again crazy - surprise, surprise ! I hope I can summarize the rest of the acting as simply good, without mentioning each of them individually.The movie looked much like the game - or much like StarTrek. The script was a little to complex and confusing, with too many stories in the story, but it also had suspense. The introduction was really good, except that one has to hear what these people say to understand some things happening later.",

The acting was what I've come to expect from these younger American actors (as in good).I'd say from an objective view point it's a good film. A bit lacking in certain areas, but certainly enjoyable.I say \"objective\" simply because I have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series, so I was seeing this as a film, not as a spin off (in which case I'm sure it would come across worse, simply because when you're used to one set of actors portraying your favourite characters a new team will never fit the bill).Overall not a bad way to spend my Wednesday evening.",

Sure, the actors were a bunch of pretty boys and girls, and the Kilrathi looked like rubber mice stuffed into battle armour, but the movie managed to do several things for me.(Some minor spoilers, but no real plot givaways following...)Battle in space is more realistically portrayed than many other movies I have seen. Cruisers fighting actually take time to fire at one another and move slowly because of their immense intertia. My favorite scene in *all* space type action movies is still Wing Commander's \"Give them a broadside, Mr. Gerald.\"To the person who was wondering why, upon engaging silent mode, he \"shhhd\" a crew member... although this seems unlikely in space, the ship was LANDED on a small asteroid. The Kilrathi (in the games, and also in the books based on the games) have probes that would be more than capable of dropping down to the surface of the asteroids and detecting vibrations. It was a bit silly, but it wasn't completely retarded either.They might have changed a lot coming from the game, but the only unforgivable change was the Kilrathi (see above). The fighters, carriers, and cruisers have a very plausable military look to them while still retaining some of the Wing Commander feel- plus there are realistic additions, like the ability to close off the launch bay on the famous Tiger's Claw carrier.I'm too tired to write a full review right now, but I have to say: this movie is not as awful as you may think. Maybe it's just because I've been playing Wing Commander since I was six, but this movie was a half-decent portrayal of one of the best game series of all time.",

If you can sit and watch Dr. Who, Red Dwarf, or Hitchhiker's Guide and enjoy it despite the terrible effects, you are the type of person who can enjoy Wing Commander. Also, the movie is best if you aren't really all that familiar with the game.They should have taken this concept and called it something unrelated to Wing Commander and made it a different movie with the same actors.  It might have gone over better.  Nevertheless, I have the DVD and saw it in the cinema and it is no Star Wars, but certainly deserves better credit.",

People have been saying the plot was extremely weak and that the Kilrathi monsters were very poorly done. A few comments have also been made as to the quality of acting in the movie. The movie at this point has earned a 4.7/10 IMDb user's rating which I feel is undeservingly low. I will not try to defend the movie as a \"great and timeless\" movie, for it was not. However, considering a $27 million budget, the movie was very well presented. I mean, to release a Sci-Fi movie, which relies very heavily on costly special effects, for such a small amount of money must have been a very difficult task. Look at Titanic, it was a romance and the special effects involved recreating a Ship and making it Sink, now granted they were good effects and Titanic was a good movie, but it also had a budget of $200 million. As for the actors I feel they did a superb job portraying the characters, especially Matthew Lillard who gave \"Maniac\" a lovable character and portrayed the original Maniac from the video game series very well. The plot, though not very strong, had enough flow to give the movie a sense of direction and having played the game, I understood the concepts easily. Another point not many people have touched upon is how Chris Roberts used many tactical elements from the gaming series. Involving torpedoes and the use of bombers to attack capital ships, and jump points as opposed to simple \"warp\" or \"hyperdrive\". In this, sense he kept very true to the game series. Before watching the movie, I did not really expect much from the special effects with the knowledge of the low budget but surprisingly the effects were very, very well done (except for a few close ups of the Rapiers when you can tell they are using a model with a computer generated background). The Kilrathi were poorly done but there is not enough exposure of them to take too much away from the movie, again budget constraints have hurt them in this department. However, the dogfights, capital ships, battle scenes, and backgrounds were quite stunning and had me very surprised. I think the movie provides a good opportunity for franchise possibilities if done right. Also keep in mind that this was Chris Robert's debut on the big screens and if the Wing Commander games have taught us anything at all is that Chris adapts well and learns from his mistakes. If there is a Wing Commander 2 (The movie of course) look for it to be quite a step up from this Wing Commander, especially if they get a bigger budget. I think the Wing Commander concept has great potential and after all is considered I think an excellent job was done on this movie. In comparison to other movies in this genre I would give it a 7.3/10",

            "content": "It is curious that in one of the comments, Dan Grant compares Wing Commander to Star Wars: Phantom Menace. I also had Star Wars in my mind when watching Wing Commander, especially the new Episode III, Revenge of the Sith. While Dan Grant had only his great expectations about the Star Wars trilogy to compare, I watched Wing Commander for the first time just now, and the comparison to the first Star Wars trilogy in my mind was highly in favor of Wing Commander.Stilted acting? None. Oversimplified plot? None. Dull, dragging scenes? None. In not only one quick cash-in genre but two, Wing Commander is a stunning surprise. There have been enough ho-hum scifi flicks like Supernova and even more video game licences that haven't worked at all on film. Even though I haven't played the Wing Commander PC games, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Rarely has any sci-fi action movie been done so right, with not only apt actor choices and truly eye-pleasing visuals, even six years after release, but also a clever script, fleshed out characters and a sci-fi setting which is put to perfect use.Two of the main cast, lesser known Freddie Prinze Jr. (who eventually becomes the movie's lead) and Matthew Lillard as his friend Lt. Marshall are refreshingly fitting and credible in their roles, and the supporting cast has a few high performances as well from David Suchet, David Warner and Tch\u00e9ky Karyo. If there's a weak point in the cast, its Saffron Burrows, who isn't totally at ease with her role as Lt. Cmdr. Devereaux.It is not only the actors who create a believable impression, but also the special effects designers. Wing Commander paints an intentionally unrealistic but beautiful view of space and frantic space battles, liken to that in the beginning of Star Wars Episode III, but in larger scope, with more actual strategy and played out longer. It is also enjoyable to see that Wing Commander's space battles are actually an adaptation of a World War II movie. While there are additional twists brought about by the sci-fi space setting, the battle scenes play out as naval battles in WW2, with fighters, command carriers and even submarine-like maneuvers and situations in space.It all comes together thanks to a script which does include some give-ins to standard movie formula, but goes against it on at least as many points. Instead of a simple sci-fi action flick, we are treated to a thoroughly planned out epic. It might be thanks to the storyline established in the game, which I can't say about, but it seems like the world of Wing Commander has a lot more history than the short introduction in the beginning of the movie. Adding to that the development of the characters in the movie and the movie's resistance to raise Lt. Blair to the role of a sole hero, creates an all the more credible movie experience. Only the 'guy gets the girl' twist at the end of the movie felt tacked on and unfitting, the rest of the character history is obviously thoroughly planned.In closing, Wing Commander delivers a superb space epic in the scope of one movie, which brings the new Star Wars trilogy to shame. While not a perfect sci-fi action flick, Wing Commander comes stunningly close.",

            "content": "First of all, the games in the Wing Commander series are some of the best video games I've ever played. Technology has gotten to the point where these games look dated and the full motion video seems impractical, but the story lines and combat sequences are amazing. If anyone has the opportunity to play these games and hasn't do yourself a favor and do it. That said...This movie is ridiculous and the storyline might just as well be from a 1950's B movie. The dialogue is awful, the acting worse, and the supposedly futuristic spacecraft looked like they were bought from a studio auctioning off props from old World War II movies. The director, who happens to have designed the games, apparently thought that it would be cool to throw his story lines from the games out the window in favor of some World War II allegory. If I wanted to see World War II, I would've put in my \"Saving Private Ryan\" DVD and not watched this crap on basic cable.The characters are extremely well crafted in the game series, well, for a video game series anyway. Here, they come off as a bunch of tired clich\u00e9s. Also, I take issue with the fact that Blair, the main character, is some kind of chosen one with special powers. The Wing Commander games gave us characters who were normal people forced into an extraordinary situation, something direly lacking in the genre of science fiction. In other words, there were no mythical \"Pilgrims\" or other hocus pocus like there are in the movie. I wouldn't mind if it was well done but it just feels tacked on for no good reason.Speaking of the Kilrathi, its not even discussed in the film why the Humans are at war with them or what they are. Instead of the ten foot tall, menacing, tiger creatures from the games they look like hamsters on steroids. Also, one of the best characters from the games, the evil kilrathi prince thrakath (in the games Thrakath is a cross between hanibal lectar and josef stalin), is not in the movie, leaving it without a strong villain.Now, of course, as a fan of the games I'm a little bitter that this movie is one of the worst that I've ever seen. But I know a horrible movie when I see one, and this movie is pretty much unwatchable whether you've played the games or not. Honestly, if you're in the mood for sci fi and if you see it anywhere, just ignore it and watch Star Wars again.",

            "content": "Wing Commander is in many ways a typical military themed Science Fiction film but it has enough strengths to make it worth watching.The first and most difficult hurdle of any sci-fi film is establishing a plausible or at the very least a believable setting or plot scenario. The second is trying to get the viewer involved. Wing Commander succeeds in both of this areas adequately but not exceedingly well. The setup is very cut and dry and the characters rather blunt but everything is explained at a reasonable pace so that the viewer has time to absorb what is happening.Production wise the movie also succeeds rather well. The space-ships feel small and with the presence of J\u00fcrgen Proschnow this definitely evokes a type of \"Das Boot in Space\" atmosphere. However the space-combat looks fantastic by 1999 standards and the special-effects have lasted the test of time which means the movie will not make a modern viewer cringe. Costume designs are a little off but not horribly.Overall only the Kilrathi's presence and depiction is the only thing that deserves any major criticism. Their presence in the film feels very distant and they stay out of the spotlight until the final act. When we finally see them they come off as a very stereotypical sort of antagonist for a sci-fi film and this was a slight disappointment.The plot itself, having a military setting follows a rather predictable series of events. Thankfully the cast of actors has enough heart and personality that these events don't feel like they're dragging on and generally the acting was very believable. Only during some of the combat dialogue characters seemed to lack intensity which sometimes gives off the feeling like combat in space isn't a big deal.A rather predictable story and disappointing representation of an alien species aside Wing Commander delivers an entertaining 96 minutes of sci-fi action.

            "content": "Although its aliens resemble varmints, \"Wing Commander\" emerges as a predictable but entertaining \"Star War\" clone distinguished by Digital Anvil's dazzling special effects, Oscar winner Peter Lamont's atmospheric production designs, and a first-class supporting cast. While his directorial film debut lacks originality, director Chris Roberts shows adequate ingenuity in his treatment of venerable science-fiction clich\u00e9s and conventions. \"Wing Commander\" recycles enough surefire elements from \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek 2,\" \"Top Gun,\" \"Starship Troopers,\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\" to satisfy hardcore sci-fi fans. Starring Freddie (\"She's All That\") Prinze Jr., and Matthew (\"Scream\") Lillard, \"Wing Commander\" charts the course of two audacious starship fighter pilots fresh out of the Confederation academy who find themselves thrown into the middle of an intergalactic war. The year is 2654. Earth is at war with the xenophobic Kilarthi, an ancient alien race of felines with retractable Freddy Krueger claws that resolve to obliterate the planet when diplomatic solutions fail.Freshman director Chris Roberts and scenarist Kevin (\"Mortal Combat\") Droney launch the action with a devastating Kilarthi surprise attack on Pegasus, a secret Confederation outpost in an asteroid chain. The attack resembles the Japanese 'sneak' attack on Pearl Harbor, only instead of the U.S. Pacific Fleet getting destroyed, the Confederation's Vega System Fleet gets wiped out while in dry dock. The bad guys secure a fabled navigational device which will enable them to attack Earth before the Confederation can stop them.Meanwhile, Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn (David Warner of \"Titanic\") relays a coded transmission to a freighter in route to the closest hope for Earth's survival: the aircraft carrier style starship Tiger Claw. Tolwyn entrusts the message to the son of a war hero, Chris 'Maverick' Blair. When he arrives aboard the Tiger Claw, Blair receives a chilly response from the second-in-command, Captain Gerald (Jurgen Prochnow of \"Beverly Hills Cop 2\"), who mistrusts the rookie pilot because he is a half-breed whose mother was an infamous Pilgrim.According to Droney's expository rich screenplay, the Pilgrims explored the far corners of the universe first and cultivated unique genetic powers which allowed them to navigate through space time anomalies without the aid of computers. The Pilgrims, however, grew proud and arrogant. Eventually, they revolted against their fellow Earthlings, fought a terrible war, and became hated until their race died out. The point is that speed matters in the story, and Chris Blair knows which short cuts to take through space to beat the Kilrathi before they reach Earth. Blair's identity crisis lies at the heart of the action. Until this predicament, Blair knew nothing about either his Pilgrim heritage or his special qualities.Sadly, everything falls apart when the villain storm onto the screen. Adventure movies live and die on the strength of their villains. The Kilrathi qualify as the all-time worst science fiction villains since \"The Green Slime\" back in 1968. Resembling \"Karate Kid\" star Pat Morita from the neck up, they dress like the cast of the Broadway musical \"Cats\" in tacky Naugahyde green suits from the neck down. Prudently, Roberts and Droney have pared down the screen time devoted to the Kilrathi to the absolute minimum. One glimpse at these farcical foes is enough to undermine either any suspense or credibility that \"Wing Commander\" generates during its trim PG-13 rated running time of 100 minutes.Questions left unanswered about the Kilrathi may annoy some audiences. Who are the Kilrathi? Where did they come from? Why are they so determined to destroy Earth? Practically the only thing intimidating about the Kilrathi is the way their name sounds when anybody utters it.What differentiates \"Wing Commander\" from the standard \"Star Wars\" clone is its anachronistic but novel hardware designs. Although its hackneyed story occurs in the 27th century, the Confederation deploys comparatively low-tech arsenals of bullets and torpedoes rather than high-tech lasers to battle the Kilrathi. Peter Lamont, who won an Oscar fro his production designs on \"Titanic,\" models the space fighters on the gull-wing Chance-Vought Corsairs of World War II rather than the Tie fighter or X-Wing craft of \"Star Wars.\" The space cruisers in \"Wing Commander\" have an antiquated but grungy look that links them with other notably grungy sci-fi thrillers such as \"Outland,\" the \"Alien\" franchise, and \"Event Horizon.\" Altogether, it is nothing new, but \"Wing Commander\" generates a lot of atmosphere with its retro-space look.So obsessed is \"Wing Commander\" creator Chris Roberts with World War II technology that he shuns the usual Buck Rogers paraphernalia. An interstellar fight between the Tiger Claw and a Kilrathi vessel is staged like a confrontation between pirate ships.Like \"Starship Troopers,\" \"Wing Commander\" boasts independent, strong-willed female characters that don't flinch at the sight of blood and violence. Saffron (\"Circle of Friends\") Burrows is cast as the tight-lipped, dry ice title character, Jeanette 'Angel' Marshall who suffers nobody's insolence. She believes that they are all living on borrowed time, and the idealistic Blair does his best to refute that thinking. Burrows' sullen good looks and sexy Emma Peel presence make you forget about the laughable Kilrathi. Ginny Holden's daredevil fighter pilot make a memorable impression, too.Tolerant sci-fi audiences will appreciate this serviceable sci-fi saga more than discriminating adults that expect more from Hollywood science fiction outings. \"Wing Commander\" has enough good things going for it so that its threadbare plot and enigmatic hairball villains don't sabotage it. Top lenser Thierry Arbogast, who filmed \"The Fifth Element,\" bolsters \"Wing Commander\" with his exhilarating widescreen cinematography. Arbogast's stirring long shots of space vehicles zipping past planets to vanish into the distant vistas of stars makes \"Wing Commander\" a treat for the eyes. Kevin Kiner's rousing orchestral score, that David \"Independence Day\" Arnold helped compose, give the action a dignity and stature that it otherwise would lack.Sure, the dog-eared scenario of \"Wing Commander\" has been replicated ad nauseam, but director Chris Roberts' generally competent helming of this $27-million production makes it worth watching once.",

I love Sci-Fi movies and outer space movies as a whole and there's no reason why this movie shouldn't hit the mark and quite honestly I'm astounded as to why it has such a low rating. I normally would rank this movie as an 8 to 9 but since it's had such bad markings I've upped it to all I could. And I'm rating this as a 14 year old flick at that...In short, if you like Sci-Fi's, space travel, space battles, the whole BSG theme, then one would think you should like this. Again I'm astounded as to why this movie hit such a ditch when it came to ratings and such, a very entertaining flick at least by my standards",

I know David warner David Warner is and maybe someone might mistake them for being the same person, but I didn't see Malcolm McDowell.Having never seen the film, I bought the DVD for 6 dollars. I wasn't expecting much, because the back of the DVD shows are not at all representative of the film. Anyway, I'm a fan of sci-fi, so I decided to give it a chance.I have to honestly say, I was surprised at how well done this film is. The plot is surprisingly developed, and there were some twists and turns along the way to maintain the interest of the viewer. Some of the lines could be considered cheesy, but these moments were isolated and were mild compared to the culture of one-liners and insincere babble that the mainstream audiences accept out of the Hollywood trend setters.Much of the dialogue was actually plausible, and well delivered by a competent cast. Freddie Prinze, Jr. looked like he was still shaking off the remnants of a trendy teenage mindset, but he was adequate. In fact, he's a new cadet. It's no wonder he would still be somewhat immature. Mathew Lillard's character is somewhat unlikable, but well-acted, and has some redeeming qualities at the same time. I think that was the while point. Tch\u00e9ky Karyo delivers a brilliant, emotional performance. I wasn't familiar with this actor before but he is amazing.As far as the mechanics of the film, it presents space fighting and space scenarios in a deep and intriguing manner. The good special effects helped to make it believable. The solid plot was garnished by some tense moments that seemed almost influenced by Wolfgang Peterson's landmark Das Boot. Throughout the film, Roberts brought about quite a bit of philosophical and historical content. This material was quite expertly woven throughout the film, and is tied tightly with the ending of the film as well. For that, he deserves many points. Because it's something that mainstream Hollywood seems to not be able to get right after all these years of practice.Overall, I would recommend this for any sci-fi fan. Sadly, good sci-fi films are always underrated by the mainstream audiences. Even more sad is that there aren't enough quality films in this exceptional genre. We're handed these silly, insulting films something like The Day Robots Pummeled the Earth. Or else films that are completely tethered by poor special effects. Or we're handed a world that is set up in a very deliberate, expert manner, then expected to accept the fact that anything goes, no matter how ridiculous or silly the film unfolds after the halfway point, like in Event Horizon. Those types of film give the genre a terrible reputation, and Wing Commander certainly stands out as a superior film amongst all the garbage producers try to pass off as sci-fi. It's a definite recommend for sci-fi fans. 8/10 as a film.",

            "content": "Wing Commander is an important film because it discusses strategies for combating aliens not in our Care Rank Ki-Human alliance. Freddie Prinze Jr will probably make more movies at less than 20 million a picture. My Mother, Father and Ex Wife are all of royal genes. Sometimes it is better to have a good name than wealth. I call my Daughter Julia the Princess of Peace. It now turns out that the Planet Coaltrain that the Artificial Intelligence Computer of my Daughter rules may in fact be the homeworld of the friendly KI Aliens previously brought to the edge of the Universe to avoid the big Crunch of the last universe. In real life outside of this holodeck there are no spiral galaxies only randomly placed stars and planets. The odds of a planet rotating and being a permanent distance from a star capable of supporting life are not that good. It is certainly possible for an Earth like planet with fusion at the core to have a magnetic field and local gravity but it strains credulity that a spiral galaxy could exist outside of a holodeck. Imagine expanding stars in our universe coming in contact with an outer ring of dark matter that repels the stars back toward the center of the Universe and you will understand the cosmic arrangement. The fact that Care Rank Ki Alien sentience evolved in a span of less than 20 billion years is impressive. As the Indian chief in the commercial about the Great Peace says \"You're here aren't you?\" Do not be dismayed that you are in a Holodeck. I had a dream that the Care Rank Ki said that Humans either really exist or are being genetically engineered. I am really glad that the friendly Ki Aliens believe that it is bad luck to eat we emergency rations and never have so far. What will lead to the Friendly Ki Aliens saving the Human species are our loyalty gene, and our higher reasoning being similar to the Friendly Ki Aliens plus our entertainment factor of war games, singing, and acting. The 1978 AD movie Battlestar Galactica predicted that as Skipper of Moon 168 Artevan (Galactica) I would go on alert at the point of about 6.5 billion Human lives being in jeopardy until balance will be arrived at sometime in 2023. Here is another Care Rank Ki parable for you. It is possible that this Holodeck is prerecorded to a large extent and like a laserdisc game of Dragons Lair only some outcomes can be changed. I have actually seen this large Artificial Intelligence partly disc based technology skip fast forward. It could be a wear skip or some sentient or artificial intelligence computer fast forwarded my timeline. Imagine a digital disc in a Moonfleet Moon so large that you can't get the disc through the exit of the computer room without making a bigger door. Thats a clever Friendly Ki Alien idea. For those of you that say I am hearing voices consider that I can only hear the exact accents of the 21 immortal Human list that I was given and the voice of God Apophis. Our Human artificial Intelligence discs are so old that its possible that the Friendly Ki Aliens now rule the Universe and kept our 21 Human Artificial Intelligences as thanks for our loyalty to the Care Rank Ki.

I never played the game - and this is the crux of my review - I played something else that seems to predate Wing Commander: \"Descent: Freespace - The Great War\". I couldn't help but think that there was SO much reference to everything about Freespace, it wasn't funny. The ships, the enemy, jump points, literally everything. It was like watching a movie of the game I just played. BTW, I still play Freespace from time to time - it's good fun.I did briefly enjoy the \"role reprisal\" of J\u00fcrgen Prochnow in \"Das Boot\" - \"reload tubes 1 and 2, fire when ready\": said almost the same line in both movies.Anyway, I enjoyed it; give it another go and see!",

            "content": "Space battles! Ah man, I can't ever get enough of them. Some of the coolest moments in film and TV have beautiful starfields and nebulae with giant starships and fast fighters blasting each other to hell with lasers, torpedoes, and other far-out weaponry. Cinema has been blessed with many great space battles in the Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and Starship Troopers franchises. Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets; there aren't that many movies that really show space warfare, and I personally wish there were more. This is probably why I turn to Wing Commander once in a while.The sole appeal to Wing Commander will be its space battles and special effects. They aren't that great per se; the graphics are fairly low-tech and haven't aged well. Regardless, the actual battles are fairly cool, with some nicely colorful backdrops, cool-looking ships, and plenty of explosions and laser beams flying around everywhere.The rest of the movie is comprised of some of the purest and densest cheese. It's a light and fluffy film, full of playful banter and juvenile characters; it makes for an entertaining flick in its own right, but it does not leave any lasting impact, and will likely repulse many viewers.I've never played the original Wing Commander video games, but I have no doubt that they probably have a better story and more immersive universe than this film. This film covers a pretty standard story, with stuff we've seen before in shows like Battlestar Galactica. There's nothing much new to seeing space-faring pilots fighting aliens, getting involved with each other, breaking the rules, and inevitably having to make sacrifices. With the film's lightweight tone, none of it bears any weight. The film also never lets the audience get to know the characters beyond the surface level. We also never get to know much about the universe, aside from the fact that there are aliens, there are humans in spaceships, and they're at war.This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Acting is nothing worth screaming about: Freddie Prinze Jr. looks and acts very juvenile, and Matthew Lillard even moreso. Saffron Burrows is easily the bright spot here, not only in terms of looks and that awesome accent of hers, but also in taking the role a little more seriously than everybody else. Writing is average at best. This production has pretty weak-looking sets, props, and costumes. The Kilrathi look especially awful toward the end, appearing like giant plastic cat-people. Special effects are used liberally - there's even one totally useless Matrix effect, where the camera spins around the characters while they're in slow-motion. As mentioned above, the space battles are cool, but still fairly cheap. Music is not bad though.Not a great film by any means, and certainly not the best space combat movie ever made. But in a genre that's rather lacking, I find Wing Commander fun. If you enjoy epic space combat like I do, then this is worth renting once.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)",

The only problem I found was in the look of the Kilrathi. Their skin looked like plastic! I have to say, I think Chris Roberts could have done better. He made them look very realistic in the games, so why not in the movie? Oh well. It's really the only problem I had. I give it a 9.

            "content": "Why I think this movie deserves a slightly above average vote is largely based on subjective appreciation. However, given the shower of sarcasms it collected here and some other places on the Internet, I feel sort of compelled to say a few words in his defense.Let's get rid of the \"bulldozzer in zero-G\" thingie first. OK the physics in this movie are laughably off, but so are they in widely acclaimed movies like, say, Alien 3 or 4 (the alien, more than once depicted as neither fire nor bulletproof, withstanding a bath of molten lead only to explode due to thermal dilatation? 1 atmosphere or less pressure difference enough to suck an alien trough a 25 cents coin sized hole? I beg your pardon?).I think the whole point of this kind of movie is to carry you somewhere else. They are not supposed to be checked against reality. For a start, having actual humans pilot combat spacecrafts that look and handle (and even sound!) like WWII warbirds in deep space, having to rely on gun sights to shoot at the baddies in an universe where computers are smarter than most people, etc is a collection of utter nonsenses. Same basic nonsenses as in every single movie of the genre as far as I know, by the way, Star Wars included.As I see it, these movies are drawing from very classical schemes and disguise them just enough to combine an exotic background and the pleasure of understanding what the hell is actually going on on the screen. Here the theme is mainly military with a marked WWII air and sea combat influence. So we get basically Pearl Harbour in space, then a few WWII dogfights \u00e0 la Star Wars episode 4 finale, then a couple of submarine and surface engagements in the pure post-war B movies tradition (the one with Richard Widmark as the submarine captain was a hoot, can't remember the title right now). One could spend hours elaborating on precisely how and why every single space scene in the movie makes no sense at all as far as science is concerned (or military tactics by the way).But what is wrong with that? For one thing it is very consistent with the extremely entertaining video games the movies originates from : same cheesy physics, let alone the horrible artificial intelligence, but nevertheless an awful lot of fun.The movie still has a story to tell. The ingredients are basic, not very original, but still efficient. The SFXs are pretty, and the actors are doing surprisingly well (with the notable and unfortunate exception of the extremely bland two lead roles, though). I especially liked Maniac and Paladin, both very consistent and entertaining. Actually I even rather liked all the military babble and overall slight overacting.The movie took the risk to tell a kind of heroic tale modeled after classical war movies rather than winking heavily at the audience with tongue-in-cheek humor. But all this is not taken too seriously either : more like a schoolyard daydreaming filmed with pretty decent pictures. That is what saves the movie in my opinion.The result is a rather cute story that may succeed in waking up the 10 years old boy dreaming of heroic deeds inside the viewer. It worked for me, at least.",

            "content": "First of all, no, Wing Commander is not a great film. It has some problems, the most notable being the very underwhelming (to say the least) portrayal of the Kilrathi. However, this is not a terrible film, and if you are a certain type of sci-fi fan, it's not just passable but genuinely enjoyable. Anyone who says that this film is horrible is being a bit more pessimistic than necessary. It may not seem like a serious film, but internally within its own structure, I find it very respectable. For its target audience, it does not totally fail.The visual design, when it works, is very interesting. The opening title sequence, in particular, is simply one of the best that you will find in any such genre film, in my opinion. A truly captivating, beautiful creation. To give another visual example, the ship interiors feel like what deep space battleships would actually be like. That may be just the sort of niche quality that suggests an appeal to video gamers and/or sci-fi enthusiasts, but it ties into this film's atmosphere, which when you factor in the mostly excellent cast and solid script, is fairly realistic feeling.There is also a rather unique, compelling mythology at work in the background of this film's story. It may not be wholly original (I detect some influence from the novel Hyperion, for example) but as far as movies go, this one has a certain quality that sets it apart. On a basic level, yes it appeals to the fascination with being a starfighter pilot in the vein of the first Star Wars film and the Wing Commander video game source material. But there is something more to it, something that is mostly untapped in sci-fi cinema.There is a great group of characters. I do not know how closely all of them tie into the games, but they feel like real people and again the cast is for the most part very good. Tcheky Karyo, Saffron Burrows, David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow. That's some real talent right there. And the presence of Hugh Quarshie can't help but lead me to note that Wing Commander is parsecs better than the Star Wars prequels in every way except for visual effects budget. The trio of fighter pilots consisting of lead Freddie Prinze Jr, Matthew Lillard and Ginny Holder play more into an \"attractive teen movie\" trope that takes away from the film just a little, but Holder and Lillard especially do a great job of generating some true emotional resonance in the heavy scenes.Problems? The Kilrathi, who should have been the frightening counterpoint to the human characters, mostly provide unseen menace and when they do make the screen, it is one of the biggest letdowns in any film. Also, some of the Rapier (starfighter) graphics are less than stellar. Those and a few other glitches are what kept this film from being solidly respectable, but they don't keep it from being a lot of fun nonetheless.I will say again that this is really one of the most unique-feeling sci- fi films that I have seen, and it fills a surprising gap in the number of similarly-themed movies about starfighter pilots. With a bigger budget and maybe a different lead actor, Wing Commander could have been something serious. As is, in spite of its flaws, it's a real gem of a genre film, and well worth checking out if you focus on the positives. Great cast, good story, interesting graphics, fuel for imagination.",

I don't know, it was an action movie, based on the game series, so if you like the games, where you hide behind asteroids to shield yourself and all that, then watch it, i certainly cannot say I hate this movie. Tcheky Karyo played very well, and Saffron Burrows was very cute, shame that they made no sequel, because games about space still come out, like for example Microsoft's Freelancer, and Wing Commander prophecy, and Secret Ops were very good and difficult games. Now back to getting a life :)",

            "content": "This film assembles one of the strangest casts of the late 1990s to play out a plot loosely based on the Wing Commander PC Game series. I have never played these games, but I was intrigued by the film for a variety of reasons, so I have now seen it a couple of times. I have to admit, I was more impressed and entertained the first time around. Sure, the film is reality-challenged, with several absurdities (misinterpretation of a black-hole, gravity problems etc), but I do not think that the film-makers were attempting to do anything as artistic as Star Wars nor anything as philosophical as Star Trek. This film, instead, fits solidly into the FUN, action-based sci-fi tradition, like Starship Troopers.The plot is pretty clich\u00e9. Freddy Prinze Jr and Matt Lillard play young hotshot fighter pilots assigned to their first deep space mission. They are being delivered by Tch\u00e9ky Karyo. As they arrive on a ship commanded by David Suchet and Jurgen Prochnow, they learn that the Sol System is about to fall under attack by Kilrathi invaders with a powerful armada. There is little time for complexity and character development as the single Confederation (earth) cruiser tries to make its way to a nearby jumpgate (basically the film's equivalent of warp ten or a \"hyperspace button\") before the Kilrathi do, fending off Kilrathi attacks the whole way. There are a couple of weakly explored love stories and a few surprises along the way concerning the identities of the characters, but there is little time for these to truly develop. So many of the characters do feel a bit one-dimensional, and the more intriguing plot points (such as \"the pilgrims\") are left unsatisfactorily explored.I think this film would have made a better miniseries than a cinematic release. Given a little more breathing room, and perhaps time to consult with astronomers or even people with a couple of higher education science courses under their belt, this could have been a really good sci fi film. The cast was certainly decent (some of the European cast-members were very good); the money was obviously there, and the script would have been fine had it not been stretched by the overly ambitious scope of the film.Bottom line: Entertaining with the help of a few drinks. Fun for action fans. Generally not recommended for the average moviewatcher.",

            "content": "This pioneer film from Chris Roberts takes the classic Computer game world of Wing Commander, and gives it a new edge that is exhilarating and inventive. Unfortunately, fans of the computer game series will find that there are changes in this movie, many of which are confusing. Like movies that are made from novels, the transition often leaves out important elements because novels extend far beyond the 90-120 minute boundary. And the PC games are no exception, spanning 5 games that each took several days if not weeks to finish.In this movie, the Kilrathi get very little screen time, and the time that they do get does nothing to represent their warrior race which is intricate and compelling as much as the Terrans (humans).  In fact, they look nothing like the Video Game's image of them. Instead, they are portrayed much like the BUGS in Starship Troopers, as emotionless and cultureless as insects, with no purpose and no agenda except to destroy.Also, the technology used in this film is far different than the game's, creating a confusing use of fighter crafts, flight gear, and much more for the video game players. There are no lasers, just mass-drivers and torpedoes. In fact, the battles felt much like they were being fought underwater instead of outer-space. In one scene, a battered ship is pushed off a platform only to have it drop like a rock, in outer space. And it was disheartening to hear the bangs and booms in outer space where there is no sound! I was hoping the filmmakers could have been more creative,\u0085the sound of panicked breathing and heartbeats over deathly silence as the battle ensues, perhaps?Another confusing transition for WC fans was the whole idea of the \u0091Pilgrim' race, which was never mentioned in the computer game series.  And the biggest, and perhaps saddest loss in transition were the beloved actors of Mark Hamill, Tom F. Wilson, and Malcolm McDowell, who breathed life into the WC world along with a superb supporting cast. Instead, their roles are filled by younger hip-hop hormonal teen idols, who not only did not know what they did last summer, but don't care.All confusions aside, this was a decent first step for the Wing Commander series onto the big screen because it sucessfully introduces the basic elements of the Wing Commander world. For anyone who liked the movie, I recommend the games, which are enthralling and deeper in character, storyline, and excitement. Well, Wing Commander IV was anyway. V was dangerously close to being as storyless as this movie. A Critique for another time",

            "content": "To be honest, as a long-time time player of the Wing Commander game, I was initially excited when I heard that a Wing Commander movie was in the works. Thanks to the game's high production values (at the time), and a very recognizable cast, it's one of those rare game series that would have always fit perfectly into movie form with little changes in design or plot line. Of course, Christ Roberts has to go and mess up a good thing, so he went out and found a younger cast (I would imagine to be more accessible to the \"young people\" who weren't really old enough to remember much about the games), completely redesigned the ships (not a good thing, for the games' designs were truly inspired for the most part, especially when compared to the WWII-inspired heaps in this film) and basically threw in a pseudo-religious subplot to muck things up a bit.In case you weren't able to gather it from above, I really wasn't expecting much of this film, and frankly, after having watched it, I'm rather pleasantly surprised. The CGI, while not up to par with what you'll see today, is quite respectable, particularly wide space combat and HUD shots (this is probably what Wing Commander would look like on the X-Box), and the acting is actually quite competent, with the possible exception of Prinze, who while not terrible, just doesn't seem cast all that well here. Tch\u00e9ky Karyo is the consumate actor as always, taking a role that could easily be taken for granted and fleshing it out quite well, while Matthew Lillard manages to be a bit less nauseating that usual, even bordering on the endearing.This isn't a film without flaws. Aside from the aforementioned ship design, which could have been better handled by simply using the game design, the Kilrathis simply look terrible. While it was obvious that the Kilrathi in the games were simply big, fuzzy catsuits, the movie versions are simply ugly, appearing to be an animatronic half-breed of the game Kilrathi and Star Trek's Klingons, with little to no facial animation aside from moving mouths and glowing eyes. It's fortunate that they're only seen a couple of times, because while they're onscreen you can't help but think that it could have been done far better.All in all, while a classic by no means, Wing Commander actually surprised me, and as far as modern sci-fi movies go (though it must be said that this is actually more of an old-fashioned war movie set in a sci-fi setting), this managed to please much more than I had expected. I give it: 7/10.",

As I watched this I wonder 'Is this REALLY Wing Commander?' I beheld crap special effects were complete and utter crud! I understand the budget situation but shows like Blake's 7 and Doctor Who did FAR better on their own shoestring budgets then this! Also the Kilrathi were hardly shown and when they were, they were unconvincing unlike tiger-like warrior species I remembered.Also the storyline was complete and total rubbish especially compared to the games and how space travel was presented in them! The ship designs were a disgrace and the Tiger's Claw didn't look like a carrier at all and the fighter craft were not very well designed and there was no light fighter or medium fighter or heavy fighter or bomber distinction that really defined the games! Because in the future that's how things will work! Because in space combat there will be fighter craft warfare as well as ship to ship battles.Also I hated the touch of how they make it like modern jet fighters taking off while its obvious in the future and in space that's totally unbelievable.Also I did not care much for the Pilgrim back-story let alone Blair being part one maybe its just me. Plus Blair and Maniac being friends from the beginning made no sense.Kevin Droney's screenplay was complete and utter rubbish in short. Also how Chris Roberts approved it let alone be part of it I don't know but I imagine he was probably embarrassed by how the movie based on the classic franchise he created turned out and I doubt he would have been happy with Prophecy either.Maybe Chris Roberts may well revive the franchise perhaps even manage to redeem himself in the respect of the Wing Commander franchise with either a movie or TV series or even a game reboot or he might give his blessings for someone else to do it, perhaps with him acting as some consultant or whatever or partner.Only time will tell.

And the human fleet is not in position to defend it. The Tiger Claw must find out what the Kilrathi plans are and delay them before they can jump into the Sol-system. Marshall and Blair, and their squadron of fighters led by Devereaux (Burrows), are central in the Tiger Claw's operations, but they are out-gunned and outnumbered by Kilrathi forces. Some non-conventional methods and tactics must be used and Blairs heritage may be a crucial part of them.A good sci-fi action with a nice sense in their battles. The myth of the story is nicely involved in the plot and the special effects are mostly good. However, there are a lot of plot holes and/or goofs (many concerning gravity or what should be the absence of gravity). The actors and actresses are good but not stellar, but Karyo however is very good as Taggart. Unfortunately, one must try to ignore all the goofs to enjoy this movie, and it is not all that easy, because there are so many of them. But in my opinion, it was very enjoyable.7/10",

            "content": "\"Wing Commander\" is based on a popular computer game series from Origin Systems. Unfortunately, this film does not match the quality of the games. The problem is simple: the film did not include the elements that made the games successful. Rather than hiring the cast featured in the games led by Mark Hamill and featuring names such as John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell, the makers of the film opted to hire a completely separate cast. Freddie Prinze Jr. was sub-par in contrast to Mark Hamill's performance as Christopher Blair in the games. The character of Todd Marshall was brash in the game series, but Matthew Lillard's performance makes the character unbearably annoying and obtuse. However, Saffron Burrows actually gives a decent performance and is the best of the three leads. The best talent was in the supporting cast, with J\u00fcrgen Prochnow as Commander Gerard, David Suchet as Captain Sansky and David Warner as Admiral Tolwyn. Tch\u00e9ky Karyo also does a decent job as James Taggart. Seeing the performances of the supporting cast was often more enjoyable than seeing the leads.The plot of the film was extremely simplistic compared to the plots in the game series. The Kilrathi (who look no where near as majestic in the game series) are underdeveloped compared to the game series and no Kilrathi characters are featured in the film. The Kilrathi don't even engage in any sort of intrigue, the extent of their activity is to move toward Earth and attack human ships.The main characters are developed, but most of their interactions seem juvenile. Another poor plot decision was the introduction of the \"Pilgrim\" subplot, where the lead character is a \"Pilgrim\", meaning he has special abilities in space navigation. It seems that the makers of the film thought that they needed to add this dimension because it would lead to drama in the film not in the game. Unfortunately, the \"Pilgrim\" subplot always seems contrived and the film would have been better simply focusing on what made the game series interesting: tactics and intrigues in the war between humans and Kilrathi.Where this film is better is in its action scenes. These are actually well-shot and some nice space combat battles were developed as would be expected from a \"Wing Commander\" film. The battles around the \"Tiger Claw\" and the Kilrathi pursuit of Blair in his fighter were actually the best parts of the film. Overall, though, this film does not match the game series it purports to emulate.",

It's a great movie overall . . . it's got everything: action, incredible special effects, a little romance, and yes, it's even got some important social issues thrown in.  The whole \"s/he never existed\" attitude after a pilot was killed was a fascinating dynamic -- you could see that it pained 'Angel' to say \"Do it for Rosie.\"  And the hatred directed toward Blair for being half-'Pilgrim' was a telling reminder that prejudice against people based on their heritage still exists today, but that it can be overcome.I would rate the movie 9 1/2 out of 10 stars.  Hopefully, Hollywood will produce more of such thought-provoking, enjoyable science fiction flicks. In the meantime, my final words on the movie are that Wing Commander rules!",

Granted it was based on a computer game in which Mark Hamil, among others, played starring roles, those obviously when the film came out minus Mark Hamil people were incredibly disappointed. Personally, which I had played the game and enjoyed it, I did not expect it to be identical to the game, and also noting that the creator of the Wing Commander franchise directed it, I at least knew that it was going to have the original creative juices flowing into it.Since Wing Commander is a space flight simulator where you fly space fighters around and shoot up Kilrathi, that is in effect was I was going to expect from this film as well, namely lots of dog fights between Kilrathi and Humans. Also the main characters from the game (and the only ones that I can remember were Paladin and Christopher Blair, though I suspect that there were a lot of others as well which I recognised from the game).The thing that I really appreciated about the film was that a lot of the craft had a very World War II feeling to them, especially the raptors, that basically looked like World War II fighter planes (without the propeller because propellers, and in fact jet engines, don't work in space). Unfortunately you don't see much of the Kilrathi, and when you do they are only briefly shown before they are gunned down, however what you do see are their ships. I guess this is because we are simply following the main characters, who are all humans, around and only being able to see what that see.As I said I liked this film, not only because it was science-fiction and had a fair share of dog fights, but also because of the way they created the setting.

The problem is, though, it seems director Chris Roberts (who directed Mark Hamill in the video games) thought he was directing a straight drama, a Star Wars epic that people would flock to so they could live in his video-game-created world.No.  Though the director was not in on the joke, and seemingly neither were the actors (except Matthew Lillard this time), everyone else who made the movie knew what was up, down to the Video Game graphics from the cockpit, and even the Klingon-lighting in the scenes with the Kilrathi (who looked like footballs on sticks dressed in leftover halloween costumes).The movie was a lot of fun, but just takes itself way too seriously.  If you promise not to, go see it in hopes that we can see a more enjoyable sequel, and they can get Mark Hamill for it.",

I say \"GET A LIFE!\"\nWing Commander is a popcorn movie, pure and simple. It's fun to watch, it doesn't require much in the way of abstract reasoning, and the special effects looked COOL!!!What I liked the most is that we didn't get a sanitized version of the future. The capital ships were cramped, with exposed plumbing much like you would see on a naval vessel in the current US fleet. The fighters had the markings of being combat worn (like some of the X-Wings in Star Wars). Most important, the way in which military protocol and tactical planning was portrayed was reasonably accurate.The biggest beef I've heard is that the fighters \"dropped\" off the deck as they took off. Next, people complained about Forbes' fighter being pushed off the deck into a pit. Everyone complains that this can't be possible because of the zero-g environment. The answer is that the artificial gravity used throughout the pressurized compartments of the ship doesn't have to end at the atmosphere barrier. The Flight deck would have to have gravity so fighters could land. And to push Forbes' fighter into a zero-g environment from the flight deck might block the incoming fighters' approach, hence the \"pit\" for crashed fighters.In some ways, this movie reminded me of Space: Above and Beyond. There was racism, malevolent aliens, and the very REAL message that people die in war zones.As far as the drop off the flight deck, it looks unrealistic but so what? This was a fun movie and a good way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you want movies with a message or realism, don't rent Science FICTION. Rent a sensitive movie like the \"Accidental Tourist.\"",

This was disappointing. The movie also takes a completely different approach to space combat: fighters look like WW2 - era planes and mothership combat is a lot like sub combat. I have no idea WHY they made these changes, but they're not really bad ones. All these changes lead to a movie that could have definetely used a more experienced cast, a deeper story, or an extra half hour of running time, but for fans of space combat movies (not that there's a lot of them, I can only think of Star Wars and Starship Troopers) like me, it's still an enjoyable movie** out of **** stars",

With that in mind, I thought that I'd have a look at this movie despite its critical mauling and low IMDb score. Whoops! Bad move. Really, really bad move.What a ghastly film. Really, truly, appallingly ghastly. This is what happens when some smart-aleck takes a little-known but rather good combat sim PC game with an involving story attached, guts it and tries to turn it into a Star Wars challenger. What adds insult to injury is that the perpetrator of this vile act is none other than Chris Roberts. Chris Roberts developed the original ground-breaking Wing Commander series of games and he has well and truly shat on his own doorstep as the writer/director of this noxious movement. Roberts has thankfully moved on to movie production now, so the \"WC\" movie must be an aberration in an otherwise stellar career.Nothing of the original drama (apart from a few character names) survives. Nothing of the original production design survives. None of the original actors from the \"WC\" game cut-scenes make it into the movie. In short, nothing of any value at all makes it into \"Wrong Commander\".Even reliable actors like Tcheky Karyo, Jurgen Prochnow and David Warner are swamped by the awfulness of this farrago. They try desperately to interact with a wooden Freddie Prinze Jr, sullen Saffron Burrowes and a talented but far-too-hysterical Matthew Lillard but to no dramatic effect. There would have been more drama and pathos in \"Wrong Commander\" if Kermit and the rest of the Muppets had taken the lead roles. Another disappointment is that the impressively tall, furry and distinctly feline Kilrathi from the game become unconvincing green-hued rubber-faced Gopher Men in the movie. Jim Henson is probably still spinning in his grave.Seriously, Mr Roberts, was it too much to expect even a tiny link in with the original game series. I'm sure that Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson, John Rhys-Davies et al would have been available for a cameo each at least. Starting again from scratch with a plot that sits uneasily between \"Star Wars\" and \"Top Gun\" was a baaaaaad move.The initials \"WC\" also stand for \"Water Closet\", another name for \"Toilet\"; and that sums this crappy film up rather well. Don't make the same mistake that I made and waste your time with this unwelcome floater.",

            "content": "First of all, let it be said that I had already seen the new Star Wars trailer on the web, so that was not a factor in my seeing this movie.I went in just wanting to see spaceships and special effects, and was surprised that this was an actual film with a few (very few, but a few) ideas. The idea is to reimagine WWII submarine combat (they even have the captain from Das Boot, an obvious influence, in the cast) and WWII fighter dogfights. It was kind of cute... especially the torpedoes.My favorite part, and the most clever part, was the opening credits, in which we start with a map of our solar system, as radio broadcasts talk about our exploration of space. As we continue to explore, the map begins to fill in with new stars and systems, until we end up where the action is supposed to take place.If you want to see special effects, this film is pretty good. It's like Lost in Space as you get a whole lot of bargain-basement effects. It's also like Lost in Space because this film directly rips off two distinctive effects from that film.The worst part of this film is the young members of the cast. It's like watching kids trying to take on adult roles. Freddie Prinze jr is okay-- just too young. His blond friend is THE MOST IRRITATING PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE. Their \"Wing Commander\" is like Helena Bonham Carter's pouty younger sister. There's lots of claptrap about honor and loyalty and \"the gift\" (that's \"the gift\" not \"the force\").

For all its gore and splashy special effects, at least it could claim it had a brain behind it somewhere. \"Wing Commander\" is much more straightforward. The evil Clumsy Cat-Aliens are attacking humanity, and it's up to Freddie Prinze Jr and his buddy Matthew Lillard to kill 'em all.Nevermind that the premise and background are thinner than paper. Do we know anything about the two races? No. The humans are just as vague as the Clumsy Cat-Aliens. Do we know why they're fighting? Of course not. We're just meant to assume that one side is evil, I guess.The point is the action, right? So long as stuff blows up at a satisfying rate, everything will be okay. That's the trouble: the space-battle scenes are filmed in the dark with all the excitement of a video game (one played by someone else, that is). The bad guys pose no threat whatsoever, and when our hero finally fights them face to face, they promptly fall over as if they can't be bothered to put up a fight.Everything about this movie is stupid and generic and kind of boring. Costumes appear to have been borrowed from the Warsaw Pact, and the little space-fighters look suspiciously like vintage MiGs; the larger spaceships all look more or less the same, like hybrids of aircraft carriers and submarines, barely visible in the depths of space. In the movie's favor, it's got a great cast of European character actors: Tcheky Karyo, David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow, and David Suchet. Maybe if they'd dumped the American leads they could have had a B-movie that wasn't so offensively dumb.",

            "content": "Wing Commander is ultimately let down by some bad casting and a weak third act. Prinze was a rotten choice for Blair, undoubtedly selected to give the film more attraction to a younger target audience, but his inclusion feels like the film is trying too hard to project to that particular audience. With such a fine supporting cast (Karyo, Prochnow, Warner) it's a shame the leads are a real let down.Unfortunately the plot is clich\u00e9-city with some poorly drawn characters (Maniac, Vagabond, Hobbes, Flash and Hawk were a far more interesting bunch in the games), but I feel this can be forgiven to an extent given the film's attempt to mesh more with classic war films than contemporary sci-fi. Of course, the film hardly accomplishes this, but again, with little other than Picard's continued adventures and the awful Star Wars prequels to compare with, Wing Commander at least deserves a little credit for trying. The film also feels like its struggling to find a satisfying conclusion. Obviously with the tight budget there's no room for a sequence par the climactic battles of Return of the Jedi, but even so the film needed a much tighter and more satisfying third act. As it stands, the final 40 minutes feel like sand bagging to hold the weak ending off for as long as possible.The more cost effective advent of computer generated graphics has seen a shift in space stories to the arena of television productions (Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1, Space Above & Beyond, Galactica, DS9 & Voyager), so it is at least nice to see a space story on the cinema screen outside of regurgitated Trek offerings. The effects are quite reasonable and the battles entertaining, again taking a lot of WWII influences such as the torpedo battle between the Tiger Claw carrier and its opponent at the film's climax.Yes, it's a weak, poorly acted story, but there are some interesting visual elements to the film; the costume and production design are superb and there's a reasonable amount of energy and tension in the battle sequences. I like that Wing Commander tries to create its own unique style of sci-fi universe. A few decent performances from the elder statesmen of the cast boost its credibility a little, and ultimately while the ingredients are all a little below average there's enough of interest to make the film entertaining and worth some more praise than it's earned.6 stars.",

But the special effects and the sound are good. I also liked the dialogues with Rosie Forbes. They were cool and convincing. In my opinion, this movie should have become a mini series with more room for characters like Rosie and even Commander Gerald whose attitude and thoughts I never really understood, especially in the latter half of the movie. But for an audience of video gamers this is probably less important. So, I go with a 6/10.",

            "content": "Being a die hard fan of the video game series, I felt more than compelled to write a review of this movie.First off, when I first heard there was to be a Wing Commander movie, I got very excited.  Chris Roberts did an excellent job with his dramatic cut scenes in the last three PC game installments, but he lacks that same flair in the movie version.Now, I saw this in the theaters, and I must say I was very disappointed. But then again, I suppose my expectations were absurdly high given to the reality with action movies nowadays.  The special effects were okay, not impressive, and the fight scenes were few and far between.  I despise Freddie Prinze Jr. but he did a better than average job as the young Lt. Blair.  Saffron Burrows and Tcheky Karyo save this film with their style and panache.  Karyo especially pulls off a very convincing Paladin who serves as a mentor and father figure to Blair.  Everyone else was, well there...Okay, now that that's said and done, I have to say one thing.  Matthew Lillard did the worst acting job I have ever seen as Maniac, a character who is monumental to the comic relief and pure adrenaline element to the movie.  I don't see why so many people keep saying how good a job he did, I'm not saying Biff from Back to the Future did an incredible job in the video game series, but at least his character was flamboyant and very likeable.Like The Phantom Menace, this is one that fans of the series have to see, though, perhaps reluctantly due to the bad reviews.  Overall, though, yes, it has a predictable plot, yes it has more than a fair share of bad acting, yes it has aliens that look like the crack of my...well, you know...but the movie, if you put all of the critque aside isn't that bad.  I still watch it when it comes on tv every now and then, and even though I cringe at some of the horribly shot scenes, I still enjoy it for what it is. 5/10.",

Yes, this isn't the best (or worst) science fiction film ever made, but it's fun. It calls upon a history of second war film traditions, particularly aircraft carrier and submarine adventures, to create a recognizable vision of a future. Does it matter what year it is set in? No. Is it credible that a spacecraft can jump across the light-years through a pulsar? I don't know (neither did Einstein).

Although we all know that running silent in space wouldn't mean not talking, the hush of the crew adds tension, just as it would in a submarine movie.

            "content": "I wish the producers/director of this film geared it more towards the fans of the games rather than moviegoers in general.  In failing to do so, they disappointed both.I was in high school when the Wing Commander computer games came out. They were an instant favorite of myself and my best friend.  We'd spend countless hours playing and following the storyline.  The games were like nothing we'd ever seen before - graphics, gameplay, sound effects were miles ahead of anything else at the time (on the original game, there was actually a sticker on the box that assured you that the picture on the front was an actual screenshot and not an artist's conception).  Every sequel was better and better, introducing digitized speech, better graphics and effects, and (perhaps most importantly for this article) a richer storyline.My favorite part of the game was the storyline, because it really assigned a purpose to your missions throughout the game.  Without the story, the game would be just another dumb shoot-em-up game, and I'd grow tired of all the graphics and effects.  The story gave me a real reason for completing the missions.  By the time Wing Commander II and its secret missions came out, my friend and I would tell each other that there was easily enough material for a movie, but we never expected to actually see one.Fast forward to 1999, haven't played Wing Commander for quite some time, I've been out of college for two years, I have a \"real job\", and I see a trailer for the movie.  I immediately call my old friend, and we make plans to see it.  We're both not expecting it to be good, we read a lot of bad press about it, but we are drawn to see it anyway, hoping that we'd be able to appreciate some similarities between the film and the game that we loved so much.But there were essentially none.  No similarities at all, except for names. They used the names of some of the Wing Commander characters, the bad guys were called Kilrathi, the home ship was called the Tiger's Claw, and that's it.  That is quite literally where the similarities end.\nThe ships didn't even bear the slightest resemblance to those in the game. I wasn't looking for an exact match, but this was a disgrace.  The fighters were so cool looking in the game, and so dumb looking in the film.  The movie's \"Rapier\" (the only one of four fighters available in the game to appear in the film) looked like they stuck a huge bundle of cigars into a tin can, and crammed it into an old MiG-15's nose, then cut off most of the wings and tail and attached tin cans for engines.  The bridge in the Tiger's Claw looked like a dim room full of old microwave ovens dressed up to look like computer terminals.  And the Kilrathi (for the two seconds that you actually see them) didn't even look cat-like.  They looked like mutated wart-hog muppets.They didn't even get the command structure of the ship right or any pilot-pilot relations.  First off, your character (he wasn't called Blair till WC3, in the first two you actually enter your own name, but we have to name him something)was NOT Maniac's best buddy, nor were they the same age. Blair was much older.  Second, where the hell was Colonel Halcyon?  He was my favorite character, and was erased for this movie.  Halcyon was the real commander of the Tiger's Claw; Angel was just another pilot, NOT a commanding officer.  She didn't assume any command at all until WC2 (set ten years after the demise of the Tiger's Claw), when she was in charge of a ship called the Concordia.  And finally, Tolwyn didn't appear till WC2 (Ten years later) either.I can go on and on even more, but my point is that I wasn't expecting an exact match, I was just expecting some match.  This movie wasn't even close. The game contained a great story that would have made a good baseline for a movie, but instead of using that material, Chris Roberts decided to throw the whole thing down the crapper and start from scratch, concocting a stupid story filled with holes, and populating it was lousy acting, amateurish dialogue, and just plain dumb-looking spaceships.This movie made me come to the realization that the original Wing Commander games ARE the movie; That's as good as it gets.  And incidentally, starting with WC3, the games actually have better and more well-known actors than the film did.",

Director Chris Roberts didn't manage to capture the essence of the games, and the movie turned out to be a shallow experience and poor movie in general.The story in \"Wing Commander\" was adequate, albeit not super thrilling.

And not even with talents such as David Warner and J\u00fcrgen Prochnow making appearances were director Chris Roberts able to salvage this movie.The fans of the game franchise will remember the Kilrathi as being menacing feline humanoids, but they are presented as something that resembles an over-sized gerbil in the movie, and do not really look like the feline creatures that were in the games. And that feature was really a hard pill to swallow and it really sent a low blow to the movie.If you were fan of the games, then stay well clear of the movie, because it is nowhere near to having captured the spirit and heart of the game franchise.

            "content": "Okay, good news and bad news. The good news is that \"Wing Commander\" is not as rock bottom awful as \"Armageddon\" or \"Starship Troopers.\" The bad news: it's not by much. Movies based on video games tend not be examples of high art, but I wasn't expecting \"Wing Commander\" to be such a soul-killing experience.The plot (what little of it there was anyway) was dull. The CGI effects were obvious and cheesy. The inside of the ship looked more like a high-tech basement. The space battles were dull and unexciting. The characters were so flat and lifeless that all attempts at sentimentality failed miserably. When you never care about whether these characters live or die, it's somewhat difficult to muster up any sorrow when one of them does bite the dust.\nI hesitate to call these people \"actors\" because that would be  a major insult to all the talented, hard-working men and women who make up the acting profession. The only genuine acting talent in this film was David Warner. Whatever Warner's reason for doing this movie was, I hope it wasn't because he liked the script! It's real sad that the computer game that spawned this film actually had a better cast than the movie! The computer game had Mark Hammill (who has an uncredited cameo as the voice of Merlin, the ship's computer), John Rys-Davies and Malcom McDowell. The movie has those two guys from \"She's All That\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Go figure!The Kilrathi only show up in a few brief shots in the entire 100 minutes of this movie. As a result, we only see a bunch of enemy spaceships with faceless pilots that pose as a threat. And when they finally do make an appearance, they just look like cheap puppets! One especially laughable scene is when the ship's captain hushes the crew up because he hears a Kilrathi ship above them. I don't mean to nitpick, but isn't it impossible for sound to travel in space since there's no oxygen?After finding out that this movie had a $30 million budget, I had to wonder exactly where all that money went? They certainly didn't spend it on special effects, set designs or good actors. \"Wing Commander\" would barely even qualify as a Sci-Fi Channel original movie! They might as well have released this turkey straight to video. I haven't played the computer game that this movie was based on, but it has to be more entertaining than the film itself! It's too bad MST3K is no longer on the air. Now there's no way of making this garbage entertaining.",

There have been other attempts at turning a popular game into a movie (mortal combat) and I wish that the movie industry did not do that.I have to be honest and say that the main reason that I went to this movie was to see the Star Wars trailer but I was expecting something resembling a mediocre movie from WC. What I saw instead is very poor dialogue full of cliches and some annoying plot flow. The plot made very little sense. How can the technology in 2625 be marginally more advanced than present technology? Am I the only one to notice the uncanny resemblance of the fighters landing similar to our present day fighter jets landing on an air craft carrier? Creativity is almost none existent. What you see instead is imitations of WWI aircraft, space vehicles that look amazingly like submarines and aliens that look like Power Ranger characters. They should feel embarrassed to show this movie after the SW trailer. If this movie even does remotely well, it will be due to the trailer. I do have to say that I was impressed with the performance of Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as \"Paladin\". He was one of the few bright spots of the movie.For anyone who is thinking of seeing this movie, you better be a big WC fan or else wait for it to come out on TV. It's not worth the money to rent.",

            "content": "In the distant future, humanity is threatened by enemy aliens called the Kilrathi who have stolen a device that allows them to travel through worm holes in space, allowing them the chance launch a deadly surprise attack on planet Earth any time soon. A fighter squadron are the last hope. Two young bucks called Maverick and Maniac, along with female wing commander Angel lead the fight-back.Wing Commander is one of that unloved subset of movies that was based around a video game. I think it's only fair to say that this has rarely proved to be a winning idea. I personally haven't even heard of the game Wing Commander but suspect that it had little in the way of narrative impetus for a movie plot-line to easily be constructed around. In effect, this feels like a space adventure based around the plot of an old World War II fighter pilot yarn. It has the clich\u00e9d characters and basic idea that could just as easily be used for a film of that type. This one is typical of many sci-fi space adventures of the late 90's in that it is completely bland with workmanlike special effects and almost nothing to differentiate it from the crowd. The action scenes are quite tedious to be honest and the screenplay is highly mediocre. The film is not helped very much by having Freddie Prinze Jr and Matthew Lillard star as the two central heroes; they seriously fail to convince in these roles and are far too light-weight. There is a decent international cast of respected actors in many of the periphery roles but each and every one of the parts they play are what I would term 'exposition characters', i.e. people who turn up to say something bland but plot-forwarding (sort of like actors in a TV hospital soap opera). Finally, we have very poorly defined and ridiculous looking aliens (who look like comedy cats). They are hardly on screen at all in any case, so much so that it is hard really caring much about them.I wouldn't say this film is really terrible exactly but it is an extremely underwhelming experience. You really need to be a fairly forgiving sci-fi nut to get too much out of this one I reckon.",

The only reason I'm not giving this a lower score is because I'm not a fan of the series. This must have hit a lot harder with those poor guys. The movie tells the story about people in space fighting aliens and that's about it. It was directed by Chris Roberts which changed a lot from the game even though Chris Roberts MADE the game.The worst character is this Maniac guy as he's so obnoxious and probably has the worst acting of anyone there. It's mostly just nothing but people sitting around and talking and even the battle scenes are incredibly dull. It doesn't help that the CGI looks fake. I wasn't able to follow the plot well simply because I was so uninvested I didn't really try. From what I heard, when Chris Roberts first saw the finished film, he actually CRIED.

Its plot was not very original and the acting was pretty good, however, some things were just out of place. For example, when the marines entered a Kilrathi ship, it wasn't just marines, it was the pilots, the main characters, who went into it. Now what kind of commander would choose pilots over marines for such a mission? Secondly, I kept getting this impression of WWI/WWII in space. The ships fired bullets. Bullets fired from gatling guns in space! This was very annoying to watch, simply because of its physical improbability (the bullet would slow down and come to a dead standstill unless it had a propulsion device of its own) and the fact that lasers, in my opinion, look cooler. Skipping to another scene, their ship is damaged and they hide it in a cave or a crater or something in a planet. The alien ship comes down and drops bombs on the planet. Meanwhile everyone on the ship is completely silent, and I think someone says \"shhh\" while- you guessed it, the 'ping, ping, ping' of submarine radar goes off in the background. U-Boats, depth charges, in space? The last thing I want to point out is when a ship crashes on the landing strip which is out in space, a bulldozer drives up to it and pushes it off. It falls off the platform and down into space. A little problem, considering gravity doesn't exist in space. Overall, it was fun to watch, but I wouldn't want to see it again.",

The plot is straightforward; we're dropped in the action quickly with no question about how much is at stake, and while there's not much mental exercise involved, the film is a fun ride. What's more, the dialogue is good - not just functional, but *good*. That's not a common occurrence in action films.The ride is made better by our protagonists, not least because the film is full of relative unknowns. Lillard is obviously having a good time, and it's hard not to like him, while Burrows and Prinze are a nicely understated couple, with none of the usual overt chemistry. Ginny Holder as Rosie steals all her scenes, and the quietly spoken Warner (Tolwyn) and Karyo (Taggart) have great presence on their respective bridges.After watching the film, I realised with some surprise that I liked it. Having occasionally played the games - though hardly having followed the storyline - I like what they've done.There was a mission, people died, ships blew up, the good guys saved the day and I cared that the characters made it through to the end.

To be perfectly honest, I attended the screening to see the preview for the new Star Wars movie, and I can honestly say it would have been more worth the money if I had left before the movie began. I equate this film to last years worst, Godzilla, in that both were billed as 'action' films and both bored me to the brink of suicide(or at least self-mutilation).  I was actually amazed that space-battle scenes could be so unenchanting.  I defy anyone to locate a scene that is worth watching at all.  When the movie finally ended(and thank god it did), I felt as if we were just nearing the point when something was actually going to happen; this is because there was no build up, little to no character development, and not even a hint of a climax, not to mention the 'ending' had absolutely nothing to do with any of the previous 89 minutes.  I challenge anyone to take this same basic subject matter and make a less interesting movie.  In addition, the script writer decided to steal from the Star Wars movies and slip it in with the hopes that no one would notice: Paladin=Obi Wan, Freddy Prinze=Luke, the Pilgrim mental ability=the Force, Merlin(the A.I. flight assistant)=the radar gizmo on Luke's X-Wing, and the final hyper-space-jumper-thing=the Death Star.  I'm surprised no one broke out a 'light sword,' 'millenium eagle,' or an 'R3-D3 droid.'  And on top of all of this, the movie was full of plot holes and shortcomings, i.e. the bad-guys are horrible fighters, the Pilgrims were able to 'evolve' significantly over a period of 500 years, the weapon of choice is still a machine-gun, the bad-guys leave their prized war possession guarded by about five morons without any real weapons, there's a giant gravity-well right next to the earth, and music has evolved almost not at all over half a millenium.

And unlike most games, the Wing Commander series actually has well-defined characters and a logical and sequential (if episodic) plot, so the idea of a film treatment of it didn't strike me as instantly absurd (as opposed to, say, Super Mario Brothers). In any case, I was sadly mistaken; my experience with the games only made me dislike the movie more than I would have otherwise.  Indeed, if I had checked out the IMDB before renting WING COMMANDER, I would have realized that many of the blistering reviews came from fans of the games.On to the plot.  Humanity is at war with a xenophobic alien species called the Kilrathi, who have taken advantage of unbelievable human negligence to seize secret navigation data that will enable their fleet to attack Earth two hours before the human fleet can arrive.  This is used as a backdrop for a pair of rookie fighter pilots, Blair and Marshall, to join the only Earth fighter carrier that can intercept the Kilrathi fleet.  What follows is a weak mixture of TOP GUN type air fighter concepts with THE ENEMY BELOW type submarine concepts, with sincere but hokey attempts to generate pathos.The actors are really pretty good, but the casting is utterly bizarre. Saffron Burrows, with her prominent British accent, is cast as Wing Commander Jeanette Devereaux, a character who is supposed to be as French as her name sounds.  She spends most of the movie wondering why nobody ever follows her orders; the reason is obvious, for she never punishes those who disobey her, despite the fact that naval officers in this universe apparently have the right to summarily execute their subordinates (?!). Tcheky Karyo, a native-born Turk whose voice sounds oddly similar to the beautiful Teutonic tones of Maximilian Schell, is cast as James \"Paladin\" Taggart of all people.  Taggart has a deep dark secret that is so obvious that it might as well be tattooed on his forehead, yet nobody ever guesses it.  The deeper secret is, why is a Turk being cast as a Scot?  David Suchet, always delightful to watch, makes a pretty good captain; why does he end up in crap like this?As for the two leads, the less said the better.  Matt Lillard appears to be trying, in his role as Marshall, but his character is immensely annoying. He isn't even physically attractive, but the script demands that he attract a girlfriend instantly.  Freddy Prinze Jr., the weakest actor in the bunch, is naturally cast in the pivotal role of Blair.  He is outrageously fake in this character, although it is questionable whether anybody could have done well with Blair's non-sequitur dialogue.Recent movies have a deadly tendency to undermine their dialogue with explanatory sentences that are obviously aimed at the audience rather than at the characters (like Anakin Skywalker yelling \"You did it, R2!\").  WING COMMANDER must set some kind of record for fake dialogue of this type, e.g. \"We made it!\" - \"They're following the decoy!\" - \"The Kilrathi ships are coming through one at a time!\"  This lack of confidence in the audience's ability to pay attention to what they are seeing is insulting.WING COMMANDER has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a major motion picture; since Peter Davies has plenty of experience, I'm at a loss to explain it.  It's almost like he wanted to sabotage the movie.  Long blackouts appear between many of the scenes, forcibly reminding the viewer that it's only a movie.  Admiral Tolwyn's name appears misspelled several times.  Laughable disregard for physics is everywhere.  I can forgive the old canard about the hole in the hull sucking large objects out, a mistake many movies make.  But hushing the bridge of the carrier so the enemy won't hear you belongs in a submarine movie, not in the vacuum of space.  And a \"dramatic\" moment is utterly spoiled when a wrecked fighter is pushed off the carrier flight deck by a bulldozer - and promptly falls off in a downward direction in the middle of deep space!Although these are not all the flaws, I'm making the movie sound worse than it is.  Except for Prinze, the acting is of very good quality, and the script's artificiality and illogic are no worse than average for Hollywood. The real disappointment is that most Hollywood movies are slick and well-produced no matter how lacking they may be in content, while this one is sloppy in its production values as well as in its story.Rating: *1/2 out of ****.",

            "content": "A sci-fi enthusiast could write an entire term paper on the literary and cinematic influences that went into WING COMMANDER. Best considered as what the TV series SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND could have been with a bigger budget and more polish, this movie also draws heavily from classic war movies involving not only air and surface naval warfare, but also submarines. In comparison with other B-grade space operas, WING COMMANDER shines with a quite a bit more intelligence. Drawing from docudrama-type war films, like SINK THE BISMARCK, much time is devoted to command personnel poring over navigational charts and plotting strategies within the specific constraints of hyperspace-jump travel. The script is more faithful to real astronomy than most, although boners do persist, most notably in the depiction of quasars as relatively small, local phenomena, when in fact they are extremely distant, extremely old, galaxy-sized objects.The casting and characters borrow not only from SPACE: A & B, but also TOP GUN; Freddy Prinze, Jr's, protagonist is even nicknamed \"Maverick.\" There is no \"girl back home,\" though, so the romantic interests remain confined to shipboard military personnel. The most challenging task falls to Saffron Burrows, who is called on to develop from an icy, no-nonsense wing commander to feminine love interest, and she pulls it off nicely.The special effects are generally good. Excellent space warfare scenes must be set off a little by sub-par alien creatures, and sometimes it is difficult to follow the combat action. The F/X work would probably be best appreciated on repeat viewings.",

Needless to say, all those critics were on to something.  Expecting the worse, I feel no harm was done to me by this film's simple badness.  Unlike \"The Corruptor\", \"Commander\" is a sharply made piece of junk.  It makes no sense, but then again it doesn't try to provide a backstory.  \"Corruptor\" was just all over the place and didn't care who was watching.  Inconsistencies are abounds, and the performances are very suspect.  The largely Euro-trash cast is a curiosity to say the least.  I would suspect this has to do with the film's foreign financing, but bad actors like Jurgen Prochnow, David Warner, Tcheky Karyo, and the ridiculously monotone Saffron Burrows neatly ruin things for the rest of the decent actors.  And the less said about Matthew Lillard, the better.  Like I said before, \"Commander\" goes for a long stretches without trying to be comprehensible. The film is based on a video game, but that is no excuse.  They should have made the film for the 99% of us who have never played it.  Only David Arnold's rousing main theme is the one thing I can recommend about this mess, and he had the sense to jump ship and let some one else do the rest of the score.  Well, I guess \"Episode 1\" will school 'em in May about the right way to do a space saga.-------------- 1",

The cast is as good as it gets, Prochnow, Karyo, Suchet and Warner are normally excellent (or better!) but somehow here they don't seem to work, Suchet and Prochnow especially seem uncomfortable trying to inject high drama contrary to their normal low key acting styles. I can only assume that it's the plot or dialogue, yet I really can't say exactly what it is that's \"wrong\" about either. It has a slightly schizophrenic feel to it, some scenes and dialogue were very convincing, others very poor. Trying to mix classic space opera with a \"young hero\" type movie and then adding in a romance really messes up any consistent plot.Certainly the look and feel of the movie are excellent, detail seems well thought out, the things that needed explaining are explained, those that don't aren't dwelt on. The sets look used and worn, the interior of the ship has the same \"plumbing\" you see on wet navy warships and while we'll probably have to wait 3-4 hundred years to find out whether this is remotely close to \"reality\", it certainly suspended my disbelief. True the CGI wasn't the best we've come to expect but it was good enough for me.It probably helps that I'm a sucker for any film set in the future where every nation and race seems to be represented, as a Brit I even liked the tiny detail that some characters used the Brit pronunciation of \"Lieutenant\", others didn't.I'm not much impressed by the unfavourable comparisons to the video game, I've not played it, don't want to and don't care how good it is / was. This is a movie. That said I really think that all the obvious effort was wasted on a poor plot, possibly trying to keep to some existing story line in the game? (Using pilots to make a commando raid seems a little odd!) As such it's really only an average movie and at that probably only enjoyable to SF fans looking for an all night SF DVD fest.A pity, it bodes poorly for any possible future SF films such as the much desired \"Honor Harrington\".

The plot covered the events of only the first game (if they expected the audience to look forward to a sequel, they should have tried much harder), the story is full of holes and scientific inaccuracies of the greatest magnitude, the actors are worse than those in the game and it is evident that the creators of the film simply copied cliches from war movies in order to make their own (you get all kinds of anachronistic deja vus: a depth charge attack - in deep space!, a destroyed starfighter being pushed off the deck of a carrier - in zero gravity, etc.).

The story is not bad, certainly a little better than standard Hollywood fare, and there is a lot of attention to detail in the sets and especially the dogfight fx, that people who have played the games will instantly recognise and appreciate.Unfortunately there are also many bad points to be made. The dialogue and acting is very bad. The story, while mildly interesting, completely ignores the storyline as told in the games. But possibly the most annoying feature, was Robert's representation of the Kilrathi. He must have been running out of money by the time he reached those scenes (and there are only a few), because instead of the Kilrathi as they should be, majestic and brutal catpeople, they are portrayed more as rubber faced ghouls hidden in green fog. Most disappointing.If you've played the games, this movie is worth a view even if just for the nostalgia trip and because many of the scenes actually feel like they are right out of the games (whether this is a good or bad thing I'm not sure ;).

Even the spaceships looked like submarines from World War 2, and what was the deal with those hideous hats? If they bothered to use Freddie Prinze Jr, in order to obviously attract all those 13-14 year old girls, then why did they make him wear that hat that made him look like a frog, to say the least?(A friend suggested that this could be a conspiracy to ruin Freddie's career!!!). AND WHAT ABOUT THE ALIENS? I agree with another user's comment who said that they probably had not planned for the aliens to actually appear on screen but then changed their minds the last minute.

If the acting in Wing Commander would have been more exaggerated it could as well have been fun, but it didn't bother me very much the way it was because I wasn't expecting Oscar-worthy acting anyway.Ah, I finally remember something that was actually good: the special effects, somewhat PC-game style, but that's not surprising since the film is based on a computer game. The action sequences were pretty intense too.So if you can overlook the estimated 117 weaknesses of this movie you might even enjoy it for its action and special effects.My rating: 4/10",

But can he save the day?Wing Commander is yet another movie version of a computer game & even by their relatively low standards its a stinker! The plot - such as it is - is strictly by the numbers, it may work in a computer game but is so derivative & uninspiring that it borders on the inane. Also the film totally excludes viewers who have not played the game. All this talk of Pilgrims & Kilrathi is never fully explained. Maybe the makers didn't care, knowing that the only people interested in this would be gamers.The acting is poor from all concerned, even some of the better actors such as David Warner & Jurgen Prochnow struggle with inane dialogue whilst walking around cardboard sets (why did they agree to be in this film?) Freddie Prince Junior is as reliable as ever adding another award winning performance to his list. He really is one of the worst actors around but is consistent if nothing else. His style is less realistic then many computer game characters! He is perfectly matched with Saffron Burrows who also gives a performance of superb woodenness.The FX are poor, again reminiscent of a video game rather than a Hollywood movie. The space ships & battles are notable for their lack of imagination & excitement. The aliens who are wisely short on screen time are pretty laughable. You have to keep reminding yourself that this was made in 1999!The worst crime of this film though isn't the bad acting, script, FX & directing but the shear dullness of it all. It doesn't inspire any sense of excitement or tension in the viewer from its opening voice-over prologue to a flat climax.Overall a movie that is not just badly made but pointless. Nobody cares about the plight of the cardboard characters running around cardboard sets - by nobody I mean the cast, crew, & writer/director considering the total lack of effort on everyones part! If this mess of a movie is a reflection of the game then I'm glad I've never played it! One for Battlefield Earth fans only!",

            "content": "I was introduced to the wing commander saga through the Super Nintendo game of the same name. When I heard about the movie, I was excited because I thought the universe was interesting and loved the game.However, this movie is a sad, sad waste of film and time. To address some of the technical issues, here is a small list of the many flaws:1) Sonar in space! What were they thinking? Did they even take a single physics class in high school? Sonar works off the principal of a medium providing a transport for some sort of energy (usually a sound, hence the 'PING' noise in subs and the movie). However, space has no medium where this would work, even oxygen isn't a suitable medium, hence the use of it underwater. It is made extremely clear in the movie that it is sonar being used. 2) The ship falls off the end of the runway when pushed off. Sorry, there is no gravity in space, the ship would simply float forward. It was made clear that the gravity/atmosphere of the main ship did not extend to the flight deck.3) The pilgrims sensitivity to black holes. The idea that a human would be able to detect something instruments couldn't is ridiculous.You may ask why this nitpicking is important. Several reasons, credibility and the simple respect to do some research or even consult a science professional.Critique of the movie itself. There is minimal character development. There is also little plot. No twists, no turns. This movie is a sci-fi movie, meaning, science-fiction. The movie blatantly ignores the science aspect, and is pretty week on the fiction part too. This was a showcase for special effects and that is it. While those are good, it certainly wasn't anything to make a movie about. The games themselves were largely ignored, where was sonar? When I played, we had radar, the nautical themes were not to heavy, and it didn't have a plot other than 'go kill the cats'. The movie seemed to be like a non-interactive version of the game.If you want good sci-fi, go see Contact, The Andromeda Strain, 2001, Sphere, and many others. If you want good action, go see the Matrix,Armagedon, or one of the millions of other movies. This movie failed on all aspects. For all the game fans out there, you need to realize that because the games are good, it isn't some insult to them if the movie is a load of cat crap.",

Much of the premise and cultural setting reminded me of the original Battlestar Galactica.

Roberts is a good director, and even though I kinda hate Prinze Jr., I thought the performances were okay (especially Holder and Lillard) and for 26 mill I think the fx were either nice or forgivable, but what this flick really needed was a good script. Boy, you'd think 500 years in the future we'd find more alien life than big dumb cats and make better weapons than conventional machine guns. The ships have energy weapons, why not the hand-guns? But that's not all.This was basically a submarine movie. The ship sets looked so stupid as backdrops for a starship, and why does the Kilrathi ship look so dark inside? Are they testing the assumption that cats can see in the dark? But they move so stiff and slow it really doesn't matter. And when there is 1 friendly fighter up against what could only be compared to a Star Destroyer, there just happens to be a black hole the enemy ship gets sucked into but the fighter escapes (like they couldn't see the damn thing out the window) or how a satilie dish has shielding (something not as important) but battle-ready fighters don't. But the writers didn't care about the facts or logic. Just to make a sci-fi movie, based on something people know, for 26 mill and try to profit.This film robbed me of an hour and 40 minutes of my life, something I can never get back again.

At any rate, if anyone sees this movie and has NOT played the games, please don't be harsh.  The movie was surprisingly close to the game in most areas.  Granted the technology was greater in the game, but you can do more with that format.  All in all this was a good movie with a very strong story, albeit subpar acting at times, but good nonetheless.

I challenge anyone to create a completely originally idea. It is almost impossible to do so. Yet many of us ask this impossibility from the filmmaker.I have read the complaint that this movie borrowed from movies in the 50's, but I say the movie was made in 1999 and if you are going to use a movie clich\u00e9 why not one from a classic war movie. I enjoyed this movie! There is good storytelling in `Wing Commander'. For its time and money spent on its production the end product is far better than any movie in its genre has been in years. I have read that the production quality has been a sore spot with many reviewers. \"The spacecraft look like WWII propeller planes instead of the wonderful crafted fighters and there wasn't enough dog fighting either.\" This was NOT a SCI/FI movie of star wars proportions and corners were cut. Still I believe any of the rough edges of this film can easily be explained away. In one debated scene the commander orders the bridge of the carrier `Tiger Claw' to be quiet. Someone might think the crew is ludicrous to do so because the `Tiger Claw' is in the vacuum of space and the enemy sonar will not work - but this at best implied and who says the enemy is using sonar anyhow; or many the commander wants everyone quiet so he can think.Bottom line: Wing Commander is family style space-time-fun that any true fan of the genre would be happy to have as a low budget benchmark in cinema history.",

That this film was ever produced in the first place is astounding: it is based on a series of flight-simulator computer games, and even directed by the man who created those games; at times watching the movie is like watching over someone else's shoulder as they play a video game. It features an outstanding cast of European character actors: Tcheky Karyo, Jurgen Prochnow, David Suchet, Hugh Quarshie, and David Warner. Along for the ride are two bright young stars of the late-90's, Matthew Lillard and Freddie Prinze, Jr, and seldom has there been a pair of actors so misplaced.The movie sets its cast adrift in a banal script about the conflict between a generically futuristic human military and a race of anonymously aggressive aliens. Neither side of this conflict receives any sort of background, but the humans are dressed up like Soviet sailors and fly space fighter-jets that look like MiG-21's, so we can safely assume that they represent the eventual victory of Marxism-Leninism over the decadence of Western Capitalism. The aliens look like armored cats, perhaps symbolic of Wall Street \"fat cats\". These deceitful petty-bourgeoisie kick off the plot by attacking a human base, much as the imperialist Japanese did in 1941.What follows is a remake of the 1944 wartime propaganda film \"Wing and a Prayer\", as the heroes' spaceship fights its way across enemy space to bring vital information to the human space-navy in time for the space-battle of Midway. Meanwhile Lillard and Prinze Jr. engage in a forgettable human-interest story aboard the ship, romancing fellows pilots Ginnie Holder and Saffron Burrows (both of whom are better actors and more sympathetic characters), and combating the inexplicable prejudice of executive officer Prochnow and others, none of which adds up to much. Lillard and Prinze spit out their dialogue as if they might choke on it otherwise; Lillard's rubbery features and Prinze's blank face provide an interesting contrast that helpfully distracts from their lack of talent.I won't spoil the movie by telling you the good guys win in the end. It's obviously that kind of movie, and the outcome preordained, even though the film never presents its audience with a reason to care. The setting is vague, the action obscure, the characters walking clich\u00e9s; the only thing passing for entertainment value is the enthusiastic performances offered by the supporting cast.

Yes, he's stolen liberally from the sci-fi Cannon, and even Das Boot, for the design and direction but, strangely, it works.The space-ships feel cramped and submarine like (as they would in reality) and the computers and holographic displays manage to look functional and funky as opposed to cheap and tacky. Even the obviously cheap explosions are effectively done. And one of the final battle scenes, which harks back to the days of Nelson and Napoleon's sea battles, is just unspired.Another nice touch is the style of the humans space-ships, which bear more than a passing resemblance to the British Spitfires (they even fire bullets!) which fought off the Nazi's in the Second World War.Overall, Wing Commander is a very pleasant and amusing surprise, and even had me cheering on the sofa.

Even if you are new to the game, the game will give you a lot of background. This is what the film lacked. Saffron Burrows I feel was miscast as Angel. Saffron is a fine actress in deed, but they needed someone who would be more believable opposite Freddie Prinze, jr. Maybe I am just too used to seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt at his side. Someone more around the lines of Mia Sara or Gabrielle Anwar, or even Denise Richards. They really needed an introduction for this movie. That is what sucked the most.

The FTL travel is treated in a unique manner treating us to a one use bullet-time effect. For what it is, it's well acted. IMO the two leads are the only mis-cast actors. I'm not a huge fan of either. Saffron Burrows' voice is too deep too often and it sounds forced. FPJr is a little better but for me, Lillard, Prochnow, and Karyo are the real attraction acting wise. The fighter dogfight scenes are well done as well as the broadside attack... I usually rewind that bit once or twice when I take in this guilty pleasure. The writing is really pretty good. We care about the mission beyond that it is one as the consequence of failure is so great. The relationships, as fleeting as they might be, hold importance because of the potential for never having one again should the crew of the Tiger Claw fail.

Apparently. It's made up in about the first five minutes, and never referred to again. Characters hint at every now and then, but every time they seem to get somewhere director Roberts make sure they keep quiet.

Hell I liked Mark Hamil as Blair better than Skywalker. He was cool and support from Maniac played by Tom Wilson (Biff Back to the Future) you can't beat that. I was so thrilled to see the movie coming out, accepting that it is the original story from the first game so Blair would be young enough to be played by someone like Freddie Prinz Jr. I was horrified to the inaccuracies of the movie. First off, Admiral Tolwyn?! NO! He was only Captain at the time and only made Admiral prior to Wing Commander III. And he was played by Malcom McDowell orginally. He was perfect for the role. Not to say David Warner is a bad actor, cause he is great, but no, you can't replace McDowell in that role. Keeping on Wing Commander III, the skipper missile was an experimental weapon used by the Kilrathi at the end of the war. It wasn't even a concept yet at the time Blair was a rookie. The cloaked \"phantom fighters\" that made their debut in Wing Commander II would still have been in development at the time of the movie, let alone well known skipper missiles for the first movie. Additionally, the Concordia was a new Confed Dreadnaught, brand new by Wing Commander II. Perhaps in service only a short while. She was old and dirty in the movie, and so was the Tiger Claw. Another thing, Paladin was played by John-Rys Davies in the game, and they picked some guy who just didn't measure up. And what is with the whole pilgrim thing? That wasn't in the game at all!? I heard someone else speak about the relationship between Blair and the senior officers on the Tiger Claw as being inaccurate. I am more in tune with the later Wing Commander Games, so I can't testiy to that. I gave one point because the kid that played Maniac in the movie I could see turning into Tom Wilson. But Freddie Jr. No, sorry. He is no Blair. I pretend this movie never happened. I will forgive Chris Roberts if he wants to make a new game or try again with the movie this time using original cast from the game. And I mean no substitutes. Call Hamil and Wilson, McDowell, Davies and everyone else.That's my two cents. I did like the soundtrack.",

This movie was designed to cater to young adolescents.  If Chris was true to the original story, this could have been one great movie.  The only things similar to the original storyline are the character names, ship names, and the enemy race.  That's where the similarity ends, though.These are the things that SHOULD have been done:1.  Kept the original ship designs of the 1st Wing Commander game.2.  Kept the original character personalities.  Paladin is a frenchman in the movie!  He should have been a scotsman like in the game.  The pilots are all adolescents in their behavior.  I wanted to see hardened pilots, like in the original game.  Not teenagers looking to make their next libido score on one another. (Also, the captain of the tiger's claw does not have the same name as in the game).3.  Never introduced this 'Pilgrim' faction of humans, along with the lame prejudicial sideline in the movie.4.  Kept the original plot of the game.  The plot was over-simplified in the movie, and very rushed.  True, it's hard to fit in all of the information in a game that may take many hours into the limited movie time frame, but it could have been done a lot better than it was.5.  Tried to get Malcolm McDowell (Malcolm Taylor) as Admiral Tolwyn.In conclusion, this movie isn't even worth a passing glance in a video store window.",

            "content": "Reading through the comments for this movie, I seem to see two types of people: those who played the games this movie is based from and those who haven't, but the opinions in both those groups could not vary more.  I have played several of the Wing Commander games, but never to completion so I only have a passing familiarity with the characters and locations, but enough to know their names.  I have heard how bad this movie is, but I thought I'd give it a shot for the sake of comparing it to the games.Smart move.  The movie has a cookie-cutter plot, that's for sure, but the sets and technology are marvelous.  The idea that 600 years in the future we're tooling around the galaxy in hunks of junk that seem more like submarines than spacious, well-lit starships like on Star Trek is a completely different take on things, and something that the producers of the film should be proud of.  People assume that with time comes progression in technology, and while that is true to a limited extent, in the last 100 years we have seen little change in the implements of war--tanks, planes, ships, submarines--aside from their overall firepower, safety, etc.  Nearly 100 years ago in World War I we were flying biplanes and dogfighting over Europe.  Now we're flying jet planes and dogfighting over Iraq.  During the American Civil War, we used wooden ships to fire cannons at each other, now we use huge steel ships to fire rockets at each other from longer distances. The tool is the same, the methods are the same, only the quality has changed.  People 50 years ago thought we'd be living on the moon by now and traveling in hover cars, so who are we to say what technology we'll develop in the next few hundred years?  I have no trouble in my mind picturing our space battle fleets in the future consisting of cruisers, destroyers, and carriers, and firing torpedos with nuclear warheads on them with the same tactics we use now.  Just because Star Trek has massive energy weapons doesn't mean we'll be able to develop them ourselves, maybe we'll be firing bullets like they did in Wing Commander.  Maybe energy weapons DO exist for the humans in this movie (they do in the game, by the way), but the rigors of deep space travel prevent the ships from using them effectively. Submarines have limited weaponry and capabilities because they travel in places where we can't normally go and resupply them easily, particularly in times of war.The acting itself was a little sketchy.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. was better than I expected him to be, and Matthew Lillard was perfect for the over-the-top role of Maniac (not Maverick as some others in the comments have wrongly remembered).  There was, of course, a huge plot hole concerning the cross worn around Blair's neck, but that was thanks to a scene that was cut from the final movie.  The physics were a little off, but let's face it: how many sci-fi movies use real physics?  I hear people complaining about this movie that sound doesn't travel through space so they couldn't use sonar, yet no one complains that you can hear the ships and weapons firing in Star Wars, right?Don't go in expecting Star Wars, or even Top Gun in space.  Go in with your mind open, and forget what you've seen in other sci-fi movies.  Just because phasers, photon torpedos, and anti-matter driven ships exist elsewhere doesn't mean they exist here or even in real life.  If you're a fan of war movies, then you might like this one, but don't be expecting Tora! Tora! Tora! either.For those that rag on this movie constantly, just back off.  It has some redeeming qualities, and while it isn't one of the best movies ever made, it has enough to make it interesting and worth a look on a Sunday afternoon.",

I can even predict the end, which I never got to see because I got up and left the theatre.

(Mark Hammill was even cast as the main character when they began incorporating live-action cut-scenes into the game, forever cementing the connection.)So one can understand that when Chris Roberts decided to bring it to the big screen, he felt the need to make changes to the Wing Commander franchise to differentiate it more from the Star Wars franchise -- thus the clunky WW2 fighter designs and naval-style battles. Although this works fine on film, it really changes the look and feel of the franchise completely, giving nothing for fans of the amazing games to connect with... and lets face it, fans of the games were really the core target audience (or should have been!)The whole added subplot about the \"Pilgrims\" -- something not found in the games -- felt a little bit like a rip-off of Star Wars' \"The Force\" in a way, too (that is, as we understood the Force before The Empire Strikes Back): a plot device to give the main character a special power to set him apart from the other characters. Again, it works okay, but I wish Roberts had taken all the time spent talking about the Pilgrims and used it instead to flesh out the enemy Kilrathi, who were much more interesting and fully-realized characters in the video games. (Though admittedly, the budget probably wouldn't have allowed that much time with the creature effects.)It's bound to be a disappointment for fans of the video game franchise upon which it was based, simply because it had so little in common -- and because the video games themselves featured more well-known actors, such as Mark Hammill, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies and Tom Wilson.But in the end, it still makes a fine sci-fi film, well worth watching if you're flipping channels and find it on television, or renting if you are a fan of the sci-fi genre or any of the film's actors.",

On top of that, they could never really decide what kind of ship they were on. It starts out as an aircraft carrier, but then they have to rig for silent running as they're being depth-charged by the enemy. At this point, I started to expect to see water bursting in at the seams like in every good WWII submarine movie. Then, after firing torpedoes (not photon torpedoes, but good, old-fashioned, big, long, metal torpedoes, hand-loaded and everything), they let the enemy come close so they can fire a full broadside just like Horatio Hornblower (a much more believable movie).

The writing is good, giving some weight to the characters' mortality unlike other video game movies that treat violence and death as a tolerable side effect.  Prinze's character is meant to be an Everyman and turns out an Anyman, but is still watchable. The characters have some actual depth, and Taggart and Devereaux are commanders I would trust any day.  The creature effects are cheap, eliciting chuckles when they first appear on screen.  The sets are impressive.  The Rapiers and the Tiger Claw look exactly like you expect a group stationed in the middle of nowhere that can't get decommished and replaced equipment to look like, patchwork and all.  The sets reflect the cramped, \"We're not here for your comfort\" design of military vessels.  Although the ending is never in doubt, it is involving in spots, the science makes sense after some thought, and it grows on you.  Blair says of Marshall in one scene, \"He's a great guy.  There's no reason to hate him.\"  Same with this movie.  It doesn't hit all the right notes, but it gets closer than most other sci-fi movies even attempt to these days.",

If they *could* then they'd be be creative making big bucks with movies.I love computer games.  But 90% of them are essentially movie-plot ripoffs and wanna-bes (ie.  Duke Nukem = stereotypical action Stallone/Arnold, Laura Croft = Brit Indy with cones for breasts, Resident Evil = zombie b-movie). This works out ok for games because it's interactive.  Who hasn't wanted to be Luke Skywalker/Starbuck, or Bruce Willis, or a Brit Indy with cones for breasts?But unfortunately, when you take it to to the silver screen you lose the interactivity of the game which leaves very little substance and a lot of rehash.Honestly, the makers of Wing Commander (movie) didn't have much to work with.  All the good plotlines had already been taken by the interactive games (which are quite decent).Not only that, but Chris Roberts was on this WWII kick or something. Doing retro-tech is cool and artsy in flicks like Gattaca but when you're doing an action film it doesn't work at all.  DOes Roberts really think they'll still be firing torpedos, using sonar, and firing machine guns in the 24th century?  Has Roberts been to a modern aircraft carrier lately?  Did he *see* anyone loading steel balls into cannons or anyone raising the main sail?I hope this teaches video game makers a lesson.  Unless you've got a REALLY good idea, stay away from movies.  Don't ruin for the next guy.  I would think the failure of WC has ruined the chance that movies like Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, and Resident Evil will be released anytime soon.

The effects overall were fairly good considering the limited budget.Now the not so good stuff.  Poor scripting lead to some very accomplished actors like David Suchet and Jurgen Prochnow appearing very wooden and forced.  The editing meant some parts did not flow well at all and instead of building character relationships (particularly between Blair and Devereaux and Marshall and Forbes) it rather glossed over some very important scenes.  The 'bullet time' sequence rather than being an effective plot device was made into a 'look at me' effect thrown in at the last minute and was totally superfluous to the film.This film could have been a very good film if it had been scripted and edited better.

What sci-fi elements there are, are primarily of added interest rather than the main substance of the film. What this movie is really about is wartime conflict, but in a sci-fi setting. It has a solid cast, from the ever reliable David Warner to the up and coming Freddie Prinze Jr, also including many British TV regulars (that obviously add a touch of class :), not forgetting the superb Tcheky Karyo. I feel this is more of an ensemble piece than a starring vehicle. Reminiscent of WWII films based around submarine combat and air-combat (the fighters seem like adaptations of WWII Corsairs in their design, evoking a retro feel) this is one of few American films that I felt was not overwhelmed by sentiment or saccharine. The sets and special effects are all well done, never detracting form the believability of the story, although the Kilrathi themselves are rather under developed and one dimensional. This is a film more about humanity in conflict rather than a film about exploring a new and original alien race or high-brow sci-fi concepts. Forget that it's sci-fi, just watch and enjoy.",

Without spoiling the plot, it contains two separate love stories, a statement about racial prejudice, and Hunt For Red October-esque submarine warfare sequences, in addition to the  the usual dogfights and military psychodrama. The cast was rather devoid of any big names, which didn't help or hinder the movie, everyone put in a reasonable performance considering the (sometimes rather silly) script.

The carrier space craft looked like a giant techno-hotdog and the fighters appeared to be straight winged MiG-15s with hair dryers slapped on the front. When the NavCom was stolen someone should have 'hollered for a Marshall (battery)'. I could ignore the various sounds of war in space but the thing that irritated me visually was the smoke trails on the missiles.One redeeming feature: The 3D spin scene during the jump (it looked good).One last annoyance: If the tractor could push the crashed fighter off the side of the carrier, why couldn't it have pushed it back through the airlock?OK, I've had my whinge.

The storyline of the games could have easily been adapted to fit a full length movie, but instead they opted to change almost everything. The acting isn't great, although it's not downright awful - it's close. The characters are very stale, making it hard for viewers to relate to them. A central character could be killed off and you wouldn't really care, the emotional flow from the screen to the viewer is virtually nonexistent.As almost every one else has pointed out, the ships! they look like WWII fighters, and the carrier looks like a submarine - what's up with that ???I can only think of one positive thing in this movie: the state of the ships, no chrome and gloss, they looked beat up and worn out, kind of like the millennium falcon in Star Wars... but that's it.Wing Commander stands as one of the few epic computer games.

(I can still hum the main theme to \"Heart of the Tiger,\" some six years after I last played it, and it still sends chills down my spine.) While Tcheky Karyo and David Warner put in fine performances as James \"Paladin\" Taggart and Admiral Sir Geoffrey Tolwyn, they could never match the terrific work of John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm MacDowell, who played Taggart and Tolwyn in the games. Nothing in the uninspired script compares with Tolwyn's sneering \"Well, colonel, what would you aim for if you had the biggest gun in the universe?\" Prince Thrakhath's \"Heart of the Tiger\" speech, or the not-so-friendly banter between Mark Hamill's Christopher Blair and Tom Wilson's \"Maniac\" Marshall.

The change is remarkable.  Everything in this movie bears the mark of a bigger budget.First, the evil aliens do not look like overgrown tigers.  For those unfamiliar with the \"Wing Commander\" series of video games, the original Kilrathi aliens looked like big cats.  (A blatant rip-off of the \"Man-Kzin Wars\" pulp novels.)  Thankfully, Roberts decided to use his bigger budget and spring for more menacing aliens.  Fans of the games, no doubt purists, will disagree and find the new Kilrathi upsetting but I view the change as akin to Gene Roddenberry's makeover of the Klingons from the TV show to the cinema.Roberts also chose a better class of actors than was available in the game sequences.  The Wing Comander games always had a fine starring cast (Mark Hamil, Ginger Lynn, Malcom MacDowell, etc) but the supporting cast always left something to be desired, consisting of the game's programmers, testers, family members, and others.  The film's cast is much improved.  The supporting ensemble includes such classically trained actors as Jurgen Prochnow and David Suchet.Of course, the technical effects are better.  The games never suffered from a lack of video pinache, but they had limited time (30 seconds to a couple of minutes) in which to wow their audience in a video sequence.  Roberts always managed to squeeze the action into that time and develop an engrossing plot.There lies the problem.  It is obvious to the viewer that Roberts lacks the discipline needed to pace a scene for the big screen.  It's as if he forgot how to keep a scene tight.  Perhaps it was the daunting prospect of filling 90 minutes all at once.  Maybe it was the knowledge that the audience could not influence the outcome with a joystick.Whatever the reason, Wing Commander is a mess.  The plot moves nowhere, the dialogue is corny, the space combat is too dark and slow, and the soundtrack is trite.  Overall, the movie is just not exciting.  My friend's ten-year-old complained the movie was boring about 40 minutes into it.Wait for the patch.",

I'm now certain that the ships flew through the incredibly large plot holes to get from place to place. Its good to see that in a couple hundred years from now humans are still using mini disks for data storage.  I'm sure that the same \"briliant military minds\" that sent wave after wave of disposable foot soldiers against mele attack aliens in Starship Troopers were responsible for the ships in this movie.  The Rapiers look like they were pulled from the Smithsonian institute and WHY don't the capital ships have some sort of missile defense!?  Submarines 20 years ago could at least drop decoys in the water to confuse torpedos.  Apparently in the next couple hundred years we forget how to do that.  In one scene the Tiger Claw is hiding near an asteroid when a Kilrathi destroyer flies overhead.  For some reason you can hear a pinging sound.  I take it this is supposed to be the ping of active sonar (like in submarine movies) the problem with this is that sound doesn't actually travel through a vacume at all so sonar wouldn't actually pick up anything, ever.  Also at this point Paladin is telling everyone to be quiet. There could be an Iron Maiden concert going on on that ship and the destroyer wouldn't be able to notice.  Apparently it's taken for granted that the viewing audience is going to be to stupid to pick up on things like that. I've read in a couple other reviews that scenes with the Kilrathi were thought up at the last minite.  I completely agree and would go further to say that these scenes should have been cut.  The Kilrathi looked idiotic. Godzilla looked more realistic than them and he's SUPPOSED to look lame. Another question, why are piolets used as marines when they make the raid on the Kilrathi ship? All in all this was a horrible movie.  I realized that I haven't written about the acting done by Freddy prince and his special friend Matthew Lilard but I don't think my comments would make it past the censors.",

Wing Commander had some excellent graphics that were as good as the Matrix, as well as funnyman Matthew Lillard, but I think that the movie just seemed so thin plot wise.

They start with something about 40 hours until the Kilwrathi arrive at Earth.  So they go out of the way to get to a defence on a jump point to Earth. (like the enemy would use the points! come on!) and stay there for like 4 days, hmm, unless my math is wrong, thats 96 hours!  well, to conclude this movie is a horribe movie, filled with plot holes, bad characters (i didn't talk about them, sorry), awful effects, and just altogether bad.

Also, when the Tiger Claw goes to ground to avoid Kilrathi patrols, why are they whispering? After all, sound CAN'T carry through space.There are several other elements of the story that could have been thought through a little more thoroughly. The year is 2654, which is fine and dandy, but they STILL use gasoline for power! And what about the fact that Tiger Claw itself uses the same type of fuel as the Kilrathi?Other than these major technical or scientific problems, there is only one major flaw. The acting was extremely poor. After having played Wing Commander 4, which had excellent acting, I was expecting more from Chris Roberts.While the movie is disappointing overall, it was fun to watch.

Even as a fan of the video games, I was left with disappointment, like I beat the final boss and be left going \"Is that it?\"It almost felt that the director didn't really care for the audience, you get some pretty fun performances and almost over the top at times which is expected with a movie based off of a video game. The graphics as well for this time weren't even that great, this was the year Star Wars Episode 1 came out and they had better graphics. Probably due to a bigger budget.I would put it at 6, it was an okay popcorn movie with some enjoyable moments. The sad truth is that it'll be forgotten and not even saved in a cult status way. Even the video game itself only has a few that probably still remember that it even existed.

His writing and directing styles are much better suited to the world on 2 minute cut-scenes than the world of $50 million, 2 hour feature films.  At times you couldn't even tell what was going on he moved the camera around so damn fast.The CG effects were very nice, very well-done (with a few exceptions -- you can tell which were last-minute effects).  The space battles looked great, but as I said before, the alien bad guys -- the Kilrathi -- were horrible, and had all the menace of a carrot.The acting was terribly uneven, with two exceptions -- Matthew Lillard was great as \"Maniac\" Marshall, and Saffron Burrows did a good job with a thin character as \"Angel\" Devereaux.  Jurgen Prochnow and David Warner were a total waste, and the only thing I can figure is that both saw the amount of screen-time they'd get, saw the corresponding pay offer and figured they'd get while the getting was good.  Unfortunately, Freddie Prinze Jr., in his first top-billing role as our hero Christopher Blair, was rather forgettable.  I found myself wanting to see less of him and more of Maniac and Angel.Overall, I give this flick one star for content (mainly thanks to Digital Anvil's CG work) and one star for effort.

Even though people that enjoyed the movie thought the audience was clapping at the end because the movie was great, they (and my father and I) were clapping because the horrid thing was over. I love the Wing Commander series.  I've played them all, over and over. What I expected from this movie was dogfights, at impossible odds.  What I got was \"bad guy comes out, they shoot it, end of that\".  Where were the dogfights?  I LOVED the awesome cockpit views they did, and the opening special effects of the Kilrathi ships flying by were great, however... I had to laugh at the movie.  3/4 of it's dialogue, talking about nothing.  1/5 of it is space, and the other stuff is dogfight (which wasn't really worth of the name \"dogfight\") and cheesy romance (which also can't be called \"romance\"). I'm 13, but I have more sense then to actually like this movie.  I know. It stunk.  But the games are great.  Play those.  Please, don't hate Origin or Chris Roberts or Wing Commander for this... just look at the movie, and laugh.",

            "content": "This isn't the best film ever, but it isn't the worst, either. It's basically a bunch of buddy and war film cliches strung together with obligatory sci-fi elements and a strangely unsatisfying finale. Basic plot: (spoilers): Two buddies graduate from the Terran Confederation Academy together, heading straight into an intergalactic war. They are assiged to Confed's decorated strike carrier, the Tiger(sic) Claw. Buddy 1 has an affair with his squadron mate who later dies in a \"s**t happens\" landing accident that shifts from being tragic to bizarre to hilarious. Most of the emotion of the film is robbed when you're not thinking \"where have I seen this before\", but \"where HAVEN'T I seen this before?\".Meanwhile, Buddy 2 is being bitched at for being part a legendary breed of space navigators called the Pilgrims who started a great big war with the rest of humanity, and lost. Some of the survivors fight alongside humanity against an evil breed of FUGLY space aliens, while others align themselves with the aliens, the Kilrathi. (A planned subplot which would further elaborate on the Pilgrims, involving the captain of the Tiger Claw plotting against the Confederation was cut, leaving the whole Pilgrim issue unresolved. Thankfully, it is retained in the novel.). In the end, Buddy 1 gets over his grief over the death of his lover and helps Buddy 2 save the universe. Everyone finally comes to grip with Buddy 2's heritage, and everyone lives happily ever after. The end.That's the basic plot. The rest of this review will be addressing other points.The acting in this movie really isn't THAT bad. Prinze Junior and Lillard do a decent job of being buddy-buddy twentysomethings, which last time I checked, they were. The downside is that they're forced to recite a script bogged down by every war movie and love cliche that ever existed in the history of the universe. But then again, these things happen when game designers write movies. (On a side note, I find it incredibly hilarious how half the reviewers here are ranting and raving about how \"t33n st4rs R gh3y!!!11111 th3y sh0uld use 40 y34r o1ds to p14y t33nag3rs!!!11111 w4h!!!!!!!!!!!\" . . . especially how Mark Hamill, who played Blair in the game, *was* a teen star at the time of Star Wars.)The ships don't ACTUALLY shoot bullets; officially they're \"rotary neutron cannons\", which is a cool way to say gatling lasers, basically. And while we see the torpedoes being loaded manually, that's not usually the case; if you watch it closely (like anyone HERE's gonna do that . . .), the weapons control officers reports that \"tubes three and four are damaged. Auto-loaders are not operational\". (It might seem anachronistic for state-of-the-art warships in 2654 to fire projectiles instead of the antimatter bolts visible in a few scenes, but in the games it's explained that only torpedoes can penetrate ships' shields consistantly. Should have put it in the film, guys).And while the image of the fighter being pushed off the deck looks REALLY REALLY DUMB, there's actually a logical explanation: \"The Claw has artificial gravity. The ship's artificial gravity extends slightly past the end of the runway. Ships dip as they come off.\"Then we have the \"Das Boot\" scene, where the destroyer comes and everyone's whispering. I know someone who can explain this far better than I can:\"AGH! The scene is the ultimate proof that your average movie goer is stupid. The enemy capships start to fly off and everybody starts cheering, and Paladin goes \"shhh\". And then you can hear that there's still a blip, which is a ship heading for the Tiger's Claw. He's *clearly* just telling them to shut up so he can hear... and everybody still had a field day with this. (It's even more ridiculous when you think about it -- if the characters honestly believed that the Kilrathi could hear them, as trained military personel they wouldn't have cheered at all.) When I tell somebody to shut up, it's generally *not* because I think alien ships can hear me. Well, sometimes it is. \" It's apparently just a stylistic flourish.Of course, all these \"stylistic flourishes\", many of them lifted from World War II, seem really stupid in the context of the movie. So why have them? Chris Roberts, the director, says: \"I wanted to have something that felt like Das Boot in space . . . There were some scenes I wanted in the movie that were the equivalent of Das Boot's depth-charging scene. I was trying very much to make a classic World War II movie, but update it and set it in space, so things that you see will register with you on a subconscious level, but instead of destroyers at sea or a submarine stuck at the bottom of the ocean, it's all in space.\" Seems like Roberts tried a bit TOO hard to make things register subconsciously, simultaniously insulting his audience's intelligence.So should you see it? It depends. It's almost a given that if you have the games, you won't enjoy it, since the general feel of the movie is much different, and there a bunch of things easily mistaken for continuity errors, which I won't go into for lack of relevency. On the other hand, if you want to see a kick-ass action movie or a decent story, the movie fails on both accounts. While there are some nice CGI effects, the fighting is few and far between, and rather slow paced - you get the idea that everything's leading up to some Star Wars style big-ass battle that never shows. The plot isn't anything to scream at either - fairly typical fare, and the characters never show themselves worthy of any real empathy.So if the movie is so bad, why do I like it? One word: background. It may seem odd to hear this, but this is one case where I felt the universe created for the movie was more compelling then the actual movie itself. This isn't Star Trek, with its shiny, hi-fi definition of the future, or even the more utilitarian Star Wars and Babylon 5. This is a WAR MOVIE, and the film never lets you forget it from start to finish. Sets have a very claustrophobic, Hunt-for-Red-October feel, ships are patchy and worn, torpedo crews heave the auto-loaderless weapons into their firing tubes. This ain't no Galaxy-class hotel room, baby, THIS IS A WARSHIP!The intro is first-rate, starting with a starmap and a quote from John F. Kennedy (\"Many years ago, the great British explorer George Mallory who was to die on Mt. Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said because it is there\") and leaping directly into a Pearl Harbor-esque attack sequence. I think much of the disappointment from the film is that the intro set a highwater mark that the film couldn't equel. The soundtrack is nicely done too, one of the best parts of the film. It's evocative of classic scores done for films like /633rd/. If you only buy one thing from the film, get the soundtrack. It's worth it.So this is basically a World War II sub movie in space. If you like that sort of thing, and are willing to forgive some laughable moments (\"I'll never let go Jack!\"), great. If not, you should definetely pass. Personally, I love it, I have the DVD, but I usually only watch the half-hour or so of action sequences. But that's just me.Side note: If you're interested in Wing Commander, head down to the Wing Commander Combat Information Center Chat Zone, the very best Wing Commander site and webboard, whose address is above. They'll answer all your questions, and then some.Thank you, come again.",

All the ships, and the weapons were different, the only objects that stayed the same were the ship names.   Here is what is wrong with the movie:1.  Blair and Maniac WERE NOT FRIENDS out of the academy, they became friends eventually.2.  The guns were not bullets, they were lasers, and the ships didn't look like blobs.3.  Paladin had no relation to Blair whatsoever, neither did they make friends until well after Wing Commander 1.4.  Maniac never had a girlfriend!I am servely disapointed with the special effects, and they space battle scenes!  The whole point of Wing Commander was the space battle scenes.  I realize they had to make a storyline to it, but it was terrible.  A very bad approach.  The only reason Chris Roberts made Blair and Maniac friends right off the bat, was because of the beginning of Wing Commander Prophecy where Casey had his friend.

When I played/watched Wing Commander IV, I thought to myself, \"I haven't seen such a film on the silver screen before, let alone my computer screen.\"  So, as I left the cinema thinking, \"How was that so bad when WCIV was so good?\" it came to me: The director had no experience with five uninterrupted minutes of film.  He knew how to build tension to the point you went to the cockpit. This is evident in at least a few scenes I can name.  The pacing seems to be racing, but you're not sure why.  For example: the hull breach, the \"depth charge\" scene, any of the dog fight scenes, the marine attack on the Kilrathi ship, etc... Of course there were other problems facing the first time director, but none had a greater (or lesser, ATCMB) impact than that.  Feel free to disagree with me, but you'll be wrong.  :)",

Replacing veteran actors like John Rhys Davies, Malcom McDowell and Mark Hamill was a veritable who's who of the worst actors in Hollywood. Freddy Prinze Jr. delivers a role of a caliber only a cardboard cut-out of himself could duplicate (not that this is out of the ordinary for him). Matthew Lillard proves once again that he's only good in a role where a complete lack of skill as an actor goes unnoticed. Beyond this, the story is ludicrous. If the two leading actors don't irritate you just with their presence, or lack of screen presence, the boring, paper thin plot will. The fighters, far removed from the sleek, lethal looking fighters of the video game are replaced by clunky, clumsy looking ones. I remember hearing the creators of the movie wanted the movie to have the feel of old school WW2, Korean War dogfights, but they not only failed in that, they gave us fighters that nobody would actually want to fly in the game. I remember this being the first movie I ever felt like walking out on, and only stayed because I figured at the time that there had to be some redeeming value to it. Wow, was I ever wrong. And the worst part of this disaster? It derailed a possible franchise before it even got started. I remember thinking that Wing Commander 3 would have made a great movie (even though the video game was among the first video games to have a full cast of actors and sets).

I was concerned that he might be forced to stray from his original vision to create a film that would be \"appropriate\" for Hollywood.  My concerns were justified.  Wing Commander is a formulaic film that completely fails to capture the spirit of the games upon which it is based.The movie is plagued with a mish-mash of characters and events pulled from several of the games.  Given the film's running time, I'm not surprised that this approach was taken, but I am disappointed by it.The rest of my disappointment stems mainly from the movie's special effects.  Roberts was able to bring together a lot of talent to produce the involving graphics, cut scenes, and cinematic sequences in the game series.  It's unfortunate that he couldn't do the same for this film.  Instead, it seems he decided to back off from high-tech energy weapons, and adopt a WW2-esque approach to the battle scenes, complete with machine guns and torpedoes.  It's cute, but it doesn't fit.

And with Wing Commander headed to the silver screen, I figured that we'd once again experience a sci-fi spectacle that would make us forget all about Episode I. After all, Wing Commander is a cool game.Freddie `Ray from I Know What You Did Last Summer' Prinze plays Christopher Blair, a cocky up-and-coming fighter pilot. Despite his skills in the cockpit, nobody seems to like our hero because of his `pilgrim' heritage \u0096 I guess they're all jealous of the cool pointy hat he gets to wear on Thanksgiving.Blair's buddy, `Maniac,' is portrayed by Matthew `Emmanuel Goldstein from Hackers' Lillard. `Maniac' is a loose cannon who enjoys fancy aerospace maneuvers, hot-dogging, and having sex with his clothes on. Despite the `fine' `job' of `acting' that Lillard does, I just can't agree with this casting decision. After all, we all know that Maniac is really Biff from Back to the Future. Shame.Anyway, the two of them \u0096 accompanied by some Norwegian guy whose accent keeps changing \u0096 are farting about in deep space, when they get a distress signal from a group of Terrans under attack by the Kilrathi. This is our heroes' cue to go aboard the TCS Tiger's Claw, and start vaporizing space scum in stupid-looking fighters that resemble stubby A-10 Warthogs.Once on board the Tiger's Claw (which looks suspiciously like a submarine, complete with manual gauges and monochrome vector-based monitors), Blair delivers the distress signal, conveniently placed on a Sony\u0099 brand Minidisc\u0099. Soon, we are introduced to Blair's new wing commander, \u0091Angel' Devereaux, who has what looks like an enormous pimple on her left cheek. We also meet up with Rosie, a female pilot who has sex with Maniac, and is promptly blown up by the Kilrathi. Oh yeah, there's also some guy called `Ubutu,' whose name served as a major source of amusement for the next half-hour of the movie. Ubutu! Ubutu!After some flying-around-and-shooting-stuff action entirely presented from a cockpit perspective, the Terran troops board a Kilrathi cruiser. Instead of resembling the sorta-cool Muppets of Wing Commander III, the Kilrathi look like WWF wrestlers wearing Halloween masks; fortunately, the Kilrathi keep pumping fog into their ship, making it hard to see how silly they look. After the Terran commandos retrieve something that looks like a car battery from the murky depths of the ship, Blair does some pseudo-mushy scene with Angel, and almost gets sucked into space in a remarkably monotonous action sequence.All of this leads up to a climax that's about as exciting as plunging a clogged toilet. After Blair beats the bad guys, he flies back to the Tiger's Claw, where everyone is cheering that the damn movie is finally over and they can finally go home.Is there any reason you should go see Wing Commander? I think so. After all, your local theatre is probably air-conditioned, and the relative emptiness of any Wing Commander screening will allow you to bring along a laptop and catch up on your work. You can also eat tasty popcorn and mack on the girls working there. And when you're done, you can retreat to the lobby and play cool pinball games \u0096 hell, you can even go to a clean, fully-stocked bathroom, should you feel the need!Even though Wing Commander is an anachronism-laden celluloid turd, you'll walk away from the cinema realizing that even though a movie sucks, American theatre-going offers many unique conveniences.

There was entire plot branch that was fairly integral to the overall story that had to be cut out due to technical reason, but even without it the film was extremely well done. Even though it didn't encompass the original look of the games it did convey the overall spirit of the story. Considering they only spent 27 million dollars on it I would dare say that it is a much larger and better acheivement than the entire Star Wars series, and a better film I might add.",

The reason I originally chose to see this movie was I liked science fiction and I enjoyed playing the original video games (cheesy cut scenes and all).  This movie contained very little of either.The acting (especially Lillard) was spotty at best, but then again it's hard to act when the script shows no signs of wit, intelligence or emotion. Even with the lack of anything important or pithy to say the characters still insist on talking about everything, including giving a running commentary on the few and far between space battles.The battle sequences themselves are relatively impressive but as I mentioned they make up a very small portion of the total running time. Other than some interesting visual-distortion explosions there isn't even one major gimmick that will let you enjoy the movie.  I won't even mention the alien make-up effects except to say that if you cross the cowardly lion with the dog-puppet insult comic from Conan O'brien you'll be close to inventing your own Kilrathi.To sum up, a better cinematic experience can be had by going back and playing the Wing Commander series.  Why a science fiction movie needs to be as wordy as this one is beyond me.  At least we won't have to sit through Roberts directing a movie ever again (stick to the games, my friend).

The props used are even worse, which have no resemblance to military hardware now, or worst yet, 655 years from now.There is a very unrealistic thing about the whole thing. From a lack of sci-fi looking sets to a total lack of military bearing drives me nuts. The ships used look like WWI biplanes with props and wings ripped off. Or maybe A-10's without wings. Also a lack of any energy weapons. Trueness to the game, is non-existent, if you were looking for any. Ships look nothing like what they are supposed to, and the timelines and technology are junked.The computer graphics are cheap, things look like they were done in Paint Shop Pro. Asteroids and planets especially. Even the music was bad, a series of repeating measures which was recorded in half-witted quality. Storyline and plot were poorly written, and tried to press everything into a 2 hour movie, when it would have fit better in a four hour set, or better yet, none at all. Research should have been done on the current military before even venturing into this.

To make matters worse, appearantly all of the rules of script writing (like character development and continuity), went with them.  But I really liked all of the \"Das Boot\" references, like the pinging sonar sound when the ship is being hunted by the enemy, and dropping nukes like depth charges.  It's as if the director ran out of plot ideas half way through and ask Tcheky Karyo what he thought they should do (\"Well, in DAS BOOT, we sat on the bottom of the ocean and...\") and away they went.  Along with that, the space fight scenes just weren't that good (although the World war I gattling gun sounds the planes made when they were shooting were hilarious), and the special effects definitely didn't make up for all of the holes in the plot.

Actors aside, the vehicles are a complete departure from the style of the game.  In particular, the signature style of the Kilrathi's non-symmetrical design is lost.  Also, the Kilrathi themselves look very different than how they are portrayed in the game.  I dare say the game did a better job.  To say a few words in favor of the movie, I thought the character Paladin was very well done, and Maniac was well played by Matt Lillard, although I miss Tom \"Biff\" Wilson in that role.  The parallels drawn between life on the \"Tiger Claw\" and the \"Red October\" were interesting.  Having J\u00fcrgen Prochnow from \"Das Boot\" on the bridge helped make that connection too.

Second off, I had some time to kill with some friends and everything else playing at the theatres didn't peak our interest.   Finally, I am a big fan of the PC game series and Wing Commander 2 ranks as one of my all time favorite games.   The movie started out poorly for me as they forgot to put in the SW trailer :( (This was probably a sign from above of the agony to come).  Oh well.Anyway, the movie, Wing Commander is directed by Chris Roberts, the original mastermind of the Origin created computer game, so I was expecting some sort of tie in with the game at least.  I didn't get what I wanted, however, as Roberts pillaged what was an excellent computer developed cinematic world into a commercialized and compromised movie.  The Kilrathi in the PC game were enormous catlike, furry creatures.  The Kilrathi in the movie were portrayed as these rubber walruses with a goatee.  I was confused naturally.The storyline was pretty basic.  The terrans are trying to save Earth from a Kilrathi invasion...Blah, blah, blah.  The acting was mediocre with the only believable performance by Matthew Lillard (Maniac) and some good moments from Prinze (Maverick \"Blue Hair\" Blair) and Karyo (Paladin, who I thought was supposed to be Irish in the PC game last time I checked?).In all honesty, I can't blame the actors for making this film bad.  I can however blame the screen writers, Chris Roberts (director) and Kevin Droney for writing a horrible script.  There was a decent bit of action, but what Roberts missed was actual character development.  That's what made the Wing Commander computer game series so enjoyable.  The cinematic scenes!Anyway, Roberts butchered the chance for an actual developed sci-fi action drama, so don't bother wasting your money in seeing this movie.  Only go and see this movie if you're a masochist or an oldschool wing commander fan who wants to see brief moments of nostalgia.  4 out of 10 on the IMDB scale.",

As the movie opens he is at his best as the moraless, emotionless, anything-for-the-fun-of-it jokester Todd \"Maniac\" Marshall.

Maniac, in particular, was someone you loved to hate in the games. Now he is portrayed as Christopher Blair's Academy friend (one of many small contradictions between game storyline and movie).

You don't give a flying projectile about any of the characters and halfway through it's gotten just so bad in general you have to force yourself to keep watching just because you spent the 99 cents to the discount bin to rent it.Awful!",

            "content": "When I sat down to watch this movie, I expected worse.  A friend of mine had given me all of these bad reviews from all over the net and frankly, I think they were unfounded.  Sure, the plot was hard to follow at times (it seemed like just a bunch of stuff happening at times) and I found it odd that 'medics' were rarely on the flight deck.  These negative critics were also right on about the technology; I hope we still won't be using machine guns in the 27th century.  As far as acting is concerned, I thought the Captain of the TigerClaw (David Suchet), Maniac (Matthew Lillard), and Rosie (Ginny Holder) were particularly good.  Freddie Prinze Jr.'s performance in the lead role was somewhat disappointing although I have seen worse performances.  To his credit though, he and the others did have to work with some base dialogue.  Tch\u00e9ky Karyo's role as Paladin was poor.  He sounded like an Obewan Kenobi/Jean Chretien (Canada's PM) wannabe.Action sequences were good in places and horrible in others.  First of all, there are two types: space battles and armed combat.  The space battles were well done, similar to Space Above & Beyond for those who have seen the show. Unfortunately, the armed combat sequences sucked wind.  Why would the pilots double as marines?  It's an insane practice and in the video games, I don't think you get to play as marines (although I haven't played a recent Wing Commander). I should also mention that the ending was pretty cheesy and very cliched.As far as movies based on video games goes, this one is A1 (Wing Commander is head and shoulders above Mortal Kombat II).  As far as movies go, however, this one is about average.",

HOW DO WRITERS LIKE THIS GET JOBS??)...because NOTHING is explained and your left waiting and waiting and waiting.The casting (and cast directing it seems) was done on a budgetary basis and I personally think some cast members were put in the wrong roles. *looking into who had that job...not watching any of their movies* Every time I see a scene it just seems like something belonged in-between that scene and the one previous like filler, like some sort of game-play or something???

Nonetheless, the visuals were internally consistent throughout -- quite an achievement in a sci-fi film set this far in the future.I found that when I suspended disbelief, I was able to immerse myself in the film and cheer for the good guys, but the movie periodically did something so silly that it yanked me out of the story to scoff briefly before diving back in.If you like sci-fi and space opera ala Star Wars, go for it -- you'll enjoy this quite a bit.

Yet this was not the case. For all you fans of the game, go see the movie as a respectful hail to a good attempt.

After previewing the movie, however, I would have to say that Wing Commander missed its mark.  Although the basic theme had great potential, Wing Commander appears sketchy and obscure.  Romances within the storyline contain little depth, the Kilrathi screamed further development, and the climaxes lacked surprise.  Wing Commander does have its merits, too. Visual effects take a very realistic look at the development of technology, not making a dramatic leap from jets to full fledge star ships in only a few centuries.  The actors, themselves, tried to develop their characters, but lacked a solid script to leap from.  Finally, Wing Commander still contains appeal for those interested in sci-fi/action movies.  Basically, if you watch the movie expecting Star Wars, you won't be impressed; but if you watch for enjoyment, Wing Commander will tempt your tastebuds for Star Wars and not diminish the fun of Wing Commander.",

For those of you who have not seen the movie, you may not want to read on if you still want to see it. If you've played the games, you will probably be disappointed. Chris and Erin Roberts did a wonderful job creating all the Wing Commander games. You'd think that Chris would try to keep the story the same, but it isn't. There are lots of differences that are disappointing to see. Just a few of the many examples: - Paladin's ship is not called the 'Diligent.' It's called the 'Bonnie Heather.' By the way, he has never been a Commodore. He was a Major in WC 1 through 3, and then became a senator in WC 4. - Hunter and Blair never get into an argument. They have always been friends since they met. - Angel and Blair don't fall in love until Wing Commander 2. Angel isn't even the flight commander until WC 2. Where's Colonel Halycon?? He's supposed to be the flight commander of the Tiger's Claw.Who's captain Sansky? You never do find out who the captain of the Tiger's claw is. - What's the deal with the ring? That never happened.. Furthermore, you never even find out about Admiral Tolwyn until Wing Commander 2.The movie has a totally different ending than the game. Where's the 'Star Post' they are supposed to destroy?The actors/actresses aren't all that bad. But they definitely weren't as great as the fab 5 (Mark, Malcolm, John, Tom, and Jason) from the Wing Commander games.Wing Commander is a great story, FAR FAR better than Star Wars.

If taken as a continuation or part of the Wing Commander saga in the Universe established by the games, and by the books coming out at the time of the games, who form the base of the Wing Commander universe, it is a complete and utter fiasco. And with the size and loyalty of the fanbase the games has, one can't avoid thinking that the movie would be made for them. Here it sadly does not live up to it's predecessors so to say. The only thing kept, are the names. Personifications, stories, backgrounds, technology, everything, has been chucked out the window.One can only hope in the end that Chris Roberts was strongarmed to do this to appease wealthy studio executives who failed to see the quality of the original product. Anything else is hard to believe, as his work in the games has been of such quality.In closing, I see alot of people saying that the sonar is a problem in space because sound does not travel there, and then I see people sweeping that complaint away with saying shows like Star trek and babylon 5 and so let you hear sounds in space, there is a difference, in those shows the sounds are aimed exclusively at the audience, and never at the people in the show, while in Wing Commander it is used as a plot element, big difference, and very disappointing.",

If there is a film featuring a space battle, alien lifeforms, and a epic soundtrack, I am there with the popcorn.Having said that, Wing Commander, a runaway best-selling video game series, demanded a movie better than what was delivered. Here are the brutal numbers: $45 million to produce; $11,578,059 total US box office gross. Ouch.Chris Roberts, the primary face behind the train wreck, essentially missed the boat by writing a tale that borrowed heavily from too many other movies, and throwing in elements that could not escape the common sense filter of demanding science fiction audiences.Wing Commander tells the story of a single starship enroute to stop an alien threat that threatens humanity. So far, so good. But the problem starts immediately with questionable casting and even mind-boggling plot holes big enough to (fill in the blank). Worse yet, military protocols and interaction are cherry-picked for \"cinematic effect.\" In other words, some of the worse traits of military bearing are shown on screen, while other elements are conveniently ignored.Anyone who has served in uniform for more than a week (a nod to the Two-Brained Cylon for that imagery) will wince at the dialogue between a rookie fighter pilot (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and his wing commander (Saffron Burrows). It is the latter actress who actually appears like someone you'd want to follow into combat, but Prinze Jr. as Blair looks too much like a Neo wannabee (re: the Matrix) to be trusted with ANY mission, much less serving on board.The only other people on screen who at least tries to earn their paychecks are Tch\u00e9ky Karyo and an under-used Hugh Quarshie.Aside from an AWESOME original soundtrack, mediocre special effects, and a movie trailer for Star Wars Episode One (sadly lacking in the DVD release), Wing Commander will marginally entertain the video rental crowd, but will frustrate everyone else. There are far worse movies out there, but there are far better ones too.I personally liked it enough to purchase it on DVD, but your entertainment values may vary.",

His innovative use of cut-scenes drove him to produce Wing Commander 2, 3, 4, Prophecy and Privateer. I, for one, have been hooked since I got a medal for one of my missions in Wing Commander 2. That shiny little bunch of pixels almost brought a tear to my eye.\nAnd then he released this crap.You might have guessed already that I didn't think much of Chris Roberts' first and, presumably last, experiment into the world of movie production. I felt like a guinea-pig, pushing the boundries of human movie endurance as $25 million worth of sheer crap oozed out onto the screen before my very eyes.This film isn't all terrible, mind. The intro sequence, complete with a wonderful CGI map of known space and JFK quotes galore set the film up to be a stunner. The orchestral score (Kevin Kiner/David Arnold) was truly inspirational -- all the signs of a 'classic' movie.So in some ways, Wing Commander: The Movie is an architect of it's own downfall. After all this expectation, frankly p***-poor acting and writing blew it into my much-hallowed 'Top Ten Worst Plots' list. It's currently occupying the number 2 slot, just behind Death Race 2000 (which is a genuinely brilliant film, nevertheless).I'd explain the plot to you, but I'm not sure where I'd begin. It really is that disorganised. Various sub-plots are opened up (such as the story of the first space explorers, the Pilgrims, who were persecuted into near-extinction), but are never closed. It's almost as if Roberts got so angry with the inspirationally bad acting performances from Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard, he resorted to taking a pair of scissors to the film one night.The basic synopsis is:Confederation = Good Guys Kilrathi = Bad Guys Confederation destroy Kilrathi. The end.Anyone who played the games should steer well clear of this film. No justice is done to any of the characters or species, and not one of the big-name actors from the games made the transition to the film. Chris Roberts should go back to doing what he does best -- designing games. The question is, can he recover from the implosion of the Wing Commander movie?\nThere's that tear in my eye again.",

            "content": "After reading several bad reviews I expected this movie to be pretty much junk, and as I watched it, I learned that it is. This one is a classic example of a video game movie.The story isn't too bad for a cheap \"Sci-Fi\" movie (at least there is one). Those who have played the games, however, notice that it mixes the characters from the original game and the sequels in a way that doesn't match with the original story as told by the games. I couldn't help but wonder if it was really necessary to force them all into the same movie instead of coming up with some fresh names instead.The film is also full of references to ship types and weapons from the games, and not much of it is explained to the audience. I suppose that would be a problem for people who didn't play the games. Effects were, in my opinion, good enough, although it doesn't usually matter much to me.What really destroys the movie is that all of the characters weren't mere caricatures. Each has exactly one defining trait and that's it. Maniac is reckless, Angel is recovering from the loss of a loved one, etc. etc. In a computer game it makes sense - after all, you're playing it for the fighting, not the drama - but in a movie one would expect something more. To make matters worse, the actors seem to be doing their absolute worst. If you thought you had seen it all when you saw Mark Hamill in the video sequences of Wing Commander III, think again...I gave this one 3 out of 10 because for some odd reason I still enjoyed it part of the time. Sick me :-)",

            "content": "I loved the game. I played Wing Commander 1 day and night on my first 386, and I followed the series through the years up to Privateer 2. I was very impressed of the movie scenes in Wing Commander 3 and 4, and even Privateer 2 had not been bad. So, with that much guys around obviously knowing their business, the movie had to be good, hadn't it? OK, I didn't expect the best of stories, and the actors wouldn't be the bee's knees, but at least special effects and CGI would surely be first class...Well, this turned out not to be the case. I mean, OK, I can accept it that the space ships looked a bit clumsy and old-style compared to the vessels in WC4 - the film plays right around part 1 and 2. But WHY do the Kilrathi look like Klingons with a bad make-up? What happened to the fierce, proud cats from the game?And you know the worst thing about it all? Because I couldn't find the movie anywhere to rent (which, again, should have given me a hint, shouldn't it?), I actually had to buy the DVD! Gosh, what a WASTE of money!",

Only in a few heavily clich\u00e9d moments do they even reference the seriousness of their situation.The special effects, however, are adequate and some of the action sequences though short are fairly well executed.Otherwise the film seems to be filled with many 'Das Boot' references which I found detracted from my ability to take the film seriously.However, some of the older actors did do a decent job with frankly a lousy script.All in all one to watch on TV on a wet evening.

I've watched it several times and have always enjoyed it, there aren'et a lot of space battle scenes in movies that aren't Star Wars, and this \"Sub Hunt\" style was really fun to watch.I never expected an acadamy award winner, but this definately fits a need for people who love space battle movies. Matthew Lillard plays the role he always plays, an over-the-top personality that gets himself and other into trouble. (I find that a good thing). Freddy Prinze Jr. Does a fairly good job at his \"Hero\" role.I just like it. Can't help it.",
