            "content": "It's hard to think of blockbuster films that portray Native Americans as well as this one does. They are human beings here, with different personalities, intelligence, dignity, culture, and humor. The fact that a major Hollywood film had a good portion of its dialogue spoken in Lakota, subtitled in English, is fantastic. The portrayal of white cruelty, such as in the scene with rotting buffalo carcasses littering the prairie, invert the classic narrative, both in the genre of Westerns and in how history is often taught. The film identifies who the real savages were, and Kevin Costner should get a lot of credit for that.The film is of epic length, and by no means perfect. I would have preferred it without the love story, and for more centering on the native characters. The soundtrack is also intrusive, and there were many instances where I found myself thinking that the scene would have played more effectively had it been set to minimal audio. As for the criticism that it uses the 'white savior' trope, I didn't see it that way - if anything, Costner's character is the one saved, both spiritually and then physically as he's about to be hanged for treason. It's much more about the beauty of coexistence and of respecting other cultures, and how tragic the historical genocide was.The film is clearly a labor of love, and Costner took a lot of risks with it. The casting of Native actors quite honestly felt decades ahead of its time, and Graham Greene (Kicking Bird), Rodney A. Grant (Wind In His Hair), and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (Chief Ten Bears) are all wonderful. The cinematography on location mostly in South Dakota is simply stunning. However, what I love most about it is its heart, and how it shows simple appreciation for the Sioux people. \"They were a people so eager to laugh, so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other. The only word that comes to mind is harmony,\" the main character says. Would love to see more films like this, and from a native perspective. 31 years later, it's long overdue, but give Costner credit for what he accomplished in 1990.",

            "content": "Dances With Wolves Is directed by Kevin Costner who also stars. It's adapted by Michael Blake from his own novel of the same name. Starring along side Costner are Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell & Rodney A. Grant. Dean Semler provides the cinematography & John Barry the musical score. Set during the American Civil War, the story tells how Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) goes to a military outpost on the American frontier, where confronted with alienation he befriends nature, the Lakota Indians and finds himself in the process.\"I had never known a people so eager to laugh, so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other. And the only word that came to mind was harmony\"The critics were rubbing their hands with glee, getting ready to tear Costner apart for what undoubtedly would be a failure. An epic Western movie made in 1990, had he not learnt from Heaven's Gate? It was long in production, and with only a $15/$22 million budget afforded it, word came that Costner had to put in $3 million of his own cash to aid production. It was beset with production delays as the problems mounted up with the weather, animal training and with action scenes taking up to three weeks to shoot, all contributing to the belief that it was doomed to failure. \"Kevin's Gate\" they cried, what's that? It's partially sub-titled too? Never work.Dances With Wolves went on to make $424 million in Worldwide theatre tickets alone. Heaven knows what the total would be if we added the VHS & DVD returns as well! Come Academy Award time the film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture (making it the first Western to win the prestigious award since Cimarron in 1931) & Best Director. It was also nominated in five other categories with Costner up for Best Actor, Graham Greene for Best Supporting Actor & Mary McDonnell for Best Supporting Actress. It was, all told, a personal, artistic and commercial triumph for Costner. One can see him post Oscar night sitting there on his porch sipping sour mash and flipping the finger at all those critics who willed him to fail.Costner's movie is a simple tale, of that there is no arguing. But Dances With Wolves (the name given to Dunbar by the Sioux) is magnificently told, as enchanting a Western that has ever been made. It boasts everything needed to make a first class Oater. The story may be simple but it's rich on detail, the characters have real depth and it never sags, not even in its magnificent elongated directors cut that runs 236 minutes. The credit has to go to Costner, who in his debut as director lest we forget, has managed to blend everything together in the style of one of the old masters from the classic Western period. Every tonal avenue ventured down pays off handsome rewards, it all goes somewhere, awash with wistfulness, romanticism and elegiac poetry. The action sequences are expertly crafted, with a buffalo hunt particularly breath taking; no CGI here, the odd animatronic for a close encounter, but mainly the real deal, as are the wolves and the Lakota Sioux, too, who are played by Native Americans. Its humorous too, with its fun being intentional and aiding the flow of the friendships forming.As most Western fans will tell you, a lyrical horse opera needs great location work and a score to match. Thankfully Dances With Wolves has both, as both Semler & Barry produce work that picked up the Golden Baldy on Oscar night. Lensed predominantly in South Dakota around the Black Hills & Badlands regions, Semler infuses the film with natural landscapes that send the frontier bursting thru the screen, his framing explains things better than words can in this environment. While Barry's score, lifting nicely from A View To A Kill at times, is suitably grand, deft in touch for the main theme and blood pumping for the buffalo hunt and the Pawnee attacks. Acting wise the award nominations received for Costner, Greene & McDonnell were richly deserved. The boys are quiet and undemonstrative, at one with the essence of the story and infusing it with a sincerity so lacking in many epics. Playing Stands With A Fist, a white woman raised by the Sioux after her family were slaughtered when she was a child, McDonnell has to reach different character levels as the story unfolds, and she delivers emotional depth on every level. No nomination for Grant, but his work is top dollar also, his latter scenes with Costner really nail the shift in tone.There's some historical missteps that will no doubt annoy the purists, like I don't believe the Pawnee were the aggressors they are painted as here. While the central romance between Costner & McDonnell is delicate but not fully formed; tho it does improve in the directors cut. But it's hard to criticise little itches when such vision and ambition comes together as well as it does here. Structured with precision and showing respect for tradition, this is a movie about loving people for people lovers. And one can quite easily believe that some genre legends up in the sky were looking down and nodding approvingly. 10/10",

            "review_title": "I love this movie!",
            "content": "It's hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since I first saw this movie. I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner's Dunbar character? Or Dunbar's later observation that \"there was no dark political objective\" to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I've seen in any film.This movie's depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi's character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or na\u00efve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner's Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character's arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I've seen in any movie. Costner's performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie's indispensably tight focus. He's completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country's past, and asks us to do the same.Rating: 10 (Good job, everybody.)",

            "content": "Many people regard a lot of films as \"top class\" but I always keep a little shelf in my mind for the films that I regard as the best films of all time - films that are simply timeless masterpieces. Welcome to the top of that shelf! There are certain criteria by which films are judged and greatness is only obtained when all the criteria are satisfied in full. Dances with Wolves is the greatest timeless masterpiece of cinema to date because it satisfies all these criteria: 1) Cinematography: the sweeping landscape photography of the Frontier combined with the subtle night-time photography earns top marks. Aside from Oscars for Cinematography and editing, it also won the ASC award for Outstanding achievement in Cinematography - as well as a host of other industry recognition awards. In short - the cinematography is breathtaking.2) Sound/Score: the score is one of the best ever written. Again, awards rained from the sky for magical and moving score that combined seamlessly with the film/story.3) Screenplay: The dialogue and plot is magnificent. The film does not fall into the common plot formulas found in other films that attempt to pass themselves off as epics. The story combines as both of celebration of life and a somber rumination of the history of mankind.There are comical moments, dramatic moments and tear-jerking moments - that all make their entry (and exit) into the story with flawless timing.4) The Acting: for all that has been said about Kevin Costner, this was the peak of his career and he played the role of John Dunbar to perfection. A relatively unknown band of actors gave magnificent, heart-felt and down-to-earth performances in support. It was actually refreshing to see an \"EPIC\" where the producers didn't feel the need to throw famous actors in with cameo roles to improve it marketability. As far as I was concerned, there were no weak links in the chain on the acting side of things. Kevin Costner certainly proved his worthiness as a director by getting the best out of the cast.5) The ONLY film in history to.... Have an extended (director's cut) version that was better than the original. Due to concerns about the length of the film, Dances with Wolves was stripped back to three hours. Some complained that it was still too long, but I thought that the film was patient - it included good relevant detail but managed to keep the story moving at a good pace. The director's cut added an hour to the cinematic release and was, without a doubt, better than the original. It somehow added more intrigue to the story and included many sobering insights into the destruction of the American Indian race.Over all, I regard it as the greatest most masterful epic of all time.",

            "review_title": "Rediscover \"Dances With Wolves\"",
            "content": "I haven't seen \"Dances With Wolves\" for years but recently rediscovered its brilliance. Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name - Dances With Wolves - and assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter. Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene have key roles. This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order. Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3-hour epic Western. The extended director's cut is an hour longer and most of the added material is worthwhile and fleshes out the characters more than the theatrical cut. I recommend watching the 3-hour version and, if you want more, check out the expanded version.Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck \"patriot\" would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes - so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree? Also, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself - the film's protagonist - is white. What about the \"foul\" guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people just like him. He's not portrayed as evil, but merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, \"Good luck, Lieutenant\" and you know he means it; the words show love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love & compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the \"fun\" of it. Again, it smacks of reality.This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain. Neither is the movie as pro-Indian/anti-white as some insist. It's more complicated than that.As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have \"gone injun\" and many Natives have assimilated with whites. The story explores the possibility of what would happen if a white man dropped all prejudices and tried to get along with some Sioux neighbors; and what if this small band of Natives was open and curious enough to accept him? Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it IS a Hollywood movie, after all. Regardless, it's presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way.\"Dances\" is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films; it is the definition of why films are made.The film was shot mostly in Western South Dakota with additional shooting in Jackson, Wyoming, as well as Nebraska and Kansas.

Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" \"Freddy Vs. Jason,\" and \"Weekend at Bernie's.\" I don't think any of those movies has ever been called \"boring,\" but they sure are crap cinema.Onward. \"Dances With Wolves\" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.Costner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.He also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.Sure, it's easy to call \"Dances\" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.Finally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of \"Dances\" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring cliches of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated dreck we've gotten saddled with lately.",

            "content": "\"Avatar\" vs \"Dances With Wolves\". Round One. Fight! 1. Sam Worthington and Kevin Costner both play soldiers. Worthington comes across as a brain dead jar-head, whilst Costner's character is a bit more complex, at once naive, disillusioned, smart and funny. One point to Costner.2. Both films utilise extensive voice over narration. Costner's is better written. One more point to Costner.3. Cameron was an experienced director when he made \"Avatar\" and should have known better. Costner, in contrast, was young, inexperienced and on debut. One point to Costner for being a directorial virgin.4. \"Avatar\" was a zillion dollar enterprise. Costner partially financed this movie himself and based it on a script by a broke guy who slept in his house. One point to Costner's film for having a low carbon footprint.5. Both films have heroes who abandon a technologically superior race and \"go native\" by joining an alien tribe. In \"Wolves\", the tribe is slow to embrace the white hero. In \"Avatar\", Cameron cheats by making his hero \"prophecised by the planet\"; they have to embrace him. One point to Costner for not trying to rip off George Lucas' \"Force\".6. \"Avatar\" looks like a video game. One point to \"Wolves\" for not looking like \"Avatar\"7. \"Wolves\", though stupid, is filled with nuance, subtle details and quiet moments. \"Avatar\" bashes our heads with everything. One point to Costner for not damaging our heads.8. \"Avatar\" has horses with six legs whilst \"Wolves\" has horses with 4 legs. One point to Costner for not making stupid crap up.9. Costner's film emphasises the communication barriers between the natives and the hero, albeit clunkily. In \"Avatar\", communication issues are quickly brushed aside. One point to \"Wolves\".10. Cameron's film doesn't show much of the customs or daily activities of the natives. One point to Costner.11. Costner is embraced by the tribe after taming a wolf, rescuing a woman and hunting buffalo. Worthington is embraced by the tribe after riding a dragon. Dragon's are stupid. One more point to Costner.12. Colonialists are portrayed as one-dimensional villains in both films. In Costner's film, however, these villains only appear during a brief climax. One point to Costner for serving less crap.13. Both films portray the natives in a romantic, \"noble savage\" fashion. In \"Wolves\", however, the tribe is shown at war with rival tribes and massacres a white homestead. This does not quite counteract the sentimental portrayal of the natives throughout the rest of Costner's picture, but on the flip side, \"Wolves\" has the arduous task of revising 80 years of racist cinematic portrayals of Native Americans. \"Avatar\", in comparison is...well it's just stupid. One more point to Costner.14. The natives in \"Wolves\" belong to the Sioux tribe. The natives in \"Avatar\" are at once Native Indians, Rastafarians, Africans, hippies, Smurfs, cats, aliens, Disney creatures and Egyptians. One point to Costner for offending less races.15. The characters in Costner's film have cool symbolic names like \"Stands with Fist\". In \"Avatar\", we have symbolic names like Navi (naive), Selfridge (selfish), Grace Augustine (possesses grace like St Augustine?), Pandora (trouble when opened) and Sully (he's tainted). One point to Costner for not being Cameron.16. Cameron's film has unimaginative action scenes. \"Wolves\" has no real action scenes. It's more of a tone poem, and aesthetically thwarts genre expectations. One more point to Costner.17. The first five decades of cinema portrayed native American Indians in an incredibly racist fashion. \"Broken Arrow\" was the first film to rectify this, before revisionist westerns began to appear in the 1970s, with masterpieces like Altman's \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Ulzana's Raid\", \"Hombre\" and marginally interesting films like \"A Man Called Horse\", \"Soldier Blue\" and \"Cheyenne Autumn\". When \"Wolves\" was released, films about Native Americans became increasingly melancholic, mourning the loss of a race which history had now accepted as being \"ethnically cleansed\". Is Costner's film more melancholic than \"Avatar\"? Yes. One point to Costner.18. Both films have been praised for their cinematography. Costner's compositions are simple and lack any significant depth, purpose or weight, but he should be commended for the poetic and ethereal style of the film. It's Malick-lite, but it's brave. \"Avatar\" looks like fluorescent vomit. One point to Costner.19. Bizarrely, both films have the white hero having sex with a native girl, as though this transfer of bodily fluids unifies races and symbolically brings rival cultures together. Insultingly, the native is deemed inhuman unless accepted as a white man's object of desire. Half a point to Costner.20. When \"Wolves\" was released it was fresh and relatively original. \"Avatar\" is one clich\u00e9 after the next. One point to Costner for not being an unimaginative plagiarist.21. \"Avatar\" was bashed for the \"white saviour\" clich\u00e9. This clich\u00e9, or fantasy, involves white heroes \"saving\" a \"victimized tribe\" by becoming a top dog within the tribe, the white man always retaining his dominant position. In \"Wolves\", Costner remains inept throughout, is rescued by the natives and ABANDONS the natives when the white man attacks. In the \"director's cut\" we even become aware that he never understands Sioux traditions and will never be able to assimilate. One point to \"Wolves\" for being intellectually defensible.22. \"Avatar\" ends with the white man attacking the natives. \"Wolves\" has no crowd pleasing action scenes and instead hints at the slaughter of the natives with a simple shot of a Spanish helmet. One point to Costner for poetry.8/10 \u2013 \"Wolves\" wins. The 4 hour cut in particular is a great film which avoids the sentimental pro-Sioux feel of the 3 hour cut. See too \"Ulzana's Raid\", \"Hombre\" and Altman's \"Sitting Bull\".",

            "content": "Dances With Wolves is three hours long, but that is not long enough, it is so wonderful. It is set in the Civil War-era prairie, and it captures the encounter between a white man and a Sioux tribe. However, it is timeless. It is romantic, adventurous, active, comical, tragic, and educational. It demonstrates the color of one race and the cruelty of another. It forces us to view our own culture with a different eye. It features redemption, nay, salvation. The camera captures the prairie beautifully, the bluest of blue skies and the whitest and puffiest of white clouds, the most colorful of colorful ground, the roundest of rolling hills, and the largest of buffalo herds. This movie was a risky project. The story and the symbolism is simple, but it was filmed and performed masterfully. It deserved the seven Academy Awards it received and then some. A must-see masterpiece. Ten out of ten does no justice. See for yourself.",

            "content": "\"Dances with Wolves\" is hated by quite a lot of people. Is it perhaps because the Indians aren't depicted as the bad guys for once or is it because this isn't the usual Western in which you'll not find a justification for the slaughtering of the Indians? Is it because it is very long or is it because Kevin Costner is in it? I don't know, but I do know it is very cool to dislike everything he has done, but I'm not following the masses. I can still think for myself and I must say that, even though the man has done some bad projects (for instance \"Waterworld\"), this movie is absolutely one of his best.The movie starts with showing us a wounded Lieutenant John Dunbarr (Kevin Costner) who is about to have his leg amputated. Because he wants to keep it, he decides to flee and go back to his troops. Than he does something stupid. He takes a horse and starts running in front of the rebel front line, but doesn't get hit once. His troops, overwhelmed by so much 'bravery' all jump up and start fighting again and eventually win the battle. Because a general has seen what happened, Dunbarr gets the honor of having his wounds being treated by the general's surgeon, who saves his leg. Now that he feels better again, he asks to be send to a remote outpost in the West. Arriving there, he finds himself in the middle of the wilderness, all alone and surrounded by hostile Sioux. His only companion is his horse and an old wolf that he calls Two-socks. Gradually he gets accepted by the tribe, where he is known as \"Dances with Wolves\" and falls in love with \"Stands With a Fist\", a white woman who had been adopted as a young girl and was raised by the tribe. But while he is living with the Indians, the West is very fast being conquered and one day he finds new troops in his camp and even though he is an American soldier, he is seen as a traitor.I've always had a weak spot for the not-so-average Western, so when this movie first came out I was already a fan. Now, so many years after it was first shown, this is still one of the best Westerns ever. I like the fact that it shows the Indians not as savages, but as normal, loving people who only defended what was rightfully theirs. I like the fact that the movie isn't sugar sweet, but shows every detail very realistically. I even like the fact that the soldiers are seen as the bad guys for once. Add to this some very good acting and directing and an interesting story and you know you've got something special. This is a very good movie that should be seen by everybody. I give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "This is an amazing film--particularly from an artistic point of view as well as the film's ability to convey emotion. When I saw this film in the theater, I felt totally drained and very sad, so it's obvious that Kevin Costner did a great job in directing this film. It was just wonderful.Now this isn't to say that the film is perfect. While great, in many ways the film makes the same mistake old-time Westerns used to make--they present characters in simple and black/white terms. In the old days, Indians were seen as savage, stupid and brutal--and for the most part, that's exactly how the Whites are portrayed in the film. Plus, the Sioux are practically perfect in every way. It's nice to see the deficiencies of older films are being counter-balanced--but it isn't very accurate either. In fact, twenty years earlier, I think LITTLE BIG MAN did a better job in showing the natives in a more realistic manner. The characters weren't quite as one-dimensional in this earlier film.Now despite this handicap, DANCES WITH WOLVES is still a marvelous film and deserved Oscar recognition--and not for reasons of political correctness. A combination of great evocative music, breathtaking cinematography and excellent acting made this one of the great films of the 1990s. However, from a purely historical point of view, it isn't the best history lesson--though it is a darn bit closer to the truth than you'd see in most other films of the genre.",

The main ingredients of the story between these two movies is fairly similar - however, the pace and finesse with which Dances with Wolves portrays the development of the relationship between John and the Indians is masterfully done. While Avatar has huge flaws in its story-telling including some scenes with very weak dialogue - it might have gotten away with it as the audience is perhaps distracted by the bombardment of impressive CGI effects!If you thought Avatar was good and haven't seen Dances with Wolves in a while - I highly recommend it. An excellent move that I think deserves a much better review score - and also should definitely be on IMDBs top 250 list.",

            "content": "`Dances With Wolves'When I first saw the movie Dances With Wolves several years ago the story affected me in a heavy way, so much so that I decided that it would be a long time before I watched it again.  The story is not entertainment.  It is a lesson.  Last week I watched the movie again with a new understanding. Many of the published reviews seem to dislike the movie for various reasons. They are the ones that missed the point of the story.The story is, of course, fiction based on a novel by Michael Blake. Fortunately, Michael Blake also wrote the screenplay for the movie insuring fidelity with his vision.  To the credit of Kevin Costner, who was one of the producers and the director, he allowed the story to be what Michael Blake had originally created.  Costner showed great sensitivity in not only capturing the personalities of all the major characters, but making the land itself (in this case South Dakota) one of the major players.\nThe land was not just a backdrop or playing field.  It was the main character and very much alive.  The cinematography was some of the best I've ever seen and in the tradition of the great movie director, John Ford. Ford had an ability to present the land in all its beauty, which also just happened to have a story occurring on it.In Dances With Wolves, the land of South Dakota might initially appear to be a bleak place, but as Lieutenant Dunbar (Costner) spends more time at his isolated fort, he somehow slowly merges his soul with the surrounding territory.  The life on the land eventually stumbles onto his location, including a wolf and a tribe of Sioux.  The Sioux and Dunbar mistrust each other initially but through curiosity learn how to communicate with each other, however painfully slow. The wolf too was curious about the soldier, but kept his distance for a while.  Finally, the wolf trusts Dunbar enough to play with him on the prairie.  The Sioux see them playing.  Here was a white man not killing the animals.  He had earned a new name: Dances-With-Wolves.The main difference between this movie and a John Ford movie was the way Costner humanized the Sioux characters.  In a John Ford movie, most Indians were the enemy.  The only 'good' Indians were the cavalry scouts, but we never really met these scouts as people.  John Ford hired Navaho people to play the parts of Indians in his cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande, which were filmed in Monument Valley on the Navaho Reservation. Years later, Ford attempted to humanize the Native Americans in a movie called Cheyenne Autumn, but by then Ford was an old man and had lost most of his creative genius.  It is a hard movie for me to watch.Costner's movie takes great pains to allow us to know the Sioux characters. The story is about them as seen through the eyes of a perceptive white man, who had been given a new life by the gods when his attempt at suicide ended with his recognition as a war hero.What I see when I watch the movie: I see ten thousand years of evolution and experience of a human tribe on the North American continent with the most recent characters at the leading edge of the current (1860) time. The character's lives are so well presented that I sense the history of their past  In other words, I understand why they do what they do.  What depresses me about the movie is that I know the ending but the characters don't.  I know that their natural way of life is coming to an end.  The characters don't know.  To me, the movie is a story of the 4 billion, six hundred million years of natural evolution which is about to meet technology. Technology will be as devastating to this tribe and the land as if an asteroid had hit the earth.The beauty of the Sioux life is so precisely shown in this movie.  Their everyday routine of just living off the land is seen the same way as a buffalo eating the grass.  The Sioux adapted to the land the way it was. You see the grass move in waves like the ocean does when the invisible winds touch the surfaces.   You see the effects of the same winds that blow across the face and hair of Stands-With-a-Fist.  You hear the same winds.  The same winds take the smoke from the lodges away from the village. The land and air and life merge in a poetic movement.The horses seem more natural and free in their herd next to the village. They are part of the tribe.  You can see the magnificence of the Sioux riders as they become one with the horse as they hunt the buffalo.  I suppose, in a way, the horse was a step in technology for the Sioux since they didn't have the horse until the Spanish Conquistadors brought them. But when they adapted their life to the horse, they became a great people. I look at it as a step in evolution, not a step in technology.We find that the holy man, Kicking-Bird, played by Graham Green, was a hen-pecked husband, something we can all identify with no matter what race or ethnic group.  His wife saw more than he did, especially the budding love between Lieutenant Dunbar and Stands-With-a-Fist, who was played by the heavy-duty stage actress Mary McDonnell.  She is important to our story because we understand the Sioux from her translations.  As an actress, she was so convincing in her struggle to remember long forgotten English words from her childhood, from the time before she came to live with the Sioux. Kicking-Bird on the other hand represented the soul of the Sioux People. He was patient and was the type of person you would want as a friend.We have Rodney Grant playing the part of Wind-in-His-Hair, the warrior who was quick to anger but was smart enough to listen to his elders and not kill the white soldier.  Rodney Grant represented the beauty and pride of the Sioux People.  He speaks the last relevant words in the story by proclaiming that he is the friend of Dances-With-Wolves.  Before Dunbar became Dances-With-Wolves, Wind-in-His-Hair would have been happy to kill him.`Red Crow' Westerman played the part of the chief, Ten-Bears.  We've seen him play the part of a shaman in other movies.  He represented the wisdom and of the Sioux People and was also their prophet.What movie about Native Americans could be told without Wes Studi?  In this movie he plays the enemy Pawnee so convincingly that you really hate him. Not only is he the enemy to the white man but the Sioux also.  Wes Studi can be very intense in his savagery, but in the eyes of the Pawnee, he was only protecting his tribal interests.So we see the Sioux and, to a lessor degree, the Pawnee in their soon-to-end natural states.  We immediately feel at home with the Sioux.  The Pawnee aren't quite as lovable, especially when we see Wes Studi scalping the muleskinner.  The first disturbing scene is when the Pawnee attack the Sioux village and we see that to save themselves, the Sioux need the technology (the rifles) of the white soldier.  The Pawnee were so fierce looking (again convincingly by Wes Studi) that we fear for the Sioux tribe but see that the rifles are out of place in this natural world.  It is another technological step in the same magnitude as the horse.  But for all their beauty and greatness, we know they cannot win the final battles with the white civilization because they are so grossly outnumbered.\nThere is the core of the problem.  The over-population of the modern civilization overruns their own land so they come to the land of the Sioux and destroy without asking.  You could see it in the face of every tribal member as they walked past dead and skinned buffalo which were left to rot in the sun after the buffalo hunters had skinned them for their hides. They were absolutely stunned and sick at the sight.  Whoever did this had no soul.  I extend the message of this movie to today and see population running amuck, stripping the land of resources and changing the atmosphere. It is too painful to contemplate.To emphasize the loss and waste of the beautiful prairie life, near the end of the movie we see the soldiers shooting at the wolf for fun.  The wolf is confused and doesn't understand that bullets are hitting near him. Eventually a bullet strikes the wolf and we hear him cry out.  For me that was the most painful scene of all because I know that's what people do.  I see people kill a beast for the trophy.  They take it home and hang it on the wall.  The soul of that animal has been cast aside by a human, which has no soul.The beauty is not in the trophy.  The beauty is in the life.  The ending for the wolf represents the ending for the Sioux and all the other tribes that lost the natural way of life.  Therefore I am just as disturbed for the Sioux as I am about the wolf.  I am disturbed for the future of the Earth.",

If there is an afterlife for films, this would go straight to the pearly gates. Kevin Costner and his creative team are saints of modern film-making. Against all odds, they created a challenging, beautiful movie about a dark period in American history. And the movie, with its statements apparent, never shifts left or right, for which we are all truly thankful. It is a story, plain and simple. They would never make a movie this slow today. They'd never make a movie with this kind of character and story development today, either. The only thing that comes any where near close is the \"Lord of the Rings\" films. This is the best period movie, history movie, and Western all rolled into one. Make no mistake about it, the best film of the nineties is not just a flick, it will restore your faith in films for a long time. Unfortunately, after seeing \"Waterworld\", it won't restore your faith in Kevin Costner. It would take another \"Dances With Wolves\" to do that, and since \"Dances With Wolves\" is a perfect film, that would be impossible. 10/10",

Let me tell you I have seen this film more than a few times. I think you know when a film is special to you when you watch it and you keep thinking to yourself \"oh this scene coming up is great\", if you can say that continually whilst watching a film then you know you are watching a great film.As for the film itself, cinematography has never been bettered, Costners acting is OK but it his presence rather than his acting that has brought gravitas to his movies, you certainly cant argue with his directing, which along with Orson Wells, Tarantino and a few select others must rank alongside as one of the best directorial debuts. The supporting cast is excellent especially Graeme Greene who is the wonderful Kicking Bird and of course Rodney A Grant.I shamefully dont know too much about the history of the Indian population in America, so I dont know whether the events or portrayals in the film are accurate, however artistic license is surely allowed when making what is first and foremost a piece of entertainment. Being British I have seen many an American film with British stereotypes, not once have I been offended or appalled, as I see them as interpretations, God knows British filmmakers are just as guilty of such generalisations when it comes to \"foreign\" characters.Marvel at the wonderful film-making in this film not political inaccuracies after all this is a story, and a damn fine one at that, remember King Kong didnt really climb up the Empire State Building and you dont here gorillas complaining about being misrepresented. This is a point of view expressed in a great film.Personally films dont get much better than this.",

Said understanding is permitted through an engaging story told on a stunning backdrop of our disappearing plains and enriched with beautifully moving music. In 2007, \"Dances with Wolves\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen.

Because nothing and nobody will ever be able to do what Kevin Costner and his team did on this movie. It won seven Academy Awards and countless other ones, and it deserved every single one of those and much more.One of the main reasons why I loved \"Dances With Wolves\" is not just because it's a great movie, but because it's a very realistic movie. For the first time in a long time--or probably ever--we are shown what Native Americans were really like. Throughout history, Native Americans have been shown as barbaric savages with no intents but to murder and kill. But this movie shows that they were nothing at all like that, and it is correct. Native Americans were people, just like us. They only killed when they deemed it necessary: self-defense, protection of their land, beliefs, and so on. And it shows that just like us, they can hate, love, laugh, and cry. This movie also shows that Native American societies had both good and bad in them, no different than us.\"Dances With Wolves\" is over three hours long, especially in the extended addition, but like many other classics, if you have a good sense of what a good movie is, you won't even bother with the time. Because this movie is so epic and powerful and realistic, it's incredile. And it's remarkable what Kevin Costner did, seeing as how he had NEVER done a director's job until he made this movie. And he also played a very convincing lead role.Overall, this epic Western is a classic movie.

            "review_title": "A Moving and Superbly Made Movie",
            "content": "Like most of the commentators here, I found \"Dances With Wolves\" to be a moving and superbly made movie. Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of \"injuns\" over the years.So it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.Perhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as \"Indian Removal.\" And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at \"As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs\" a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, \"A People's History of the United States.\" It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, \"the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses.\" From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.Another good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, \"The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier\". \"I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West.\" This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. \"At this time, 1890,\" continues Burnett, \"we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today.\" Burnett later describes the \"streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838\" and the \"4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile\", again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about \"Dances With Wolves\" is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between \"settlers\" from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the \"bad\" news-- Costner.Finally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.",

            "content": "I have always been fascinated about Native Americans especially their customs and believes. I didn't like some of the films that portrayed them all as savages because like any society, there are good and bad people in them.Finally with Dances with Wolves, we have a balanced story where we are shown that the Indians are not savages, they are just trying to live on their land, the white men are the invaders but that was never shown before. This film shows what the Indians were like before the white men flooded their land, ordering them off it and moving them where they could keep an eye on them. The Indians see Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner)and wonder what this means, as he is the first white man they have seen in a while and know that his arrival will have consequences for their people and we know that it did for them and the film comments on this, at the end. I have to say, watching this movie and thinking what happened in real life, I felt anger on their behalf. What right did these white people have for invading their land, arrogantly deciding they knew what was best for these proud people and dictating to them about the beliefs they should have, the clothes they should wear and how they should behave. It was a terrible injustice and it was about time someone showed the other side to the Indians.The film is just so beautiful. The locations are stunning, the music fits with the action, the characters you couldn't help warming to, accept those nasty army men who I was glad was killed as if anyone deserved to die, it was them and makes a change because in the 50's and onwards, the audience would be cheering them on and not the Indians but the positions are reversed in this film and we are cheering the Indians on. The film is funny in parts but still manages to convey a serious message about the mistreatment of the Native Americans in the past. There are some amazing scenes. One at the start of the movie where Dunbar overhears doctors saying they will have to cut his foot off and he escapes and later decides he doesn't want to live without his foot so rides into enemy fire to be killed and at one stage let's go off the reins and raises his hands as if to say he is ready to die. Another incredible scene was when the Indians were hunting buffalo, the sequence was so huge, the action seemed to take over the scene on what seemed a never ending canvas.People have moaned about the length of the film but I think it is just right. Every scene Costner has added to the film is justified and the movie is never boring, it keeps the audience focused on the screen.I loved the romance between Dunbar and Stands with a fist (Mary McDonnell). The chemistry between them sizzles and yet there is such tenderness.I also like Dunbar's relationships with Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Wind in his hair (Rodney A. Grant) and Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman.' This is a very emotional film that had me in tears at times especially when Cisco the horse and Two Socks the wolf are killed. I got so caught up in the film that I was screaming at the screen and that is the power of the film where it sucks you so completely into the story. Cisco and Two Socks are just as much characters as the humans in the film and you have watched them throughout the film and are devastated when they are killed in the way they are. I laughed my head off when Cisko kept escaping the Indians and going back to Dunbar. And Two Socks who learns to trust Dunbar by the end and even takes food from his hand.I think what is also so unique about the movie is that the characters speak Lakota and it is so interesting listening to a different language other then English all the time.Well done, Kevin and the rest of the cast and crew for making such a moving film.",

That being said, it is still an excellent movie with great acting, solid direction, beautiful cinematography and a story that defies western genre standards. Costner had great intentions with this film, and it mostly works. Some would call this movie a \"white savior\" film. But I sort of disagree. If anything, the Indians save Coster. He embraces their way of life after finding his own life unfulfilling. It's a good reversal of an old trope I think. It has that feeling of the grand epics of old like Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur. It might not be as iconic, or age as well, but it still stands on its own as a great and unique film. Costner and company should be proud of what they accomplished.I really think one big reason people don't like this movie is because it beat Goodfellas at the oscars. It will be debated forever. Personally I can think of several more upsetting Oscar upsets, but I understand the criticism. Yes, Goodfellas is a much more superior film, but it been nearly 30 years. Let it go people.",

It falls into the same category as Braveheart and Lawrence of Arabia - classic adventure tales, romanticized, and just plain watchable. The plot is a simple one - a calvary lieutenant John Dunbar after attempting suicide in the Civil War requests a post on the edge of the Frontier and there encounters Sioux and finally turns native. It is the arc of John Dunbar's growing awareness that the Indians are not the true savages here that makes the film - he is an everyman, he is us, and we gladly join him on that journey.Dances with Wolves remains a terrific watch, Costner is as handsome and charming a hero as a Peck or Stewart, and the supporting cast are winning.

He does do a heartfelt job directing, and his acting isn't too shabby either, in fact he gives a certain decency to Dunbar which I had difficulty not empathising with. He is very well supported by Graheme Greene and Mary McDonell who is especially brilliant. The cinematography and scenery are just magnificent, while John Barry's score is nothing short of amazing. The moving climax gives further emotional weight to an already poignant story, while the script is wholly credible and the characters feel real.

He won Best Director in his first attempt at directing.  That says it all.  His vision into the past is like opening a book and reading the tale just as it was transcribed from one human to another.  Imagine how Kevin must've felt riding horses amidst real buffalo, real Native American Indians, upon the open plains just as it was done 100 years ago.  Put yourself in his boots.

He chooses his post to be at a very remote location, far from towns and forts. During the time he spends there, he befriends with Indians, thus learning to value the way of life of the Indians.Four hours long, very much narration and no car-exploding scenes or people getting killed, what is this? It is what infidels call boring. Nope, this is one of the best movie I've ever seen (stands at my top 10 list).The way Costner befriends with Indians is believable and also interesting to watch. Some people here have been complaining about the coincidence of an American woman being at the Indian camp who teaches Dunbar Sioux / Lakota (don't know the correct term for the language, sorry) and the rather female-gendered speech all the actors have omitted. It doesn't matter, at least if you don't know how to speak Lakota, it still sounds very good and believable. The actors speaking Lakota truly brings authenticity, and I really think it was worthwhile.This movie is pure excellent. Costner's direction and John Barry's soundtrack are both really good. The movie being four hours long, I thought I would be quite tired after the movie. I wasn't. Never have I been following anything so keenly for four hours than this movie, and never has a life of an individual man been so interesting to watch.Dances With Wolves is for the favor of American natives, which I think is really good, for often Indians are depicted as the bad guys. This time the situation has been reversed; white-colored are the bad guys and Indians the good guys. Such radical division doesn't fit this movie though, because there are \"bad\" Indians as well. But still, clearly being Indian-oriented, it stands for their favor.The scene of Two Socks' end made me furious. Excellent movie, I would recommend this to everyone.My first movie review ever by the way, I think it shows",

            "review_title": "Great Epic Western",
            "content": "To celebrate my 750th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. By 1990 the Western genre seemed all but dead. There had been few notable examples since \"The Shootist\" and \"The Outlaw Josie Wales\" in 1976; Clint Eastwood's \"Pale Rider\" is probably the best of the few from the eighties. The last attempt to make an epic Western had been Michael Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\", which had proved a financial disaster. It was therefore a brave move by Kevin Costner, the film's star, director and co-producer, to attempt an ambitious Western on the same scale as Cimino's.Lieutenant John Dunbar is a Civil War hero who is posted to Fort Sedgwick, a remote frontier outpost. When he arrives at the desolate fort, Dunbar finds it deserted. The only humans nearby are a group of Lakota Indians, with whom he makes contact. At first their relationships are marked by mutual mistrust and inability to communicate, but eventually Dunbar befriends the Lakota. He finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe, and falls in love with a young woman named Stands With A Fist. (She is not an Indian by birth, but a white woman who was adopted by the Lakota as a child after her family were killed by the Pawnees, the traditional enemies of the Lakota. Perhaps even in the nineties Hollywood was still uneasy about mixed-race romances). Eventually the tribe accept Dunbar as a full-fledged member and rename him Dances with Wolves after seeing him playing with a wolf. Dunbar marries Stands with a Fist, and lives for a time as a member of the tribe, whose language he has learnt, but his idyll ends when he is captured by the military, who threaten to shoot him as a traitor.During filming, budget overruns and production delays led to the film being dubbed \"Kevin's Gate\" by sceptics who felt that the project was doomed to failure. (The \"Kevin's Gate\" tag was later resurrected, with greater justification, for another Costner film, \"Waterworld\"). Cimino had deliberately set out to make a masterpiece, and though he failed his was an honourable ambition. Moreover, \"Heaven's Gate\" has many positive virtues, and Cimino's margin of failure was not as great his many critics stated. Costner, however, succeeded where Cimino failed: \"Dances with Wolves\" is, in my view, one of the cinematic masterpieces of the nineties.My view was not, admittedly, shared by everyone, although it was shared by the Academy who awarded the film seven Academy Awards including \"Best Picture\" Some felt that it was overlong, although in the case of an epic like this a running-time of three hours is amply justified. Trying to cram this story into a ninety minute, or even two hour, film, would have resulted in something unnaturally cramped and rushed. (I have only seen the three-hour version, although I understand that there is an even longer \"director's cut\".Some people disliked the film on political grounds; in his \"Hollywood vs America\" Michael Medved claimed that this was the first major Hollywood picture in which the hero is a traitor to the United States. (Strange that so experienced a critic should never have seen \"Gone with the Wind\" or any of those other old Civil War films that glorify the Confederacy!) It is, moreover, doubtful whether Dunbar actually is a traitor. He does not fight for the Lakota against the US Army; the only battle he fights in is against the Pawnees. He is guilty of, at most, deserting his post, but it could also be argued that it is the Army which has deserted him, by allowing him to be sent alone to an isolated and abandoned fort. Dunbar has to decide whether he owes a greater allegiance to the US Army or to the Lakota who have befriended him and whose culture he has come to admire.This was not the first Western to take a pro-Indian standpoint, although it is the grandest and most ambitious. There were earlier examples such as \"Broken Arrow\" or \"Cheyenne Autumn\", and such portrayals became fashionable during the sixties. Although \"Broken Arrow\" was praised when released in the fifties, it was later criticised for casting white actors such as Jeff Chandler and Debra Paget as Native Americans and having them speak English rather than Apache. Here, however, much dialogue is in the Lakota language with subtitles, and all the Lakota are played by Native American actors. \"Dances with Wolves\" ends on a sombre note, explaining that a few years later the last remnants of the free Sioux were subjugated by the U.S. Government, ending the conquest of the Western frontier states. Perhaps criticism like Medved's stems from the fact that some Americans might not like to be reminded of this less than honourable episode in their country's history.Everything about the film is on a grand scale, including John Barry's sweeping musical score and the stunning photography of the landscapes of South Dakota and Wyoming. Costner's acting is, I admit, not to everyone's taste, but to my mind he is one of the few modern actors with a genuine epic sense and the ability to convey the heroic. There are a number of other good performances, too many to mention individually, although I will say that Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene well deserved their Oscar nominations.\"Dances with Wolves\" led to a partial rehabilitation of the Western as a genre. It was followed two years later by another great Western, Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\", and Costner himself has made further examples such as \"Wyatt Earp\" and \"The Postman\" (essentially a Western with a futuristic setting). The film's importance was recently recognised when it was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of only a handful of films from the nineties to have been so honoured to date. 10/10",

First the death of Robert Pastorelli (actually from a drug overdose in response to his imminent arrest for murdering his wife) then the suicide of Charles Rocket. There is an ugly pattern here if Kevin Costner gets crushed in a freak buffalo stampede then we will know for sure. With that out of the way, this is a landmark in film. The likes of which may not be seen again in Western films for quite some time. I can't think of one that captures the beauty and intense savagery of the west in such an appealing fashion. Kevin Costner gives his career best as Lt. John J. Dunbar, a soldier who, in response to an unparalleled act of bravery on the field of battle, gets sent (quite by accident) to a remote outpost in the middle of Indian country. Alone and inexperienced, he makes friends with the local tribe and finds love, eventually becoming one himself. But the ever expanding Western frontier and its new conquerors will not forget him even if he chooses not to be a part of it. The scenery is magical and the casting was terrific. While not what you would call a happy story with a feel good ending, the ending is appealing to all of us and above all, makes sense. Clearly the accomplishment of a lifetime.",

Nonetheless, except for the smaller beginning and ending segments, the long one in the middle with \"Dances With Wolves\" and his relationship to the Sioux Indians and his romance to \"Stands With A Fist\" (Mary McDonnell) is enjoyable to watch. It's also a visual feast, stunning in parts such as the Buffalo stampedes.The version you want to watch is the extended DVD one. Other good points besides the cinematography and three likable main characters, two mentioned above and Grahame Green (\"Kicking Bird\") The Indians' dialog is interesting throughout the film and McDonnell is outstanding in her role. Her romance with Costner is one of the best I've seen in a film.What makes the film click is that combination of drama/romance/action and even some necessary humor.What was unnecessary, and the bad part of the film, is the extreme bias shown in here where all the white soldiers (except our hero) are sleazy, profane, cruel or insane - every one of them!! Talk about prejudice! Also, if you do any history checking, you'll find the Indians portrayed in actuality were anything but the generally nice people shown in this film. The truth is that they were one of the more bloodthirsty tribes...one of the worst of the Southwest. It's pathetic to read some of these reviews from such naive reviewers who have no clue of the truth, or perhaps they don't want to hear it. Costner is famous for this sort of thing in his films....but they are so entertaining, people don't bother check his claims.The cruelty, bias and some uncomfortable scenes with bloody animals, don't always make this a pleasant movie to watch no matter what side of the PC table you're on...but, overall, it's a memorable, gorgeous film that digs deep inside you.

What impressed me about this film is that it was Kevin's first directorial debut (although I think he got plenty of help from another Kevin, Kevin Reynolds who is one of my favourite directors and also a genius at epic films like this). It does say, however that the thrilling buffalo hunt scene was done by Kevin Reynolds. This movie shows us the beginnings of Manifest Destiny and also what noble creatures the indians were instead of being savages ass they are often portrayed in westerns.

Even its nearly four-hour length is just right, any shorter and the required leisurely pace with emphasis on the Remington-like photography which makes one think of a moving painting would have been lost, any longer and the movie would have become boring. \"Dances with Wolves\" is one of the few occasions when the long time slot is required to tell the story the way it should be told (\"Greed\" is another example). Kevin Costner is not much of an actor but he is one hell of a director. \"Dances with Wolves\" will stand up against any western John Ford made. Even Costner's acting is much better than the low point it would reach in his next film, \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\"Though not all that original, the story approaches its subject from a fresh angle. A somewhat mentally distraught cavalry lieutenant who was driven nearly insane by action during the Civil War is assigned a distant frontier outpost by a deranged commander who proceeds to p*ss his pants and shoot himself. The post has been recently deserted. So Lt. John Dunbar (Costner) lives as a hermit, befriended first by a lone wolf, then later by a tribe of Sioux. Living with the tribe is a white woman to whom Dunbar takes a liking. The tribe is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the buffalo for survival. The encroachment of the white man begins taking its toll with the buffalo slaughtered for tongues and hides, leaving the meat to rot. Dunbar must decide which way to go.Though long, the film moves with not a moment of respite from beginning to end. The viewer becomes part of the story and is carried along by the sweep of the lonesome, beautiful, and at times deadly, great plains, inhabited by native Americans who like all humans live lives of pleasure, pain, fleeting glory, desperation, and dreams, now threatened by outsiders who want the land and its creatures for themselves.",

The critics may have their say, but Costner's 1991 Best Picture effort is epic in all of it's facets, from the gorgeous cinematography to the heartfelt saga of Native American peoples and their treatment at the hands of the white man.I'm constantly enthralled by the lyrical names of Indians; this film offers Chief Ten Bears, Wind in His Hair, Stone Calf, Kicking Bird, and Stands With a Fist. Generally the names say something about a person's character or physical traits, certainly a lot more colorful than Smith or Jones. Even Indian language contains reverence for nature and life that is not found in most other tongues, and sadly so in an increasingly furious paced world.Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) learned this for himself when relegated to an abandoned 'soldier fort' by a pants pissing, suicidal commanding officer at Fort Hays. His journey would be filled with physical demands and frustration attempting to communicate with his newly discovered Sioux friends, yet the relationship goes both ways, and the Sioux are in constant amazement at this soldier who 'dances with wolves' on the prairie. One of the movie's great scenes and a favorite of mine as well is the one where Dunbar, Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) and Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell) attempt to teach each other their names. At least 'Dumb Bear' didn't stick with the lieutenant.Set in 1863, the movie does well not to mention any of the famous historical figures of the era from either race, as many films are prone to do. So we have no reference to Custer, Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse. Also unusual is the placement of a warring Pawnee raiding party in hostile opposition to the more peaceful Sioux tribe. Depicting their savagery in the attack on wagon driver Timmons (Robert Pastorelli) who pleads mercy for his mules, director Costner appears to be offering a balance to his film, showing that good and evil can be found in all races and cultures. The message running throughout the film is that taking the time to learn about someone who's different can be a life changing experience.\"Dances With Wolves\" can be viewed, understood and enjoyed on many levels, and it has aged well since it's 1990 release. It transcends it's Western genre limitations and offers the viewer a glimpse of what could be a better way.",

Costner plays a Civil War veteran that is sent out West after getting a great honor, and hope that troops would come with him. When he realizes that the people he lives with are Lakota (Native Americans), he starts to adapt to their lifestyle, learning their language, and learning some of their values, such as following the buffalo, and even falls in love with a white women (Mary McDonnell), who became a Lakota following her family being massacred by Pawnee Indians.The movie is both touching, and tragic, as we all know what happens as a result of what happens to them, but the movie tries to show the happiness in how they each try and make the best of hard situations (killing off Buffalo, taking away land), as the movie progresses, it gets a bit slower, but its worth some of the wait.Excellent film making.",

John Dunbar (KC) is a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out, he is not alone though. One of, if not THE movie KC will always be remembered for. For this Zoner, I think it is sheer perfection. I know it's controversial amongst movie fans, but I think the movie and KC himself deservedly beat Goodfellas at the Oscars. It's even more of a personal triumph as a professional one for KC, as it's a movie nobody wanted to make, and those willing to, wanted to make a host of changes. The major studios wouldn't provide the proper funding. They took issue with the script's length and the amount of subtitles, the latter something that KC would not budge on - on top of the film being a western, when the genre was considered dead. Because of budgetary overruns and general industry reluctance to invest, KC was forced to dig deep into his own pockets to make up the film's $18 million budget. That caused rumors that the film would be another out-of-control, embarrassing flop. In fact, some studio people were referring to it as \"Kevin's Gate\" and a vanity project etc.I remember going to see it with my childhood sweetheart at a packed screening. I have never seen such a diverse audience, my girlfriend and I were teenagers, there was a couple in their sixties or older sat next to us, and two women in their 20's who giggled like school girls, at how cute KC's butt was when he was naked. It's incredible that this was KC's first movie as a director, it's beautifully shot, brilliantly acted and John Barry's score is a winner too!! I could wax lyrical about this movie all day!! But I won't bore you all with it.The highest grossing Western of all time, with a domestic take of $184 million. Danced with Wolves ended the year, the third highest grossing movie of 1990. Beating movies such as Pretty Woman, Die Hard 2, Goodfellas, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dick Tracy, Back To The Future 3, Gremlins 2, Rocky V, Total Recall and Kindergarten Cop. Only Home Alone and Ghost made more money that year. It achieved this, without ever reaching #1 on the US box-office charts.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

And it has noble intentions, for which I give it credit. But it's hard not to be sort of annoyed by it upon subsequent viewings, in the same way I'm annoyed by Steven Spielberg movies when he's trying to atone for his white guilt. In order to puncture stereotypes about a group of people these directors think their audiences don't know enough about (in Costner's case, native Americans), they resort to making caricatures out of the white people instead. Spielberg is a much worse offender than Costner (see \"The Color Purple\"), but Costner is guilty of it too. There's an air of condescension that turns me off.But I will restate that the film has noble intentions, and Costner was taking quite a risk in bringing a three-hour film about native Americans to a mainstream audience and banking on mainstream audiences caring.Grade: B+",

It is true that, especially in the theatrical cut, the Sioux are held in too much of a beautiful light but the film, especially the extended cut, takes great pains to make them fully 3 dimensional and the film is wonderful addition to the Western canon in light of that. A lot of this is a credit to Costner who fought for the extensive use of Sioux (among other things) and Michael Blake's care to do his research. If nothing else this is a powerful rebuke of how these issues are usually treated in America cinema.On its own merits, the film is wonderful. Dunbar is a perfect canvas to paint an everyman on and his journey from the madness of Western culture to the loneliness of self-imposed isolation is powerful and heartbreaking. The relationships with Kicking Bird, Stands With a Fist, and Wind in His Hair are resonant, detailed and raw. Much credit to all of the actors for anchoring such a long story and always being engaging. The movie is slow but the slowness is heavy with meaning.Costner, as director, pushes his film into a striking naturalism that utterly fits the story. The vistas and cinematography are lush and engaging in their own right but Costner knows how to put a Western together and the beautiful plains are not pretty for their own sake. We understand why Dunbar wishes to live there and what the Sioux are fighting for. The actions are few and far between but when they happen they exciting and memorable. This is a masterwork.",

            "content": "What do Oliver!, Annie Hall, Gandhi, Shakespeare in Love, and Chicago all have in common? All won the Academy Award for Best Picture and are said to have unrightfully snubbed the win from superior movies of that given year. Unlike the films I just named, Dances With Wolves was very deserving and I consider it to be one of the best Oscar- winning films ever made. People say this robbed Goodfellas of 1990's win--an argument I completely disagree with.Taking place during America's colonialism days, Dances With Wolves is about a lonely, depressed Lieutenant named John Dunbar. He is assigned to a remote outpost near Indian tribes. He spends a few weeks alone, and is eventually befriended by the Sioux tribe where he finds a new purpose in life and is more happy than he has ever been.Don't get me wrong, I love Goodfellas. But it honestly shocks me to see how many people trash this movie just because they liked Goodfellas more. Honestly, that is pure immaturity. It seems like any movie about the mafia is everybody's choice for the year's best film. When you really watch both films, Wolves is clearly the superior achievement. Let's examine why Dances With Wolves is so much better than Scorsese's masterpiece.In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese uses pop tunes from respective eras that fit scene well. Problem is, the tunes are so good that they are distracting. John Barry is one of the greatest composers in the history of cinema and the music he creates for Dances With Wolves is so monumental. Compare the song \"Then He Kissed Me\" to John Dunbar's theme. Obviously Dunbar is victorious.Martin Scorsese uses every tool he knows to create a fun crime pic that really explores the regular life of a mobster. The dialogue is dynamite, the acting is great, and the filming techniques are awesome. Check out the \"Funny How?\" scene; Karen and Henry going to the nightclub; Henry becoming a drug addict. These are all iconic scenes well done by a talented director. Problem is, the entire movie glorifies the mafia! It makes the mob out to be great fiends who have your back no matter what and you can live the life of a king. That is sending the wrong message! This must've really inspired people to join mob families. When the mafia betrays Henry Hill, it is his fault. He blew it. He was an idiot! The other big problem I have is you can tell this is a movie. Goodfellas feels like a super long trailer. Voiceovers happen way too much, there's lots of freeze-frames, very short shots, ultimately failing to sweep the audience up into the movie's world.No let's get back to Dances With Wolves. Dances With Wolves, Barry Lyndon, and Gone With The Wind are the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Kevin Costner's epic creation is enthralling and involving, anybody that sees it will be blown away. Sure Scorsese uses great filming techniques, but what about Costner? Certain shots of the people in the landscape and rising the horses are just as (if not more) affective. The cinematography, costumes, music, sets, landscape and weather are all as gorgeous as can be. Just because it is long does that automatically make it good? No. But Dances With Wolves is truly amazing and will guarantee pull the viewer right into the movie's world. This is still one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen.So Dances With Wolves clearly has the better look, acting (as a whole), music, and feel. But it also has the better premise. This movie is about a man who has always been involved in violence and hate, but wants peace in his life. Goodfellas is about a kid who sees violence and wants to become a part of it, using everything to his advantage. This is about how man can change himself for the better. Calling Goodfellas the far superior films is severe immaturity. I remember my first beer too.If Goodfellas was an instrument, it would be a harmonica. If Dances With Wolves was an instrument, it would be a harp. If Goodfellas was an accessory, it would be a headband. If Dances With Wolves was an accessory, it would be a 24-karat diamond ring.Every frame in Dances With Wolves looks like it belongs in a national art museum.4/4",

It paved the way for actors such as Clint Eastwood and especially Mel Gibson to persue a directorial career.\"Dances with wolves\" also changed the character of the Western genre. In the 30's and 40's the rules of the game were clear. Indians were savage and bloodthirsty and the White men was bringing civilisation. Although from the '50s onwards nuances start te appear, \"Dances with wolves\" turns the division of roles completely upside down. In this film the Indians are the good guys. This is true of the Sioux clan. The rivalising Pawnee clan is portrayed just as in the early days of the Western.\"Good\" means in this film above all living in closer harmony with nature. This is the most obvious in the scenes with the buffalo's. White men killing them for their skin only and leaving the naked corpses rotting on the prairie. The Indians killing them only for food and survival.\"Dances with wolves\" is not the only Western in which a little orphaned girl is adopted by the Indians and becomes one of them. I am espacially thinking of \"The searchers\" (1956, John Ford). In \"The searchers\" however John Wayne is not interested in the Indian culture and way of life and only wants to rescue his niece from these \"wild people\". In \"Dances with wolves\" John Dunbar (played by Kevin Costner) falls in love with the white girl turned into an Indian woman and becomes an Indian himself.The character of John Dunbar is politically correct, the character of John Wayne is unfortunately historically correct. The way John Dunbar and the Sioux are showing interest in each other and work hard to overcome the communication gap is much more generic than the difference between Indians and White men alone. As Roger Ebert put it in his review: \"A civilized man is a person whose curiousity outweights his prejudices.\".\"Dances with wolves\" contains very beautiful images. It was filmed in Panavision and there is a 70 mm copy of the film. 70 mm film is unsurpassed in quality but is heavy, expensive and hard to handle. I just read in the paper that in the Netherlands some art house cinema's have re-installed equipment to project 70 mm filmstock to give special performances for film buffs.",

To say nothing about Orson Welles!  I will never be a fan of the Oscars, but there are two exceptions when the Academy went out on a limb and really got something right in giving a film a bunch of awards.  \"Dances With Wolves\" is one of those exceptions, (the other being 1984's \"Amadeus\" by Milos Forman). Everyone on Earth was expecting Martin Scorsese's \"Godfellas\" to run the table, and don't get me wrong...I LOVE \"Goodfellas\".  It's one of the best films of the decade, but it doesn't have the rare texture, detail and rich feel that \"Dances With Wolves\" has.If you haven't seen this film, don't believe all the negative talk from the other users here...go rent it at once, preferably the special edition which has much more to offer, but even if you can't find that version, see the regular anyway.

This film, along with Lonesome Dove, are the two best Westerns by far to come out of Hollywood in the last 25 years (and maybe the best ever!). Both are sheer epics, with wide ranging vistas and story lines that sweep you up and carry you away to another time.The movie is also very similar to another done in 1970, \"A Man Called Horse\", with Richard Harris, and both do an honest portrayal of the Native American.It is truly sad, near the end of this film, to see the eventual decline of the Native American way of life, and the appalling savagery of the \"Christian\" white man.Needless to say, the whites didn't come off as heroes, as they did in so many of John Wayne and other stereotypical pieces from earlier decades.Dances with Wolves is so natural. I love the pieces of humor especially in the first part of the film (ie. Costner bumping his head against the door frame of his cabin and knocking himself out). Although this isn't a comedy, there is nothing out of place. Everything fits together perfectly! Costner's a natural here.Lt. Dunbar says that the Indians aren't the bogeymen they were made out to be. I suspect he would've thought different had he fell into the hands of the Pawnee, for the few minutes they'd have allowed him to live.The Sioux were portrayed as civilized and dignified, with all of the Native American cast, headed by Graham Greene, doing a SUPERB job! And Mary McDonnell. She was outstanding! Too bad we don't see her or Costner in such films anymore. They both seem to have faded into the background, with Costner doing standard grade romantic flicks.This, along with Lonesome Dove, is a must for everyone's personal collection; to be viewed and enjoyed over and over again.If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!",

The DC is the must see version as it was with Avatar, so much more is put into context with the DC over the cinema release.Kevin Costner is one of my favourite actors and I didn't know he was the Director until after I had watched it the first time.Kevin Costner plays the main character, John Dunbar who at the beginning of the movie is about to get his foot amputated. This he objects to and after struggling to get his boot back on, gets on a horse, and charges at the enemy, trying to commit suicide. He fails in his attempts, but helps turn the tide of the battle for the Union soldiers. This gets him in favour with his superior officers and when he asks for a transfer out to the West he is assigned an abandoned prairie post.This is where the movie really starts and ends.Many would find this movie rather boring in places but these have to be endured and overcome or you will miss out on the really good stuff.\nA wonderful movie that can be watched more than once with ease, even though it is nearly 4 hours long if watching the only version worth watching.",

            "content": "Tired of the war and facing the loss of his legs, Lieutenant Dunbar rides towards suicide but finds only glory for his \"brave\" actions on the front line. The reward is the posting of his choice and he selects an outpost on the western frontier so that he can enjoy the country while it still remains. Arriving there he finds an abandoned fort with plenty of supplies but decides to make the best of it and enjoy the quiet. After initial tension and mistrust between him and his new neighbours, Dunbar gradually makes acquaintance with the holy man from the nearest Sioux tribe. With time he becomes friends and slowly starts to bond with the tribe and be accepted. His appreciation of their ways grow but at some point he knows the frontier will move and other white men will come, and in greater numbers.With the box office, awards and critical acclaim that greeted this film, it is easy to embrace it as the greatest film ever or to deride it as part of the traditional backlash against anything successful. However, watching it again 15 years later the truth is somewhere in-between. There is no doubting that the film has problems but it does have an epic sweep to that works well with the slow, steady pace to it. It is certainly not dull but it is hardly the fastest film you will have ever seen. If you can buy into this approach then it is actually quite engaging and the film develops nicely along with Dunbar as a character and as a person \u0096 although this is not to say it is perfect. To the detriment of the film both Dunbar and the narrative are too na\u00efve for their own good. His narration is clunky and simplistic, which is pretty much what could be said of the black/white view of the Sioux (noble people without any real fault) and white people (ignorant, heartless and boorish people). That it does this is no surprise but it still reduces the value of the film by how simplified things are.Despite this I still enjoyed the basic story and it did engage me sufficiently. The ending was obvious and a bit cloying and some plot devices seemed more sentimentalised than they really needed to be but otherwise it did the job. Costner was at the height of his powers with this film but personally I didn't think his performance was overly sincere and laboured, failing to produce a \"real\" person and focusing instead on telling his version of history. McDonnell is more convincing early on but she doesn't really help the idea that this is very much a white version of the story. Greene adds a touch of the genuine to a role that really doesn't have much more than \"quiet dignity\" written across it. The support is mostly good although they do tend to all fall into the clich\u00e9 roles based on their race. However the film mostly belongs to Costner and, although not as strong as he was in JFK, he does enough to match the general, rather na\u00efve approach of the material. As director he does well with the vast landscapes and the action while making good use of the score so that it tugs the heartstrings without it feeling like you're swimming in syrup.Overall this is not the classic that history would have you believe, nor is it a terrible, revisionist piece of garbage that others claim. It is somewhere in-between, being a patient epic that is worthy while also being too na\u00efve and sentimental to really convince and have lasting value. Worth seeing then for what it essentially does but be prepared to buy into its approach and its simplification of the issues.",

Making his debut behind the camera, Costner attempts to purge the Western genre of its racist overtones and cowboy clich\u00e9s, but he does so by introducing anachronistic attitudes and expressions: his protagonist is too obviously a late 20th century hero transplanted to the Wild West. The impressive wide screen photography certainly captures the epic scope and expansive visual scale of the Prairies, and the depiction of the native Sioux (speaking their own language, through subtitles) is, for once, altogether free of condescension. But the script is little more than a long, transparent apology for the mistreatment of Native Americans, with Costner carrying all the sins of European culture on his back and sharing the Sioux agony like a born martyr. If any other paleface were even half as human the film might have been more credible.",

Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the \"new genius of American art films\". Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the \"John Wayne\" bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a \"misunderstood\" progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish? Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature. Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything. What more is there to say about this lousy film except that it had no 'truth' about it and it wasn't a loving portrayal as some people claim it to be?",

As  the more acute critics of this film have pointed out, this film sentimentalizes and sanitizes Sioux culture.It is, in fact an interesting example of the American equivalent of what Edward Said called \"orientalism\"., which could be called \"indianism\". An ideal \"indian ' culture is created to act as a kind of American pastoral, an \"anti-Industrial\" mythos.Of course, there is nothing wrong with good pastoral, nor with an intelligent critique of the excesses of industrialization.However, sentimentality and falsification  do not make for good pastoral, nor do self righteousness and pseudo -intellectualism make for intelligent criticism of industrialist materialism. Note here that I do not mean to denigrate or insult the Sioux-or any other American tribe.Their REAL cultures are fascinating. In fact the American Indian actors are uniformly excellent in this film. I have a sneaking suspicion that they were laughing behind their backs at the pompous , guilt ridden, hypocritical naive, paleface, who had come among them to make this film praising their culture. Not a single White man ( other than Costner ) is portrayed as anything other than brute. The only white character other than Costner who is portrayed as having a soul is Stands with a Fist..and she had the good fortune of being kidnapped and having her family massacred by the peace loving Indians. Let me reiterate. This is NOT  a pro -Indian film. It is a patronizing, pompous film, with Costner portraying himself as the benevolent Great White God, Finding  Himself among the Noble Savages.Repeatedly, Costner  echoes Christian iconography and language in an effort to transform his character into some \"crucified hero\" out of Peckinpah. Someday, people will marvel that Kevin Costner beat out a genius named Martin Scorsese for best director",

Instead, it turns out to be something completely different; it's a slow-moving drama, filled with romance and pathos, in which the action is limited to just a few brief scenes.Instead, this film is an ode to the Sioux Indians in the same way that THE LAST SAMURAI is an ode to the ancient warriors of Japan. Through a process of gentle reflection, we get to witness their customs, their rituals and the way of life they enjoyed shortly before their culture was subsumed by the new-wave Americans. As director and star, Kevin Costner is in his element, carefully crafting what is undoubtedly his best film.It's a thorough and compelling piece of film-making, featuring fine performances (particularly Graham Greene and Rodney A. Grant) and some quite wonderful cinematography. Although the narrative is very slow-moving - and the theatrical cut alone runs for 3 hours - it's never boring, instead completely engrossing. I particularly liked the way the animals - such as the horse and the wolf - have characters all of their own. There's a sense of foreboding as the story progresses, and the last hour in particular is tragic beyond belief and had me in tears. A masterpiece.",

            "content": "Kevin Costner's great epic Dances with Wolves is one of those films that I've been meaning to watch for years and years and just never got around to it, mostly because of the prodigious running time. At almost exactly four hours, it is something of a commitment, but never for a second does it get slow or boring. Actually, I should say a majority of the movie is slow, but it's a testament to how good it is that it is still never boring. Kevin Costner stars as a Civil War soldier sent to a remote outpost with vague instructions. His orders were given by a general who is clearly out of his mind, which sort of throws a veil of mystery over his assignment, which is perfect for making us wonder how long he is really going to be stuck out there in that sea of prairie before relief arrives. Maybe forever. Hopefully forever, as it turns out.The major accomplishment of Dances with Wolves is that it so thoroughly and so personally allows modern American audiences to relate to the plight of the Native Americans as the white man plowed across the frontier, destroying so much of the untouched natural environment and the peoples and cultures that lived there. Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner), takes his post and faithfully performs his duties and awaits his relief, gradually becoming more and more comfortable in his surroundings and, most importantly, forming amazing friendships with a nearby Sioux tribe and a wild wolf. For much of the film, nothing much is happening other than the slow development of these relationships, and it is one of the most delightfully entertaining and watch-able things I've ever seen in a western. The only thing that I had a little bit of a hard time was accepting Mary McDonnell in one aspect of her role. She fits the image of a white girl raised by a Sioux tribe, but when she attempts to speak English as though she hasn't spoken it since she was a little girl, her supposed stumbling is not very convincing. Then again, this could be because I am an ESL teacher in China, so I am surrounded all day every day by people who speak broken English for real, so to see an American actress trying to do it doesn't quite work for me.Nonetheless, The relationship that Dunbar forms with her and her tribe is an amazing piece of film-making. A friendship between an early American soldier and a Native American tribe has never been done before, so this is a major accomplishment and a major contribution to our knowledge of American cultural history. And on top of that, the movie is astonishingly beautiful.It is genuinely heartbreaking when the whites arrive near the end of the film, as we all know they will. They are so callous and vicious and uncaring, interested only in killing anyone and anything in their way, rather than trying to understand them, the way Dunbar would.The character depth is also amazing. It is interesting to wonder, for example, how Dunbar would have handled the approaching Sioux had he not been alone or had been better armed. I don't think he would have reacted differently, although around him almost certainly would have. But he and the Sioux are civilized men, and civilized men are more curious than brutal. There is some tension when they meet, but neither of them are inclined to kill without reason. The Sioux, also, are complex characters. They are clearly a very spiritual and loving people, but they also have a lot of the characteristics of what were, and are, called \"savages.\" They murdered and scalped the white men who brutally killed and skinned all of those buffalo. They had reason to do the killing that they did, but their style of punishment illustrated a chasm between them that Dunbar knew could never be completely crossed. Because of this, the movie ends in the only way that it really can, which is another thing that it does so well. A good movie should have an ending that seems perfectly natural, that seems like the only thing that could have really happened, but still be a surprise. Dances with Wolves has that and so much more. This is one of our greatest modern epics.",

            "content": "I read them all, and seem to find that most bad reviews on IMDb are saved for last. Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, I think this was truly an epic masterpiece in every way - bad acting from Costner (Dunbar), included. We have to consider perhaps that is how his character was written.....Does ANYONE click on the \"more\" button for \"Trivia\"? If you had, you'd have read that Costner wasn't the only actor considered for the lead. You also would have read that he was interested in the story BEFORE it was written into the novel, and encouraged Michael Blake to do that first, then the script. I feel it was a big plus that Costner was involved from the very beginning. Paid-off well in his directing.In the \"goof\" department, I found a huge one which no one else mentioned. When they have captured \"Dunbar\" and have him all banged-up in the tent, some soldiers are standing in the doorway looking at him. One was of Asian descent, which plays well for not showing discrimination today, but there would NEVER have been an Asian in anyone's army in this country in those days - they were forcefully segregated. Maybe a reminder that \"Native\"-Americans walked over land-bridges from China? Did anyone else notice that Dunbar started to become Indian when his moustache disappeared? No scenes to show Indians shaving.....\"Dancer with Wolves\" is a fabulous movie to get lost in, no matter how long it is. Gotta get the DVD ! Costner surely got it all together for the cinematography, the casting was very good, costuming authentic. I don't find anything to dislike and a lot to really like in the film. I, too, think \"Kicking Bird\" (Graham Greene) should have won an Oscar for his brilliant performance, as should have Rodney A. Grant (Wind in his Hair). I saw him shopping in Ralph's and he looked exactly as he did in the movie - very friendly, what a hunk. Mary McDonnell was perfectly cast, and did a great acting-job. \"Red Crow\" was the ultimate chief, as Nathan Lee as \"Smiles a Lot\" was stellar. Every role was played to the fullest, whether the film was actually authentic or not - I didn't care, I'm not a stickler for authenticity so long as I enjoy the whole thing. Films with good stories that show the breathtaking beauty of this continent always get me - I'm so glad some people are filming it before the condos go up.I loved the score. Few people caught the fact that the officer who sent \"Dunbar\" to the last post was a trifle insane. He apparently couldn't have handled any combat, but was put-out that he was assigned to do nothing in some remote outpost. The actor who portrayed \"Dunbar's\" guide was absolutely fabulous, as nasty as he was. His death was how we are used to seeing Indians brutally act-out in most movies and was touchingly played. \"I bet someone back East is wondering, 'why doesn't he write'?\" What a line !!....badly delivered by \"Dunbar\" to \"Two Socks\" after a long visit with his neighbors.....The battle with the Pawnees was so beautifully filmed. Just like today, they were battling to keep their country and take the spoils of who were weaker. The romance between \"Dunbar\" and \"Stand with a Fist\" were poetic; so glad there wasn't a lot of sex-scenes in here.....completely unnecessary. It was thrilling to see the huge herd of buffalo, no matter where they came from.It matters not to me that some critics, professional or amateur, panned this movie. It was/is a true escape for me into a beautiful world that has no equal today. What a pleasure to remind me that Native-Americans were intelligent humans, also.....and lived with dignity in their own life. My gratitude is for everyone who had a role in bringing this film to the screen - what a great movie for children. Thank you ! A 20.....",

It wasn't until ten years later when I saw this film that something about the destructiveness of white people really hit me. There have been films that I have seen since that bothered me. Films like Instinct and Boyz and The Hood were eye openers as well, but this was one of the first ( along with Mississippi Burning ) that made me embarrassed for being white. I wanted to go outside and apologize to the world for the race that I belong to. It is that powerful of a film. This must have been something that Costner was building up to in the years past because this has to be an incredibly personal film to him because there is so much raw power and emotion put into it.DWW shows us that in-spite of what we have been taught by watching old Westerns, the natives, like any other race of people had their good points and their bad points. They weren't the war mongering people that we have been taught to believe. They had families, basically wanted to be left alone and were good at living by their own code. Once the white man came along and destroyed their world, everything changed. Although I am white, watching films like this and Mississippi Burning makes me ashamed of what white people are capable of. I realize people of all colours of skin can commit acts of genocide, but watching this film reminds me of how terrible my ancestors were 100's of years ago.I really applaud this film and I am so amazed that Costner did the job he did in his first effort. This film deserved every Oscar it received and if it wasn't for such an incredible performance from Joe Pesci, then Graham Greene probably would have taken home a best supporting actor Oscar.This is a really important film and it has something to say.

Graham Greene (also Oscar-nominated) is the primary member of the tribe and Mary McDonnell (in an Oscar-nominated part as well) plays a white woman who has lived almost her whole life with the Lakota Sioux.

Since it's my intention to praise rather than rant during this review, Jeremy Irons will be spared for the moment.Costner's three-hour masterpiece chronicles one man's relationship with the Native Americans near his outpost after the war. It's a love letter to American scenery, an homage to the people that land belongs to, and a beautiful representation of Michael Blake's novel.Kevin Costner, usually known for charm, All-American good-looks, and sports movies, shows so many hidden talents in this film. Dances With Wolves is a true masterpiece, and unlike other epics with bloody battle scenes like The Last of the Mohicans, this one can be watched over and over again. It's touching, charming, delicate, and grand. It's pretty obvious, going into an epic Civil War/Native American movie, that there will be some tragic scenes.

I remember learning about the Indian's way of life in my history classes and because of that I appreciate the historical accuracy in which the Indian's way of life is portrayed throughout the movie. I cant compare Dances With Wolves to any movies that came out before it, but I can say that it likely served as an inspiration for more stories that came out in Film and TV in later years, such as Avatar, which I believe was inspired by Dances With Wolves.I praise the great performances done by Kevin Costner (John Dunbar / Dances With Wolves), Mary McDonnell (Stands With A Fist), Graham Greene (Kicking Bird) and Rodney A. Grant (Wind In His Hair). I'm glad they had all actors playing Indians speaking Indian instead of English in the film, as I know they have done that in other movies. I think Kevin Costner's character had a great character arc, starting off in the movie as a wounded and suicidal soldier and finishing as a happily married white Sioux who resents the white military.The cinematography in the movie is quite stunning, and the score of the movie is really something! I think that John Barry's score of Dances With Wolves is one of the greatest scores of a movie ever composed.I think this film is well deserving of the 7 Academy Awards it won, including Best Picture and Best Director.

            "content": "This film was very well made throughout because it looked at what Lt. Dunbar did to find his true self.  His quest to \"see the frontier before it disappeared\" was very successful since he met the Lakota people who showed him what life was truly about.  I believe Lt. Dunbar found his true inner self among the Lakota people.  He never found that among the whites.  He felt that there was something wrong, like something was missing in his life and he rightfully needed to go to the frontier to pursue what he needed to find and he found it with ease. However like any other film, there are the usual misconceptions about certain things.  For example, the scene where Lt. Dunbar rescued Stands with a Fist from committing suicide before taking her back to the village. When Wind in his Hair approached him to grab her out of his arms, he ordered Lt. Dunbar to leave the village and to leave the Lakota people alone altogether. If this kind of thing happened in real life back then in the 1870's, the warrior would have not only took the woman from him, but he may have wanted to kill him too for just showing up like that among the villagers without warning.  If this kind of thing occurred, (with him bringing the woman back) it would not have mattered if he did the right thing.  The fact that a WHITE MAN showed his face would be a cause for major concern.Another possible misconception may be that the Pawnee were NOT traditional enemies of the Lakota like the way the film portrays them. Unfortunately the Lakota fought among other Indian Nations at the time but what made it worse was when after the whites arrived, they lured the Indian Nations to each other so that they could fight among themselves.  It was sad to see that kind of thing happening. But............. anyways............ thank you kindly once again for allowing me to review on this great film. See ya in the next review. :D",

            "content": "Particularly, I found sad that a great western like \"Dances with Wolves\" is mostly forgotten in the recent years, being only remembered when some people on Internet make a bad joke about how \"Avatar\" from James Cameron \"ripped -off\" this film. That kind of comments made me think that the people that keep saying things like that doesn't even saw this excellent film in first place: Only the premise of this movie has some vague similarities with \"Avatar\": The characters, story, development and setting are completely different. And both are very good.While \"Avatar\" focus more in action and in the incredible visuals, \"Dances with Wolves\" is more slow-paced and meditative, being more focused in the drama and the relationship between the characters, without being boring.The characters are quite different too:John Dunbar (Here wonderfully played by Kevin Costner, a great and underrated actor) has almost anything in common with the hero of \"Avatar\", Jake Sully. And don't get me started in the rest of the cast:Most of them are not even remotely similar.Sure, the premise of a military man who eventually became part of a tribal culture is the only thing that both movies have in common, but besides that, there is almost none similarity.Anyway both \"Avatar\" and \"Dances with Wolves\" are both good movies, but very different between each other. The absurd comparisons that are constantly made reveal the fact that most of the viewers have forgotten almost everything about this great movie, remembering only the basic premise of it. Which is a shame, because this is an excellent film, with a great story and many beautiful scenes.",

Which turned out to be no real surprise, as the movie is chock-full of beautiful nature scenes and massive movements of people and buffalo, because once you get past all the window dressing, the storyline is simplistic and slow-moving and the characters are mostly stereotypes.The Sioux are the \"good\" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the \"evil\" Indians, and the American soldiers (except for Lt. Dunbar) are all complete buffoons who make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism. The reality, of course, is that cruelty, violence, and imperialism were practiced not only by the white man but by Indian nations against one another. The white man won because the Indians hated each other too much to unite (and still do). But Hollywood movies rarely make genuine attempts at telling history accurately anyway.I should note that MAD Magazine, when it satirized this movie by comparing it with several others, said that none of the movies (Dances With Wolves included) were a serious depiction of the American Indian. I agree.",

He made many awful movies, so far, but this one is a real under low, a real failure. Well, there are 2 great moments - the excellent scenery and animals. They are very good and sweet. The rest is very preachy, predictable, real boring and yawning all 4 long slow hours. This is what they call a heritage? Maybe, I was not impressed - Kevin made a movie about himself, for himself and with much of his beloved his self. Sorry, this does not work.

Movies which are there to teach you a lesson in life you should never forget.I consider Dances with Wolves as such. Despite its amazing length of 3 hours, I wish it would last more as I feel inhabited by the spirit and the beauty of this movie.I'm mesmerized by the beauty of the Frontier. It's revealing its majesty throughout the picture with those gorgeous mountainous and woody landscapes. It gives you an impression of freedom far away from our civilization. It's also powerful as those herds of buffaloes are running in the wilderness. It's a tribute to the Nature beauty before it's slowly taken over by humanity which is not such a good thing as all we are able to do is to destroy everything.The story itself is a life lesson about trying to learn from each other despite our evident differences and live together instead of destroying each other. It's a story about humanity, tolerance and respect. Some values we tend to lose so often. Throughout John Dunbar, we learn that the best way to survive is through peace and that people we consider as ruthless enemies can become our friends if we start to understand and learn from our differences.The casting is just awesome. Kevin Costner is inhabited as Lt John Dunbar, a US Army officer who survived the horror of the Civil war and on his own request decide to retire as a Frontier man. There is a feeling of freedom transpiring from him. The scene when he dances around the fire is so emotional and beautiful. Mary McDonnell's performance as Standing With Fists is as aerial and gracious as she can be. She is making such a sweet couple with Kevin Costner. The duo is perfectly completed by Graham Greene as the watchful and protective More Kicking Birds.To be honest everyone is playing its part well even the US soldiers who torture Kevin Costner as they consider him as a traitor. They are giving chills and despise, a sign of their acting talent.I cant give anything else but a 10.",

            "content": "The talented and famous Kevin Costner during his great career he never received a deserved recognition for his impeccable performances. He had to sit on the director's chair and act at the same time to be finally awarded, and it wasn't for nothing. But to be able to start talking about the work of Costner and his great team, let's start talking about the wonderful story.\"Dances with Wolves\" begins during the American Civil War with the Lieutenant Dunbar (Kevin Costner), tired of all the war and after facing a near-death experience in the middle of a battlefield, he asks to be transferred to the unknown area of America, \" The Frontier \", a vast green area with only animal and native life. Dunbar always dreamed of know and explore the frontier before she disappeared with the economic advancement of the Americans. But on this trip he is faced with the indigenous tribe, the \"Sioux\", and with them the great change of his life.A film that works as a Western with a vast Western environment and even moments of fantastic action in the Western style, but the film manages to go much deeper than that. From the beginning, the film manages to put ourselves on the feet of Dunbar, from the output of the world he was born into the unexplored world. The 1st hour of the film we only see Dunbar with his internal monologues and dialogs with his horse and a wild wolf that serves as their only company, but always with \"Kicking Bird\" (Graham Greene), a member of the Sioux tribe, watching him. Michael Blake's writing is just fantastic (who also manages to be loyal to his own work) making a fantastic job deepening Dunbar since a lonely man to a great friend of the Sioux.The film not only puts us at Dunbar's place but we get to feel the same feelings that he has regarding to the Sioux that goes from admiration to love. The Sioux can not only be an indigenous people with a great culture but nourish a huge intelligence and respect between each other, and they also have a innocent and good sense of humor (they fart; insults jokingly) making each one very realistic and human. We even feel a bit of the relationship between Dunbar and \"Stand Fist\" (Mary McDonnell), no big surprise, beyond beautiful she is smart and brave and also be the only white people among the tribe.Not only the writing of the film is fantastic maintaining an excellent character development but Costner's direction is just superb. Behind the camera he delivers a flawless direction putting us closely to the action scenes and makes us feel in the midst of the beautiful green desert with beautiful scenery magnificently filmed.The cast also stands out without difficulty: Kevin Costner is already superb behind the camera and in front of it would be no different with a sparkling gleam in his eye and his way of speaking the language of the Sioux without difficulty is just stunning; Mary McDonnell fantastic in every detail; Graham Greene honor his Native heritage perfectly.Kevin Costner was able to show a real talent for management and shines with a sparkling performance with a superb cast, all included in this beautiful story of a man who went out to find his place and eventually found himself. A wonderful writing and direction and an ending that made the strongest gets wet in tears, \"Dances with Wolves\" is a true classic masterpiece.",

            "content": "This movie left me speechless. It is a Hollywood epic without the \"Hollywood epic\" feel. It is beautiful in form and content. Costner's camera directs our gaze along the raw, beautiful West without forcing our emotions. It doesn't settle for cheap tricks. The dialogue is devoid of cliches - it is Hemingwayesque in conciseness and in poetry. The story is both a deviously simple tale of a Union soldier encountering Sioux Indians in the unexplored American West and a profound contemplation of deep compassion and love that can develop between people who do not even speak the same language. It is about almost metaphysical, no, entirely metaphysical connections between cultures that transcend our regular forms of communication. It is also about communal and intensely personal growth through an unquenchable curiosity and a desire to understand and learn. \"Dances With Wolves\" is about listening, not speaking and it is probably the first, and the greatest anti-Western made. It is a phenomenal predecessor to the great \"Unforgiven.\" The cinematography in this movie alone is enough to make one sit through the entire three or four hours (depending on which version you are watching). The cast is phenomenal, the chemistry between them not forced or full of histrionics. In fact, \"Dances With Wolves,\" despite its length, is actually full of profound restraint. More often that not, it is the silences that speak in this film, not the words - a pattern which runs hand in hand with its main themes. And, finally, it is a deeply American movie. It serves as a perfect elegy to the American West as it was in the 1800s and far before. However it is not a movie that seeks to blame (though, as many have pointed, it does not shed good light on the whites), but it is above all a love story which is evident in nearly every frame. Kevin Costner, regardless of whether you like some of his other movies or not, has made a great, deeply intelligent and sensitive film.",

            "content": "Costner's Dances With Wolves is an aesthetically beautiful film that displays Hollywood's ability to represent changes in social perspective and the Indian myth. America's turn towards the sympathetic Western, initiated around the 1950's in such films as Delmer Daves's Broken Arrow (1950), helped alter the mainstream image of the American Indian and further develop the \"noble savage\" myth. It should be noted that Dances With Wolves is not an attempt to portray the history of the Sioux and their interactions with white men as an absolute truth, rather it is a symbolic work that explores the inner desire to find the American self as it relates to the Indian. Multiple myths intertwine through the narrative to weave a cinematic masterpiece that captures its audience's minds and astonishes them with its lush visuals. Hailed as a terrific film by those who see it, it is also a thought provoking film by those who study it.The protagonist of the film, John Dunbar (Costner), is the vehicle for many statements about the search for a distinct American identity. The quest to find oneself in the wilderness and shed the stain of European ancestry is pivotal in the film. John Dunbar \"goes Indian\" and finds the Sioux way of life a truer model for a human being, devoid of the hypocrisies and evils of industrial WASP society. White to Red is developed throughout the film, and Costner delivers the transformation piecemeal, discarding Dunbar's uniform, language, loyalties, and eventually his name.The film stands apart from much of the early Western genre in that the Indian is the benevolent good guy, and the white man is the enemy. Many polar relationships are at odds (and also viewed as American): industry and nature, nomad and settlement, innocence and decadence, Red and White. The film uses clever strategies to validate the Americanness of contradictory poles of each relationship dealing with Indian and Western myths. For example the contradiction between savage and noble Indian is treated by including both kinds of Indian myth-types. The Pawnee are shown as bloodthirsty warmongers, while the Lakota are seen as peace loving defenders of their hunting lands. This representation also affords the film the capacity to show American Indians as both good and bad guys. So the violence in the film elicits an identification with the good guys, which should startle the viewer from typical notions of the Indian myth. Can all Indians be bad? All they all good? Are only some tribal nations good? And if so, who determines which one are? Be sure to question any and all generalizations that you may recall about the American Indian when watching this film. Its vivid cinematography and musical score help create an epic story feel, as does its length of 3+ hours. Its length isn't cumbersome and allows a lot of material and character development due to its relaxed but captivating pace. I recommend Dances With Wolves not only on its technical and visual achievements, but especially with its treatment of the contradictions inherent in modern American perceptions about the history of its original inhabitants.",

            "content": "Kevin Costner made many ill-received movies; some can even be labeled as \"bad\" despite their \"good\" intentions. It's only fair then to acknowledge that \"Dances With Wolves\" is not just Costner's finest hour, but a peak of excellence and significance reached by the Western genre. Get \"Cat Ballou\" off the American Film Institute's Top 10 Westerns and put \"Dances With Wolves\" where it belongs. Oh, and by the way, this comes from a \"Goodfellas\" fan.Indeed, we know the level of 'hatred' \"Dances With Wolves\" generated is inversely proportional to the popularity of Martin Scorsese's gangster epic. Well, \"Goodfellas\" is my all-time favorite film right after the two first \"Godfather\" and I saw the film perhaps five times more than Costner's masterpiece, but just because it lost the Best Picture, Best Director and other statuettes, doesn't mean that I should vent my anger on the winner, so give it a break and enjoy it, regardless of your opinion about \"Goodfellas\", it is possible to appreciate both films. Now, I close the \"Goodfellas\" chapter and get back to \"Dances With Wolves\" because there's a lot to say about it. Costner's best contributions to cinema were based on the two most American defining themes: baseball with \"Bull Durham\" and \"Field of Dreams\" and in \"Dances\", the vast plains of the frontier become the field of American lost dreams. As a fan of Gary Cooper and other Hollywood Western legends, Costner, along with Clint Eastwood, contributed to the resurrection of a dying genre in America's land. Although I'm not sure Clint Eastwood would have focused on a native-themed movie (his films centered on solitary characters carrying the burden of a haunting past), \"Dances with Wolves\" is about a young Civil War officer, Lieutenant John Dunbar, who seizes the opportunity of a promotion to get exiled in a remote outpost near the frontier, before it belongs to History.The heroic deed that earns Dunbar this peaceful job is perhaps the only moment that feels a bit Hollywood-like, after that, the story immediately plunges us into a slow but meaningful journey where left on his own, Dunbar write his memories and shares his thoughts about the landscape, his loneliness and a mysterious wolf who comes to visit him on a regular basis. At that moment, Dunbar embodies the spirit of the frontiersmen who came to unexplored lands wondering whether they were hostile or not. It's a matter of time before his presence alerts the Natives, some of them are Pawnees but a lucky hazard make them meet the wrong man and he's savagely killed and scalped.It is interesting that the first Natives we meet incarnate the negative stereotype, but it also reveals something essential about the film, it doesn't apply the reverse racism consisting on sanctifying the minorities. The film doesn't find excuses, or alibis, every people are showed on an equal level of humanity, and also, sometimes, savagery, for even the White soldiers display the most brutal and inhumane acts and incarnate that \"haunting past\" America carries like an Eastwoodesque character. But there's a central piece in the film, that is magnificent, which is, the mutual discovery between the Sioux and Dunbar. It goes through a wide range of emotions: puzzlement, suspicion, and then curiosity takes the most of them and they just go for it. People complain that the film is too long, well, hell yes, it's as long as it needs to make dialogue possible. Because something happens when the Sioux discover Dunbar, the movie stops being shown from his perspective and we get a whole quarter of hour in the Sioux village. During this sequence, you see the sorcerer Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) sharing his thoughts with the wise Chief Ten Bears (Floyd Westerman) or the impetuous Wind in the Hair (Rodney Grant), together they discuss what kind of sign a naked White man could be: an omen? a blessing? How can they approach him, and a whole debate goes on about his hostility. That's the film's masterstroke, for one moment, Dunbar ceases to be the subject but the object of the Sioux' community, the roles are reversed and this is why \"Dances With Wolves\" is important. It humbles the American perspective and takes its time to make the first exchanges possible. This moment is also essential because it tells us that the path sometimes to hostility is paved by the very struggle of communication. Even with friendly intentions, you can't sometimes understand the words, the rituals and many of them seem 'barbaric' at first glance. That the film acknowledges these differences is also a credit to its intelligence and its respect to ours.The script manages to simplify the communication through the character of Standing-with-a-Fist, a White woman, played by Mary McDonnell, adopted by the Sioux after her family was killed by the Pawnees. Her English is rusty but understandable enough to offer a right bridge of communication and naturally, there's a genuine romance growing between Dunbar and her, and it's never thrown at our faces, it takes its time so it feels natural and realistic... although the film has a lot to borrow from Hollywood, from the inspirational score to the heart-pounding battles and buffaloes' hunts. Yet, that a film found such a balance between Hollywood tradition and a documentary-like immersion in Natives tradition, makes it the perfect link between John Ford and Arthur Penn.Penn directed the underrated \"Little Big Man\" and it's fair to mention the film in a review of \"Dances With Wolves\", Penn was the first to provide an inside look on the Natives' lives and to show what looked like a genocide on the Native population. \"Dances With Wolves\" doesn't need to, through this three-hour experience, we're able to face the value of the loss, for it's a swan song of the Native whose resonance is as haunting as a wolf's howl.",

            "content": "Before I watch this movie, I have heard about it as one of the most famous epic western genre films in America. Generally, it is an extreme long art work which it runs almost four hours; meanwhile it is fulfilled with visual shocks and a thoughtful story for me, at least.As the beginning, the scene which Dunbar requests transferring him to western frontier, gives me different feeling than other western genre films which I heard about or have seen before, because Dunbar does not seem like a traditional hero who is muscular or physical strength. When he arrives at Fort Sedgwick and starts to rebuild the fort there, I recognize this movie presents the real life which frontiers had to deal with all problems by themselves at that time. Dunbar has to face to the wild environment and his neighborhood, a Sioux tribe, whose members have attempts to steal his horse several times and threaten him. In this point, the movie gives me convictive evidence about individualism and self-reliance for Americans.Belonging to the development of the story, Dunbar not only lives at the frontier but also starts to talk with Sioux tribe through the white woman, adapted daughter of Kicking Birds. As a \"hero\", Dunbar is depicted as an honest and kind-hearted man instead of cold-blooded killer, which I imagine every soldier will be. Meanwhile, Sioux tribe does not seem to be unfriendly or aggressive. They are native people who live in the western America for a long time. To adapt such wretched environment, Native Americans have their unique lifestyle. In my opinion, it is also one of the reasons why inventiveness is regarded as an American spirits. At last of the movie, the last free Sioux is conquered by western frontiers. It means another \"new world\" has been established; also it shows other hints about current Americans' personalities.Although the story has been ended, I cannot help stopping my imagination and thoughts. It tells me not only the fantastic history of American frontiers, but also guides me to rediscover the profound contexts of Native Americans. It should be said, no one likes bloody wars, I hope all \"heroes\" who we know will be just seen in movies, while their spirits should be left in our lives forever.",

There he makes friends with Indians and becomes one of them, called Dances with Wolves...I don't like westerns. I'm not a big fan of any actor in this film. I don't like 4 hour movies. I don't like conventional stories. But \"Dances with Wolves\" remains one of my favorite movies ever. The only way for me to describe it is to say that it's simply pure magic and a beautiful allegory of a man finding out who he is and what he wants to do with his life. The 7 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes are well deserved. Basically, all of the scenes are simple, but have some intense power to them. For example, the scene where Dunbar sees the wolf for the first time and wants to shoot him, but then changes his mind for some reason, is wonderful ( the music by John Barry there is perfect ). Or the one where Dunbar and Stands with a fist sneak out of the forest to have intercourse. Or when the captured Dunbar spots his dead horse. All very emotional and powerful situations, so heart wrenching that they turned my mind upside down. I do have some complaints here and there, but they are ultimately minor flaws.-----------Now, I'm quite surprised how cold some critics are towards this film. I'm not buying that stuff that the reason is that they don't like Kevin Costner because I, for example, don't like Clint Eastwood either and still have to admit that the man made a great film with \"Unfrogiven\". Honestly, I would prefer \"Dances\" over top 250 films like \"Pulp fiction\", \"Silence of the lambs\", \"American Beauty\" and \"Goodfellas\" anytime. Now that I mentioned \"Goodfellas\" I have to clear something out. Many complain how that mafia epic should have won the Oscar for best picture and by going on the critics site rotten-tomatoes.com I found out \"Goodfellas\" average grade is 8.8/10, while \"Dances\" is only 7.1/10. Scorsese's film from 1990 really is excellent, but it's also cold and mechanical and can't be compared to the sheer beauty of the intimate film with a soul like \"Dances with Wolves\".Grade: 10/10",

The first third rewarded that with gorgeous visuals, an excellent opening set in the American Civil War, an interesting main character and wonderful scenery. Particular praise must go to a single shot of a rain cloud that is the second best bit of weather on film that I've seen, after the ending of THE DUELLISTS. After this everything started going downhill rapidly.At heart the problem is that this is a vanity project adapted from a novel by the novelist. Hence a running time at least one-third over-long (plenty of material could and should have been cut). Hence long, dull, often quite stupid voice-overs that are novelistic in length and badly delivered by Kevin Costner, whose voice is far less impressive than his whiskers (which are shaved off halfway through, leaving him with an absurd mullet haircut). Hence also the ridiculous portrayal of both Indians and Americans. The American characters are handled with all the subtlety of a propagandist, being uniformly cruel, stupid and close-minded. The Indians meanwhile are, beyond the token bad Indian (played by the same amazing hawk-faced Indian that always plays this role), wise and tolerant to a fanciful degree. There is absolutely no complexity to either side, nor is the story put in any kind of historical context. So, a beautiful but badly-flawed film with an interesting concept that goes on and on until you're practically shouting at the screen for the 7th Cavalry to storm on in and slaughter all the Sioux, thereby ending the never-ending turgid voice-overs and fire-lit pow-wows.

If this was British India instead of the American west the British colonial officials would be saying Costner had gone native.Dances With Wolves tells the story of Lieutenant John Dunbar who after a suicidal act that gets him a medal also gets him transfered to the western frontier where only a corporal's guard of an army remains while the country is engaged in the Civil War. The post that Costner is assigned to is completely deserted so he and his supplies are just left there and Costner sets up house and prepares the place for occupation when the troops do come. But before they come, the Sioux Indians come calling.During the early part of the 19th century what Costner did could be considered groundbreaking diplomacy if he were not a military officer. He did nothing more than what the trappers and mountain men did before him, learn the ways of the Indian and live peacefully among them only looking to do their trapping thing. Someone like Kit Carson would have understood Costner's John Dunbar very well. But what a colossal mistake this guy makes when after riding with the Sioux into battle against their enemy the Pawnee, incidentally supplied with army rifles and ammunition that came out with Costner; he comes into the now occupied fort by a company of soldiers wearing Sioux regalia. Of course they shoot at him and certainly he's going to be thought of as a renegade, a latter day Simon Girty if you will.John Ford would certainly not recognize the cavalry troopers from any of his films. These guys are a real scurvy lot. However those who stayed in the army at the end of the Civil War were a bunch who saw action in such places as Shiloh, Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, and Antietam to name some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. Seen in that light their attitudes toward Costner are understandable.Dances With Wolves won a flock of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for Costner and a bunch of technical awards. The cinematography one was really earned, especially with the buffalo hunting sequence which reminds one of the Robert Taylor MGM classic, The Last Hunt. Director Costner couldn't direct actor Costner to the Oscar though, he lost to Jeremy Irons in Reversal Of Fortune. Ditto for Mary McDonnell who lost for Best Supporting Actress to Whoopi Goldberg for Ghost and Graham Greene who lost for Best Supporting Actor to Joe Pesci for Goodfellas.Dances With Wolves is an epic western in the tradition of Cimarron which was the last western before Dances With Wolves to come away with a Best Picture Oscar. It's the tragic story of the American Indians facing the inevitable triumph of a hunter/gatherer society being trampled by an agricultural/industrial society. The sociologists would assign no guilt or blame, it's just a fact of life. It's also the story of a decent if horribly misguided man. In fact not since Alec Guinness in The Bridge On The River Kwai have we seen a character like Costner's John Dunbar who just takes the wrong tack in trying to deal with a bad situation.If you like your westerns mature and intelligent than Dancing With Wolves is a film to treasure.",

Most of his films have actually been terrible (\"The Postman\", \"Message in a Bottle\", \"Dragonfly\" to name a few). Some might argue for \"Thirteen Days\", which was a good attempt but it just lacked something that his movies from the 80s and early 90s achieved. \"Dances with Wolves\" is an excellent film which is all the more impressive since it was Costner's directorial debut. Costner's acting isn't outstanding but it didn't have to be. Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell and Rodney A. Grant are the real stars here and Costner just coasts along and thankfully doesn't ruin the film with his monotone acting style. Great use of scenery and some of the most beautiful cinematography ever. I commend Costner for not cutting the movie and making it shorter because the 3+ hour length is necessary to adequately show the changes of the characters. I just watched the director's cut, which is actually 4 hours long, and I still didn't mind the length because this is such a great story of how we should not always judge a book by its cover.

This tells a believable tale.An American soldier is sent to guard an outpost station and wait for his fellow troops to arrive. Instead he begins to observe local natives who live on that land, and a wolf he nick names \"Two-Socks.\" He ends up getting sucked into the native lifestyle and falls in love with a white woman in the tribe who was raised by them from childhood.Kevin Costner did a good job directing this movie, and it's an epic story that flows really well. This is one of those movies that will last through the ages because it's always going to be relevant. The acting in this movie is really stellar from all except Kevin Costner, who I still feel isn't a great actor.

It's not just an epic in terms of length, but also in terms of the themes of love, adventure and cultural exchange which it addresses. It is a richly detailed portrayal of one man's enlightenment and transformation that should cut to the heart of anyone who watches it. Kevin Costner plays Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, wounded during the Civil War in Tennessee and, at his request, transferred to the frontier. When he arrives there, he finds his post deserted. While there, he eventually meets the Lakota Sioux and strikes up a friendship with them that develops over the course of the film. One thing (among many) that this film does right is portray Native Americans in a more sympathetic light compared to film portrayals in the past. Here they aren't \"noble savages,\" but people just living off the land who have a rich culture and history. The Pawnee aren't portrayed as kindly, but in the context of the film this is OK as they are enemies of the Sioux. This leads to the bigger issue of American imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine which, while never directly addressed as such, was a major source of tension between the US and Indian tribes in the 19th century. Yes, we stole land that they had been living on for generations and the film is bold enough to admit that. Aside from issues, DANCES WITH WOLVES manages to just tell a good story with richly detailed characters that has dramatic heft and palpable emotional impact. There are a number of sequences which display Costner's eye for good cinema and show a firm directorial hand at work. One such sequence takes place about halfway through and shows Dunbar and the Sioux hunting a herd of buffalo on the plain. There are also a few battle sequences which are brilliantly filmed. The only minor complaints I have are that the US soldiers towards the end are portrayed as villains in a somewhat cartoonish way. While certainly not saints, I feel like they were portrayed that way on purpose so as to make the Native Americans look that much more like the heroes. I can see why this was done, but I don't feel like it was entirely necessary to vilify them in such a broad way. I also think that despite the importance of the events that the film portrays, and the way in which it portrays them, that in the end it's merely a crowd-pleasing epic. Nothing truly profound is said about the human condition and our relationships with one another, as seems to be the film's intention. It has the slight air of being a cinematic apology: a rather sincere one, but still a little pretentious. I'm not quite sure if this film deserved to win Best Picture in 1991, as there were a lot of strong contenders that year, but it certainly was a high point for Kevin Costner's career and is definitely worth seeing.",

Mary McDonnell(Battlestar Galactica) as Jack Dawson as Stands With A Fisthis movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they.

            "content": "From the opening scene, we are shown Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), shattered and sensually dumbed by the hardships and horrors of the Civil War. His mind has also suffered under the brutality, shown by his suicidal ride along the enemy entrenchment; Costner noting in his superb commentary that the 'soldiers were rotting' physically, mentally and aesthetically.However, it is this act by Dunbar that leads to his reposition to Fort Sedgwick, where he can begin his rebuilding and eventually rebirth as \"Dances with Wolves\". For me, it is most important to see Dunbar's initial fears a)of being alone amongst the grass, and b)sleeping with the light on, cradling his gun. His fears of isolation showing him to be broken down to the primal fear of a child, but ultimately, and contrasting to the fellow soldiers we see, still civil and humane.Dunbar describes war's effect on nature as 'abruise to the landscape , that will be slowly healed'. But for me, it is his recognition and empathises for nature that brings him closer to Two Socks and later the Sioux tribe. It is Dunbar's detest of man, brought on by the unreasoned horrors of the war, that allow him to reassess the nature of the savage wolf and the supposedly savage, native Sioux. Dunbar, scarred by the war, sees past the necessary brutalities of their lifestyle, and is compelled by their mutual respect and humanity; as he learns to socialise and love again.Directorly, Costner is both bold and dynamic, and it is a credit to him and producer Jim Brown that the film was made for just $15m. Central to this was the bold castings of Mary McDonnell (Stands With a Fist), who perfectly performs a role that could have easily come across as comically or even absurd, and Rodney Grant (Wind In His Hair) who takes the generic 'noble savage' role, and eloquently builds on it, growing to a multi-layered performance from naive racist to capable and humane potential leader. Alongside these are highly competent performances from the familiar Graham Greene and Tantoo Cardinale.Equally, it is Dean Semler's photography and John Barry's score that superbly frame and enhance the picture without encroaching on it allowing, at all times, the story to take centre stage. As has so often been said , a glaring omission from the top 250, which is perhaps more of a comment on the quality of viewers than the quality of cinema.An outstanding piece - well done Kevin and all who helped make it!",

The movie is an outstanding adaptation of the book.  The only difference is that in the book the Indians were the Comanche.  In scouting a suitable site for the movie, Dakota territory was chosen.

            "content": "This was the directorial debut for actor Kevin Costner, who deservedly won the Oscar and Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA, for Best Director, he also funded the film himself, based on the book by Michael Blake, it really gives the Hollywood western genre a kick. Basically set in 1863, during the American Civil War, First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Costner) returns from battle, his injured leg is to be amputated, but following a suicide attempt Dunbar unexpectedly rallies his comrades, and an experienced general's surgeon saves his leg. Dunbar is praised as a hero, meeting mentally ill Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin), he requests to transfer west, to see the Western frontier before it ends, he is paired with mule wagon provisioner Timmons (Robert Pastorelli), as they leave Fambrough commits suicide. Dunbar and Timmon reach the desolate Fort Sedgwick, after a scenic journey, all they find is a lone wolf that Dunbar befriends and names \"Two Socks\", because of its white front leg colouring, Dunbar awaits reinforcements and remains to man the post, despite the threat of nearby Indian tribes. While Dunbar writes a diary, and rebuilds and restocks the fort, Timmons is killed by Pawnee Indians, this and the death of Fambrough means other soldiers are unaware of Dunbar's assignment, and no soldiers will arrive to reinforce the post. Dunbar is initially approached by neighbouring Sioux Indians who try to steal his horse and intimidate him, he decides to find the Siouz camp and attempt to communicate, on the way he encounters Stands With A Fist (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Mary McDonnell), the white adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird (Oscar nominated Graham Greene), she attempts suicide because of the death of her husband. Dunbar brings her back to the tribe to recover, some tribe members begin to respect him, he eventually gains rapport with Kicking Bird and the warrior Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), as time goes by Dunbar finds that what he was told about the tribe is untrue, he grows to respect and appreciate their lifestyle and customs, and learns their language. Observing Dunbar and \"Two Socks\" chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name \"Dances With Wolves\", during this time Dunbar also forms a romantic relationship with Stands With A Fist and helps defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe, he eventually wins the approval of Kicking Bird, is allowed to marry Stands With A Fist, and abandons Fort Sedgewick. Because of the growing threat of the Pawnees and the whites, Chief Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman) decides to move the tribe to its winter camp, Dunbar decides to accompany them, he goes back to Fort Sedgewick to retrieve his diary, which would provide the army with means to find the tribe, but the fort has been reoccupied by the U.S. Army. The soldiers open fire and kill Dunbar's horse, Dunbar is captured and arrested as a traitor, being interrogated Dunbar cannot prove his story, a corporal found and discarded his diary, refusing to interpret for the tribes Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner, Two Socks follows him, the wolf is shot by soldiers. The Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and free Dunbar, they no longer see him as a white man, but as one of their own, Dunbar, as Dances With Wolves, decides him remaining would endanger the Sioux tribe, so he and Stands With A Fist leave, American troops are seen searching the mountains but unable to locate them. Also starring Tantoo Cardinal as Black Shawl and Dumb and Dumber's Charles Rocket as Lieutenant Elgin. Costner gives a brilliant performance as the soldier who befriends a feared Indian tribe, he also directs the film with real passion and conviction, the supporting cast members such as McDonnell and Greene are terrific as well, the film may be three hours long, but it is really worth it, it has great sweeping battle sequences, beautiful backgrounds, marvellous music, and it really does atone for the shameful depiction Hollywood used to have of native American life, a splendid epic western. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Barry, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Original Film Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Kevin Costner was number 93 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 75 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!",

It s a wonderful film of the \"New Westerns.\" This movie moves beyond old stereotypes of cowboys and Indians, and who is heroic and who is not to provide fleshed-out characters and anti-heroes. In this instance, the American Indians are not portrayed in simple black-and-white terms, but instead are portrayed as three-dimensional human beings. Graham Greene is terrific as the Sioux chief in this movie. Kevin Costner does well as the complex and mentally troubled John Dunbar, who finds a renewed sense of being when he lives among the Sioux.Some people have criticized this movie for engaging in \"reverse stereotypes,\" i.e. that the whites are portrayed as villains and the Indians as noble savages. Those with a background in Indian history will also argue that the Sioux were the aggressors on the Great Plains, and that the Pawnee, here portrayed as the villains, lived at the Sioux's mercy in real life. I do not think this movie should be considered perfect history, but I feel that the reverse stereotypes are not extreme, and that, as a work of art, this movie succeeds in providing a compelling story of Dunbar's transformation on the Plains. The historians' complaints are legitimate, however, and I argue that people viewing this for a history class exercise caution when viewing this movie as an example of history rather than a work of fiction.Great acting and a lovely score round out this classic film. My favorite scene is at the very end, where the macho warrior Wind-in-His-Hair tells Dunbar, \"can't you see that you are my friend?\" Watch it!",

He eventually makes friends with the nearby Sioux Indians, and begins to understand their struggle under the white man's rule of America. He eventually earns the Indian name \"Dances With Wolves,\" hence the title. Now, this movie is just a few minutes under four hours, and every minutes worth it. This movie won best picture in 1991, and it really earned it. In my opinion, at least, this is among the best films ever made.This was Kevin Costner's directorial debut, and that blows my mind. He does so good behind the camera, as well as in front of it. The directing and cinematography in this film make the prairie look so beautiful. Just as with a more recent movie, The Martian (2015), the cinematography makes something that seems bland or boring look stunning.As mentioned above, Kevin Costner does great in this movie. I honestly think this is the best he's ever done on screen. His co stars, Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene, do amazing as well. All of the acting is great. The score is also great. The score sucks you right into the film, and portrays the tone of the current scene wonderfully. Thanks to John Barry for that.The last great thing I'd like to praise is the run time. I normally don't enjoy an over longed movie, and believe that it can take away from the pacing of the film. This has been common in films such as Interstellar (2014). However, if the crew shaved off an hour or so of this movie, it would be too quick. Clocking this film in at four hours was a perfect choice. Absolutely perfect. By the time the credits rolled, I had almost broke tears, and was gasping for more of this masterpiece.Overall, I loved Dances With Wolves. It is definitely a classic, and will stand for a long time. I give Dances With Wolves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",

Unfortunately, when he finally reaches Fort Sedgewick he discovers that his post has been abandoned and rather than return to Fort Hays he decides to remain there until more soldiers eventually arrive. What he doesn't know is that his traveling companion to Fort Sedgwick has been killed by Pawnee Indians while attempting to return to Fort Hays and as a result nobody there realizes that Lt. Dunbar is all alone at this remote location. However, his situation immediately changes one day when he abruptly comes face-to-face with a Sioux Indian. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film turned out to be an exceptional movie all around with Graham Greene (as the Sioux medicine man \"Kicking Bird\"), Rodney A Grant (\"Wind in His Hair\"), Mary McDonnell (\"Stands with a Fist\") and the aforementioned Kevin Costner all performing in an excellent manner. Likewise, both the plot and the music were quite exceptional as well.

            "content": "It's more than apparent that Kevin Costner has such love and reverence for the Hollywood western, as he resurrects the genre one decade on from the infamous flop that was Heaven's Gate and continuing the long tradition of epic Hollywood filmmaking in Dances With Wolves. I find it refreshing to see westerns which include the Indian point of view and the insight Dances With Wolves provides into the culture and lifestyle of the Sioux as well as hearing a language not often heard is fascinating. The Indians in Dances With Wolves are humanised with moments such as when John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) endures a relatable awkward moment as he sees Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) having sex in the tipi they are sharing, to moments in the film in which the Indian children of the tribe have the desire to be grown up and act older than they are. The Indians, however, are not sanctified either and the film avoids the noble savage stereotype; some members of the tribe are vicious killers and openly express their prejudice. The white man on the other hand is shown killing mass amounts of Buffalo only for their horns, throwing their trash on the ground and polluting the water. More significantly the film shows the Sioux's rival tribe The Pawnee working in co-operation with the US military to take out the Sioux, presenting the conflict between settlers and natives as not a simple good/bad dichotomy - Dances With Wolves presents both villainy and nobility on both sides.Although not many people share the fondness I have for Kevin Costner and dismissing him as a dull, monotone actor, I point to Dances With Wolves as a showcase that the man is a great screen presence as he carries a four-hour-long movie on his shoulders with no dialogue for long stretches of time while exuberating his commanding narration voice. The passage of time in which John Dunbar very slowly over the course of a four-hour runtime becomes assimilated into the Sioux culture, learns their language and becomes more emotive and open from his previously quiet, stoic self represents an astounding piece of storytelling. Unfortunately, certain individuals will look upon a movie like Dances With Wolves and decry it as offensive for its display of so-called \"cultural appropriation\" because apparently, the embracing of other cultures doesn't represent unity between races but thievery of one culture's ways by another. Dances With Wolves is a film that speaks to our humanity and shows how race can transcend culture. The scene in which Dunbar is being held by the US soldiers as they assault him, denying him to return to his newfound way of life as well as killing his wolf companion Two Socks and using his diary as toilet paper is beyond painful to watch. I've become so attached to the character at this point that I can't bear to watch everything he has worked towards being destroyed.I can't say if Dances with Wolves is a movie intended to carry an environmental message but that is an impression I get from it from the film's contrast between the resourceful Native Americans to the more polluting white men (Costner would go on to later produce and star in the eco-thriller Waterworld). John Dunbar's desire to see the western frontier before it disappears is comparable to the last great frontiers today which are apparently at risk of eventually disappearing if modern climate change accounts are anything to go by. John Dunbar is a man who doesn't want to take advantage of the land but to simply admire and bask in it - who needs CGI when there's a world of scenic and natural beauty out there begging to be captured on film? Simply look at the film's majestic landscapes of the badlands accompanied by John Barry's score which evokes a real sense of wonder. \"Why go out to a location when you can just create it on a computer. Isn't that so much easier?\" - sigh. Likewise, the famous buffalo hunt scene is the real deal. How do you recreate a buffalo hunt? Why get huge herds of buffalo of course. Like the chariot race in Ben-Hur, history is brought back to life with herds buffalo as far as the eye can see with stuntmen on horseback right in the middle of it all; pulling off something as huge as this and retaining continuity is astounding. Dances With Wolves doesn't come off as cold, callous Oscar bait but sadly it is another movie in which its Best Picture win has hurt its reputation; \"Dances With Wolves is just that movie which beat Goodfellas\".",

As a white person myself I find it amusing that every \"great\" movie about foreign culture features a white protagonist who must integrate.  Why not skip that crud and just make the lead character an Indian?  What a novel idea, there are surely many candidates (especially since Hollywood can make someone who most of history until 1995 referred to as a tyrant, William Wallace, look like a saint.)  Kevin Costner butchers yet another lead character in this movie (his Elliott Ness was just pathetic, I won't start on JFK) as a Union soldier who befriends a group of Indians and begins to adhere to their culture.  Luckily for him there just happens to be a white girl kicking it with the tribe, (nothing against Mary McDonnell, her performance was about the only bright spot here) other wise he'd been out of luck.  God forbid his integration would go so far as him marrying an Indian, no, no, that might actually have been interesting.  Also, every other character in this movie besides Costner and McDonnell falls into one of the following three types: good Indian, bad Indian, absolutely completely despicable rotten white guy. The Scenes with the buffalo are equally ridiculous.  We watch the Indians tracking the buffalo down, \"Horay! isn't this great, they're slaughtering them but they will use the entire animal!\" as opposed to the white people slaughtering them, with disgusting looking skinned carcasses covering the fields (we didn't see any gross carcasses when the Indians killed them) and as if that wasn't enough we get sappy sad music blaring while a baby buffalo wanders the fields looking for his slaughtered mother. PUUUUULLLLLLESE!!!! Do not subject yourself to that kind of  manipulative crap!  Why didn't the Indians just go collect the dead animals and score an easy meal and a few pairs of liver skin shoes?  And besides, I'm sure Indians killed quite a few baby buffalo's parents, AND DIDN'T CARE.  This movie is painfully slow, and can basically be partitioned into scenes of Kevin Costner getting his butt kicked, scenes of Costner recovering from the butt kicking and beautiful clips of the country side over a span of only three hours.  This movie is totally overrated, stereotyped and racist, the fact that it won the Academy Award is ridiculous but consistent.",

            "content": "This is a review of my second viewing of \"Dances With Wolves\", the first being right after its release in 1990. This viewing was the DVD edition, in Digital Dolby 5.1. The DVD picture is truly remarkable, one of the the best I've seen. However, the sound is mostly \"stereo\" - the surround channels often have nothing, and at other times you may hear insects chirping, fire crackling, or some of the music. Not a very good example of use of surround sound.As most know this film won the oscar for 1990, as well as Costner's direction. As good as the film is, I feel it is a bit over rated. I give it 8 of 10, but in truth not much better than Costner's \"The Postman\", which I actually like a lot and think is generally under rated. Go figure!Much of this film seeks to portray the Sioux as a gentle, intelligent, family-oriented tribe. I suspect they really were. At the same time it seeks to portray the invasion of the white man as something cruel, which it probably was. Although it isn't intended to be a documentary, I'm sure it gives viewers a fairly accurate, sympathetic view of the Native American plight during the mid-to-late 1800s as we expanded west.The filming was done in the rolling plains, and the Badlands, of central South Dakota. Having been through that region a couple of times made watching this film even more enjoyable.",

In fact, I have always wondered if it is just a little too masterful to be a directorial solo effort of Kevin Costner. I suspect he got a lot of advice, and general help.I thought that the first 3/4 of the movie was considerably better than the last 1/4. When it was about the process of a lone white man developing a relationship with the Sioux, Dances With Wolves was an amazingly artistic film experience. That did not last through the whole movie.Back to Kevin Costner. I have always had trouble with Costner as an actor. It was Costner who led me to the notion that the very best actors have all of the inherent physical tools of acting. That would include a speaking voice that can avoid a nasal monotone. Perhaps I am too critical.Anyway, I gave Dances With Wolves an 8-star rating. As movies go, is not the Wizard of Oz, but it sure ain't bad.",

            "content": "\"Dances With Wolves\" won seven Academy Awards for 1990, including best picture and best director, both of which were claimed by the film's star, Kevin Costner, whose performance was also recognized with a nomination. There's been grumbling from film buffs that Costner's triumph was undeserved, that Martin Scorsese's gangster epic, \"Goodfellas,\" should have won, with Scorsese taking the director prize, and there's been a tendency to sneer at Costner's directorial debut ever since. If the Academy was turned off by \"Goodfellas\"'s violence and misanthropic characters, they could feel safe voting for \"Dances With Wolves\" since it seemed more noble, in the same vein as \"Gandhi.\" As Kevin Costner's Calvary officer makes peace with an Indian tribe and they welcome him into their fold, it speaks well of the human race, certainly more so than Ray Liotta talking fellow mobster Robert DeNiro out of \"whacking\" a fellow hoodlum. \"Dances With Wolves\" has its villains, all of them white U.S. calvary soldiers, whose anti-Indian actions make them racists, and, therefore, deserving of the audience's hatred.Native American issues were big at the time, thanks in part to the critical and popular success of Forrest Carter's \"The Education of Little Tree,\" a \"memoir\" of the author's childhood as the member of a Cherokee tribe that continued to be popular long after Carter was exposed as Asa Carter, a pro-segregationist former Klansman and speechwriter for Alabama governor George Wallace, and definitely not a Cherokee. A true Native American author, Sherman Alexie, was also making a mark at this time with such novels as \"Reservation Blues.\" In short, Costner's feel-good epic was the right movie at the right time, very appealing to audiences, who made it a several hundred million dollar grosser, and the Academy, who could vote for it and feel as though they were finally addressing the grievances that Marlon Brando introduced when declining his Oscar for \"The Godfather\" 18 years earlier in protest of Hollywood's treatment of Indians in all those John Ford westerns.I avoided \"Dances With Wolves\" for years, having dismissed it as politically correct, New Age slop in a pretty package. I finally caught up with it in 2006 and was impressed. Slow moving and rather boring at times, especially when Costner reads from his diary in a monotone that would have gotten him kicked out of any high school drama class, it is nonetheless an extraordinary achievement overall, with lovely cinematography and a John Barry score that's already a classic. When it comes, the action is well-staged, particularly a buffalo stampede, and the Indian's attack on the Calvary troop that has taken Costner hostage. There's a lot of mystical nonsense, including the shot of a wolf howling from a cliff, but it's moving regardless, especially set to Barry's majestic score.Although it's often classified as a western, \"Dances With Wolves\" is more of an historical epic, though a fictional one. I don't think it deserved the Oscar over \"Goodfellas,\" but it was far more deserving of that prize than many other films that the Academy has honored through the years, and Costner gambled with his career to make it.Brian W.

            "content": "An Orion picture release, directed and co-produced (Wilson) by its star, Kevin Costner, written for the screen by the book's author, Michael Blake, and co-stars Mary McDonnell, Rodney Grant, Graham Greene, Wes Studi, Bob Pastorelli, Tantoo Cardinal and Maury Chaykin as Major Fambrough. One of the decade's best (The-Fugitive JFK Ronin), Dances is a brilliant blend of romantic-realism, action-drama and handfuls of charm ('Here, have some sugar in your coffee!'), depicting the culture clash that accompanies the inevitable expansion of humanity throughout the post-Columbus Americas.The movie opens on a Civil War battlefield in Tennessee. A stalemate exists and badly injured Union officer Dunbar (Kev) needs an amputation (Sgt Pepper {Everett}: \"Better take cover Lt., those boys are shooters\") but decides on a reckless act of diversion, one almost certain to result in his death, riding between the armies in hope of ending the impasse. With the grim-reaper ready to swing (a Rebel sharpshooter has Dunbar sighted), \"fate moves its huge hand,\" sparing the suicide who inspires his blue-coat brethren to rout the Confederates into frantic retreat. As reward, the hero receives proper medical care and is granted a wish, a repost out West \"before its (natural state) is all gone.\" Arriving at Fort Hays (KS), Dunbar reports to fussy, fragile Major Fambrough who nonetheless is impressed with the new arrival's mission statement and sends him, unofficially, \"on a knight's errand to the farthest reaches of the realm,\" that being Fort Sedgwick, now a deserted post and the lieutenant's odyssey begins.There are moments uniquely Costnerian (\"Your name is Stands?,\" teams with Smiles-a-lot, wheat-field walk & telling of tatonka), coming across as contemporaneous, yet, the story is so strong, Barry's music so majestic, he whose key so often unlocked the door to our hearts and scored range epics Born-Free (66) and Monte-Walsh (70), Semler's camera so well-aimed (his frame of proud Pawnee Studi is 24k gold), that it detracts not the least from the historical context, an achievement most modern westerns, policed by PC mandates, fail at miserably. Pulling off that rare film feat, Dances scored big at the box-office ($22M > $424) AND the award galas, winning seven (7) Oscars in categories picture, director, score, camera, screen-play, sound and editing, three (3) Globes and numerous other picture-director accolades, with only BAFTA voters baffled, never calling out Dances title on trophy nite with zero (0) wins. Bloody ridiculous.A bison hunt, a spirited shindig where \"good trade(s)\" are made, a clever horse (Cisco), playful wolf (Two Socks), Pawnee angst (\"He'll get us all killed\"), an Army more confused (Cargill) than evil (Bauer Spivey), all making indelible marks. The opening War scene is as poignant as it is exhilarating while the closing river raid and last goodbye (\"You are my friend!\") tie-up this rolling masterpiece beautifully (4/4).",

It touches on everything that is truly important to me: beautiful love and friendship not just between people but also between people and animals, loyalty & dedication, harmony and victory. The cinematography is breathtaking, the music score is lovely and the cast is absolutely superb, including Cisco and Two Socks. I take my hat off for Kevin Costner's genius as director and actor. The film is difficult one to make, considering the treeless scenery and the fact that John Dunbar spends a lot of time with no one to talk to, and yet it is very entertaining. The battles are crafted tastefully, the love scenes are special with no unnecessary details and the humour is just the right dose. Dances With Wolves is an exquisite masterpiece and the two-disc extended edition is the wonderful treatment the film deserves. The transfer is high quality and it comes with stylish, cleverly designed keep case. The personal touch from Kevin Costner and Jim Wilson makes it even more special for every true fan of the movie. Take your time to indulge in this wonderful experience! I had an amazing weekend viewing the video. Had the feeling that Kevin and Jim were in my screening room when their commentary were on and I learned a lot about these remarkable men and what they have to go through to make it happen. I will treasure my old disc and will often go back to it, but when I need a dose of pure inspiration and motivation, I will play the extended version, listening to the last few words that Kevin says in his commentary.

            "content": "\"Dances with Wolves\" remains as one of the best movies of all time. It takes you back to another place and time, the Frontier, to a place that you wish still existed. The movie has excellent actors-Rodney A. Grant, Graham Greene, Wes Studi and so many more. I loved the beautiful scenes of the endless prairie, of the Lakota Sioux camp, and the wonderful music of John Barry. The story centers around the life of Liutenant John Dunbar, and his trek of self discovery. In the beginning we see him as a disillusioned Union soldier, lying wounded in the surgeons camp bed. He attempts to take his life, but instead ends up saving the day. He is promoted and given the opportunity to leave the fighting grounds of the Civil War for the posting of his choosing. He chooses to be posted in the Frontier, in order to see it before it is gone. Once he arrives at the camp, he finds out it is deserted. He remains there, alone, hopeful that new troops arrive soon. Yet they never do. He finds out that he alone must learn to live in an environment he knows nothing about. Then he makes contact with a Sioux, and several times they try to steal his horse, Cisco. The movie, to me, begins really when he travels to the Lakota Sioux campsite, to make contact. It is here that a relationship with the Sioux really begins, as well as Dunbar's relationship with Kicking Bird. Gradually, John Dunbar realizes that the Sioux are not the way he envisioned them. He had had preconceived notions about them-about all Native Americans, to be exact. He finds himself identifying with them, with their way of life and beliefs. Eventually he comes into contact with his own former world, the world he left behind. He finds out that he no longer identifies with his former comrades or with the US government. It is then that John Dunbar discovers just how far he is willing to go to protect his new adopted family-the family he learned to love. I deeply recommend Dances With Wolves. It is timeless.",

Okay so they do have daft names, but by no means is this a criticism of them and I don't mean to offend any Indians or Costner by saying it. And Fist In The Mouth or whatever he was called was obviously a very dignified character, as was made abundantly clear on more than one occasion - about eight I think.One thing that got me though was how Dunbar and co. were crying over some dead buffalo in one scene, but then ten seconds later were themselves having a 15-minute heroic buffalo chase, which was so over the top you felt sure a rabid Dunbar was going to start eating one raw.It was too much for me this film, I like to make my own mind up while watching films rather than be spoon-fed a load of sentimental claptrap like this. 4/10",

The photography is dusty and brownish and it spoils the beauty of the landscape. The action scenes are sporadic and non-exciting. All the whites are laughably bad (save Costner, of course). As soon as a white guy appears on the screen, we are sure that he will readily do something awfully evil. This causes an unwanted comic effect. Moreover, I don't think that the current fashion of representing the American Indians as a not-even-much-modernized version of Rousseau's \"good savage\" is much flattering for them.Now I must confess one thing: I watched \"Dances with Wolves\" some years ago; I found the plot so uninteresting that I cannot remember how the film ends!

One sort of such people is the guys who post huge walls of text, so huge that any point of yours gets literally smothered by those. No matter what you have to say, you'll simply be flooded with tons of text of very questionable relevance, and there will be no one else to actually care enough to dig through this mess and back your point. So much for believing that being logical and consistent is enough to win any argument.Watching Dances with Wolves was a bit of a relevant experience. Not that it was an awful movie that makes you go WTF all the time. Quite the contrary, this is a movie with a lot of positive moments, most notable of which is a stunningly beautiful cinematography, above-par acting and a very extensive use of the Sioux language, which adds a rather delicate touch to the movie considering it was made in 1990, when attention to such details wasn't as revered as it is now.But every now and then the movie takes a shortcut, feeding you with oversimplified, cloying or plain stereotypical views of things or digressing onto the secondary plot paths only to abandon them in a few minutes later. The most screaming example is the image of the Indian tribe that let the protagonist in: they are all good people, noble savages to the brim who simply shine with the wisdom of simplicity. On the other hand, almost all the white people are arrogant, insane, cruel or dumb, which leaves no chance for the audience to have any sympathy towards them.This might be tolerable for an average 90-minute movie, but Dances With Wolves is an almost 4-hour epic, and, honestly, it could benefit from some trimming. Yet, instead of using this huge time span to actually show us things from different points of view, the film rams home its single chosen perspective, in case we have any doubt that what US did to Native Americans was a bad thing. Kinda like what Avatar did in 2009.I am actually surprised that this movie is so critically acclaimed. Apparently, Costner got all those Oscars and other rewards because political correctness and historical revisionism were reigning supreme in 1990's. Or maybe it was epic and sentimental enough so that people could forgive it for being somewhat shallow and one-sided. After all, it's still a beautifully looking movie, especially if you like the views of Kevin Costner's naked butt.",

This movie, believe it or not, was produced with only a $20MM budget- Costner had to guarantee his own house! Do you know how much John Carter cost ? Look it up.Dances with Wolves, is the material proof, that low budget movies are sometimes the best ever made. The story could not be more moving. Is does not encourage apologia of patriotism, courage, lakota natives or the United States. It's an elaborated think piece of an adventure through the struggles of segregation, the civil war, the conquest over the frontier, the last remaining tribes and the expansion of the northern federation, peace, friendship and nature. All characters play their role perfectly - there's not a single miscast. Costner incredibly displays as a rookie an epic voyage in the mid-west to find himself befriending a native-American tribe and their civilisation. The insight, the language, the manners and the buffalo hunt, are extremely rich and plastically breathtaking. The score is brilliant. Might be one of the best scores ever written. All along, the score simply corresponds perfectly with every scene that requires a matching music. You cannot deny that, whether you think there's not enough this or that, that Costner has delivered a colossal effort to offer us a movie that will go down as one of the greatest film pieces in cinema history. Never once do you get bored, look at the time, in fact, you wish this movie never ends, and when it does, you are not disappointed by the ending. The CGI are spectacular - you really believe that the buffalo hunt is real. I urge everyone to check the making of this movie.

He finds it deserted and through a series of unfortunate circumstances he is stranded at the fort with nobody knowing that he is alone there, or even there. He meets his neighbours, the local Sioux tribe, and slowly gains their respect and friendship...Well-intentioned but badly executed. After all the westerns showing Native Americans to be nothing but savages, a movie humanizing the Native Americans was due. Dances With Wolves may be one of the first movies to have a balanced approach in that regard.However, that's where anything positive about this movie ends. The actual execution is quite bad. Director Kevin Costner turns what should have been a profound 2-hour journey into a 3-hour ordeal. Every scene is drawn out to the maximum and many scenes are there as padding making the move slow, dull and overly long. As director he also favours long, drawn-out close-ups of the lead actor, who happens to be himself. Seems incredibly self-indulgent, slowing the movie down further and detracting from the plot.Moreover, the whole tone is so preachy, moralising and pretentious. Turns what should have been a natural lesson to audiences into a soap-boxing sermon.Undeservedly won the 1991 Best Picture Oscar. How this won over Goodfellas I don't know.

Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" \"Freddy Vs. Jason,\" and \"Weekend at Bernie's.\" I don't think any of those movies has ever been called \"boring,\" but they sure are crap cinema.Onward. \"Dances With Wolves\" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.Costner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.He also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.Sure, it's easy to call \"Dances\" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.Finally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of \"Dances\" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring clich\u00e9s of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated deck we've gotten saddled with lately.",

            "content": "The first time I watched this movie, I almost fell asleep half way through seeing it. I was only 13 years old, so the movie's contents were above my adolescent expectation. Furthermore all conversations in Sioux and Pawnee languages were subbed in mandarin; itself a foreign tongue for me.\nToday, ten years later, I just have watched it again in its original English format and I'm deeply at awe at the beauty of this film. Physically speaking, the cinematography, setting, lighting and costumes were very well executed/done. But the real strength comes from Blakes' great storytelling and Costner's engaging directing. This film deserved all the credits it is dued. I felt fortunate to also see the movie the second time in its intended 4-hour version, which I believe brings us a fuller picture of a man's journey of self-discovery. What he found is the heart of the land for which he fought for (during the Civil War) and thought he knew. A transformational quest of consummation between the heart, cultures and ways of life. There are moments when I feel that the performances were not genuine enough, but if you think about it, the actors and movie staff had done a great job in capturing the essence of a vanishing culture. Costner's character for instance, is too naive and sweet for a white soldier of his time, but the movie must be made accessible to a wider audience in the US, hence the story is mostly told from his point of view. Having said that, the real heroes in this movie are the Native Americans, who tried to survive the wind of change brought by colonialization.The character of Dunbar has become a tool of narration that essentially tells us a beautiful story. A story about a vanishing culture, a people whose spirit and way of life are the very essence of America. The true America. When this movie was released in Asia, most of the local audiences labeled the movie as being a watchable bad-movie. The truth is the movie's contents resonanced with the local histories. We are doing exactly what the white colonial movement of that time, were doing against the native people. So those who didn't accept the message and learn from it, were disturbed. I have learnt something  and absolutely love this movie.",

It also has some splendid action pieces like the buffalo hunt and the battle with the Pawnee (who for some weird reason look like Iroquois) and odd moments that get your attention like the mentally deranged major, played to creepy perfection by the great Canadian actor Maury Chaikin, the domestic life of Kicking Bird and his chatty wife, and the interplay between Lt. Dunbar and his pet wolf, Two Socks. Pile up enough of these scenes and moments and throw in John Berry's beautiful music and Dean Semler's even more beautiful cinematography and, bingo, you got yourself a pretty damn good movie. Should it have won best picture over \"Goodfellas\" and should Costner have won best director over Scorsese, to mention nothing of nabbing a best actor nomination for a rather flat, emotionless performance? Obviously not. But as an epic western from a first time director it's impressive. Give it a B. PS...Of all the many awards this picture got the most well deserved was Graham Greene's nomination for best supporting actor, playing the introspective Kicking Bird. This guy should have had a bigger career.",

I would also point out that not all buffalo hunters were white - many tribes slaughtered thousands of buffalo so that they could sell the skins to other natives as well as to whites.One last thought - The Indian Wars happened over a century ago so nothing we can say or o today will undo any of the wrongs committed by either side, so isn't it time we all moved on and lived as the world is today?

All the Native Americans are sensitive in their way, heroic, understanding, reasonable, and at least fairly good looking. All the whites, besides Costner and Mary McDonnell, are two-dimensional villains and/or oafs, jerks, morons, and not good looking. This is a stacked-deck look at the two ethnic groups if there ever was one.Not one white soldier is even willing to listen to Costner for a minute? They are all incredibly cruel from the get-go? ALL of them are also stupid? Not one of the Sioux tribe harbors jealousy, mistrust or resentment toward Costner, or is just not that great a guy? Then there is the scene where the white soldiers shoot the wolf. This REALLY strained one's willingness to believe because it is a movie. What wolf is going to hang around while being hammered with the sound of gunshots and seeing guns pointed at him? Even if he loves Costner, the wolf called Two Socks is going to take cover, wouldn't you think? He just stands there, waiting to be killed. This means he is supposed to be a spirit or angel I guess, not really a wolf. But that point is not made clear.Finally, I have to agree with those who say that Costner is not much of an actor or a narrator. Since he's the big star, and in all the scenes, that really detracts. I will say that the buffaloes were impressive and some of the actors playing the Sioux were easy on the eyes.",

This was the case in this film and in others - Little Big Man immediately springs to mind - again, in the film version, the Pawnee replaced Cheyenne as the murders of Jack Crabb's family. As far as I can make out, the Pawnee gave great service to the US as army scouts.

This film portrays a frontiersman who discovers a life with native American people and a respect for their way of life. It depicts the native Americans as people more than previous westerns, which had a more lowly view of them.The best thing about the film is the production value - the attention to detail, the set design, the costumes, and so on. Some of the landscape shots were breath-taking, and there was also a good sense of action. I believe that this is the reason why the film was so popular. (Not to mention the audience's new love for Kevin Costner and for being more fairer to the native American culture on the silver screen.) However, I do not think this is the best film ever made. In between sweeping scenery and action are fairly long drags of dialog and Kevin Costner being a hero and showing him with his native American wife and hard life and loss. I'd personally rate this as an average film, but it gets points for some spectacular photography.",

The relationship struck with John Dunbar and the tribe makes great cinema with a timeless story of courage, discovery and friendship. This film is rich and colourful from its awe inspiring landscapes to its fabulous array of talented actors, most notably Graham Greene whose portrayal of Kicking Bird is absolutely perfect. I urge people who have not seen this film to open your heart to what most must agree to be one of the greatest movies ever made. The music score by John Barry is my favourite movie soundtrack and I suggest that you listen to the soundtrack if you can.

            "content": "\"Dances with Wolves\" is beautiful. The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal. The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier. Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional. No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth. Costner captures this feeling with perfection. Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery. There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence. His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when \"Dances with Wolves\" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true. For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.While Costner's imagery stands powerfully next to any great director's work, it is the overall story that ultimately holds back the rest of the film. Costner is obviously comfortable behind the camera, but it is his work within the film that feels a bit repetitive and clich\u00e9. Costner is not Lieutenant Dunbar. While he is the imaginative force behind the story, he cannot seem to tackle the character itself. Costner never quite transforms himself into something we haven't seen. Perhaps watching it during its release would have been a different story, but in 2008, one watches Costner be Costner only in Native American headwear. The scenes in this film where he first encounters the sounds of the frontier, or later when he finds an unseen love, were utterly dishonest. Costner was Costner; there was no other way to see it. The only parts that glimmered with a possible character were the beginning run through the barrage of open bullets, and the violent reintroduction to the white culture near the end were satisfactory, but for just a few short moments. Costner needed to tell us more about Dunbar, give us either flashbacks of his life or his reason for making decisions. The voice-over wasn't convincing enough as a conscious to give us true rhyme or reason. Those puppy dog eyes that Costner blasted any chance he had never gave us the torment that obviously dwelled within this man. There was a reason for his possible suicide attempt and escape into the wild. With no mention of family or history, it is difficult to understand Costner's why.With Costner misleading us through the mapping of this film, it was left up to the other players to demonstrate a goal at the end of this four hour tunnel. This semi-happened with Graham Greene's character and Catherine McCormack's role, two people forced into clich\u00e9 roles that they have played time and time again. This time they pulled it off well, but I just didn't believe them. Greene plays this character in every film he has ever been in, while McCormack's character was a cross between Helen Keller and Pocahontas. Not to sound offensive to Native American's, I was happy to see a sympathetic view of them via Costner's eyes, but it felt used. Hardship seemed to be an unknown word to this tribe. Costner was able to walk on in, build relationships, not worry about food rations, and easily jump right into the culture without any worry. There was never a moment where I found myself saying, \"Ah, is he going to make it?\" \u0096 the simplicity of it all seemed faked and merely in place for emotions sake.Finally, the question of time has to be approached. Did Costner need four hours to tell this story? Alas, no. Using the beautiful landscape he merely bought time, aka filler, to push his simplistic tale from average story to epic. In two hours, Costner could have pushed the emotional button further and really dedicated himself to his character. At pushing 245 minutes, we felt as if we lost the character of Dunbar after the first hour and a half. With such a broad canvas, not enough was dedicated to the right parts. Costner's relationships with the other characters were pushed so far that a sense of apathy was built. Any cares that we had were brushed away at the two and a half hour mark.Overall, Costner's film probably deserved the Oscars at the time \u0096 but it currently doesn't stand alone as a modern masterpiece. Costner misjudged this film pushing the framing too far and loosing the central focus. His character of Dunbar seemed more like an imitation of Droopy Dog in the frontier, instead of a stylized representation of a true soul. Costner does powerfully show us a sympathetic view of the Native American culture during the time of its downfall, but with such an epic nature I expected it to carry more realism. The Sioux has danger, they had fears, and they had their own to worry about, but once Costner appeared we saw none of that. Costner was so excited about learning about them, about communicating with them, that we never quite had the chance to see their world. Costner must be given credit for his eye in this film. While his directing skills were not as I anticipated, his visual eye was superb. Images that may never be captured again were detailed throughout, giving us the view of an epic \u0096 although lacking the other parts. \"Dances with Wolves\" is worth viewing at least once, but another four hours could not be done by this critic even if life depended on it.Grade: ** \u00bd out of *****",

This film has a lot of very good things going for it, The cinematography, the script (mostly), the way the story flows and explains in a believable way what is happening to Lt John Dunbar, it also shows the increasing trepidation on the part of tribes just beginning to come into proximity with the expanding towns and forts. (The way in which the elder presents Dunbar with a Conquistador helmet as his belief that they will remain unaffected is very poignant)It's not a perfect film, but this was Costner's first attempt at directing, and was a whole load better than the laughable \"Robin Hood\".Costner's not the first actor to want to make such a statement in film and wake people up, Brando tried for twenty years, but the studios did'nt think it would make money.I hope this film will make some people find out more on the subject.

In one extra scene, we see Kicking Bird taking Dances With Wolves on a journey to a sacred place where they believed all life sprang from. Once there, they see the unwarranted and indiscriminate killing of both the environment and wildlife. Two extra scenes also deal with the early differences between John Dunbar and the tribe. One is where the white hunters who butchered the buffalo had been caught and the tribe were celebrating by waiving their scalps around a fire, and the other is where a Pawnee warrior has his head bashed in by a elderly female Sioux. They were apparently cut from the film because they showed a more naked savagery, but I feel they show the truth in the difficulties faced by a people fighting for survival. I really can't praise this film enough for its sheer breadth of vision, its powerful emotions and the way Kevin Costner draws out the majesty of the plains, its changing seasons and the ebbing and flowing of the life that clung so desperately to their land, only to lose it to a people who, as Dunbar narrates, have no souls, no honour and no regard for Sioux rights.",

Kevin Costner has made more mistakes than good films: Dances with Wolves is probably his best. Well filmed, good story-line, mostly good acting, and of course the only really good music from John Barry, who is usually so repetitive he gets sickening (apart from his really majestic apportation in `Zulu' 1964). `Dances with Wolves' stands out from most films related with the Civil War and/or general Westerns in that there is more sincerity, more human compassion and feeling, without forgetting the superb photography. The buffalo hunt was just simply superb, really great filming. I've just seen this film for the second time, and even so it did not seem too long in its cinema three-hour form. I shall watch it again some day......",

            "content": "While I was watching Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves (1990) I was reminded of a book excerpt that I read which was from a book called Black Elk Speaks because both stories talk about the Sioux tribe, but the book was based on real life events and this movie is fictional. Costner's film tells the story of Lt. John J. Dunbar(played by Kevin Costner himself) who is a Civil war veteran who served with the Union army who is under exile all by himself in an empty farm while looking for buffalo and at the same time befriending the Sioux tribe. Costner's movie is very well made but I really don't think that this film should have won the 1990 best picture Oscar over Martin Scorsese's masterful mob picture which came out in the same year which was Goodfellas because to me it was more deserving, Costner's film is on a par with some of the best western movies ever made along with The Searchers (1956), Unforgiven (1992), Rio Bravo (1959), The Good, the bad, and the Ugly (1966), Pale Rider (1985), and so many more. Like Driving Miss Daisy in the scenes where Dunbar tries to make friends with the Lakota Sioux tribe it is a story of skepticism and later it becomes a very inspiring story of friendship and love for one another. As well as the scenes where Costner's character is about to be hanged by his former military friends his fellow native American friends come back to save him and those scenes prove to us that people from different races can still be very important people in a particular point of your life.",

            "content": "Whether you are a fan of Kevin Costner or not, \"Dances with Wolves\" is a must see! Despite this film's impressive running time of 3 hours, it actually feels shorter than that once the powerful story plot draws you into the world of the Civil War era. Costner, Greene, and McDonnell should have all received Oscars for their performances, as this film was that good! I was amazed at how well the writers were able to portray the Native American life, too, as it is hard to come by a film that does this so well.Costner basically plays a Civil War lieutenant that comes across a Native American Sioux tribe while on his journey to the frontier. Over time, he eventually befriends the tribe. Not long after, he falls in love with one of the tribe's family members, named Stands With A Fist, a woman who they took in from another family after she tragically lost her husband. They end up marrying each other.Costner's character, John Dunbar, is then given the Sioux name \"Dances With Wolves\" after the tribe leader, Kicking Bird, played brilliantly by Graham Greene, notices Dunbar playing around with a wolf that he names \"Two Socks.\" Later on, Dunbar is captured by some soldiers of the Civil War and is pressed for answers as to why he is wearing Native American clothing even though he claims to be enlisted in the Civil War. He later tells them that his name is \"Dances With Wolves\" and that he is a member of the Sioux tribe. Knowing this information, the soldiers attempt to kill Dunbar, but their plans are foiled when the Sioux tribe intervenes and takes back Dunbar. Back at the tribe's camp, Dunbar then announces to the entire tribe that they should move their camp so that the soldiers won't know where to find them. They quickly object Dunbar's proposal. In response to this, Dunbar then announces that he plans to leave the tribe behind, and his wife, Stands With A Fist, also agrees to go with him. As they are leaving, the film ends with the tribe giving Dunbar a Native American salute as a way of thanking him for all that he has done for them.In summary, \"Dances With Wolves\" is one of those films that makes you feel like you are really there. It is simply an extraordinary masterpiece. The bottom line? See this film. You won't regret it!",

Lieutenant John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) makes a request to an insane major (Maury Chaykin) to be posted on the frontier before it dissapears. The Major agrees and John is sent to a far outpost to join other soldiers but quickly finds that they are no longer there. On his own he must make for survival as well as use diplomacy to ease tension with a local Sioux tribe. John learns that these people are not the savages his colleagues portray them to be and learns their way as well as befriending a wolf. John is now torn between taking on the Sioux lifestyle and betraying his fellow men or becoming what the army see as the enemy or can he make ties between the Indians and the army?This is 1 of my all time favourite movies. It has such moving sentimentality and is an absolute gem by Kevin Costner. Beautifully filmed (by an Aussie oscar winner) and written. It's quite dissappointing that Costner couldn't continue his success in movie making but this 1 is among the greats. The film researches the complexities along with the simple lifestyle of the Sioux tribe that no longer exists. This also has a huge emotional impact on the audience. \"Can you see. I am wind in his hair and I'm your friend\" is 1 of the most moving lines in this movie. The native ways of the American Indian was beautiful and at times savage but true to the land where the white man destroyed the buffalo for pelts and the land for greed. It captures the true tragedy that is the loss of these native tribes and their ways of life on what was their own soil. An educational masterpiece that all must see and love as I & many others do. Well done Kev!!",

Instead of allowing the surgeon to cut off his foot, he rides into the Confederate lines intending to commit suicide. It proves to be a distraction that wins an Union victory. The admiring visiting general gives him any position and he chooses to go west before it's gone. The isolated outpost is deserted after the disappearance of the soldiers. He is alone with his horse with only a wolf to keep company. The neighboring Lakota tribe makes contact and gives him the name of Dances with Wolves. Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) is the leader, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) is the wild young buck, and Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell) is a white woman adopted into the tribe ever since she was a child.This is both an epic and a compelling human story. It's a western but even more than the old formula. The comic relief that is usually in the old western like Maury Chaykin and Robert Pastorelli are instead used as characters of quirky madness. Kevin Costner gives the film's quiet leading man. The thing that truly sets this apart from the normal Hollywood western is the authentic attempt at native characters and culture. It's not only their sincere attempt at the language and the use of native actors. It is that they are human beings. The communication problems is done expertly. That doesn't always happen even in modern movies. Graham Greene is excellent as a leading voice of the Lakota Sioux band.",

We can only get so close as our potentials permit. Unfortunately, life is war, which we will lose, but we can decide how long and of what quality it will be.So Dunbar lived it to the fullest possible, but he was not narrow.Every being is fragile and because he knew it, he helped his friends (the warning about the arrival of the army and his escape in other direction from that of the Indians)as they helped him (the rescue from the army).In this way the Indians too could live it the best possible.The gratitude was expressed especially beautiful by the legendary scream from the cliff by Wind In His Hair.This is the reason why Dances With Wolves will be watched by many future generations.Similar can be said for The Shawshank Redemption and Papillon.",

The storyline follows a Civil War soldier who get stationed to single handedly maintain a post on the edge of Indian territories in the Midwest. As he comes to understand their ways he quickly sees the mistakes of the white man. When military forces check on him and receive pushback for their actions, he may have to choose one side or the other. This movie stars and is directed by Kevin Costner (The Postman) and also stars Mary McDonnell (Donnie Darko), Graham Greene (The Green Mile) and Larry Joshua (Cradle 2 the Grave). The settings and cinematography are a absolutely stunning. The circumstances are also fascinating as are how the characters face them and interact as they mature and evolve. It's impossible not to appreciate Costner's performance and his approach to the circumstances and how he depicts the events from this era, even if the story is fiction. This is a beautiful movie that tells a worthwhile story that makes the 3 hours run time bearable. I strongly recommend seeing this and would score it a 10/10.",

Even though much of the movie did have a similar plot to \"Little Big Man\", it was still a fine piece of work. Having the Lakota speak their own language gave the movie an extra feeling of realism. One could say that Costner's character started to live authentically only after he befriended the Lakota.We could be cynical and say that the movie features a white savior - and also note that Costner's next directorial effort was \"The Postman\" - but \"Dances with Wolves\" is still a movie that people should see. Like \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\", it refutes the idealized image of the Old West that audiences saw in John Wayne movies. It shows the true history of the United States. I don't know if I would call it the best movie of 1990 (a year that also gave us \"Goodfellas\" and \"Misery\"), but it's still up there. It's good to know that in the 25 years since the movie's release (to the month), people have taken a more serious look at our treatment of the indigenous peoples, to the point where some cities no longer celebrate Columbus Day.I recommend the movie.",

I had the pleasure of viewing the 4 hour version which felt in no way too long or dragged.

It is literally a story like no other.The cinematography is jaw dropping. Best cinematography in a film in my opinion. The frontier. The landscapes. The beauty that no longer exists. As Dunbar himself said he wanted to see the frontier before the white settlement. And he saw it! Saw it through the eyes of Kevin Kostner in his masterpiece achievement.Kevin Kostner really should have won the Oscar for his Acting. I mean the film won 7 Oscars maybe the Academy thought it should not get greedy, but the fact is Kevin Kostner played the role of a lifetime. He transformed into Lieutenant Dunbar. Even though some scenes are clearly 'Hollywood' you forgive it because the film is perfect. It is flawless in everyway.

Yeah, I was a kid.I watched it then, in the early nineties, maybe a half-dozen times. Then stopped and moved on. Even when the (nearly) four hour version came out, I avoided it to savor the experience I had for a special time.Sixteen years later, the Bluray was given to me for my birthday \u2013 my only request \u2013 and finally, I watched the 3 hour 58 minute version. Reaction?Well, I still love it. It's a beautiful, adventurous, wonderfully written and excellently acted epic. But, I'll hold off on the 6/5 star rating. Which would be hard to explain anyways.Some call this overrated, that it shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar and way too preachy. I disagree on all aspects. It's an epic yet small and intimate film \u2013 that's not something just about any filmmaker can do. It's very deserving of the Best Picture Oscar \u2013 sorry, Goodfellas \u2013 and besides, it fits with their love affair with epics. And watching this time, I paid close attention to see if I was too preached at. I didn't feel so. These are facts: Greed came over Americans \u2013 shocker \u2013 and we devastated these lands and more importantly, these people. (They got their revenge and my money when I gave up probably a year's salary at the Indian Casino over a period of a few years\u0085) Not once did I felt talked down to, or at school. If anything, I wanted to get educated on these wonderful people: the Sioux.Anyways, if you haven't seen this by now, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) fears he'll lose his leg in the Civil War and when his suicide attempt fails, he requests to be stationed in what he thinks is Nowhere, USA. Only, he befriends and is adopted into the Sioux tribe and takes allegiance to them over his own \"white people.\"Wow\u0085what is almost 4 hours I summed up in a few seconds. Believe me, there's so much more to the plot.The movie is gorgeous \u2013 it has both some of the best cinematography I've seen and one of the best scores I've heard. The love John does have for Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell) is genuine and fun to watch. And the camaraderie within the group, the peaceful and playfulness of the members and productive and loyal stands makes you feel as you're with them as well over the course of the movie.Highly recommended\u0085although, just stick with the 3-hour theatre version. I found the changes (additions) in this one-time viewing, even after 16 years of Dances silence. And the deleted now inserted scenes didn't add much.",

Even more overrated when it comes to acting and credibilty is his female opponent Mary McDonnell. Not only is she basically overacting but her appearance makes it even less credible. Why does her hairstyle have to be absolutely 1990, also even hooker-just got out of bed-and dragged thru the dirt-style? Her character is supposed to have lived with Lakotas for some two decades, and she still hasn't been told to comb and groom her hair like all the other women in the band, not even when she's getting married. It's just silly and does not go well along with the otherwise well studied original clothing and effects among the Lakota characters. This is a big turn down about the film as a total.\nThe plot is very much a Hollywood clich\u00e9, with good fighting evil, and as always the Pawnees are the bad indians. What was genuin and new in 1990, at least in such a big production, was that the audience got quite a good Insight into native culture and even more important, that they spoke their own language.

The officer who commits suicide in the beginning, what the f*ck, quite irrelevant and stupid. The only climax is that he has a change of heart for the particular Indian tribe and he never disliked them to begin with. The white woman who was captured, her story is bland and her acting is border line awful. The only good acting is the actors who portray native Americans. I have no idea how it is so praised and sometimes considered a classic. I bought it for 5$ because I was sure it would at least be pretty good because I tend to love movies of this genre, But No Way!

Kevin Costner's Dunbar is one of these and he takes off at the risk of his life before they can do this. In the process, he becomes a hero for risking his life in a charge (pretty much an accident because of random luck). He is given an opportunity to choose his next assignment and ends up on the central plains. He survives, living off what is there, and eventually meets up with Lakota tribesmen. What this movie tells us is the fact that the West is going to be gone; the Native Americans are going to be shoved aside. He is integrated into the tribe and finds there a white woman who was taken in when her parents died. He \"becomes\" a tribe member. This is a story about human beings and their spirit and gets away from the clich\u00e9s of the Western movie. Costner is fantastic in his role.",

            "content": "Dances With Wolves (1990) :\nBrief Review -A compelling human drama and some passionate filmmaking by Kevin Costner. Dances With Wolves is based in the novel of the same name which tells a story of white man (soldier) who goes to his military post but end up having friendship and bonding with tribal Indian group. The film is all about human bonding which cannot be stopped by any difficulties such as language, religion, cast and class. The soldier feels comfortable while living in a small village with tribals and they are ready to fight mightier enemy for him. This says so much about thier great friendship. I called it a passionate filmmaking because the film needed lot of research and dedication if it had to be made as a quality film. I couldn't see a single thing compromised or reduced for the sake of feature film-making. Rather, the film is an uncompromised classic. The locations, art direction, background score, costumes, language, accent and even the characterisation of all the actors all these things are uncompromised and outstanding. Look at Mary McDonnell's non glamourous avtar, how convincing she looks. Which actress would have accepted such a dull looking role? Kevin Costner does an incredible job as an Actor, producer and director of the film. He deserves all the credit for huge critical and commercial success of this film. I happened to catch the 236 minutes version of the film whereas original runtime is of 181 minutes but still I didn't find it boring. May be i got to watch more scenes and that's why it connected me more to the characters of the film. Dances With Wolves deserved all those 7 Oscars but i feel sad for Kevin that he didn't win Best Actor award. He deserved it for this astonishing performances. This is without any doubt The Best Film and Best Performance of his career. A Classic and a Must Watch !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "This movie ended up on my TV set against my desire for the 500th time, I have never reviewed it so here goes: This movie was created unwittingly as the poster child of Hollywood political correctness. Everything about it is makeup fantasy that shows no relation to 1870s reality. First of all no one who fought in the Civil War walked away from it resembling a Hollywood pretty boy. The ones that survived lived through dysentery, amputation, blood poisoning, disease, or death. Don't forget in movies you can die and still walk away.In this drama an individual single handedly wins the Civil War by charging on a horse with a sword. In reality he probably would have been made a bureaucrat with a cushy job in the Johnson administration. But no, our pretty boy wants to go west because he is too pure to live in nineteenth century white world. He may be pure but he is still a stupid white guy who doesn't yet know yet how wonderful other races are. Follow closely.Instead, cut to the chase. Evil white world follows him out west and you know the rest. On the way Dances meets a beautiful Hollywood bimbo. In a politically correct western no Hollywood pretty boy (who saved the Union) is going to marry no toothless Indian woman even though (wink wink) Indian women are superior to white women. You see the hierarchy in Hollywood is this: Hollywood bimbo is the center of the universe, the buffalo are next. Then come the Indians who are all equally good - no judgement here. Then comes white women then the rabid dog, then the white male. And That's Hollywood. The cinematography was nice. Of course if made today Dances would by played by a LSMFT - Jim Parsons, Neil Patrick Harris, or Ellen Degeneres? One last note: If a black person had sneaked onto the set all involved would have gotten confused into a catatonic state. What to do then?",

            "content": "Possible Spoilers!Dances With Wolves was my favorite movie for a long time and still is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time at the movies,in 1990.At that moment I was 11 years old and it made a huge impression on me,because this was the first \"mature\" movie I had ever seen in the cinema,maybe together with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.I remember that I thought that the scene in which Timmons,the dirty mexican,gets butchered by Pawnee Indians was very gruesome and it still is,as a matter a fact.My favorite scene was and still is the scene with the Buffalo's,a beautifully made scene. And then the surroundings,the beautiful country in which the Indians lived freely until the white men showed up.The movie shows the Indian life from the Sioux point of view,which makes the Pawnee bad guys.But still,the real evil men in the movie are the white men and rightly so.Costner(his best role in his career together with \"the Untouchables\") plays an American soldier called John Dunbar who wants to live in the Indian land peacefully.He meets with the Sioux Indians and starts to become an Indian,especially after he gets named Dances With Wolves(Sioux see him fool around with a wolf) and marries an Indian/white woman. Costner,who also directs the movie,gives the white soldiers their true face as brutal killers.The scene that gives the best image of that is when the soldiers kill Costner's horse and shoot on the wolf.In the end the white soldiers get killed by the Sioux Indians and that makes the viewer happy.The real end of the movie is rather sad,though.Costner leaves the Sioux with his wife and as we see them leave the camera goes away from the two and a text shows us that almost all the Indian tribes get killed or captured by the white soldiers.The version that I saw at the cinema was 3 hours long,but I've got a version of 4 hours on video that is as good as the 3 hour version. A must see for everybody we wants to see the story from the opposite side of John Wayne,the Indians. 10/10",

Hollywood most wants to make long winded epics that relate to something people feel is important, without really saying anything (Eg, Titanic, Lord of the Rings).This slow meandering tale lacks any great impact, but works (unlike nearly everything else Costner did later) because it suits the story. Set during the American civil war, Costner plays a war hero who is sick of the war and goes to the west where a different war is being fought. With no men to command (they have disappeared before he arrives) he first makes contact with, then befriends the plains Indians.Yet so called civilised man is not that far away and that will bring tragic results.Everything that is wrong with Costner movies is right here, and you can't help to leave this movie a little bit moved from this journey into a another world that has been destroyed by our own.",

This film doesn't try to transform points of view (like most 1990s movies tried to do later), but only tries to give each one's position (though I still consider that many white men of the US army aren't correctly depicted). The scene in which John Dunbar tries to feed \"White Socks\" (the wolf), and finally makes it is by far my fave. The way he earned Indians' respect made me feel great. But when he fell prisoner of his own army and caged just like a wild beast, I must confess I felt quite disappointed.

After 20 minutes I nearly switched it off - I thought it WAS very self indulgent, over slow and a huge ego trip for Kevin Costner. But I stayed on and about an hour in it suddenly took off and breathed a life (probably around the time the Costner character empties a lake of corpses). I realised that it took time to get into because the world it conveyed was merely being set up. Once into the thrust of the story I was emotionally involved and very impressed with the direction, locations and music. There are some moments of genuine tragedy and real bonding between the Costner character and the Indians. It isn't a documentary about the period, but it does give you a glimpse into that bleak time in American history.Once the film ended I felt that I'd seen a truly epic piece of work. I couldn't imagine watching the theatrical version - goodness knows how you can take an hour off the movie (thank God for DVD). I watched it on a massive projected screen, and in DTS - so it was a truly cinematic experience.Costner deserved his Oscars, but I think it was a one-hit wonder for him.

            "content": "A film that manages to combine deep and meaningful character study with exotic locations and the feel of an adventure. Dances with Wolves is one of those rare films where time becomes transcendent and you're no longer able to perceive the usual story arcs or acts. They're there and the film has a rock-solid foundation, but you're still surprised when something new happens, because the film has managed to lull you into its world, its prolonged seasons. This is a movie that is able to portray the passage of time properly. It's a film in which events don't take place over a weekend or even a month. Rather whole years just glide by. Or perhaps just months, it's impossible to say for sure, but it feels like years, a sizable chunk of a whole life.And what a life that is and what a person living it. Lieutenant Dunbar - masterfully played by Kevin Costner - is a war hero given a dead end assignment according to his wishes, so that he can resign there to die a slow death. Thus the film starts as a macabre portrayal of a man giving up, but unable to just lay down. And it never becomes clear whether he manages to shake that initial attitude towards life. The events slowly give him more reasons to live, but Costner always plays him slightly detached, like he's always just one step away from giving up again. It's an amazing story and one that requires space to flourish. Quite many films since this one have managed to recreate the same \"going native\" storyline, which of course existed before this film though never quite like this, but none of them have seemed to realize that the film needs to dedicate most of its running time to the actual \"going\". Because that's the story, that's the attraction. The action scenes and battles have their place, but the magic is in the community, in the bonds that slowly grow between the main character and the natives.It's very hard to find any flaws in this film. Its slow pace is not for everyone, especially in the extended cut, but I personally never complained or even noticed the hours. It's a captivating film from start to finish and every minute is well spent, be it a minute of quiet landscapes rolling by or a minute of blazing battle. All has its place and every scene tells a story, reveals another layer.One of the greatest westerns ever filmed, if not one of the greatest films. In my opinion a film that everyone should watch at least once.",

We know what happens to most of the Native Americans, so why drag it out? I love the story, the characters, their arcs, the plot, but it was all too long.

No doubt Costner did that to win the emotional adulation of his audience. He himself narrates that the result of this \"elevated me to the status of a living hero\".Still later, when setting up his post all alone, he writes in his journal how he \"is not the whole affair\".... an attempt at being noble, but that appears to be exactly how Costner wants others to see him -- and I mean Costner the actor, not Dunbar the soldier. And again during his stay with the Sioux, he mentions in his droll narrative how the people see him as a \"celebrity\". And still much later he states how the soldiers \"hate me like no other\".... there's that tin-plated nobility again. The hate for him has to be 'special', more than the hate for anyone else.And speaking of nobility, how noble - or even realistic - was it for this seemingly dedicated soldier to abandon his post and become an Indian? That is rather hard to believe, as is Costner forgetting all about his rifles and journal at his post, even though he knows that white men could show up at any time. This development only extended the film for another half-hour, which leads to one of the technical errors: the film's running time is severely too long. These are the things which prove that Costner was preoccupied with blowing his own horn, and that's a shame. His Personal Ulterior Motives belittle an otherwise well-made film.",

The film has a superb Civil War scene to introduce the disillusioned officer. Following this is a memorable performance from Maury Chaykin, who sends the lieutenant on his mission to the frontier.Slowly Lieutenant Dunbar learns about the Sioux tribe and integrates himself into it. This leads to several episodes that include such things as breaking the language barrier and making war on the Pawnee. I liked the fact that the Sioux spoke in Lakota, albeit a simplified version. These episodes are portrayed with high caliber cinematography and the aid of an excellent score by John Barry. The film can be slow-paced at times, but is interesting overall. Kevin Costner is decent as Lieutenant Dunbar and the supporting cast gives excellent performances.The theatrical cut is a good one, but I enjoyed the additions in the extended cut.

Kevin Costner's performance as Union soldier John Dunbar was wonderful and using real Native Americans in the film was a good idea.  In fact I know a chubby, crude-talking Native American girl who said that one of her relatives was in the movie.  I guess it could be possible.  It really had some emotional moments such as the scenes where the soldiers were shooting at the wolf who came to Dunbar's fort often (thus this is how he got the Indian name, Dances With Wolves) and where they were attacking the Sioux.  What's interesting to note is that my mom pointed out that normally in movies, the Indians are portrayed as being the bad guy and they never showed any positive characteristics about them, whereas in this movie, the white people are portrayed as the bad guys (except for John Dunbar) which in a way was true.  That was the Indians' land and white people took it away.  This was a wonderful film and is worth watching several times.",

Add in fine acting and direction, and you have one heck of a fine and entertaining movie.  You could not have asked for better performances than we got for the roles of \"Kicking Bird\" and \"Wind In His Hair\", and kudos to Nathan as \"Smiles A Lot\".  I may be out in left field on this, but I was not as pleased with Mary McDonnell as \"Stands With A Fist\". I did not read Michael Blake's novel, but what an outstanding screenplay he did.  As Lt. Dunbar was drawn into the Sioux fold, I felt as though I was being drawn, as well.  I found myself cheering during the rescue of Dunbar by his \"blood brothers\" and felt no grief for the fallen soldiers.  Absolute must-see!!!",

Historically, they did an excellent job of bringing this story to life as a period piece, representing a glimpse of the expanding Western Frontier. The filming was wonderful. The character development of the main character could have used more body. Mr. Costner was excellent in his role; but it felt a little like he was holding back and could've given it more passion. The main Sioux characters were better developed. The story is compelling, and worthy of its awards; but perhaps some of what I was looking for was left on the editing room floor? I am eager to see the expanded version. Still, it was a touchingly beautiful film, a \"must see\" for anyone.",

UnnecessaryJohn didn't tell the chief of the Village the whole truth once he got comfortable.he waited until the end. Unnecessary\nThings i Liked\nThe bonding between the American and the Indians.His way of narrating the storyThe name he has been given by Indians is cool. Shmanitotonka ob watchi.

Everything he did before or has done since is irrelevant. It's one of those transcendent experiences that is greater than the sum of it's parts. All of the necessary ingredients were in the right place at the right time for this movie, and magic happened. Like the extended edition of Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring, this version of Wolves is what should have been in the first place, test audiences and people with short attention spans be damned.

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILERS???I'm not a fan of any of the Kevin Costner movies out there, except for this one. No, I'm not here to bash him. I am just saying that trying to top the scope and beauty of DANCES WITH WOLVES with over-budgeted stuff like WATERWORLD is impossible. This is the one great work that he can be proud of for eternity.Based on a book by Michael Blake, DANCES WITH WOLVES is a story of a Union Soldier during the Civil War who takes an assignment in the west, far out into the prairie and \"Indian\" country. He finds the fort deserted and has no idea what's happened to the other soldiers who lived there. They might have been kidnapped or murdered or both by the fearsome \"Injuns\" who reside in the country, or they might simply have left their belongings and trudged out into the prairie during a freezing blizzard and froze to death. Lt. Dunbar (Costner) feels lonely and isolated, except for his horse and a friendly wolf who comes to visit now and then. But the beauty of the prairie is enough for him to feel content even without human company. For a while anyway. He meets several members of the Sioux village several miles away and slowly comes to trust, admire and befriend them. He realizes that white people have labeled \"Indians\" as savages, heathens and bloodthirsty murderers, and that the people are exactly the opposite of that. In time, Dunbar is re-named \"Dances With Wolves\" by the Sioux people, and he falls in love with an adopted Sioux of white ancestry called \"Stands With A Fist\" (Mary McDonnell), whose parents were killed by members of the Pawnee, when she was no older than five or six. Very much like the child SWAF was, Dances With Wolves is adopted as a member of the family of Sioux and his life takes on meaning for the first time he can remember.The People are worried and hope that Dances With Wolves will answer their many questions. The whites began to emerge in the 17th century, after the Spanish Conquistadors had been in and out of the land. The whites, unlike the other groups, seem intent on staying. The People are being driven further and further west, and their buffalo, the staple of their lives, are being slaughtered in such huge numbers that they are on the verge of extinction. In the early part of the 1800s, buffalo hunts were commonplace and successful. In the 1860s, buffalo were already threatened with extinction. Times were changing so fast that the People had no idea what would become of them. This film illustrates the mindset of the Sioux, and other Native American tribes, like no other film in existence. There are many memorable cinematographic scenes: The great buffalo hunt, the battle with the Pawnee warriors, the battle with the Union Soldiers, etc. But the best part of this picture is the human element, the struggle to communicate, the realization that a bunch of people that are thought of as \"ignorant\" or \"animal\" are actually very warm, compassionate, human, the understanding that even though someone is \"white\", it doesn't make him hateful or \"dirty\" or soul-less. Prejudices on both sides are resolved.\nA great story, as fresh and insightful as it was fourteen years ago. Wow has it been that long???",

I only watch the extended version, even though both the theatrical and extended are both excellent. But like with many of Ridley Scots films (Kingdom Of Heaven is a classic example) and The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, I prefer to watch the extended versions as I always think they add a lot more to the film.This movie though is without a doubt a 10/10. Beautifully shot, beautifully acted and definitely beautifully scored by the late great John Barry providing the best score of his entire career. The film deserved its success and it is without a doubt Kevin Costners best film to date after Field Of Dreams. A superb supporting cast too where you actually care about every single character.This film should be watched by everybody at least once and now that we have IMAX cinemas, I really hope that one day, the film is remastered for the format and has a re-release in IMAX in its extended form as it would be just incredible to see it on a screen of that size.",

Me however I didn't really care for the politics of this film and just enjoyed the story, the acting, particularly Costner's lead role as John Dunbar, the beautiful cinematography and production value and great score composed by John Barry. In my opinion people who don't like this movie probably think Michael Bay is a genius and think the Big Lebowski counts as an intelligent film. Go watch this film if you haven't already, the Oscars it won, especially the award for Best Director for Kevin Costner was well deserved, I'm also glad it won Best Picure over Goodfellas.

The movie is about a civil war soldier, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), sent to an outpost in the western frontier. There he encounters an Indian tribe camped a short distance from his outpost. He gradually becomes acquainted with the members of the tribe and, in time, becomes friends with the tribe. What makes this movie so good is being able to see and feel sympathetic to how the indians' land was more or less taken from them by the white man. It was done very cleverly by showing how John Dunbar went from the attitude most people have ( the indians were savages ) to understanding their culture and coming to appreciate it and understanding they were only protecting their way of life and territory. Most of the really good movies, like this one, will have you come away with an altered point of view or, at least, make you look at something in a way you haven't before.",

I was impressed by Mr. Costner's directorial debut, though I felt much of the same material about the Caucasian race's shameful treatment of Native Americans had been stated as eloquently in LITTLE BIG MAN.  Seeing the 4-hour cut of DANCES renders my initial reaction invalid. I recently viewed LITTLE BIG MAN for the first time in 15 years, and then bought my copy of the extended DANCES.  Comparing the two works is like saying THE LONGEST DAY covers the same turf as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  They may cover the same history but they are different poems in different languages.

Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful. The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil. The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other. Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did. The American Indians deserve it up to a point.

Injured in battle and facing a leg amputation and questionable prospects for survival, Dunbar commits a nearly suicidal act of bravery that inspires his fellow soldiers to charge and overrun enemy lines. Rewarded with the best health care, a promotion to the rank of lieutenant, and his choice of posts, Dunbar travels to the edge of the western frontier. Here he comes in contact with the Sioux nation and a thrilling and vibrant landscape brimming with fascinating wildlife. Dunbar discovers who he really is and even falls in love, but his fellow soldiers are not in the mood to celebrate his success.Dances with Wolves won seven Oscars including for best picture, and if nominated for best bromance it would have won that too. No \"I love you man\" moment can top that of the brash warrior Wind in his Hair shouting from the cliffside \"do you see that I am your friend?! Can you see I will always be your friend?!\" Tell me you did not have tears in your eyes.Elaborate and epic, Dances with Wolves made a deep impression on me when I first saw it as a senior in college. At the time it was refreshing and eye-opening to see the film's alternative takes on the plights of Native Americans, women and soldiers during the western frontier era. While these sympathetic takes have not quite withstood the test of time, at least it was progress. Kevin Costner (Dunbar) and Mary McDonnell are quite good, but the performances of Graham Greene (Kicking Bird) and Rodney Grant (Wind in his Hair) really stand out. The four-hour soap opera format is much more bearable with the alluring images of the majestic Grand Tetons, big sky country, and the eerie Badlands, combined with a catchy and emotional score. \"Good men\" said Hawthorne \"ever interpret themselves too meanly.\" Just do not interpret your bro too meanly.",

If that were not the case, I might be upset by it having been made; however, I'm not, and rather, I'm thrilled that it is as entertaining, engaging and communicates its important message well. Just as this does. This is involving right from the start, and the drama is effective and does not feel forced. It is epic and on a grand scale, helped by the immensely high production values and the amazing score. The visuals are stunning, with magnificent cinematography and editing, aside from those few and far between shots that are too close. This is largely credible, if admittedly black and white, and very clearly siding with the Natives, to the point where they almost couldn't allow any Americans to have attractive features. The battle sequences are masterfully done. This delves into the society and culture nicely. The narration is used well. Every acting performance is impressive, and Costner isn't the only one to shine. It is a credit to this that 25% of the dialog is not in English. There is great humor, and this is fun and exciting at times, not only serious. This holds some strong, graphic, bloody and occasionally gory or otherwise disturbing violence, a little moderate language, and very brief male nudity. The regular DVD contains four trailers, one of them for this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle the subject matter, that can be intense. A smart Western that still holds up. 8/10",

The 40th anniversary release will be a 9 hour cut!!!Is it a beautiful film, that is/was, refreshingly respectful of native Americans? Yes and good on it.Is it a little dull? Yup",

Not since Birth of a Nation has a film worn its racism so blatantly.  Aside from the plodding pacing, simplistic dialogue and wooden performance of Costner, the film is rife with historical innaccuracies and half-truths.  Who would know from watching this \"historical\" film that the Lakota Sioux were ruthless, vicious warriors who were not above scalping, mutilating and raping their victims?  Who would know that the Pawnee actually had a reason to attack the Lakota, because they  had been forced off their own land?  It is exactly this sort of half-baked revisionist history that does an injustice to the very people the film tries to ennoble. Costner and Blake must not think much of their audience to portray every soldier as a buffoon and/or coward, and to make the \"bad\" Indians noticeably darker-skinned than the \"good Indians?  This film should have come with a disclaimer stating that it is a work of fiction, because from reading and hearing people's responses to it, I am not sure the average viewer is smart enough to distinguish a well done movie from a piece of feel-good PC ego-stroking.",

            "review_title": "An impressive directorial debut from Costner",
            "content": "Kevin Costner's 1990 Dances with Wolves was notable for being the first Western since Cimarron in 1930 to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. But it isn't a typical Western, if there can be said to be such a thing. A sprawling epic (nearly four hours long, if you watch the Special Edition), it charts the growing relationship between US Army Lieutenant John Dunbar and the Lakota tribe he finds himself living next to, and the emphasis is very much on Dunbar starting to understand the Sioux rather than the clich\u00e9d \"Cowboys and Indians\" approach people often vaguely recall (usually incorrectly) from Westerns of the past.\nDances with Wolves is based on the novel of the same name by Costner's friend Michael Blake, which he in turn based on a spec-script he previously wrote. The story is character driven: Dunbar chooses a posting to the Western Frontier so that he can see it before he disappears, and is left isolated at an otherwise unmanned fort by the deaths of the only two people who know where he is. Lengthy scenes show him making the fort habitable before he even makes contact with the Lakota, and when he finally does so their initial encounters are characterised by mutual suspicion. Gradually, he starts to befriend them, eventually joining them on buffalo hunts and starting to learn their language, with some help from Stands with a Fist, a white woman who was adopted by the child when she was a little girl and can still just about remember how to speak English.\nAll of this takes about three quarters of the film. Surprisingly however, it doesn't drag. Costner is one of the most boring actors ever to achieve Hollywood success, as his tedious monotone in the occasional voice-over painfully demonstrates, but he proves well cast as the thoughtful Dunbar. The Lakota are uniformly well written, with the most obvious examples being Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Chief Ten Bears. Stands with a Fist also works well, starting out as a grieving widow who is terrified that Dunbar will try and take her back to the white people and ending up as Dunbar's doting wife. Graham Greene, Rodney A. Grant and Floyd Red Crow Westerman are utterly naturalistic as their characters, as is Mary McDonnell who is quietly impressive as Stands with a Fist. The characterisation only falls down at two points: Maury Chaykin gives a brief but memorable performance as the insane Major Fambrough, but the character is an absurdity. Later, the US army soldiers who capture Dunbar are portrayed as one-dimensional sadistic hicks; this is clearly intended to make it all the more satisfying when they get killed during the tribe's rescue of Dunbar but feels lazy. However, neither of these shortcomings is enough to derail the film.\nIt helps that Costner the director is more impressive than Costner the actor. He assembles all of the right ingredients, from the costumes and props to John Barry's sweeping soundtrack, and he handles the character moments and the action sequences equally adeptly. The decision to film many of the scenes in Lakota with subtitles is laudable, even if the accuracy has been questioned. Dean Semler's cinematography makes full use of the South Dakota location filming, with long and wide-angle shots that show off the frontier landscape wonderfully. He also provides some dynamic camerawork for the many action sequences: the battle with the Pawnee is particularly impressive. The buffalo hunt, with its filming of a herd of wild buffalo (and the odd tame one courtesy of Neil Young) is a breathtaking technical achievement.\nDances with Wolves deserves the epithet epic; it's also a beautiful, elegant and very well made film. By the end of the lengthy running time, the audience has to got to know the characters well enough that the poignant ending, which sees Dunbar and Stands with a Fist leaving the tribe to protect it from the US Army, feels genuinely sad, and the historical note about the Sioux submitting to white American rule thirteen years later feels like every inch the historical injustice it was. Dances with Wolves has been credited with prompting a resurgence of interest in the Western genre in the 1990s, and it isn't hard to see why.",

            "content": "In an occasional series I look back at films I have loved (to death) and muse on why with the vain hope that some of you will dust them off again and plunge right in all over again. They need to be re-watched. They're worth it.This time; Dances with Wolves, brought to us by a very wise and brilliant young actor (at that time) called Kevin Costner (you've probably heard of him!)NB: This was what turned Kevin Costner into gold dust for a few years (remember Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). Costner was King Midas basically until his sparkly, shiny star reached its apogee with his untimely filmic demise in the utterly ridiculous and overblown (and over-budget) Waterworld. (Holds head in hands; Kevin what were you thinking!)I fell in love with Dances With Wolves in 1990 and then recently again when I tried to force my 13 and 15 year old to watch it. Their response was the inauspicious; \"It's a bit boring dad,\" as they vacated the sofa 32 minutes in. But I contend here Calum and Adam that you're just not quite ready for it yet and don't be surprised if it cycles round again sneakily one Friday Family Film Night soon. Dances With Wolves is genius, a slim novel of 1988 vintage written by Michael Blake with his eyes on a possible screenplay prize, it was bought hook, line and sinker by Costner who yummed it up so much he starred, directed and drummed up the finance for it over the next few years. It became Costner's labour of love and at the same time he re-invented the Western form for Hollywood so they could fall in love with it again in a post-modern way with a whole lot less stubble and a whole lot more human heart.Dances With Wolves has Oscar written all over it and I fell head over in heels in love with it when I was a (still extremely naive and immature) twenty-two year old. Where to start then on this gorgeous-fest of love, hope, humanity and sheer cinematographical brilliance?Is it with Timmons the hapless mule-train driver who first takes the naive and idealistic John Dunbar (the solider fresh from the horrors of the Civil War) that Costner plays out to the Frontier, a sea of prairie where so-called civilisation hasn't reached yet? (Poor Timmons dies brutally - and brilliantly - the victim of some Pawnee Indians tracking back to their home-lands after a patrol. His scalping is so visceral we can almost hear (at an appropriate distance) the skin unzipping from the skull!)Or perhaps we should start with Kicking Bird (played by Graham Greene) the thoughtful and wise young brave who first visits the decimated Fort Sedgwick after John Dunbar first arrives.Or perhaps it is simply the vast, swaying grasslands of the mid-west, an ocean of Buffalo for mile upon mile? A landscape the sky was invented for, a landscape to put us in our mortal place.Or perhaps it's the sweeping John Barry soundtrack or incredible long, lugubrious shoots of the Dakota Badlands and the in-your-face wilderness of a country as yet untamed.At root the reason why so many of us love this film is the production values for the whole project, from cinematography through to the language coaching the Native American actors underwent so they spoke Lakota convincingly. Everything on this movie is sumptuous (except perhaps the budget, note to self Mr Costner) and it is strong and powerful theme of the story, revisited endlessly in mini-echoes throughout its three hour duration, that brings home such a resounding narrative success. Dances With Wolves works because the story is simple and straight as a Pawnee arrow and it strikes right to our hearts. It is about what we truly are, as individuals and as a species. It is about heart and head, family, connections and the wisdom of living together with tolerance and in harmony with our world. It is about the wind in our hair and the sun on our backs, it is about simply being as opposed to being something.The story is a back-to-nature tale of John Dunbar's gradual re-education about the so-called Savages the great White Man is expunging from America's heartland. It is an Alice Through The Looking Glass narrative where Dunbar very soon realizes, whilst amongst the metaphorical wolves of the title, it is his own kind, White Man, who are the savages. The story of this film was totally ripped off in Avatar, same idea, just with eleven foot smurf aliens and some eye-popping CGI. What Dances With Wolves has in spades which its newer and bluer rip off didn't (and I totally loved Avatar too) is that it helped reinforce a revisionist tack on the Great American West, actually much more like genocide than a heap of swaggering John Wayne gunslingers ever let on. Of course the Native American life-style is romanticized in this film, the wars between tribes, the pointless politics and the diseases and famines of a neolithic society are all glossed over, but we can forgive all that. It's ultimately an extended apology for all the Cowboy and Indians nonsense that went gone before. The Wild in West was the White Man's rapacious and violent land-grab and in Dances With Wolves we get to see that barbarism from the other end of the telescope. Not pretty or pleasant, but a truer account than most Westerns.Go on, buy it again and re-watch it. It deepens our humanity and succeeds in upsetting me deeply every single time I watch it.***** (Five Stars)",

Like other monumental motion pictures (Casablanca, Titanic) it sets the story against a huge backdrop (in this case, the Civil War).  After I saw this movie I wanted to buy a wolf for a pet.  Later reality kicked in and I figured that would be a little dangerous and illegal.  So I went and danced with my cat.  I honestly do not understand why so many people put this movie down.  Costner's performance was good not hideously bland and boring. Graham Greene would have won an oscar if Joe Pesci did not give a career performance in Goodfellas.  The soundtrack is so good Mozart couldn't have done it better.  My favorite scene is when Costner sees the Indian camp for the first time, simply stunning and timeless.  I still believe Costner's direction rates among the best of all time, right up there with Coppola's \"Godfather\" and Kazan's \"On the Waterfront.\"  The cinematography (beauty of the movie) looks better than heaven probably does.  Costner's horse was fabulous and can outrun Black Beauty any day.  For all those history freaks that declare this movie inaccurate, hello - did you see \"based on a true story\" anywhere in this motion picture.  That comment is so bogus it's like putting down Star Wars because it's not a true story.  If you enjoy history so much go read a history book.  Some people say this movie is filled with Costner's conceit and greed.  That's bogus too.  You reward Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and Mel Gibson's Braveheart when they both did the same thing (by the way I think both those movies are awesome as well).  Just because a man in Hollywood does a huge amount of work on a particular picture (Stallone did the same thing with Rocky, as well as Thornton for Sling Blade) that d oesn't mean there character has to be so humble.  I am happy Costner made himself a great character because he deserved it.  I would have done the same thing if I did all that work and so would all of the critics out there who cut this movie up.

The scenes where an Indian and Costner are talking have to be twice as long so the language can be translated by the white girl who has lived with the Indians. Thank goodness Costner learned the language almost over night so I wouldn't have to watch many scenes like that, but after that I had to see Costners words put in subtitles like the rest which I hate. And that overly long scene where the hesitant wolf finally takes food from Costner is film making greatness right? Costner should have gotten an Oscar for that scene if nothing else. NOT. And what in the world was with Mary McDonnell's hair. For it to stick out like that I think it would have to be teased and/or hairsprayed, which would make it not authentic - they didn't know about teasing or hairspray in the 1800's.

Overcoming the language barrier and their mutual fear and distrust, Dunbar and the proud Indians gradually become friends,\" according to the film's official synopsis.\"Eventually, (Costner) falls in love with the beautiful 'Stands With A Fist' (Mary McDonnell), a white woman raised by the tribe. He learns the culture of the Sioux, lives with them, and even experiences the breathtaking excitement of a buffalo hunt, but his knowledge of the fate which will ultimately befall the tribe torments him. Finally, he is faced with a crucial decision that will cause him to examine his heart and soul before making a heroic choice that determines his destiny.\" Some of the criticism regarding \"Dances with Wolves\" misses the point; it's intentionally about role reversal.Mr. Costner was a neighbor of mine during the 1980s. He lived on Palm Drive, past the old LCUSD building. I'd never seen a Costner movie, but knew he made them. After \"Dances with Wolves\" came out, you could measure his success by the amount of long, dark cars coming to pick up Costner for award ceremonies. There were quite a lot of limos, and the film's honorees included the aforementioned, plus writer Michael Blake, photographer Dean Semler, composer John Barry, and editor Neil Travis.Costner's film is very beautiful, and he looks very good in it; much like real life, but with more feathery hair. He's a nice man (very zen) just like the character he plays herein. I was surprised to see one of his daughters in the opening, playing \"Christine\" (Ms. McDonnell as a child); why didn't anyone think to match the character's hair? A great dad, Costner took his children on walks, and jogged when in town. Backing out of our car port, we always checked to make sure Kevin Costner wasn't behind the vehicle.******** Dances with Wolves (10/19/90) Kevin Costner ~ Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A.

This really does mark the highpoint in Kevin Costner's filmography, made at a time when he could do little wrong. His direction here is typical of all the best, well-shot films of this type, with great location work and a fine eye for detail. It's best strength though lies in the mix of emotions that bombard the audience. Pain, beauty, sadness, joy, and by the end a strong sense of anger toward the savage white land-grabbers; the like of which is very powerful and implemented superbly well. Despite the plot using the overused white person adopted by natives theme, everyone still should watch this film at least once.",

The acting is generally good, overall it is a very well-done film and was well awarded seven Oscars, but at twice the necessary length it is a shame that it cannot go down as a masterpiece. If it had been a half or even three quarters of its length, Costner would have directed a masterpiece \u0096 instead this is just a very good film, but nothing special.",

Dances with Wolves overall highlights the mistakes that white people make and the assumptions that they have about native cultures.

            "content": "This movie, by far, is my favorite of all-time. However, to see the edited TV or cable versions does not do this film justice! To get the most appreciation out if this movie, the DVD version is a must! There are extra scenes on the DVD which give you a better understanding of their respective scenes, such as when Stands With A Fist's husband is brought back dead by his fellow Sioux warriors after a battle against the Ute tribe. You then realize why she was slashing her wrists when John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) finds her on the prairie. Anyhow, this movie has something for everyone: Adventure, romance, action, and just overall wonderful human drama. Dances With Wolves basic plot is that Lt. John Dunbar, a recently decorated Civil War Union officer, requests to be assigned to the most remote Army outpost on the American frontier. His main reason is that he wants to see it \"before it disappears\", as he puts it. To his astonishment, he realizes upon his arrival at the fort, it is deserted. He doesn't know what happened to the soldiers who were supposed to be there but decides to stay anyway. During his time at the fort, he meets and befriends a group of Lakota Sioux Indians, although not with some apprehension on both sides at first. Eventually, he realizes that his pre-conceived notions and prejudices against this race of people are totally unfounded. He, for the most part, falls in love with the tribe after realizing what a peaceful and harmonious they prove to be. Dunbar then fully adopts the customs and culture of the Sioux and rejects his own past. This film has a terrific moral to it as to how we all have certain prejudices against people who are different from us and if we just take the time to know them, we can become better human beings. Also, the musical score in this film is unsurpassed. It was so instrumental in conveying the mood in each and every scene of this film.",

Ask any Indian, we find them VERY annoying. All they're interested in is what they want Indians to be.Once we get past the racism, Costner's acting is sub par, as usual. What can we expect from a guy whose debut was playing a frat boy?Oh, on the lighter side, American censors cut out a scene where Costner says \"Big buffalo\" and one of the Indians says \"Actually it was a little buffalo.\" You can guess what they thought he was talking about. And Costner's probably is fairly small, judging by the fact that he is speaking the female Lakota dialect throughout the movie. LOL",

I find myself humming along while I am watching the movie.  The scenery is incredible.  You find yourself wanting to run in those fields, maybe not with the buffalo; that could be dangerous! The actors that were chosen by Costner were perfectly cast.  I could not picture anyone else in the roles.  The Lakota are beautiful people and are portrayed as a noble, caring, brave and close-knit community.  They take pleasure and pride in family. This movie has everything; action, drama, suspense, humour and yes, a gratuitous butt shot.  Kevin Costner is a fine male specimen and a joy to behold.

            "content": "Very few films get better the more times you see them. Dances With Wolves is that film - for me at least - or one of them. I specificy me because the last time I saw this was when I was a young'un and today I am delighted to discover a film that is just as beautiful and moving as I remember it. I was judging it for its pure surface value then - and now I could judge it on that or anything else - on every level this film manages to succeed. It is one of the last of the Great Hollywood Romantic Epics tailored for for the spiritual grandeur of John Ford. Luckily for us, director Costner happens to be Ford's near-exact size. It's sad Ford died 17 years before the release of this film, because it is one while watching, one wishes Ford had seen it too. You know he would have been pleased. This was also that brief point in Kevin Costner's career where he was suddenly likable, and charismatic, and INTERESTING. Wow! Dances With Wolves is to Kevin Costner as is Wonder Boys is to Michael Douglas. Here he brings it together with a superb directing job that finely rivals Martin Scorsece's work that year on Goodfellas. Many have called Dances' win one of the worst, but I'm fine with it winning. Both this and Goodfellas are near perfect films in completely different ways, and some days I have a hard time deciding which is better. When Hollywood has neglected the subject of the Native Americans' plight (there are a few notable exceptions, such as Ford's \"Cheyenne Autumn\" and \"Little Big Man\") this film officially does all that has been missing justice in one grand, beautiful film. It begins with a spell-bindingly ridiculous sequence where Costner somehow fails to commit suicide riding a horse in front of enemy Confederate lines - it climaxes thrillingly, a battle on the creek where we twitch furiously happily every time our Sioux take down another Union'er. It ends with the devastating tragedy of a historical fact. David Lean died in 1991, and I have to wonder whether he ever saw this film too. This film is very much the mix of Lean and Ford, and I can't imagine any two director's who could be more perfectly combined. There are empty spaces in their works that could be filled by the others' - and thanks to Kevin, the space is filled. It wins Oscars for Best Supporting Actor - Rodney A.

Kostner won the award since he has the Hollywood morons behind him, where as, Scorsese, is considered an outsider, who lost to a mediocre director. Why couldn't they find a American Indian to portray \"Stand with a Fist\"? The dialog between her as an interpretor sounds like The \"Jeopardy\" show.. Dunbear..no..Dunbar. The hunting of the buffaloes and the stockade-even though makes a nice spectacle-is cruel and should not have been allowed by the South Dakota authorities, not to mention the carcass shown of them. Kostner as John Dunbear! is a selfish loner (the type who shoot their own driver) who keeps a journal for the sake of narration but his voice is effeminate and shrill. This guy is no Morgan Freeman or Ray Liota. His acting is good when he gets on hand and knees to portray the Tantkata (buffalo.) even the Indians were impressed and seemed to them as good acting. It looks like he made a trip to the frontier, to hook up with this girl who is a bad interpretor but obviously good at other things and sleep in a tent. The story is drawn out for no reason. The only recreation and entertainment comes from a Kostner and the jackal staring at each other, even though the jackal comes out as a better actor! The shot where he picks up the wounded girl on to the horse is not shown-the reason is-it is almost impossible to do this, since the stirrups didn't exist. The movie is a money maker but was it better than \"Good Fellas\"? If so, why is it not in the list of Top 250 Movies? May I ask?",

His request is granted (after a really unusual scene where a man announces he has just soiled himself). He then meets the natives, who are understandably worried about the white man's moving in on them. But Costner just wants to be friends -- how can he make this work? Kevin Costner appears in and (in this case) directs epic films. At three hours and fifty-six minutes, this is the most epic of them all. But it's a good kind of epic, holding your attention with a rich story and strong characters (thank you, Graham Greene). I may not personally enjoy this as much as \"Waterworld\" or \"The Postman\", but it is probably the better film critically.There has been some complaint that this is a \"liberal\" movie. I can understand the complaint. This film definitely gives a more sympathetic point of view to the natives than the Americans. Reflecting on the situation, we now recognize the natives were wrongfully massacred. However, this is not the traditional view. Also, Dunbar says he wants to see the frontier \"before it's gone\", implying a liberal anti-sprawl stance. I don't have a problem with his views, though I do think they were not common at the time.The film is full of good surprises: fights, love, historical oddities and Costner's bare bottom. I think you should see it if you haven't. My brother has watched this film a dozen times, so it has to be worth your watching it at least once.

Although i never prefer Hollywood films which are so long but with 'Dances with Wolves' you can sit for 3 hrs. without getting annoyed at any point.The film directed by Kevin Costner is artistic yet very simple. I don't know if he has any other title which is so much popular. The story portrays the terminal era of Red Indians with different perspective.. It is normally believed that the tribes including these people were cunning as well as brutal. But in this film the other side of the coin has been highlighted. It has been shown how American armed forces try to conquer their land so that they can exploit it for their own advantage. Their operation almost leads to the extinction of a community in whole.Kevin Costner has crafted this film so beautifully that the ethical beliefs, customs and rituals of the Red Indians are shown in the most mesmerizing fashion. This film clearly delivers us a message that if someone wants to form a bond of care and affection then language is certainly not a barrier.There are numerous reasons due to which one can go for this film. The set decoration, the costume, the direction and of course, the plot. Overall, this film has truly justified with its 1991 Academy Award nominations and wins.Go and watch this movie... you'll never regret it !! 9/10 Highly recommended ....",

Seriously, is been 30 years since this film was released, I've watched it over 50 times (at least!) and I NEVER STOPPED CRYING LIKE A BABY watching this INCREDIBLE scene!The \"Wind in His Hair\" says all if two phrases, ALL ABOUT PURE FRIENDSHIP!\nTo me, this is the ULTIMATE love, among with the love for your children. No erotic love, no. The pure love for YOUR FRIEND, that makes you sacrifice for him, your brother in arms, your ...brother, period!The film is EPIC, I mean... seriously... GIGANTIC EPIC!\nAnd I'm not even American, nor Native Indian origins... and still, this film TOUCHED ME SO MUCH, that I thought I am Lakota and I was close to start searching for relative origins!!!Okay... I love western films. And I do love the Native Indians, the REAL AMERICANS! I always was supporting them watching films, even if I was pretty sure they will lost and slaughtered from the White men in the end... No matter, I was always with them! And this film... oh boy... is a POEM, A TRIBUTE for those people. If you have A SINGLE DROP OF INDIAN BLOOD in your veins, this is a LEGACY film for your people, you MUST watch it.Great photography, emotional music/soundtrack, superb costumes, REAL LAKOTA (SIOUX) LANGUAGE FOR A CHANGE (not English!), REAL INDIAN FOLKS-ACTORS (not... painted White actors!)... real buffaloes, real... real...

            "content": "There can be no denying 'Dances with Wolves' is an incredible production and it certainly deserves all the accolades and high praise, but ultimately I found the film (eventually) a bit boring.Yes, it is an interesting story of a man's journey to self-discovery, but to sit through a 3-hour western drama with very little action does become tedious. If the film was just over 2 hours long, or 2 and a half, I might have found it less boring. Some scenes were unnecessarily long and could have been cut. The film is also very slow moving.Ok, so that's my main criticism. Kevin Costner is wonderful as John Dunbar. We don't really know too much about the character, but since he is about to discover who he truly is and wants to be, it doesn't really matter. There are some very funny moments, too. The cinematography is beautiful and I loved the setting. 'Dances with Wolves' is a story of courage, will, determination, moral values, and unlikely friendships.Off course a love interest was inevitable and predictable, and when the love story finally took over, I really became bored. We all view films differently, and that's a good thing. For me, 'Dances with Wolves' is too long a movie, and there were moments when I got a sense of deja vu. 'Gone with the Wind', for instance, is longer still (about 4 hours), yet I never felt bored. The 'Lord of the Rings' films are about 3 hours long each, and they, too, kept me engaged for the entire duration of the film. 'Dances with Wolves' just drags too much, and there are many rather quiet moments in the film. It is a beautiful movie with lots to admire, but just too slow for my liking.",

It is a human drama, it is a classic Western, a civil war film and a film about understanding of Native Americans. Costner plays Lieutenant John Dunbar or as he will come to be known by the Native Americans - 'Dances with Wolves.' The story goes that Lt. John Dunbar, exiled to a remote western Civil War outpost, befriends wolves and Indians, making him an intolerable aberration in the military. The film is one of the first of it's kind to treat Native American's with respect, this is an intelligent film about breaking down the barriers of communications between a tribe of Native Americans and Dunbar. The story is brilliant and the acting is wonderful. The music score by John Barry is brilliant and his best alongside his score for 'Out of Africa' and I won't mention the Bond theme because no one really knows who really did it. The cinematography is brilliant and in my favorite scene from the film that is in perfect showcase. Late at night Dunbar is woken by the sound of buffalo. He can't see anything through the fog as he runs into the open field and as he stands there he is surrounded by a herd of buffalo who emerge from the mist and on the characters face emerges a look of wonder and amazement. How wonderful it is that the audience shared the same reaction throughout the whole movie.",

            "content": "Nineteen ninety was a different time for Kevin Costner. This film, which he directed and starred in, won seven Oscars (unjustly overshadowing \"GoodFellas\" in my opinion) and cemented his status as one of Hollywood's heavy hitters. Fast forward nearly twenty years later and he's equally famous (or infamous) for a couple of massive flops (\"Waterworld\" and \"The Postman\"). However, this early directorial effort shows some of the promise of what might have been.The story concerns a Union lieutenant who requests a post on the frontier so that he can experience it before it fades into history with the westward approach of 'civilized' man. In his solitude he connects with nature and then strikes up a friendship with Native Americans in the territory. It's a fairly engaging story but I feel that there were a few concessions made to give it a broader appeal. I could have easily done without the romantic angle and I feel that the film would have had more resonance if it had been cut off a little earlier.Costner's not too bad of an actor but I would have preferred someone else in the role. It's not that he's particularly unconvincing but rather that he lacks personality. The supporting cast is hit and miss, with Graham Greene standing out as the best of the lot. He managed to nab an Oscar nomination along with Costner and Mary McDonnell, neither of whom I would have singled out.Costner's direction is fairly accomplished and there is some nice cinematography at times but I wouldn't have chosen him over Scorsese for Best Director. The score by John Barry sometimes seems overbearing as well. I would have rather had sparser instrumentation to go along with the sparseness of the frontier. However, the score won an Academy Award so I may be in the minority regarding its merits.Considered as a whole, \"Dances With Wolves\" isn't a bad film but, as we've seen many times, the Academy got carried away and made some now-questionable Oscar choices. As for myself, I believe that with a few tweaks this could have been a great film rather than just an okay film.",

Along with the genre usual tools (roaring music, breath-taking landscapes, etc.), Kostner provide us with the most authentic native tribe portrayal ever captured on film. Here, every single element of the indians daily life is depicted in detail, but far from the documentary style: in fact, everything is showed as part of the story-telling. Then, the linguistic choice. It is here that the movie raises from excellent to memorable: we hear the true language of the natives, their voices sound distant and fascinating, exactly as they must have sounded to Lieut. Jhon J. Dunbar at his first meeting with the Sioux (Michael Blake's novel was about Comanche, though, but while the Comanche language happens to be disappeared with its speakers, Lakota is still spoken in North Dakota Sioux Reservoir. No one ever attempted such a task, not even the righteously famous \"new Hollywood\" western films, like (Blue Soldier) between many others. The original novel is carefully respected under every other aspect, and the result is a powerful, moving picture of what America once was, and of the people at which expense America has been built. In his directorial debut, Kostner displays what eventually has remained his distinguished mark: a style both magnificent and visionary (the buffalo hunting scene is masterful), with a notable sense of what cinema has to be: something larger than life, but made of life itself.This movie stands, in movie arts, as the greatest tribute Hollywood has ever made to Native Americans, and as a great lesson of national awareness for all who desired to know the dirty, mixed, deep roots of the United States of America.",

My only objection is that Kevin Costner puts himself in the frame just a bit too often and for too long. As for the rest, the performances are impressive, the story heartwarming and heartbreaking, totally believable, the production design just awesome and the direction, though sagging at times,as good as it can get. Kevin Costner should stick to direction, here he shows a wonderful talent.

He could play both brave daredevil and degraded debauchee-ribald. And he played, but evidently didn't convince exacting critics. Well, let so be it. All the same we love him. He nevertheless won critics' hearts by his director's talent. His epic western film \u00abDances with Wolves\u00bb - the confirmation of that.This is an extraordinary story about extraordinary man. Each of us makes strides along the road of life with one or another destination, leaving the tracks by acts of various kinds. Somebody sows the good seed, somebody destroys everything, somebody creates for the welfare of science and culture and somebody aimlessly goes down with the stream in expectation of opportune destiny. The character of \u00ab Dances with wolves\u00bb, First Lieutenant John Dunbar doomed to be a hero. His heroism is not the ostentatious prowess and thirst of recognize, it's his self, his way of life. His conscience, his spirit and his desperate heart lead his acts. His vital desire don't come to conquest of all possible and impossible heights, he violently persists in discover the frontier within himself.Growing roots in an uninhabited fort, stoically and thoroughly overcoming the harsh natural conditions, John Dunbar conscientiously and patiently waits for other soldiers. At first sight, he's absolutely lonely. But he realized very quickly all advantages of his loneliness: finally he was left alone with himself. Getting acquainted with Sioux, with their way of life, rituals and law, he doesn't look for personal gain. His aspiration to become closer with new neighbors, to be imbued with their traditions and, in the end, to become a part of their tribe, was dictated not by desire to relieve the lonely pastime or establish the good neighborly relations with strangers. All his acts \u2013 are heartfelt needs heart and soul. The destiny an incredible way throws John in the dizzying centrifuge of even more incredible circumstances, which frenzied rotation only strengthens his will and morale, opening him his true capabilities and personal orientations. Going over to the Sioux side and fighting against the U.S. Army, Dances with Wolves has no doubts in his right choice and actions. He doesn't compromise with his conscience, he acts jointly with it. He had found himself, the meaning of his way, and he didn't betray these acquirement.John Dunbar stepped into a heroic way from his birth and relentlessly moved on it even on unconscious level, without changing neither his route nor to himself. Ha was a hero even before accomplishment of his heroic feat. He went all his life to these and subsequent feats. John Dunbar didn't become Dances with Wolves, he became himself. And those circumstances, which thick he gets into, only push him to the frontier within himself, his genuine predestination.The staggering movie! And staggering Kevin Costner!",

            "content": "First let me talk about what I consider to be the strengths of this movie. John Barry's score is excellent and well deserves the oscar it won.  Dean Semler's cinematography is magnificent and, to me, the highlight of the movie.  For many years I considered the cinematography of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" to be the best I had ever seen.  Now I'm not so sure.  To me, the filming of the buffalo hunt/chase is one of the great achievements in movie history.  And the filming of the vistas and the land under different lighting conditions is outstanding.I did not see the performances of any of Mary McDonnell's competitors, but was very disappointed that she did not win for Best Supporting Actress.  And the nominations for Art - Set Decoration and Costume Design were very well deserved.Another top achievement was getting to know the Indians very intimately and coming to realize that individually, the Indians of the 1860s are very much like white people today.  And it showed, to an extent, how Indian culture of the 1860s differed so vastly from white culture of the same time.  It would have been a good idea, I think, to have developed this aspect some more.That is one of the weaknesses, in my opinion, of this movie.  Another is the tendency to portray the Sioux as 100% good and the whites and the Pawnee as close to 100% bad.  I have a handful of reputable books that all point out that there were a significant number of whites who were sympathetic to the Indians during this time.  Unfortunately for the Indians, there weren't enough of them and most were back east.Regarding the Pawnee, it is true that they were enemies of the Sioux.  But so were the Crow, Shoshone, and some lesser tribes.  From what I have read in my books, the various tribes of the Great Plains competed against each other for enough land to support them.  They needed water, grass for their horse herds, wild game for food, and buffalo for just about everything. They warred against each other.  But that doesn't make one tribe \"good\" and another tribe \"bad\".Finally, there is too much of Kevin Costner in this movie.  I don't know if he realizes or agrees, but it seems that he was trying to make himself, not the people of the Sioux village, the centerpiece of the movie.  If someone else had done the narration, that would have been a big help.  Or if someone else had played the part of Lt. Dunbar, that also would have been a good idea.",

Great actors acted very mediocre. The story was mainly about mad people acting weird, the storyline was very weak. Then the story changed and it was mainly about Costner and his solitude. The movie was now very similar to one of the pseudo-documentaries set in the nature. One of those scripted documentaries where an animal is followed. The animal has a name and an artificial voice-over tells us what the animal is feeling and what the animal's motivation is. These pseudo-documentaries are usually poorly made and very much made up.

Like those two, I dealt with it and watched the whole film.This is about a Civil War soldier named John Dunbar who is exiled out in the middle of nowhere. While he is there, he and the local Sioux tribe becomes friendly with each other.Kevin Costner is pretty good here. His haircut in some scenes reminded me of Mel Gibson from Braveheart. Graham Greene is magnificent as Kicking Back or whatever his name is.The score for the film is truly memorable. I can't remember a good score from the 1990's as good as this one.

The pic's still an all-American boy's adventure, owing a lot to Jack London's books and in that respect watchable (if not nearly as harsh and absorbing), but finally too long-winded and overreaching.6 out of 10 gripping buffalo hunts",

In this movie we finally see Indians portrayed as they probably were: a people with a culture that white Americans were not able to understand. Cavalry officer John Dunbar, on the other hand, understood the Indians, forced by his isolation, but ended up being acculturated by them to the point of marrying an Indian woman. From there, this character follows his heart and his sense of justice more than his rational discernment. The story is deeply romantic and has a touch of sadness because we, the public, know the fate of these Indians, and the film shows us how the Americans knew to be unfair and cruel. Kevin Costner has earned in this film one of the most remarkable works of his career. He was brilliant in the role of the young American officer, to whom the fear, the need and the curiosity lead to initiate dialogue and coexistence with the Indians. Mary McDonnell gave birth to the young Indian who marries Dunbar and filled her character with gentleness, understanding and joy. The way the Indians are represented seems historically accurate, as does the representation of Americans. The wide prairie scenery is a beautiful addition, astounding and astounding the audience. Some sequences, such as marriage or hunting, are worthy of anthology.",

He could have done better. But what am I thinking? He did such a great job in direction and producing, I cannot blame him for not winning the Academy awards, can I? The rest of the cast did fine job too.The sound was great, it's so suitable with the view of the wilderness of the place.

It was a story that was long overdue...entire generations were lied to about the injustices and downright hatred the Lakotas and other American Indian tribes suffered. The film accurately portrayed how the Lakotas embraced their land, taking only what was needed, never anything more. Graham Greene and the other actors who played the Lakotas and Crow were outstanding. They were believable...real humans who were driven off their lands due to \"manifest destiny\".

It carries you to the place whether it be a Civil War battlefield or hospital, or a dusty fort at the end of the westward sprawl of America ca. 1860s, the rolling hills of the prairie, or the majesty of a huge herd of buffalo, this movie is transcendent visually. The musical score by John Barry whisks you away to place, and a moment, with perfect effectiveness. Just play \"The Buffalo Hunt\" on the radio, the next time you are driving in an open expanse. You'll understand. Historically, this capture the dichotomy of the American expansion westward, and the challenges it presented to the Sioux and other nations displaced by this expansion, in beautiful and sorrowful detail. It shows is the majesty of what the American Indian world was like. This makes this Dances with Wolves such an important story for future. Kevin Costner shares the objective story of the American Indian. Too many movies cast the American Indian as mindless and bloodthirsty savages. This film captures the American Indian as the unwitting protagonists in a story of the duel between the past and the present, a position they would have rather avoided entirely. Even the Pawnee, in their displays of hostility in this movie, act in response to a sense of frustration and self preservation. This movie captured the pride of a people, as well as their anxiety, in the face of changes that they ultimately could not challenge or control. This story of the American Indian remains beautifully intact with this film.",

The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier. Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional. No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth. Costner captures this feeling with perfection. Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery. There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence. His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when \"Dances with Wolves\" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true. For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.",

Now one thing I should point out is the novel and hence the movie is purely fiction.Having said that and reading some of the negative reviews and scorn surrounding the depiction of white people in the movie, I would like to say, are all white people evil? No. Were all Indians evil? No. However, being part Indian I think I have a valid point to make and that same point was made in the movie, \"The white man comes and he takes. Without asking.\" What is not said is because the American mindset is we kill and get what we want because we are better. Manifest Destiny is no more than excused genocide. The US slaughters because it can. If anyone doubts the nastiness of the US all one has to do is to read the letters of General Sheridan, Sherman and others of their ilk. BTW I would also point out the quote, \"The only good Indian is a dead one!\" didn't originate with Indians. If I have one issue with this movie is it the depiction of white soldiers being the predominant race in the Union Army when they were slaughtering the Sioux. I have no sympathy for the black race calling for reparations as they helped wipe out what was left of the indigenous population. As a matter of fact, the dominant race in the US Army during the Indian wars of the plains was black with white officers.So a movie was finally made that shows the people of the plains as being human. As for the Pawnee, as history shows, all enemies are always reviled. This is true of our time, to whit the Iraqis, so let those of us without sin cast the first stone. I'm sure if a story was presented from the Pawnee point of view they'd be depicted as saints.Notice that all stories show their subjects in the finest of lights, this is true from Beowulf to the present day. Even Romeo and Juliet two suicides are portrayed in the best of light. So LIGHTEN THE f**k up.Go to the movies and enjoy yourselves for 90 minutes to 9 hours. Oh and by the way GET a LIFE!My recommendation? Get the movie's extended version if you liked the novel. This version more closely follows the novel than the one released in the cinema. Then watch it with a grain of salt. However, I do advise reading actual material from the period, especially what Col. G. A. Custer had to say regarding the issue of the black hills and the Sioux. Also the novel was originally about the Comanche. It was thought at the time of filming that depicting the Comanche as benign would offend some people hence the change to Sioux.",

Reminiscent of the old Eastwood-Leone films, but done much more professionally. Costner never so much resembled an animated corpse as he does in this flick, yet it works marvelously. He is a poster boy for stereotypical Indian stoicism, and the Sioux embrace him with open arms. I think the politics of Cowboy Bad, Indian Good isn't too heavy handed either. The message is certainly there, but is told in a fair manner, as it points out that not all of the American Indians were saints. Ill leave that all alone. Its rather long, and I don't think Ive seen the end more than once. But I never tire of attempting to rewatch it.

When I first watched it, probably at the cinema, I really liked it and I liked it again once it was bought on VHS, so I couldn't think where the disdain for it had come from when I watched it this time and found it to be a highly enjoyable film.I can only assume that it came about, because Kevin Kostner suddenly started appearing in everything and he wasn't regarded very highly for his performances in other things, especially 'Waterworld' (1995) and that the idea of watching such a long, long film, with him in it, was off putting.Actually, apart from his boring and monotonous drawl as he narrated his journal, although I suppose that might have been appropriate for his character, Kevin did a very good job in this film. He was actually quite handsome and had a lovely bottom on display, but he also delivered a great performance too.The film overall could definitely have been a good smidge shorter and I do feel that if it had been, I would have been and would be going forwards, more inclined to watch it more often, but films of over two hours in length really are a commitment, especially when the subject matter wasn't exactly my go to genre. I liked the message that it sent that showed people getting along and the historical aspect, that provided an idea of the feelings at the time. It wasn't essentially my own history, being from and living in Britain, but it was still of interest.I also liked the fact that most of the story was fairly calm and carefully blended with the fewer rough moments. It was a film more about tolerance and acceptance than their opposite, prejudice, as well as an exploration of the lead characters self, away from what appeared to be a bad element, in the form of the American soldiers. The one thing that always amazes me though is how bad the Americans make themselves look in some of these films. It's almost as if they were saying that for every good man in the US, there were 60 or 70 bad ones to undo all the hard work that he had achieved.With that aside, I will no longer groan when I see this in the TV guide, but I will still have to consider if I have the time to watch it again when there are other films still out there to be watched. It was definitely one to be recommended for the beautiful way in which most of it was filmed and for its peaceful and easy qualities for the most part.759.81/1000.",

            "content": "My view of this film has changed, but it's still great in many ways. I still never tire of watching the buffalo hunt, and the period is brought to life marvellously. The extensive use of the Lakota language, even if flawed, is immensely admirable and educational, as is the portrayal of Native peoples in a positive light.But the portrayal of the Sioux is perhaps too positive, and that of the Pawnee too negative. As with Last of the Mohicans, the good guy Natives are Elves, while the bad guy Natives are Orcs. The Sioux and the Mohicans are graceful and respectable, while the Pawnee and Huron are bloodthirsty and barbaric. The Sioux and Mohicans are also long-haired and handsome, while the Pawnee and Huron are bald, unsavoury, and smeared in frightening war paint. The two films demonize the Pawnee and Huron in order to garner more sympathy for the Sioux and Mohicans. Kind of insulting if you ask me, to all four tribes. And while the film is commendable for portraying Native peoples (the Lakota anyway) in a positive light for a change, it seems to give the false impression that the Lakota were all saints. Some real-life Lakota carried out brutal attacks, against the supposedly exceptionally savage Pawnee no less, burning their lodges and killing women and children. Look up the Battle at Blue Coat's Village, and also Massacre Canyon.People go on about the Americans being portrayed as all vulgar and repulsive, but I'm not sure this is fair. A very small amount of Americans appear substantially in the film, and it is easy to imagine that the behaviour and attitudes depicted actually would've happened. It's hard to tell if Kevin Costner intended to give a blanket portrayal of them, because the Lieutenant who questions him is a good character. There's even a deleted scene where Dunbar stops Wind in His Hair from scalping his dead body.Sticking with appearance, although the period is brought to life really well, the Sioux always look like they've just stepped out of the shower, while the Americans are always dirty (Timmins especially) and the Pawnee are always sweaty. These contrasts kind of take me out of the period a bit.Stands With a Fist is another contentious character. It's quite a coincidence, isn't it, that there just happens to be a white woman living with Dunbar's Sioux neighbours. And of course he just so happens to fall in love with HER. But it is a plausible situation. And if he prefers the white woman over all the Sioux women, that's his choice. It's also an interesting dynamic. But I still would've preferred if Dunbar had fallen in love with a Lakota woman. There wasn't any real intimate interaction between Dunbar and a Lakota person. He always seemed kind of distant from them.Probably the most common critique of this film is that it's a condescending White Saviour film. This is just not true at all. I mean Dunbar gives the tribe a heads up on the presence of buffalo, and he evens the odds against the attacking Pawnee by giving the Sioux the guns from the fort. How is he a messianic figure? He's just helping them out and earning their respect. If anything the Sioux save Dunbar, I mean they literally do at the end of the film.Overall I still like the film, but not as much as I used to. I still think it deserves an 8/10, but that's down from the 10 I used to give it.",

            "content": "The Dances With Wolves from which the title derives is the name given to Kevin Costner's Union Army Lieutenant, named John Dunbar, by the Native Americans he'll come to reside with. It's a touching moment, one of rather a few in a 1991 piece directed by Costner himself, and gets across a sense of equality between two sides whom come together through an entire clan representing one and and a lone individual representing another. The film sprawls over a number of various genres, ranging from war to romance to western, but is never sprawling in the negative sense; all this eye for scope and extravagance nicely reigned in by a man doing just as well in front of the camera as behind it. Set during The American Civil War and running on hostilities between the north and south as well as the Native Americans and the issues they have with rival clans of their own kind, the film is wonderfully low-key in its dramatisation of all this conflict and hatred boiling up between individuals; Costner's presence as this Lieutenant acting as this rock on which to map onto and observe. After all, the film unfolds in the beautiful locale of 19th Century North America - the film obliging in focusing on all the beauty of this place at times such as these amidst all the hatred and warfare, in the views; naturality of the place and eventually the love with a young Native American woman.In Dunbar, we have a lead the film is unashamedly proud in detailing as softly centered and understanding as possible. Positively pacifist in mostly everything he does, Dunbar represents the very antithesis to a Spagetti Western lead; adopting traits that are more suited to more classical western leads of great honour, courage and moral value whom are only ever as violent as they need to be when drawn into duels with the wicked. Dunbar's first action is to essentially win a battle between Union and Confederate soldiers without shooting or harming anyone. He does this by way of engaging in a suicidal act that'll come to double up as one of sheer bravery, but without ever actually killing or harming anybody; a riding up to the enemy on a horse, sacrificial Christ like pose in-tow, as enough confusion and doubt is implanted within the minds of the enemy that a frontier charge occurs.This heroic act, in the eyes of his superiors, is enough to warrant a repositioning to another front; something Dunbar requests when his dream, it appears, is to get as much out of this conflict as possible by journeying far and wide so as to lap up the surroundings amidst the ugliness of war. His posting does not go so well in the initial stages, the camp is devoid of other people and that sense of being all alone and rather vulnerable is put across by way of some uncanny stumblings across of dead animals in nearby ponds of water and an interruption to his stay in the cabin on behalf of his horse giving him a jump. It's here the film gives itself time to construct a sensitive and methodical portrait of Dunbar, a man that writes a journal in a warm and reassuring manner getting across a sense of caring to go with prior positive traits. The film goes on to use the inclusion of an animal, in this case a wolf whom Dunbar names Two Socks, to reaffirm positive; uplifting and caring traits so as to assure us our siding with him. To enhance positive characteristics, the film has Dunbar refrain from deeming the wolf a pest and therefore killing him, instead opting to write about him, in a glorious tactic designed to evoke a sense of creation in reaction to the wolf rather than destruction.But in doing so is not enough to criticise the film, rather acts as a necessary place so as to point out the time the film takes to establish character prior to the meat of the piece, that being the coming together of Dunbar with some local Native Americans; the kind that are far peaceful than certain other tribes in the area. Dunbar is bathing when the Natives first arrive, a moment in which he is at his most vulnerable and in the rawest of forms; an event that sees him cleansed of his uniform and all things that I.D. him as what he is just as those he'll come to bond with arrive for the first time. When time comes to interact with the clan on a greater scale, it'll be by way of Stands With A Fist (McDonnell), a young Native girl who's attempted suicide but is found by Dunbar, and then we remember well into his bond with them that mostly all of the people of his own kind he's interacted with so far have been anything but relatable: eccentric higher-ups and grotty waggon drivers, the latter of whom Dubar describes as \"probably one of the foulest men I've met in my life\". Dunbar connects with her because of a shared sense of alienation to the group, Stands With A Fist initially being an outsider adopted in much to the relevance of Dunbar's eventual arc towards these people.The film runs on the idea of finding solace and peace in times of war with those that you ought to be fighting, its foot entrenched in documenting the ordeals of a more classical western lead in Dunbar is deliberately clashed only with the idea to come to terms with the Native Americans, or Apaches, and come to understand them rather than utilise them as some persistently ominous, deadly off screen threat. Rather, Dances With Wolves reserves this role for that of the Ameircan soldiers as the film progresses; completing Dunbar's realisation of both the beauty of the locale and the people that inhabit it. The film is an affecting effort, broad in a sense of scope and style.",

However, it is okay because there is room for a little romance in the movies.

The film paints a fairly realistic picture and plants many nuggets of foreseeable emotional sadness, as one would envision the story arc to play out, yet few that I anticipated actually occurred. The three hours gives ample time for thorough character development as it should with its sprawling and calm pacing. The portrayal of the American soldiers felt a bit stereotypically heavy-handed.

Of course no one complains because it's an adventure fantasy epic containing lots of action (CGI) and pretentious drama. It's easy to hate a film like this one. What's not to hate for today's audience in a film that takes place in the old West with \"indians\" and a Union captain becoming friends with them. Westerns are not as popular as fantasy epics or even epics at all. By epics I don't mean grandeur quality films like Russian Ark, The Thin Red Line, Andrei Rublev, or The Seven Samurai, but mediocre ones such as Troy.

I treasure the sensitivity and spirituality in those who created this masterpiece and find it hard to understand how anyone could seriously fault this brilliant movie. Dunbar's/Costner's  transformation into the Sioux way is compelling, stirring, agonizing, funny, beautiful. Thank you, Kevin Costner, if you ever read this, for letting those of us who have these feelings know that we are not alone and that we will never forget. For me, this is more than a film; it's a spiritual journey to the homeland of my soul, perhaps to all human souls, who lived in this way for far longer than we have lived in this modern, built world.

This first Kevin Costner directorial effort is a mostly well done chronicle with a few very strange characters near the beginning of the movie but once Costner's character is by himself and encounters the tribe the movie gets much better. This is one of the first movies that depicts things from the Indian's perspective when it comes to the whiteman's discovery of the West. The whitemen are portrayed as mostly selfish buffoons while the Indians are portrayed as thoughtful and wise. This one-sided vision is a little overdone, but I guess we need to makeup for all the times when the clich\u00e9 Indian-whiteman portrayal was done in so many other movies. Costner's character befriends the tribe, falls in love with a white woman adopted by the tribe at an early age, and fights with the tribe defending their colony and then eventually has to decide which life he should hold onto. The love story is well done and Mary McDonnell as the love interest as well as the other Indian portrayals are done very well. This is overall a good movie that was possibly a little over-heralded when it first came out, but it is definitely well worth the viewing despite it's 3 hour length.",

Not only does it provide a full-absorption perspective of a culture that is virtually non-existent, it also depicts a sadly accurate portrayal of life in the Midwest plains. Kevin Costner did an exquisite job of playing a disenchanted soldier looking for fulfillment and purpose in his life. Graham Greene, Rodney A. Grant, and Mary McDonnell all played their parts of Sioux Indians magnificently, stirring the needed amounts empathy and hope for an epic movie such as this. Despite some very minor historical inaccuracies, I believe this movie delivers a message about American History better than any book can, and one that we should not be so quick to forget. There is majesty in freedom, and that was taken away from many Indians, not just the Sioux. They are the true American natives, and watching this movie with an open mind and heart is the least tribute we can pay to them.",

In his own words, \"I've always wanted to see the frontier, before it's gone.\"Upon arriving at the outpost Dunbar\nfinds it completely abandoned. He secures all provisions, sets up secure outlooks, and\nwaits for reinforcements to arrive,, however long that might take. Aside from his trusted horse, Dunbar's only other company comes in the form of a solitary wolf, which John names \"Two Socks.\"Dunbar spends time everyday writing the details of his journey in his journal. Hoping the details of his day to day life will prove helpful at some point in the future.One day, while Dunbar is at the creek doing laundry, a Sioux Indian arrives at the outpost. John scares the Sioux off quickly,, but not\nlong after the Indian returns with a small group, and Dunbar begins to open up communcations with the tribe. Upon visiting their village, Dunbar finds that the Sioux have a white woman in their tribe, which helps their communication move along much quicker (seeing as how the woman can understand both English and Sioux languages). Over the course of the next year or so, Dunbar spends more time with the tribe than he does at the outpost, and eventually becomes a part of the tribe when he marries the white woman (Stands with a Fist).As the harsh winter begins to set in, the Sioux look to move to their winter camp, and John realizes that his journal is still at the outpost. Knowing that his detailed journey is too important to leave behind, John sets out to retrieve the book as the tribe begins their journey.Upon arriving to the outpost, John is shocked to find that his reinforcements had finally arrived, and in great number. The soldiers capture John and interrogate him. He tells them to look at the journal, that it explains everything that has occured since he arrived. When asked whether they found anything, the soldiers who arrived first both lie and say they found no journal. John is then escorted away from the outpost by a group of soldiers, to be tried for desertion and hanged. Thankfully, his Sioux brethren have been following the soldiers, and ambush them to free John, killing every soldier in the process.After John and his Sioux brethren arrive at the winter camp, John informs the Sioux counsel that he will now be seen as a traitor, and will be a wanted man. That while killing the soldiers that captured him was a good thing, people will come looking for him and will\nkill the entire tribe in the process of apprehending a traitor like him. After much discussion, John tells the counsel that he and his wife must leave and go to speak to those who would listen.After John and his wife leave, a military unit led by a Pawnee tracker find the winter camp, but the Sioux have disappeared almost without a trace of ever being there.Wow,, it's really hard to believe this movie came out 32 yrs ago!! It was such a big movie during my childhood (like Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc). It still stands up as one of the all time greats of my lifetime. All of the Oscar wins were very well deserved! 8.5 rating!!(I saw in another review something about this movie depicting the noble savage and white savior, or something. It sounded like woke nonsense imo. I didn't, and still don't see any of that. Imo, the character of John J. Dunbar/Dances with Wolves was that of a good, very decent man/soldier who while trying to fulfill his role of a soldier happened upon a group of people whom he befriended, a woman he fell in love with, and found a home, family, and purpose that he never imagined before. That's what I saw in this movie.As far as towards the end of the movie when the soldiers have Dunbar, and the Sioux kill the soldiers to save John. I saw that as a terrible \"it's either them or us\" scenario. The soldiers weren't evil. Some were scoundrels and needed a lot of whoopins,, but not evil. If the Sioux hadn't taken them down, then John was gonna die. Sad, that it came to that,, but it's nothing new in the world.)",

Despite certain elaborated idealisation of Sioux life, this is a far cry from your mystical tree-hugging pacifists (aptly portrayed as being ruthless in warfare).However pointless this may be given the far-reaching recognisability of the movie, a short recap of the: Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) is sent out to the west to guard the frontier, while the rest of the country is in civil turmoil. The post is completely deserted apart from a stray wolf, who slowly grows an affinity to the kind-hearted man. Waiting for reinforcements to arrive, the first to contact him are his neighbours, the Sioux, with whom he soon forms a close familial relation, slowly immersing into their culture and way of life. Meanwhile chance encounters with bison hunters, cavalry troopers and loggers, have Dunbar grow increasingly disillusioned with his own kind...Rewatching the movie over twenty years after it received a multitude of Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), the widespread appeal of the movie has not faltered, still a touching, awe-inducing epic of stark significance to mainstream perceptions of American history. Certain aspects of the story-telling are simplistic and unrefined, often supplanting more cognitive portrayal of Sioux society with opportunities to bring in a hearty laugh. This doesn't however take away the charm of Costner's legendary feature, as comedy basically offers light-hearted respite from the inevitable downfall of the American Indians and the natural habitat in which they resided.The extended four hour cut undoubtedly has its coherence issues, as some scenes are visibly less well-rounded, often superfluous or just jarring. Nonetheless they do add to the overall scope and emotional pull of the story, hence all in all they largely feel best kept untouched.",

            "content": "**May Contain Spoilers** I like Westerns, and Kevin Costner doesn't really bother me; but this movie just wasn't as good as I had heard/hoped.The things I dislike most? (1) The simplistic approach to good guys/bad guys: Lakota=good; white people (except John and Stands With Fist)=bad. Give me a break! (2) Kevin as John Dunbar wasn't a horrible casting decision, but his narration was terribly wooden and sleep-inducing. (3) Mary McDonnell's portrayal of Stands With Fist. Okay, first of all, her whole existence in the movie just screams, \"Contrivence!\" Second, MM's performance was awful. Her attempts to remember English were bizarre and not believable. It was the reverse awfulness of someone doing a bad foreign accent. Third, the hair, OMG, the hair! Why was Stands With Fist wearing bad Eighties hair with highlights? I would think that after spending most of her life with the Lakota and adopting everything else of their lifestyle (dress, work around the village, marriage into the tribe, language), someone would plait that woman's hair. The hair just completely took me out of the movie every time MM showed up on screen. Kevin's was pretty bad, too; but it was not nearly as 80s as MMs. (4) Kevin's complete \"grasp\" of the Lakota's language. Was he a savant? I could see if he were still kinda stumbling and fumbling with the language, as many adult learners of other languages do; but Kevin was having long, meaningful discussion with tribe elders in a language he couldn't have begun learning more than a few weeks before. I know I'm supposed to suspend my belief here, but some things are just too incredible to believe.I wouldn't call this a turkey, but it was about two hours too long and full of enough faults to make me believe that it only garnered the Oscar because of the preachy, PC message, not because of any real substance.",

            "review_title": "How Is This Kevin Costner's Directorial Debut!?!",
            "content": "1990 was a year that produced many top-tier films. Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies and in any other year, I would have been angry about it not winning the top prize. In 1990, it had to contend with the behemoth known as Dance with Wolves, a film that is also one of my favorite films of all time. Kevin Costner's epic was released at a time where westerns were presumed dead. Costner had plenty of trouble trying to secure financing for his project. Yet he worked his magic and made a film that is reminiscent of a John Ford western. What really stands out is how respectful Costner is to the Sioux tribe and Native Americans in general. We need to face the facts that Americans has seen the Indians as savages and predators and were not worthy of their lands which is why they kept being pushed west for the plight of the white man. As evidenced from the westerns of the 40's, racism was always a factor when it came to Native Americans. Costner treated these tribes like people and even incorporated the native language, despite less than 100% accuracy, into the film. There is romance here, but any romantic cliches were avoided in order to create a more accurate depiction. Politics aside, Dean Semler shot the film with such stunning cinematography work. The Dakotas really do have magnificent scenery and Semler took advantage of that. John Barry created one of the best scores in modern film history. John Dunbar's theme is remarkable in how easy it was to invoke emotion from me while holding true to the story.There is no doubt Costner was at the top of his game in the late 80's, early 90's era. In addition to his memorable performances in films like Field of Dreams, he made his directorial debut here which ended up with a whopping total of 12 Academy Award nominations. For a first-timer that directed a three-hour long Western, there should have been no way the film got the recognition it did. Costner directed the film as if he was Steven Spielberg. He showed such poise behind the camera working with Semler and the rest of the crew. Semler's shots were confident and steady. As mentioned, it took some time to fly off the ground. In the mid-80's, screenwriter Michael Blake wrote his movie as a speculative script that went unsold. Costner convinced him to turn the script into a novel so it would be easier to sell. Costner purchased the rights. With the Western genre being a near extinct genre and Blake's script being massive as it was, studios turned their nose at the script. Costner and his producing partner Jim Wilson were finally able to strike a deal with Orion. I can describe Blake's screenplay and Costner's directing style as patient. As a member of the audience, patience is required to feel the full effect that Costner and Blake were aiming for. After the Academy Awards were over, there was another cut of the film made. One that added an hour to the film...and it received rave reviews. It must have been nearly impossible to edit the movie!The story itself is very simple, but it is told with clarity and precision. The film is narrated and told from the view of John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a lieutenant in the Union Army. He runs away from a field hospital where his foot was going to be amputated and instead leads a suicidal charge against the Confederates. He survives and is given any post he wanted. He chooses an isolated post in the frontier, the only white man around for miles. He makes first contact with the Sioux and begins to study and learn from them. The tribe wants to learn from Dunbar because they are keenly aware that the white man is pushing them away. Over time, Dunbar learns who these people are and is welcomed as a member of the tribe. His given name is \"Dance with Wolves.\" He falls in love with Stand with a Fist (Mary McDonnell). She is a white woman who was adopted by the tribe after her parents were killed...something that screenwriter Blake based off in real life. Dunbar was able to look past any prejudices to learn about and become a member of the Sioux. He understands why they fight and live they way they do. Ultimately, that will most likely put him at odds with the Americans moving west along the frontier.Costner delivers an incredible performance. He uses comedy to counterbalance the drama at times. For example, take how he and the Sioux first try to communicate with each other. He is prancing around like a buffalo trying to get them to understand the word \"buffalo.\" Of course, the Sioux thought he lost his marbles until they understood what he was trying to say. I laughed during the scene, but it was an important scene that set the stage for what's next. I liked that Costner tried to be authentic when casting the Native Americans. We got to know key member of the tribes, especially Kicking Bird (played by Graham Greene) and Wind in His Hair (played by Rodney A. Grant). It didn't feel like they were acting. I felt like I was there as a member of the tribe.I loved Dance with Wolves. It is my favorite film of 1990...and it seems like many people agree. It can be excessive in its length...but every scene matters in the entire context of the story. Costner was very respectful telling the story the way it needed to be told. Native Americans were not the bad guys. They were just people trying to live and eat and protecting their way of life. Costner took that main point and then followed the John Ford format with a beautiful score and sweeping cinematography to create something special...something that revitalized the near-dead genre.My Grade: A+",

The cinematography highlights the above aspects quite wellThere are several shortcomings:\n1. The background score is not only monotonous and an overkill but almost no attempt is made to include any 'Indian/Native' flavour!\n2.

            "content": "Continuing my viewing of the AFI's 100 best, I recently rented the four hour version of Dances With Wolves. I had never watched such a lengthy film before and after I had been told by a few friends that this movie was at times tedious and slow, I feared the worst. However, this film is a work of greatness and kept my attention so well, I didn't notice the time at all.This movie is an eye opener to the struggles that the Sioux natives and I'm sure many other factions of natives had to go through during the second half of the 19th century. With the huge migration of people heading west it was only a matter of time until they were wiped out by the white man and his machines of war.This is a special movie for many reasons in my mind. First, it does a splendid job in describing the relationship between the Sioux and Lt. Dunbar from the beginning to the end. It is this relationship that the movie is based upon, and what makes the movie work so well. While watching the movie, I felt that I was Lt. Dunbar, not a third party watching the happenings. Secondly, the cast of Costner, Greene and McDonnell plays well together and perhaps should have been recognized by the academy. I can't really understand all that I've heard about how Costner's performance was lacking, because after all it is the center of the movie. Thirdly, the direction and cinematography of this film rank up there with such epics as Schindler's List and Lawrence of Arabia. It is basically flawless and plays the second most important role in the film.The story is told to every last detail and blended together perfectly. The ending also fits well and doesn't disappoint. I find it amazing that this great film was also Costner's directoral debut. This adds even more to the total greatness of the film which in my opinion is the best that has come out of the 90's.9/10 stars.",

It is a lyrical, savage, and profound work of love and every frame shows it. This film also changed a lot of perceptions about Native Americans at the time. Not many films make it that far into the culture. A look a time when the European culture was beginning to supplant the civilization that preceded it, it has echoes of John Ford in its portrayal of the expansiveness and impermanence of the west, but it has a generosity of spirit toward its protagonists that Ford did not share. It is unfortunate that the film paints such an unqualified picture of the white man as Satan, but in the end, that is how he was perceived by the races he wiped out. It is a moving film set against a huge panorama. It's hard not to say that it is even \"important\" because that term is usually the kiss of death.

This one is top-notch, with a a great surprise plot-twist that lifts this movie above and beyond.And of course, a superbly filmed, acted and directed movie about the clash between Native Americans and Europeans, between thier cultures and religions, is 'The Mission', which takes place in South America, with Robert De Niro, a young Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson.",

I've long been aware of the shameful history of the raping of the indigenous peoples. Read many books on the subject. So, this movie touched me where I lived, and it was easy for me to relate to the Costner character and the sentiment expressed. I thought it was an excellent movie.Problem is, I tried to watch it again a few years back and I couldn't. Had to turn it off. When Costner spreads his arms out wide and prances back and forth, eyes closed, before an array of rifles firing at him and not able to hit him the thought came to me that 'this is bullshit'. Why didn't I notice how bogus this was the first time I saw it? (Actually, I did but kept watching as I'd paid good money). I guess it's supposed to signal to the viewer that this is a very special man - protected by some mystical force.Then, a while later in the film, Costner is living alone on the frontier and along comes a wild wolf that, again I guess drawn by some mysticism inherent in Costner's character, doesn't remain true to its wildness but becomes a playmate (pet) to Costner. And again came the thought 'bullshit'.Now, I know that the movie is gonna get better (I have seen it before and there's 'indians' coming) but I'm out of the film now because, apart from these incongruous scenes, Costner is boring me to tears. The fact is, he always bores me to tears. He's a very boring actor. A boring personality with a bland look. Why isn't this movie in the top 250? I think I know why.No point in going on about it. After reading four solid pages of 'greatest movie of all time' comments this one's bound to go to the back with lots of 'no' votes and I'm sorry to offend, but: good movie once - stupid movie twice. Kevin Costner is an overblown bore of an actor and his continually declining popularity is due to people realizing it as they revisit his filmography.",

            "content": "I hated this movie! This is the first movie that I have given an F because nothing in this movie is good. \n Dances with Wolves is a super depressing movie about a suicidal civil war hero. The movie is way to long and half of it is just scenery when if you live anywhere in the west, you can look outside your window! Also, another part that screws with me, is that the credits are 10 minutes long! The movie is Best Picture Winner, and it does not help the fact that it was nominated for 12 Oscars! \n Now the movie is made for people who like watching animals get killed. You get emotionally attached to the wolf, horse, a dog, and half of the buffalo that get slaughtered. Screw you, Kevin. The first animal that you see dead is a dog you see arrows in it, the second animal you see get killed is all the buffalo. Then you see Robin Hood's horse get shot and burned. Finally, you see the wolf he dances with getting shot. But the part that really screws with me is the fact that the wolf does not die, and you just watch it squeal in pain.\n Kevin Costner does such a bad job playing this character, I would rather watch him try to do an accent in Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves. Most of the acting in Dances with Wolves is so bad, everyone is a cardboard character, but I will say Graham Greene did do a good job acting, and that is the main reason I did not give this movie an F-. Mary McDonnell is a terrible character acting wise, she is a cardboard character like everyone else. Also, she goes to her wedding with the worst hair humanly possible, she looks like she was trying to be Mel Gibson in Braveheart.\n To recap, I hated Dances with Wolves because how bad the acting was, how super depressing it was, and how dumb of story it is. F is my final grade for Dances with Wolves.",

            "content": "This film solidifies its place in history with its accurate portrayal of the Lakota.To begin with, their reaction to Lieutenant Dunbar shows how the Lakota originally reacted to the presence of white men. White men spent many years passing through Lakota lands before white people began settling there, and relations were relatively peaceful up until that point.As another example, in one scene where Kicking Bird appears shirtless, one can see the scars on his chest from the Sundance Ceremony.The visuals of the film are simply stunning, particularly the way that the majesty of the buffalo is captured.However, what makes this film truly incredible is it's use of the Lakota language, as well as the story of that use. Doris Leader Charge (Pretty Shield in the film), a Lakota language teacher at Sinte Gleska College, transformed the film with her presence and contribution. Thanks to her, this is likely the most accurate and extensive collection of a nation's language in any film. Just over a decade later, Lakota Language Consortium began a revitalization of the language.Finally, a favorite quote from the movie, and in many ways a perfect one for it:\n\"Nothing I have been told about these people is correct.\"",

            "content": "I have only seen this film once before, it was on a commercial station and (with commercials) it was so long they had to split it over two nights. The BBC finally got the rights and we get it over one afternoon (thank you BBC!). The trouble is, because it's shown in the afternoon, we get a slightly tamed down version, not that I'm complaining. But more of my nonsense later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please wait back at fort Hays while I write the next paragraph).Having fought and been decorated in the American Civil War, Lt. John Dunbar is offered any posting he would like. He decides to go and see the frontier, in his words, \"Before it's gone.\" He gets a posting to Fort Hays where the commander, clearly insane, posts him on to a far-flung outpost, which he finds deserted. Finding himself alone, he is befriended by a lone wolf he calls \"Two-Socks\". Eventually he attracts the attention of a tribe of Sioux Indians. After a rather faltering start the two sides slowly learn to trust one another. Dunbar makes friends, including, Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair who show him the ways of the Plains people. There is also a white woman among the tribe, Stands With a Fist; she was taken in when she lost her family at a very young age. She acts as interpreter and, eventually, she becomes very close to the young Lieutenant. There is a cloud on the horizon, however, Dunbar knows that the white men are coming and this cannot be good for the tribe.This is an epic film with some tremendous vistas; I would love to have seen it on the big screen. I love the way that Costner made all of the white people in the picture particularly loathsome (with two notable exceptions). Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Kevin Costner as Lieutenant Dunbar, Mary McDonnell as Stands With A Fist, Graham Greene as Kicking Bird, Rodney A. Grant as Wind In His Hair and Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman as Ten Bears.I think you have to be prepared beforehand to watch this film\u0085 Three hours is a long time so plenty of refreshments and control of the remote is always good (for bathroom breaks). There is a pretty slow pace to the way the story unveils, but it's worth sticking with. The final chapter does go on a little and I feel could have been cut slightly. Apart from that, it's an epic film that is well worth a viewing\u0085 Recommended.My score: 8.3/10",

It's stunning visuals by Cinematographer Dean Semler, and stirring music by John Barry capture each mood of the film as we follow John  Dunbar's ( Kevin Costner ) travels from an Army Field Hospital in the Civil War, to his friendship with the Sioux Indians on the plains. Kevin Costner's direction of the Movie is superb too, with his obvious feel for not only the characters and story-line but for the landscape also. Costner shows great imagination, particularly when the story leaves the horrors of the War in the East and moves onto the endless sea of waving grassland in the West, catching the loneliness of the windswept frontier and the sadness also of the Plains Indian, ever hoping the White Man would not come their way. The film spends much of it's time exploring the Indian perspective, in particular their language, as Dunbar slowly learns their ways and culture while falling in love with Stands With A Fist, played by Mary   McDonnell. There are some sad scenes in the Movie, Dunbar losing Cisco his horse after being fired on by his own Calvary and seeing also his friend the lone wolf get shot by the same Calvarymen, but the most poignant part of the film came, ( as expected ) in the end when the Indians were fleeing the Soldiers and Dunbar, with Stands With A Fist now his bride, left to go their own way. Dances With Wolves is an outstanding Western, beautifully photographed and along with many other accolades the film has attracted, supports a balanced view of the struggle for culture and civilization.",

(heh)so im able to watch this movie without being distracted by costner.  in fact, nothing about the production distracts me, and i can really get into the feel of mid-1800's american frontier.  that feeling is truly well concieved throughout this movie.  the visuals are beautiful.  the sound is, well, undistracting.  and i dig the music.  everyone elses acting is great too.  graham greene really stands out as the sioux holy man kicking bird. he's the mvp of this movie i think.  its mainly his character that makes you love this native american tribe.  and its this love of the tribe that makes you loath the inevitable army of *#@%# white men that barges in and ruins everything.  the story is indeed uplifting and touching, and finally saddening.if you havent seen it lately, you should pick it up on widescreen and watch it on a weeknight.  if youve never seen it..

The actors are all pretty good in their roles. Kevin Costner does really well, although for the first 10 or so minutes he just wanders around with his mouth open as if confused. He sort of portrayed my feelings for the first bit. I had no idea what was going on until a little ways into the movie. Graham Greene and Rodney A. Grant were both quite good in their roles as well, as as much as Costner but pretty close. Mary McDonnell was kind of over-the-top in this role, and while her performance wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. She seemed to be trying to pull off some kind of overdone insanity performance, but it didn't work in the context of the movie or just as a performance overall. The characters are pretty interesting, and it's really cool to see their relationships develop over a long period of time. By the last 1/3 of the movie the audience feels really attached to the characters, and it becomes just that much more investing. And considering the last hour is the best, it gives it a much more effective ending. The movie is, however, 3 hours long, the first 2 of which are the development stages. While it isn't necessarily boring, it's very long and definitely on the slow side. It was needed for the last hour to have the effect that it did, but it probably could have been just a little more engaging, or shorter even. The romantic aspect wasn't something I was very fond of. It came off as very rushed and a little forced, like it was happening simply because that was the expectation for movies. It seems that filmmakers sometimes think that if it's worth seeing, it has a love interest. That seems to be the case a lot of the time, but that doesn't mean that it always works. And in this case it doesn't really. Overall Dances with Wolves is an engaging character study that suffers from being on the slow side for the majority of it's runtime and a forced romance. In the end I'd still recommend this movie.",

            "content": "Have you ever read an article written by a movie star where he or she talks about another movie star and you can vividly hear both their voices just as you would hear them in their movies? That happened to me while I was reading an account about the life of Clark Gable as written by his good friend David Niven. That is when you know an actor or actress has made an impression upon you. You read about them giving an account of their life involved with the lives of others and you can hear their voice as though they were having a conversation with you. Somehow their activity as a performer has become hard-wired into your memory.Thus it is with this groundbreaking film. The inspiring and uplifting themes of John Barry's musical score easily registers in my mind with pleasure. The unusually literate performances of the cast give you insights into the Lakota and Sioux cultures that create a whole new dimension of humanization for this genre of Cowboys and Indians. While Kevin Costner as Lt. John Dunbar/Dances With Wolves and Mary McDonnell as Stands With A Fist/Christine Gunther stand out in Oscar nominated roles, there are Native American actors who also represent multi-dimensional characters of beauty, wisdom, dignity, intelligence and strength. Particularly memorable are Graham Greene as Kicking Bird, Rodney A. Grant as Wind In His Hair and Floyd Red Crow Westerman as Chief Ten Bears, along with Doris Leader Charge as Pretty Shield, Chief Ten Bears wife, and Otakuye Conroy as Kicking Bird's daughter. Wes Studi, who will later be seen playing with distinction as Magua in Michael Mann's LAST OF THE MOHICANS (1992), is also memorably on board here as the Toughest Pawnee.This Western epic is definitely a drama that could never be presented on the stage. Few films have ever reveled in The Great Outdoors as this one does. The clash between cultures is thoughtfully and probingly evoked, and to see subtitles as Graham Greene and the other leading Indian principals help Costner's John Dunbar assimilate Native American culture gives this presentation of the Western Plains an air of authenticity. The liberal use of indigenous language in this film speaks well of the story to see things from the so-called 'victim's' point of view. Here and there between thrilling Buffalo Hunts we indeed learn a few things in an expansive sweep about the manners and mores of The Plains Indian.Make no mistake, however, about who is telling this story. It is not Graham Greene as Kicking Bird or Floyd Red Crow Westerman as Chief Ten Bears. This is the story of Lt. John Dunbar lately become Dances With Wolves. So we still have a ways to go before a Native American narrates an epic tale about the waning days of The Old West. But you have to give Kevin Costner credit for his empathetic retelling of bygone days when men and women and whole tribes of people made at least some attempt to harmonize their ways with the ways of Nature.This film was nominated for 12 Academy awards and won in seven categories, including Best Director for Costner. While it flirts with images of 'The Noble Savage', and definitely posits Dunbar's Dances With Wolves as a White Savior helping the Lakota win an important battle if not the war, in the end it is more about peoples seeing past competing cultural aspirations to find the good in each other. This does not diminish the fact that the Lakota, like many other tribes throughout the 48 contiguous states, will have to confront the threat of genocide as they struggle to keep their way of Life from dying out in many respects. But where this film innovates is in presenting Native Americans in a more fully human light, capable of strategizing and seizing triumph and not just bearing defeat with honor. For what it is, this is a more hopeful and faintly optimistic and, dare I say, more family friendly version of The Old West, than is to be found in Clint Eastwood's more gritty and relentlessly realistic demythologizing UNFORGIVEN (1992). While both are Best Picture winners, I'll have to tip my hat to this one for shedding its cloak of romance in a kinder and gentler way. That's why it strikes me as the CITIZEN KANE (1941) of the West.",

Kevin Costner is brilliant as not only an actor, but in his directorial debut. The film shines with a high layer of artistic polish. I particularly liked the narrative voice-over monologues that he gives reading his journal as he learns more about the Sioux people that he has encountered. Graham Greene as Kicking Bird also gives a performance that I believe deserves to be mentioned.I really enjoyed the way that the movie turns western tropes completely around. It asserts the fact that while white people claimed to have been bringing civilization to the natives, they also brought a lot of savagery and bigotry against a culture that they knew little about. Which is ironic considering their own stereotypes of the \"savage Indian.\"If nothing more, \"Dances with Wolves\" is a terrific film that still holds up and will prove invaluable in the continuing conversations concerning people of other races and cultures interacting and maintaining healthy and positive relationships that can even blossom into friendship and familial bonds; not just in an historical sense like the one provided in this film, but also in today's world.",

            "review_title": "A harmony with the land, interspersed with savage tribal warfare",
            "content": "Dunbar speaks of the \"harmony\" with nature the Sioux have with the land, which he came to experience himself, sharing their lives. But how many viewers get this from watching the movie? I suspect it worked better on the big screen, feeling the vast expanse of earth and sky and silence. But unless you have ever been out in the empty prairie or a vast silent wilderness (something that simply does not exist in Europe) you may not understand the peace and silence of mind it produces. To attempt to recreate this is why the movie must be slow and long. This vastness and isolation is key to any good Western. In a classic Western the lone individual (or family or group, such as a wagon train) is on his own, isolated from the social norms and rule of law of civilization. He is typically pitted against raw nature and the brute force of lawless individuals, and must rely on his strength of character and wits to survive. It is a form of anomie, spiritual and social. This is what Dunbar encounters, in its purest form, in his posting to an empty frontier fort.In Westerns it is good guys vs. bad guys, which, in the old days, was cowboys vs. Injuns. Hollywood went beyond that stereotype long ago, at least since the 1960s, if not 1950s. But it is still interesting to see, through Dunbar's eyes, the transition from prejudice to understanding of Indians as human beings with families and personalities, to acknowledge the stereotypes were lies, up to a point. Those \"stereotypes\" would have killed him with an arrow in the back, as they did his muleteer guide and Standing with a Fist's family, had circumstances not intervened. We see the macho young Indians urging that he be killed and we see the motions of war with another Indian tribe. Though living in peace and harmony with the land, showing their bravery through killing, and risking being killed, is a fundamental part of their culture. The Whites are no different. We see White men at war, first in a clutzy Civil War battle, which is probably more typical than the dramatic scenes more often portrayed; in the early stages, the leadership was often not the boldest. Later we see the frontier soldiers, who seem to be the bottom of the barrel rejects. But they all feel they must demonstrate their warlike spirit, much like the Indians, though sometimes foolishly. People are people, regardless of their skin color or country. Have not soldiers elsewhere been equally vicious, and have not other countries, including Europe, committed genocidal murders? Does anyone remember the Belgian Congo?The viewer's first impulse is to view the Indians as the good guys, but they were not saints. But it was their land, and the Whites had no right to take it from them -- that is the bottom line. They know, thanks to Dunbar, that there will be so many White men coming that they will inevitably be overwhelmed, yet they cannot find the wisdom to know how to respond, aside from futile battle. We can see in hindsight that killing and more killing is not the answer, but that is the only way the humans on both sides know how to respond. The viewer feels sadness knowing this, and knowing that the Sioux's harmonious lifestyle will be lost.Some viewers, especially foreigners, will also feel anger and contempt for the White man, and for Americans. But what are you watching? A film made by Americans, primarily for an American audience, missing the caveats a foreigner should keep in mind. Should Americans feel ashamed? Of course, and we do, for the injustices committed against Indians in the past. One of the strengths of America is its willingness to engage in honest self-criticism and to strive for historical objectivity. America changes with time, over and over again. American movies can be a force for change, and a collective acknowledgment of that change. That is what you see in Dancing with Wolves, made two decades ago. You see a similar pro- Indian statement in A Man Called Horse, made two decades earlier, so this is not a radical new attitude, as much as a beautiful restatement. How many nations engage in such brutally honest self-criticism through their cinema? We find this in Europe and the West, and I have seen some from Japan - though not nearly enough, but such a movie of self- criticism that also glorifies individualism and repudiating the values of your society and government is unthinkable (and probably illegal) in China, and much of Asia. And so I do not consider this as an anti- American film, but very much a pro-American one, one I am proud of. A side note: I mostly agree with nebukanezer from Norway's comparison of Dances with Avatar. It does seem that James Cameron used Dances as a draft outline for his screenplay. Cameron should get over his ego and hire a real scriptwriter.Also, as to the Indians living in harmony with nature, anthropologists now know that the Plains Indians would periodically set fire to the prairie to prevent trees and bushes from growing, and to promote vegetation favorable to the buffalo. These fires, of course, killed many other animals and did significant ecological damage.Still, the White man could have learned a lot from the Indians, spiritually. The history of man's inhumanity to man is filled with sadness and regret.",

The last samurai in 2007 has a similar theme and both the films are epic for me in their terms. The story is very interesting and has been dealt with full justice to the characters. It also shows how people who have a great language barrier communicate effectively. The pace of the film is slow and some of the times you would feel drifted but when the lead character starts his narrative voice at specified intervals, you will find it interesting again. The acting by all was good. Without including too many characters, the film is worth sitting for 3 hours.MESSAGE: \"Kindness in heart can win many situations.\"VERDICT: \"A recommended onetime watch.\"",

            "content": "A number of scenes in the first half of this film left me wondering, \"What the hell did I just watch?\" I was wondering whether I was supposed to laugh or not. If a scene ended violently I guess it was meant as serious\u0085*shoulder shrug*.In fact, there was something odd about the entire tone of the film and it dawned on me after a while: Dances with Wolves feels like a kids movie. Whether that feel was intended or not is unclear, especially considering all the blood and violence, but the movie definitely has the feel of an adventure for kids. There is a subplot with befriending a wolf and another one about a loyal horse. This movie features farts, some slapstick and I swear at one point I heard a bouncing noise like in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon\u0085but then someone had their scalp removed.Throughout the film, the main character is narrating his experiences on the frontier and his style of narration as well as the wording sounds like that of a curious child discovering the world.While there are a few scenes that drag on for too long or seem unnecessary all-together, overall this movie is interesting and well-paced. At almost 4 hours long, it does not feel too long because the story works. Intelligently, bits of story are introduced that do not resolve right away thereby making you want to keep watching to see how those seeds will grow. The movie gets better as it goes on and as you get more attached to its characters.There is another minor complaint: the film attempts to be respectful to Native Americans, but a number of elements in the story damages the integrity of that respect. The natives who are friendly to the immigrants are portrayed as good. The natives who attack the whites are bad savages. The main character tries to train a wolf to eat from his hand and I cannot tell if this is intended or unintended symbolism but it sure is not a pleasant one. There is a white woman living amongst the natives (Mary McDonnell) because she was supposedly adopted, but was this character written into the movie to act as the English translator for the main hero or was this just another way of ensuring that the main hero's romantic interest is a relatable white actress. As always, the two main heroes are a white western couple. This is still a Hollywood movie.Kevin Kostner's main character is perhaps least interesting as he is the most wooden. His face is frozen in the expression of confusion for much of the movie. This performance fits the story as the character is mostly alone and remains cautious and unsure as he is pushing social boundaries on the frontier, but it does not make for interesting acting. The rest of the participants are more emotional and interesting, especially Graham Greene at the top of his game as the holy man.The music in this film is a soundtrack for epic exploration, some of it sounding like a tune that would accompany a scene of a kid discovering some magical house, and again contributing to the children's adventure movie feel described earlier.In short, what an odd film\u0085I like it. It is not a great movie. Some of the acting is stiff and some scenes are questionable but the off-beat mood is curious enough and the story starts to really grow on you, so that it feels like a complete and rewarding experience after the movie is over.",

Then it was the Spanish who obliterated the South and Central American tribes. Then the English and French took the example of the Spanish and at first and used the tribes against each other to get what they wanted. After a couple of generations and Manifest Destiny, it was westward for the whites and lot's more Indians. Yes, some white people treated the Indians horribly, as did some of the Indians to the whites. But, someone had to prevail. Since the beginning of time people have been migrating. The Indians of the Americas came from somewhere else too. And, unfortunately, most migration by humans results in bloodshed.

            "content": "Not too long before Dances with Wolves, Hollywood in the 1960's was littered with western movies with stars such as John Wayne, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood. These tough, big gun actors helped create some of the greatest cowboy flicks we have come to know, the western firmly stamping itself in film history, leaving a legacy far beyond the decade it shot holes in. Kevin Costner has given himself the responsibilities of film making's trifecta with Dances with Wolves, he has directed, produced and starred in one of the most ambitious and impressive debuts since Orson Wells created Citizen Kane.\nDances with Wolves opens with Union Army Lieutenant John Dunbar(Costner)miraculously surviving a suicidal charge at Confederate lines, a doomed act he had bravely opted for in favour of the amputation of his wounded leg. As a reward for his heroics, he is given apropriate medical treatment and offered a station of his choosing. He requests an abondoned fort on the Frontier, his only campanions are his loyal mount Cisco, a diary in which he pens his daily duties and a friendly wolf that he names Two Socks. As Dumbar repairs the run down fort, he attracts the curious attention of a local indian tribe, their leader Kicking Bird, played by Graham Green, is caught snooping around the Lieutenant's prized reinforcement. The two continue to meet, firstly out of curiosity and then through a female member of the tribe, Stands with a Fist who Dunbar has become affectionate toward. These encounters are the heart and soul of Dances with Wolves. Many westerns have explored relationships between American Frontiermen and the Native Indians, but none as inquisitively as this one as Costner gives the audience a rare glimpse at the trying fundamentals of human behaviour that is communication. Kicking Bird and the other members of the tribe embrace Dunbar into the camp, the leaders desire to learn about the white man, a perspective far from what we have come to witness in the American western. At this point in the film, Dunbar is completely apart of his new found tribe, his is now known as Dances with Wolves, and his love for Stands with a Fist has now become a celebrated bond under observation and respect from the group. Dances with Wolves is a film about bonds, weather its with another person, a tribe, an army or the land, Kevin Costner explores the frailties between the bonds that through effort and understanding can endure lifes toughest hardships, but are easily broken through ignorance and hate.\nDances with Wolves isnt just a magnificent western, but one of the greatest films ever made.",

A truly great film and the time passed just as quickly this time as it did back in 1990. Dances with Wolves is a treat no matter which version you choose.

The journey that the main character faces is at first a relieve for him but as he gets further down the road in this journey he realizes that it is going to a pain to survive in this environment and its not going to be much fun but you gotta do what you got to do to get through life and this man does just that.",

I know Native Americans are a much maligned group, particularly in film, but surely they should demand better than this piece of drivel. This film's story defines contrived. Isn't it convenient that Costner, the only decent white man on the prairie, just happens to find the only white woman (decent or otherwise) on the prairie? What? Couldn't he fall in love with an Indian woman? That did happen back in the Old West on a regular basis. But I guess that was too much for Mr. Costner's sensibilities. It also smacks of racism. Costner is exploiting Indians, not illuminating them. Back in the 70s, Tom Laughlin made a series of Billy Jack films in which Laughlin played the white knight, schooled in the martial arts, taking up the defense of downtrodden Indians. This movie is just Billy Jack without the karate. What really gets me is the critical response to this worthless film. Have critics lost their minds when they fall for this? I've never trusted them since this movie came out. The critics' reaction to this film so soured me against them that I now go to movies that are panned by critics. There is nothing redeemable about this movie.",

In the past many movies did not handle well the indigenous issues. Often they are abused for pure entertaining reasons rather then being historical factual. It isn't easy to reflect the past in a reasonable way but dances with wolves is very close to it even if the characters are fictional (as far as I know). This movie is a top favorite. Kevin Costner shines in this movie as I never saw him acting before and he's not the only one performing brilliantly.. It is my wish the movie is used in many educative projects. The Pawnee \u0096 Sioux conflict scenes might not represent the Pawnee correctly. One more love story would have been adding more suspense (egg Pawnee \u0096Sioux) but one has to make choices not to overload the movie. The indigenous tribes had their conflicts but rarely they ended in violent conflicts before colonisation although life was difficult and far from an idyllic paradise but their philosophies, views on the world were and are more advanced and profound then often mentioned.",

What else do you want to see from a movie??Anyway this movie left me with a sense of multiple different great feelings throughout it as it was developing and of course in the end. Sorrow and grief for sure, admiration for some things, forbidden hope and definitely made me re-evaluate some things even changing me as a person a bit. And that is because of showing with such a great way about how we, \"modern\" humans are changing/destroying the natural world, the earth, our home. Without caring at all for anything but ourselves. This is depressing to realize it. But i guess only for a small portion of people since others just want to see things to explode to understand a movie. :-(",

I also just wasn't really into the movie, like it felt like I was just watching the picture but not really in depth with what it was talking about. I did indeed like how the Indians were portrayed. I feel like AMericans need to see that most Indians were not hostile. Though they kind of had a right to be since we were coming on to their land. Maybe I just need to watch the movie again to better my understanding of it or atleast try to watch it for the enjoyment of it.

            "content": "Dances with Wolves (B+): An excellent revisionist Western that works so well for most of its running time. After becoming an accidental hero in the Civil War (beginning the revisionist theme of the film), John Dunbar is able to choose his future posting. After a memorable stopoff with his insane superior officer, another hint that this film is set to demystify the era, Dunbar heads across the American West with his provisions to his post in South Dakota. The following sequences of an isolated Dunbar embracing his new solitary life at the outpost are the best sequences of the entire film to me. I loved watching him repair Fort Sedgewick, making friends with local wildlife (where the name Dances with Wolves comes from), and starting relationships with the territory Indians. The highlight of his relationship with the Sioux Indians is the incredible buffalo hunt sequence. As the relationship grows with the Indians, the biggest revisionist aspirations take shape - the Indians were primarily peaceful and friendly. There is some complexity given to them, but it's clear they are the good guys. This is done fairly well, but by the time the end of the film comes into view it becomes too heavy handed. For instance, the Pawnee Indians and US Cavalry are painted as unthinking villains (with practically zero shades) while the Sioux and Dunbar are the only enlightened ones to see the peace. For a movie that gets so many details right, this oversimplification is really jarring and tough to take. This film works so well for about two thirds of its runtime, gets so much of the details correct (a sweeping romantic score, beautiful real life locations, taking seriously the Indian roles, etc), that the comically villainous US Cavalry in the final act of the film and the revisionist axe begin to overshadow it.",

            "content": "Without doubt, one of the finest moments ever to be found when true art emerges in the form of cinema is the epic \"Dances With Wolves\". The Oscar winning cinematography is sublime and breathtaking, the acting superb and genuine in a way that seems to only come about when performers truly believe in the project at hand as perhaps having meaning beyond commerce and thus being worthy of more than mere acting perchance even allowing actual expressions of soul. But here there is yet another great force at work, and that is surely the beauty and majesty that is the North American landscape in its unbridled glory. Having first seen the movie in it's original three hour cinematic release, I was moved in a unique and profound way that has remained with me for almost two decades now. Furthermore, I was priviliged enough to see the four hour \"Director's Cut\" some years later again in a full cinema setting. Here I felt the story was given even more depth and indeed some of the meaning conveyed originally to important aspects of the storyline turned out to make a very different point altogether. There is, therefore, no doubt in my mind that (far from always being the case) in this instance the longer cut is the one into which to immerse oneself into if given the opportunity.Naturally I have since procured a DVD version and was fortunate enough to find a release that provided both 'cuts' of the film in full wide screen format. This brings me to what I regard as a very interesting point. Over the years I have met a surprising number of people who have conveyed to me that they do not particularly care for this film. This deeply puzzled me for some years. Dare I say, and to my delight, thankfully none had ever declared anything even remotely resembling loathing. Naturally being curious as to how someone could feel unmoved by what I regard as one of the most moving of moving pictures, it emerged that every single one of these poor souls had had their first and any subsequent encounter with this masterpiece on a television. With the screen chopped off at the sides and all the other shortcomings of the now technologically quaint Cathode Ray Tube this outcome was surely inevitable for a film that realises so much of it's magic through the amazing cinematography of what can truly be described as sheer aesthetic majesty. Thankfully, large wide-screen high definition home cinema has arrived with excellent sound so as to allow the superb score some justice as well. In closing, might I strongly suggest should the opportunity to see this masterpiece in a cinema setting once again present itself, especially if you have as yet not had the opportunity, do yourself your loved ones and anyone you care about even remotely the immeasurable favour to experience this epic in the environment it was created for. Moreover, should the unexpigated version ever appear in a cinema near you... run don't walk, buy plenty of popcorn, and let yourself be mesmerised for the full four hours of cinematic heaven that is \"Dances With Wolves\"!",

You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.",

            "content": "I only took one star away from this film ... primarily because Kostner (or perhaps Blake) used the standard villain in such films ... the Pawnee. Long before the white man appeared in the Plains, various tribes were fighting one another over territory. No one single tribe was less brutal than any other in such disputes. A plus for the extended version of the film was the mention of another adversary, the Utes, and that it was clear (or apparently clear) that the Souix initiated the battle. Certainly, the Pawnee people were no better or worse than any other native group.Other than that, no flaw in the film was so terrible that it detracts from the film's purpose ... to show the Plains native (primarily the Souix) as a relatively cultured and sophisticated group that bore no \"specific\" ill will toward anyone unless it was perceived that they were infringing on their territorial rights. And, it showed them as people who were good stewards of the land ... unlike white settlers (and for that matter, white people even now).However (evil grin), as much as I liked the film, I felt that the theatrical version had a lot of unnecessary footage in it. And when I saw the extended version, I felt that if some of the scenes were added to the theatrical version, it would have made more sense to the film-goer. To test this theory (grin), I used my video capture device to capture the extended version from Comcast \"on-demand\" and edited the video based on my own parameters. I ended up with a video that's only 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version ... yet covers all the \"making sense\" bases and guts out the \"fluff\" scenes. The theatrical version DVD I got as a gift from my son is now retired (grin) since I like my edit job better.Example of cuts - On the wacky Major at Fort Hayes, I cut out the eccentric salute, the \"Sir Knight\" comment about soiling his pants, and his suicide. I left plenty of that scene in so that people would know he was a nut case. One controversial edit (grin). I cut out the scene where Spivey and a fellow soldier were taking dumps out in the high grass. True, this scene shows Spivey with Dunbar's journal. But later, when the Sergeant is the last person killed at the river, the next scene shown is the journal floating down the river ... leading people to believe that the Sergeant had it on him all the time ... that he purposefully withheld it from the officers because he was a bigot who wanted Dunbar to be hanged (ie., \"Ya turned Injun, didn't ya ... didn't ya!\").Example of scenes retained from the extended version - The scene showing Captain Cargill giving his speech to the assembled men ... and telling them to gather their things to abandon Fort Sedgewick. The scene showing the aftermath of the raid on the Utes, showing what Stands With A Fist had to mourn about ... before she was found by Dunbar. The brief conversation between Stone Calf and Kicking Bird after seeing Dunbar \"dancing\" with the wolf ... where Kicking Bird first suggests they give Dunbar a \"real name.\"Therefore, my 9 of 10 rating is for the extended version since the theatrical version left me puzzled on a few points. I'd give MY version a 10 out of 10 (grin). Of course, I'm biased, hehe.",

            "content": "Predictably \"Hollywood-esque\", but sometimes surprising (no doubt stemming from its literary origins), this Costner-directed story is certainly well made. Strangely, I've never been able to determine the depth of the star's acting talent in any film in which he's appeared. In DW, his oral narration is weak but his passive presence throughout the rest of the film is adequate for the role. Regrettable is the movie's attempt to be both (historically) realistic and morally abstract. The ethical simplicity of the plot and its characters does not lend itself to a stern history lesson, in which we are taught that the White man is (almost inherently) corrupt, the Sioux is a noble savage and environmental guardian, and the Pawnee, a bloodthirsty barbarian. What I mean is that these characterizations are fine outside of the pretension that they are the truth; the stock nature of the story is suitable only for drama (as opposed to realism). I would not be too concerned if it were made in an age where the audience was more sophisticated, because it is clear to me that one should not be deceived by the film's historic appearance into thinking literally about the nature of the plot. Rather, Dunbar (Costner) is a man who confronts the frontier within himself after a flirtation with suicide. The western limits of America in 1863 happen to form the concrete setting--the dramatic effect of pathetic fallacy--for his internal struggle. We must also remember the extraordinary influence on the American character that was the frontier--Indians or no Indians. While watching Dunbar's notebook being borne away by the river after a brutal--and decisive--struggle with Union troops, I found myself admiring the metaphor, but was also a little disappointed by its naivet\u00e9; but later, when he again comes into possession of it, the implications are problematic, more serious.Other comments: I found the narration confusing, in that it wasn't clear what chronological perspective was being adopted. What is the deal with the officer with whom Dunbar speaks before departing into the hinterland (\"I p***ed my pants, and there's nothing anyone can do about it\", etc.)",

It made a bucket-load of money and got a whole bunch of undeserved Oscars -- including Best Director and Best Picture.While this movie really wants to be a sprawling epic, its nothing of the sort.  The film's only message seems to be that Native Americans are not the stereotypical \"How, white man\" caricatures they are often portrayed as, and that they have suffered injustice after injustice at the hands of American expansionism.  While this is certainly true, it is a point repeated often both before and after Dances With Wolves.  It is also a point that has been made a lot better.  One should also note that Kevin Costner is being horribly self-righteous in telling everybody else how horrible they've been to Native Americans as if he (the millionaire celebrity) has suffered alongside them.The insufferable preachiness of the film is compounded by bad storytelling. The movie bludgeons its simplistic point home with clunky voice-over narration from Costner's character's diary.  There's plenty of films that have expressed subtler themes than this one's without saying a word.Subtlety is one big thing lacking in this movie, in all respects.  rather than letting scenery speak for itself, Costner simply has to tell  us how beautiful the frontier is.  His performance is, as usual, bland and boring.Don't waste your time on this Hollywood trash.  Go see an indie movie.",

Director Kevin Costner audaciously choose this genre which is recognized unpopular themes at that time. And he successfully revive this almost dying genre. Secondly , and most important point is that it changed the central values of traditional Westerns, from old- fashioned in white as the lead out of personal heroism , to the continent of North America between whites and Aboriginal cultural conflict and explore mutually and understand the thinking, so that the \" Dances with Wolves \" has become the most anthropological spirit of Westerns.This movie begin with Lieutenant Dunbar's unsuccessful suicide action in the Civil War. After that he choose go to the frontier as a hero, because he want the peaceful life. Unfortunately, Major Bulu suicided and the transport team is killed, so Lieutenant Dunbar lost the connect with the white world. Then he become the friend of the Sioux tribe which is the native American. After Dunbar lives in the pueblo, he find there is a team of whites soldiers come to his camp. Because Dunbar totally becomes a native people, the whites soldiers treat Dunbar traitor, and they want to kill both Lieutenant Dunbar and Sioux. At last, Dunbar leaves Sioux with his wife, and the Sioux is survived.The first half of the film is based on the perspective of U.S. Lieutenant Dunbar into the strange world . The second half , the director show the white world and the Sioux world as the same plane to the audience. It is no longer the identity of the white explorers into Sioux life , because it is not object that observed with the core of Western values. As a very long time, the roles speak the Sioux language , playing \"alternative\" masterpieces with English subtitles. Kevin Costner wanna bring the audience to such a viewing angle, which out of the standard value of Sioux and whites. Let the viewer to evaluate the main contradiction of their way of their thinking and the conflict between them, and to the maximum extent advocated by the audience-selves.To connect with the America frontier culture, I think that Dunbar is totally a typical American hero, especially with the braveness and the can-do spirit. He come to the desolate strange place without any complain, even negative mood. He is not afraid of the terrible environment. He adjusts to the tough environment very well and open his mind to accept the totally different culture and value standard. Of course, Dunbar is a tough guy. Anyway, he is the hero of the Civil War, because he is so strong at both physical and spirit. So he survives from the culture conflict and the different life. \" Dances with Wolves \" is the excellent movie not only because its anthropological angle, but also because the art aspects. Only the Academy Awards, \" Dances with Wolves \" got 10 Oscar prizes, include the best picture, the best director, the best cinematography, the best film editing, the best sound, etc. There are enough evidences to proof my opinion that \" Dances with Wolves \" is one of the most excellent movie",

The Union Army rewarded him when it assigned him to an empty Fort Sedwick on the frontier.  Gradually, John and the Sioux overcame their fear of one another and learned each other's way of life and language, with the help of Stands With A Fist(Mary McDonnell), a white woman raised by the tribe, whom Dunbar marries. Dunbar befriends a wolf he named Two Socks. Dunbar receives the name Dances with Wolves, because the Sioux witnessed him playing with the wolf in the field.  Dances with Wolves' conscious catches up with him, and he tells the tribe that the white men will be looking for him.  The best thing for the tribe is for him and his wife to leave.The intention for this movie was not just to entertain, but to teach a lesson about American History.  `Dances with Wolves' demonstrates how much love the Sioux Indians had for their land.  The purity of the land tended by the Indians compared to the land taken over by white people shows that the Indians' respect for nature ran more deeply.     Kevin Costner(director) cared deeply about the making of this movie, because he wanted to show every minor detail possible, particularly from the way the horses ran freely along the land to the way the tribe congregated around a fire at night to celebrate their victorious hunt of buffalo.The length of `Dances with Wolves' is 180 minutes long.  I did not think that was too bad, compared to the four hour editor's edition.  South Dakota is marvelous for the setting.  `Dances with Wolves' is packed with drama, romance, action, and comedy.  Even though this film is twelve years old, it is still a must see.",

The director Kevin Costner choose an unpopular theme, and revive an almost dying kind of film. Secondly, the most important point in this movie that it is changed value of traditional western movie. It is not just a film just talk about white personal heroism, it is jump out of the personal heroism. But talk about the culture conflict and understand between the North America and original people. I think \"Dance with Wolves\" has become the most anthropological spirit of the western movie.The first half of the film is based on the perspective of U.S. Lieutenant Dunbar went into a strange world. The film was showed the white people and original people in the same place to the audience, is not just the white people as an explorers to identify the Sioux life, actually it is an observation based on western value. There is a very long time they spoked Sioux language. The purpose of this I think the director is going to create a view, which Sioux and white people stood outside the value and let the audience to evaluate and think the main conflict between them. And the make audience stand on the value neutral attitude towards the history between the whites and the Sioux.I think from this movie it has related to the class I am taking now, American Ways. The contradiction in the film is the core value. The white people is intruder and they from Europe it has so many different with original people. So the movie showed a culture conflict between them, and through the story let audience understand the difference between them . At the beginning Sioux and Dunbar have been tested of each other. To Dunbar he faced is the \"barbarians\"\uff0cwhen he found Sioux were not as he heard to burning and looting, he tried to get close to them. Among the many Sioux elder, there are some people want to learn the strange thing, but even both of them are willing to lay down their own subjective value judgment, try to understand each other, it still has a lot conflict, culture conflict. There was a plot impressed me is when Dunbar achieved tribal trust and help them hunting and lost his hat. In the evening banquet, Dunbar see his hat is on other people's head and he proposed him to return his hat but they were rejected, and it almost lead to conflict. Because Dunbar think hat is his, after he lost ,pick up the man should return it to him. This is a typical Western-style thinking, obligation. But Sioux think as a trophy should not only belong to him nut also for all people who has question of ownership, are considered to be his challenge. Because in Sioux society, brave and skilled warriors have very high social status, and the warrior is also the best hunter. From this we can see different types of people have different cultures, different experience in their life and lead to a huge difference in the values.From this movie I have a deep recognize in American history and their value and culture. The different of national value and the self-centered civilization are all come from their own life experience. Because of way of production and the objective environment, so that all knowledge of the entire world, philosophy are derived from the experience of their lives. So I think it is really difficult to accept strange culture and value because of our own life experience so we could go to understand each other's lifestyle and habits, and think about their own civilized society works.",

Dances with Wolves takes more emphasis on \"fusion\", which means human beings, animals and nature can be in empathy even though their languages are not commonly used among them.It seems to me that it is the desire from humans breaks the harmony. In the end of the movie, it said that \"Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo's gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska.

The old wolf which is the only company of dances with wolves left me a deep impression. There was a particular emotion between dances with wolves and the wolf. When dance with wolves set a fire near his camp and danced round the fire, the wolf was the only audience. The wolf was following dances with wolves when he was riding a horse. Many scenes could tell the harmony between dances with wolves and the wolf. Nevertheless, what a shame that people could get along with wild environment and cruel animals but could not get along with other people who have different background.

It just so happens to be that the Sioux occupy the two poorest reservations in the U.S. Suicide rates are amongst the highest in the U.S. as well, how does this tell us that they got a \"good deal\". Every weekend you hear the ambulances taking off to try to save drunk Sioux. With populations so small the death rate is abnormally high. The U.S. allowed over zealous companies hunt the buffalo to near extinction and then gave the Sioux plows and seed to plant fields, who in their right mind tells a hunting society to plant for a living and expect them to accept it automatically. If at most they should have asked them to become cattle ranchers. In Sioux culture you did not toil day after day just to make a lowly income, nature had all you could want and if you needed something you went and got it, of course you had to hunt and make the things you wanted, but generally these were saw as activities rather than work. There was no plowing the earth, they had deer, buffalo, and other game. There was no standing in a factory for 10 hours a day making one thing, you learned how to make almost everything and you could make it the way you wanted. They still had struggles but other than that why would they want to change? They in their mind, had achieved a state of life that was comfortable and prosperous. That is why it has been hard for the Native American to find their place in white society. There is nothing glorious about our society today other than our traditions and family. My father born in 1950 grew up in a three room log cabin with 11 brothers and sisters and so far has been the only one to leave the reservation to make a life, which he has been successful in the natural gas industry(ask anyone in the area and they will know his name),a decorated Veitnam War veteran(he volunteered rather than be shamefully drafted). He left behind tradition and family which makes him sad and that's his sacrifice to give me a decent life that he didn't have as a child. That is the problem that most Native Americans face today, do I stay at home in poverty but keeping my tradition, family, sacred land, and friends. Or, do I go into the world and leave that behind. The two cannot or very rarely co-exist, if you have money or objects of value you are the main person to ask for handouts which in Sioux tradition you are supposed to help friends and family, but when the amount borrowed grows and grows and no change happens what are you supposed to do then? Rarely do you ever hear of anything good happening on the reservation, government officials using funds for their own personal uses, deaths, alcoholism, and etc. Before you make any statements about the lively hood of the Sioux let alone any Native American population you should live amongst them on reservation, then tell me they got a good deal.",

It wasn't as great or memorable as I hoped it would be, but it's pretty good nonetheless.As the story starts off, we are introduced to Lieutenant John Dunbar, who does something stupid during a Civil War battle and inadvertently leads the Union troops to a victory. As a reward, he is given a post at the western frontier. Upon arriving, he finds the post deserted. Soon however, he starts to befriend a curious local Indian tribe. Gradually, over time earns the trust and respect of these people, and eventually becomes one of them. Along the way, he also falls in love with Stands With A Fist, a white girl raised by the tribe. Also, along the way, he even receives a tribal name, \"Dances With Wolves.\" It's a simple story. It's that old man-befriends-natives-and-turns-against-his-own-people type of story. There's no originality in it whatsoever, and it's almost completely predictable. However, it is very well-told, with soul and emotion. The movie follows Dunbar and allows the viewer to feel his emotions and experiences as he gradually falls in love with the tribe and the land. In terms of the script, and other aspects, the movie is pretty good. The dialogue is pretty good, and the story is well-paced. Performances by Costner and everyone else are good as well, and the actors really bring out their characters. John Barry also composed a great score for the film, which also helped bring out the emotion, mood, and tone of the film.I do have a few criticisms of the film. My first criticism concerns Mary McDonnel. She was effective as Stands With A Fist, and her performance was good, but there's something about her that took away slightly from my liking for her character. I didn't think she was quite right for her role. Also, I should have had more emotional attachment to her (not that I didn't, but I did feel that it lacked a bit). My second criticism concerns the length of the film. I can see what Costner was trying to do in terms of storytelling, emotion, length of scenes, and all that, but, in my opinion, the film was too long. I have to admit, I liked the film, but I did get bored in some areas. Also, while the character development is solid, I think the story should have gone more into character complexity. The story itself had more potential too. There's hardly any plot at all, but it's enjoyable, but nonetheless, if the movie did have more of a real plot it could have been a lot better. Next, I didn't really feel much tension/worry for the inevitable fight with the American military coming up at the end. I really did need to feel much more of that. Also, while the movie is pretty good, it only has a few memorable aspects about it. It needed more.Overall, I feel that Dances With Wolves is more of a moral message experience than entertainment. It's not something I'd want to watch more than once, but it's a good movie all the same, definitely worth watching. But it did have a lot more potential.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",

I've seen the Dances With Wolves more than a hundred times...and look forward to seeing it again. It shows that a man can be tough, have dedication, love, and find his true self. If you've never seen it, sit down on a long winters night and watch it, you'll laugh, cry, get angry, and finish with a new feeling of hope...for yourself. That last thing may sound strange, but watch Dances With Wolves, and you'll see what I mean.I can't believe that it didn't rank on the Best 250 movies, and Pulp Fiction did. Honestly, when I read that fact, it made me angry! Pulp Fiction seemed to me as a \"blood & guts\" film with no real meaning. Dances With Wolves was more than just a movie... It's a description of real life in a real setting. Honestly, Dances With Wolves describes the life I wish I'd lived!",

On the other hand, I am quite sure what I do remember: the impression from Dunbar (the main hero) meeting Kicking Bird remains strong even after years. How two enemies, both being very proud fighters, but also tired by live, become friends - these scenes of \"Dances with wolves\" have something archetypal about them. Their first \"discussions\" about bulls (how was the word for bull? Takanka?) etc. belong to my favourite moments in cinema at all. Beautifully done, it inspires to thinking about many aspects of their stories: is not the intelligent Kicking Bird also alone among his people as Dunbar among his? Isn't it the ridiculous shyness and helplessness of the Kicking Bird that make the viewer understand his real authority? Conclusion: very sentimental, but I cannot remember anything disturbing in this movie.",

            "content": "For it's time a really beautiful film in many ways, note that I watched the 4 hour long D. Cut which I highly recommend if you think this film is for you.DWW tells the story of a somewhat despondent Officer who ends up finding himself out in the great Frontier. This largely happens through his deep friendships made with the Lakota Indians and then him finally fully integrating himself in their tribe and their ways including marriage to one of their own.Its a magnificent tale told beautifully overall and many have gushed over all those details. I will focus a little more on the flaws which in the end (including the end...) still nagged at me and kept it from my personal top tier favs. Some of these are more Nit Picks for sure, and none of these really take too much away from the entire film in the big picture, which I do highly recommend.First Act - His Journey to the Frontier and his first month at his new post so about 40 mins of the film is just very slow. There is at least some intrigue present so I would not label it boring but others might.Emotional lost opportunities - This is one of the biggest ones for me if not the biggest, and its not a huge flaw by any means there are still some heart-string tugs but it bugged me none the less while watching. Several times in the film we see a very moving part take place, but very little emotion shown. One example is when several in the tribe risk their lives to rescue him and once successful, not even a thank you escapes his lips, at least 3 or 4 others like this.Wolf - I imagine there is a bit less of him in the 3 hour version. Here anyway, it kind of goes back to emotional lost opportunities again, I really wanted to see him take the wolf fully by his side, instead they just tease each other with friendship. This is a very minor point but the Wolf was important to him.The Ending - This was another big one for me. Again its part of emotional lost opportunity flaw, but moreover it left me unsettled. So we see him departing with his wife, and then right after, we see the Army arrive. They show the Army is \"working with\" the enemy of his tribe, this is already weird, as they don't show the Indians being prisoners but maybe we can assume it I guess. We see the enemy lead them to the tribes camp, but it is abandoned now, but freshly abandoned as they find smoldering fire. Then we see Dunbar and Wife riding off in final shot, and the Epilogue role, which makes no mention of Dunbar. I didn't like that loose end, we find out what happens to the Tribe down the road but not him, and the it was shown I felt like maybe the Army caught up to him (but apparently they didn't).More on the Nit pick side of things:Relationship - This might be personal preference but I would have rather of seen him fall in love with a Sioux Woman to really complete his full integration into the tribe, even though his choice was fully part of the tribe she was white like him.His promotion - After a display of sheer despondency a promotion just due to an unplanned distraction giving their side an edge seems off.Stands with Fists - Her family murdered by Indians when she is a Child, she flees into the Wilderness only to go and live and grow up amongst Indians? Yeah, not something most would have done....",

            "content": "What to say about this film in particular? I first saw this movie as a class project in grade 7 (1991). I enjoyed it then and I must say that I enjoy it 26 years later even more than ever. The depth and sensitivity with detail was beyond my juvenile understanding. While I recommend the uncut version, the theater version is more than an ample story of love, friendship, hate, and change in a strange time. Kevin Costner may have had career missteps, but this is his Magnum Opus. Graham Greene, Floyd \"Red Crow\" Westerman, and Mary McDonnell with a swell and superb supporting cast tells the story of change in North America. The maturity and sensitivity of indigenous folk is top notch. As a pre-pubescent 12 year old, I did not quite understand the entire story, but I did see this as a very important milestone in film making. Years of marinating and quite a large amount of thought has confirmed this as my favorite film of all time (Shawshank Redemption, a close number 2). The music, the scenery, the culture clash and ultimate mixing was superb. The white man's self appointed superiority without communication with the native Sioux (and Pawnee with many other tribes assuredly represented) here is the stuff of legends. I did not know this won awards as a kid. I only thought this was the coolest 3+ hour class I'd ever had. I passed the test from viewing this film. In Canada, relations still seem restrained between the First Nations people and the 'newcomers'. Truth be told, without plot details, this is a very good movie. I am reluctant to critique the age from which this film is depicting. Nothing can change what happened. I hope, as I think Mr. Kevin Costner does, that this is a very sensitive movie with action, some cultural difference, humour (who can deny the humour in the 'Good Trade' argument after the buffalo hunt?), and a great plot. If I had a picture or film to take with me to a desert island, or an abandoned camp on the frontier as described, this is the film. Although I am sentimental at heart, nothing has shaken my view of this film in 26 years. This hasn't aged and is timeless. Understandably, there are people who will disagree on varying levels. It made me appreciate the wars of the past and how ignorant previous societies were. It also showed me how far we still have to go in the way of understanding people who come from a different place or culture than what we grew up with. An eye-opening film and, in my opinion, the best film I have seen to date. The uncut version shows more detail and is recommended highly. In short, this is a lesson in how people are all fundamentally the same. We are conditioned within our own culture, more-so back in those 'Cowboy & Indian' ways/days. This film is an education piece. It also is the most entertaining education I have received (by film) to this date. 10/10",

This movie shows that there was much more to the Sioux people than most thought. It also shows that the white man was even more savage and cruel then the supposed 'savage'. If you watch old movies with natives and the white man you see that all the natives were the enemy and uncivilized. THis movie breaks the genre stereotypes and shows intelligent caring people, now true its more or less just switched the traditional roles around, but I think that is the more historically accurate version of history All in all an excellent movie deserves to be on the top if not the top of the list of 250 much better than the Godfather",

            "content": "This is a tale of exploration and adventure of the most unusual kind \u2013 almost a fantasy. It is a fictional story about a soldier who 'turns Injun' in crude terms. It is not as if no one had ever lived with and become like the Indians. J.W. Schultz who wrote 'My Life As An Indian' is a classic example, well known because of the book, but there have been several, mostly unknown, because at that time no one was really interested to know about the life style and social, cultural values of the Indians. Some fictional tales can become more powerful by the excellence of their presentation, and Costner has been able to achieve this in Dances With Wolves. Lt. Dunbar is a desperate hero, who is given the choice of any station that he desires. He wants to go towards the frontier. Some mysterious force is pulling Lt. Dunbar towards the frontier (compare Schultz's account). The only reason he can give is that he wants to see the frontier before it is gone. The mood of the story builds up slowly and gracefully. Dunbar will gradually and surely discover why he wanted to come here, leaving behind the comfort and security of cities and forts...he will find who he really is inside. And to find all that he loves...the open, beautiful, unspoilt land, the wild but friendly wolf Two Socks, the tribe of Indians with whom he develops a social bond, and finally - Stands With A Fist. The good days can't last long....more troops have come to the frontier, and the frontier is shrinking. Dunbar sees that the tribe of which he is now a member is going to be decimated. He decides that he must go back to civilization to talk to those who would listen....that the existence of the frontier is actually the last chance for civilization to learn from. The frontier here is not just a physical boundary, but also a metaphysical one - a metaphor for the unknown, and if the frontier dies, so does the chance for civilization to learn from what lies beyond the frontier. He sets on his journey back....will anyone listen?",

            "content": "Dances with Wolves. Hate to oversell things but forget it! It's an expertly directed movie with some truly beautiful shots, lots of gorgeous wides, the best shot of the movie IMO is at 1:34:46 of the directors cut. Kevin Costner gives his best performance of his career as do all the other actors, Graham Greene and Mary McDonnell give the best of the entire movie. It's also a movie with really good intentions portraying the Sioux with a great amount of respect. John Barry delivers his best soundtrack, Two Socks, Journey to Fort Sedgewick and the Love Theme are the best of the OST. It's also a movie that takes its time with nearly every aspect. All the characters, locations, themes (as in the emotional aspects) and scenes are all very well written, realised and developed perfectly, I guess since the movie is 4 hours long that was inevitable.I think what sets it apart from most other films is how peaceful and welcoming it is, it's a really optimistic and positive movie, a tone that is similar to the Shire scenes in the Middle Earth franchise. Also normally movies that deal with animals tend to end up feeling unconvincing. But this movie does a great job with the Wolves, the wolf trainer they got and the Costners directing merge really well to create some very believable scenes with the animals.The character of John Dunbar has an extremely optimistic view on the world he lives in. Dunbar is an every man, Costner usually portrays characters like that, a person who the audience can easily connect with and one that the audience feels comfortable going on an adventure with.The only real problem is that some people won't like hearing Kevin Costners voice for 4 hours straight and I guess it could be a bit longer.",

We take and take and take and only think about the next thing we're gonna get and about how much money we have and we're in a constant race that will never end, a chase to be better than our neighbors. We destroyed almost every part of this earth. Murdered each other, murdered animals and deforested almost every ancient tree that ever existed. When I look at you I feel sick. I have very few connection with people because of it. You all make me sick. Thinking about you and what you've done, and keep on doing, makes me want to throw up. Wake up. Wake. Up.

And, I could not believe how terribly outdated and self-serving it seemed now that time has gone by and it is not as current.  The indians and their customs and way of life were not what was outdated.  Both the indian characters and the actors portraying them stay true to life and timeless.  But Costner seems like a fish out of water. He makes the fatal flaw of being overly sentimental, both for himself in front of the camera and behind it.  Perhaps I felt this way because since then I've had the pleasure of watching another actor step behind the camera and direct his own epic:  Mel Gibson in Braveheart.  After having seen the way he portrayed the English-Scottish conflict and the amazing cinematography and script that he incorparated, Dances With Wolves comes across as a B movie.  With Gibson, I see no sympathy for self - he seems to trust in the work and the subject matter to carry his film along vibrantly and with truth.  Costner, in turn, seems to feel the need to constantly show his empathy and courage in order to make sure that you see him in the light which suits him best.  I wish I could vote higher, especially as Graham Greene gave the film such heart and truth, but Costner just blaringly stood in my way.Still, a good film to watch.  Enlightening and a bitter reminder of what America once was and the people that were it's true inhabitants only to be treated in a despicable fashion.

Like walking all the way across the river, to take a shave.

Kevin somewhat overplay he's part a lot in a some places. But all in all I'll give it full house cause of the visual scenery",

I have also done a LOT of research and, whilst the Oglala Sioux in particular were a bloodthirsty lot, the same cannot be said for all the Sioux. Many US soldiers in those days WERE uneducated, lecherous, dishonest and plain dirty. And the way new settlers in the mid west recklessly and stupidly slaughtered thousands of buffalo is well documented. The storyline is believable, well laid out and entertaining.The cinematography, acting, directing, sound, editing and overall 'everything' of this movie in my opinion may never be equalled. It is a audio and visual masterpiece, and the haunting themes leave one with a wish that Costner would do another such film. No wonder it got seven Oscars - should have been at least two more.",

And the soundtrack - One of the best, if not the best available. At times it comes across as typical John Barry (shades of some Bond themes)  but it always remains emotionally stirring.I would advise anyone interested in this film to track down the extended (by 45mins) version.",

I also loved the growing relationship that John had with the tribe, especially with kicking bird, from the Sioux coming to Dunbar's place then later on, Dunbar living with the Sioux and eventually learning their native tongue. I enjoyed the direction that the film went in when Dunbar requested to go fight alongside the Sioux. I believe that it showed that John was a loyal person and wanted to help those that he cared for. I also liked the way that the character John would describe Standing with fist at their wedding and showing how much he loved her. I was touched by the goodbye that the Sioux gave John and Standing fist when they left the tribe because the army was going after John and how John was willing to leave to protect the tribe and keep them safe from the military. :)",

I have a special place in my heart for this movie especially since I have taken a missions trip up to Pine Ridge, SD where the Lakota reservation now exists. It is deplorable, but that's a whole other subject. Back to the movie... Despite the fact that the movie is over 3 hours long, it never really drags because the story is so good. Costner's character, John Dunbar, is determined not to lose his leg, which was badly wounded in battle. It is an excruciating scene when he has to slip his leg back into his boot! John Dunbar wishes to see the frontier before it is gone and his request is granted. The journey that begins there changes him in a positive way when he befriends the Sioux (Lakota) Indians, finds a sort of companion in a lone wolf (which he names \"Two Socks\"), and falls in love with \"Stands With A Fist\", played by the wonderful Mary McDonnell. The experiences John Dunbar has with the Indians teaches him that not all the natives are hostile and savage. That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of \"Kicking Bird\" played by Graham Greene. There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday. Truly, our country should always preserve whatever huge chunks of land can be preserved for future generations to be able to observe, walk, ride and breathe-in the wonder of God's creation. Add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.",

The symbolism with the wolf can be seen as his loneliness with it being around only when he is by himself. I find this as not a complicated example of symbolism more as something you would have to think about to find out. The language gap at first when john first met with the sioux really puts in perspective of why many of the army attacked due the language difference. The actions you take can often be seen offensive towards other people. You would have no way to defend yourself verbally if you offended them. It's like someone walking in your house and pointing at your tv and they think they can take it. Though the white woman had a troubled background that was never addressed again it was so small that it did not affect the story.",

I really liked the story and how it showed a more realistic look on the Natives and shows how they aren't really as deadly and vicious as they are made out to be, they are just trying to live free as anyone would want to. The ongoing meetings between Dunbar and the Native Americans was also something i really enjoyed, it was cool to see a white settler being nice to Natives and learning there traditions like bull hunting and even camp songs and dances. The only thing i really disliked was the Wolf, i didn't understand really why he was there and what his purpose was but it was also interesting to see the Wolf and Dunbar's relationship grow throughout the movie.

My moviegoing companions weren't into film epics, and I assumed, and I had heard that it was basically a piece of propaganda to discuss the plight of the Native American.  However, when I saw it recently, I was pleasantly surprised. There is very little overt preaching.  The movie simply portrays the Native Americans as more than cartoonish villains or \"noble savages\".  Westerns with well-developed, three-dimensional Native American characters are rare in American cinema.The only weakness in the film is that in order to make its points, Costner chooses to portray the U.S. soldiers and other Whites in the film in broad negative strokes.  Except for Costner's character, they are all bigoted, violent, and ignorant.  Costner basically reverses the stereotypes of the traditional western, and the same way it was unfair and ineffective to portray the Native Americans as one-dimensional, it is unfair and ineffective to portray the Whites of that time period in the same way.\nOverall, however, a rewarding film experience.",

In most movies they are usually seen as dumb and savages. But in this movie they are seen as people that are trying to survive and trying to protect what little they have. When the Sioux are hunting for buffalo and they see what the white settlers are skinning the buffalo and just leaving the rest to rot that makes them sad because that is what they need to live. In old western movies they picture them as people that kill at random and have a vengeance for all the settlers, but the bigger picture is that they were doing that to protect themselves and their tribes. And they didn't kill all the white settlers. The thing that I didn't like about the movie is the ending. I wish there had been a better ending.",

The main character Lt. Dunbar really did a 180 turn as he was once just a boring and obedient lieutenant to becoming more open about himself with his mentality and spiritual self while spending time with the Sioux tribe and discovering even more freedom than he thought he would have. The language that the Native Americans used in this movie made me think of how realistically it was during their era in history and how much their language has changed throughout the year. In all honesty, I don't see anything wrong with this film other than the animal killing. The ending does get me confused at times with the thought of maybe a sequence could occur.

The character development of Lieutenant Dunbar to Dances With Wolves was complex and showed how he went from serious and unsympathetic to compassionate and.softhearted. The portrayal of the cruel racist whites was nothing short of accurate. Not only did it show how bad the treatment was for the Native Americans but also the environment. The buffalo skinners were a very real example of this. Not only was it realistic it had a humor that was not really found in movies like this. This movie is like nothing like I've ever seen for historical period movies it brings a human side while also being historically accurate. It's hard not to be entertained and grow close to the characters in the movie. Dunbar, Kicking Bird, and Stand With a Fist are all interesting complex characters that have their own stories different from the plot. Overall this was a great movie.",

Thats enough of that though I'm getting to excited thinking there might be a water world 2. Dances with Wolves started out just fine and even had one of the best plots of all time. It also had superb dialog. The dialog makes star wars episode 3 look like child's play. It basically gives George Lucas a giant middle finger and up yours. The only reason I give it a 5 is because you see Kevin's nasty booty way to much. I mean you don't have to ruin possibly the best movie of all time with a little to much corn hole.

However, I didn't know what exactly to expect.First of all, the direction is great, being Costner's first attempt. The performance of Costner, Greene and Grant added a lot to the movie, while the cinematographer wasn't awarded an Academy Award for nothing. However, the most important reason why everyone should watch and remember this film is its message; white man's madness has destroyed ancient cultures and spoiled Mother Nature.McDonnels's role wasn't bad, but she seemed to try too hard. The somewhat abrupt ending is something I didn't like, too. What is more, I believe the movie could be much more powerful in some scenes.This film is an all-time classic western and one of the best costume dramas.",

It is one of those rare movies that takes a look at American Indians as human beings. Indians are also a fiercely proud and brave race. But in most of the movies they are revealed as savages and thieves. But it is different in Dances With Wolves. For his first movie, Costner impresses a lot. The camera work and direction are absolutely breathtaking. It is very difficult to understand that such an honestly and well made movie is not listed in IMDb Top 250. There are many stupid movies listed there but not this awesome and touching movie. This movie will always be among my favorites. A rare masterpiece that succeeds on more than one level.",

I think it shows a great side of how Native Americans did or could have lived, and showed that relationships can always be built, regardless of barriers. John Dunbar was all alone and by himself, and he did something that no white man had done or thought about doing, he befriended and learned the ways of local Native American. He faced his fears and pushed the limits and learned many things about them and they learned about him. He learned their native language and a lot of their customs. This movie is an all time great in my opinion, one of my favorite films.",

            "content": "My first impression of Dances with Wolves was not too extraordinary, the protagonist seemed dull, with no motivation or personality. As the film progressed, though, I see that was the intention the whole time. The movie builds Dunbar's character in such a clear, successful way, showing how his previous way of life was so wrong, so full of hate and misinformation. I also appreciate how the Native American tribe Sioux is shown to the audience. The dedication to appreciation of language and culture that is now widely looked over in our society today is inspiring and also very progressive for the 1990's. I also noted how there was never a happy ending. Even at the very end, when the Sioux evaded the white settlers for the last time, the director made is known that they would not do that forever. They would meet the same fate as thousands of other tribes in the Great Plains. I think it is best to not put a sweet ending over such a tragic time for so many cultures at the time.When I am told movies are very good, I usually don't believe them. Either it's not my taste, or it is not an interesting topic to me- but this movie I believe can touch any person's heart. I truly recommend this movie to not only understand the tension at that period in history, but to appreciate and learn more about Native American culture. I give Dances with Wolves a 10/10, please give it a watch.",

The portrayal of someone finding themselves through a different culture is very interesting and I feel like it can promote a healthy way of appreciating a culture instead of appropriating it. I love the characterization of John Dunbar. Yes, he did have the mindset that the Natives were bad but after interacting with them he learns that the stories that were spread around the states were just lies. I love the fact of John learning the language of his friends instead of him teaching them english. I feel like it was a nice change of the expectations of non white people needing to learn English in order to interact with the settlers and John himself was pretty funny although I feel like this was an unintentional move on the director's part). Dances with Wolves was a nice change in narrative with the interactions with Natives during the civil war and this is a must watch for everyone.",

John dunbar is great example of how these internalized ideas of native americans can be shattered by taking a second to try and understand and accept them and their differences. And notice how once he does this they become closer and as they became closer more of the culture could be shared. Things like the wolf to signify his fate and his relationship with his native americans are excellent choices throughout the movie that allow for a better understanding of the movies themes to be found.",

This is undeniably a film that I could watch again at home and enjoy it as if it was my first time watching it. I love that the Native Americans took John Dunbar in as one of their own.

Very distracting. Between the precision haircut and highlights it looks like a commercial for a volumizing shampoo. Native Americans lived a harsh life and did not look like they stepped out of a salon with a full mane, straight teeth and glowing skin. Don't know why this movie was so lauded, but today would probably not be even made. I guess it was a different time back then.",

There was also a bit of a problem with not being able to understand what the native Americans were saying.

The representation of the natives was different than most western's with some of the natives being a key part of the story line and had personalities. The movie showed much of their culture too such as celebrations and preparations for war. It shows how life was lived in the early beginnings of civilization of the United States and how many settlers saw the natives as savages and bad people.

The end of the movie was quite sad in the fact that the army slowly moved them away from their original site but it showed how times really were back then. The connection between the title of the movie and the story to the movie is very interesting. The audience would have never guessed that that is what John's name would be to the indians.

They are all portrayed as ignorant, aggressive, over-the-top evil characters. I am SURE some whites were like that but so could some native Americans be like that too. The movie also glosses over the real problem for plains Indians which was that even if US policy concerning them had been different, white people were going to expand westward anyhow and that the vast amounts of land that a small number of Indians \"claimed\" was going to cause a big problem anyhow. Indeed, the wars Indians had between each other were usually over tribal reach for hunting purposes to feed their particular tribe. Some of the movie was quite predictable too like Costner going to get the rifles he buried and saving the day against the Pawnee invaders. Basically, some of the movie was the Michael Moore view of the world that the Sioux were just kite flying peaceful people until the white man came which isn't accurate at all when you consider tribal warfare. That being said, having a movie from the Indian perspective is quite useful but this one wasn't it.",

The Indian actors played their parts well and portrayed them as if they were there. Dunbar was the star of the show and really shows us why with his acting. All the scenes looked real and nothing seemed to be a green screen. The graphics were super good considering how old it was, and all the scenes were crisp. The story line was well thought out and executed well. But the long nice musical parts where music would play were too long I think and if you weren't interested could put you to sleep.

The movie starts off slow but quickly picks up after Dunbar's first encounter with the Indians. Dunbar journals everything that happened in a notebook that he took everywhere. I love this movie and the way he tells the story of him growing closer with the Indians is so amazing. The wolf symbolizes his journey of growing closer to the Indians. As he grows closer to the Indians he grows closer to the wolf. How They get their names is also so cool but you will have to watch the movie to find that out. One thing I like about this movie is the humor and jokes that they tell. The indians are portrayed as mean savages to the settlers but when Dunbar starts to become friends with them they get this kind of comfortable humor that i love.

The tribe's culture is beautifully portrayed, the structures of their society are also clearly showcased as well as their humor, personalities, and sense of community. Dances with wolves help destroy these painful and destructive stereotypes of the native americans while painting them as real human beings. While also incorporating a white settler who came to the frontier, John Dunbar, and welcoming them into their culture and teaching him their ways, and vice versa. It also highlights the destructive nature of the white settlers and the problems they created for the native americans. In many cases the native americans basic survival, like hunting buffalo, was almost intangible for them because of the competition for resources with the white settlers. The script is flipped, now that the native americans are the protagonists and the white settlers are the antagonists.

I like how he saved a girl without even knowing, including that she was from a different culture and he didn't have to do the right thing but he chose to because it's in him. Dunbar made so much effort in this movie and in the end he had a great ending and found love. Something i disliked in this film was that the white men didn't believe he was a soldier and apart of him,they didn't even care to find the proof. That beat on him and treated him like he wasn't apart of them at all. Dunbar knew who his real family was and the natives became his family he knew they were gonna come for him and not give up on him. The wolf was a meaning that the natives were close by.",

The movie delivers a very American Social Studies version of the US Civil War and the Sioux tribe. This is a very well made movie with a great cast, terrific story, and high-quality production. There are some alarming scenes for animal lovers. However, the Buffalo hunting scenes are breathtaking. It's no wonder that DwW took home so many awards at the 1991 Academy Awards. I'm not going to say that this is going to be for everyone. It's kind of a commitment since the run time is up to three and a half hours depending on the version you see. At least fifteen of those minutes feature Costner's butt. A trope in Costner pictures. But if you are checking out movies from 1990 then I think you've gotta check it out at least once.",

It was also interesting how there was a girl that joined the native Americans and living with them even though they killed her parents and siblings.

This movie also portrays native Americans differently. Instead of just showing us them trying to fight the Americans, it showed their lives too. It showed their humor and how they live. That's an aspect of the movie I really liked. As John lives among them he learns how they live and adapt. Rather than any other western with fighting and blood.I also thought it was interesting how the wolf symbolizes so many things. One thing the wolf was symbolizing was how you need a pack. Its easier to function and get things done when you're with a group of people. Everyone needs help with something in their life at some point. John is an american but found his pack with the native Americans.",

It's one of my mom's favorites, and I remember hearing the music when she and my dad watched it. (I was to little at the time) An appropriate word for it would be bittersweet. Near the beginning it's kind of boring and startling; John Dunbar tried to kill himself by riding in front of the enemy. In the process, the others named him a hero and awarded him a horse and a new rank (I think) The commanding officer which send him out with Timmons is perfectly revolting, and Timmons himself is disgusting but kind of funny. I find myself laughing at his morbid humor when he points to the skeleton and mentions the folks back east must be saying 'Why don't he write?' The first encounter with Kicking Bird is so funny! Dunbar's taking a bath, and chases after Kicking Bird (who is trying to steal the horse Cisco) naked. Mom says that in the book, Kicking Bird described the naked Dunbar as 'so white it hurt his eyes'. Another funny thing about this movie is the reaction of the Soux to the coffee and the sugar. After tasting some, Wind in His Hair likes the sugar so much he begins putting some in Kicking Bird's cup. This annoys Kicking Bird and he covers his cup so Wind In His hair will stop adding sugar. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is John Dunbar doing the fire dance back at the soldier fort. It always gives me goosebumps.The bitter part of the movie is bitter indeed. It's heartbreaking when the soldiers shoot both Cisco and Two Socks and treat Lt. Dunbar like an animal. When the Pawnee attack the Soux, it makes me feel sick to watch them pull the arrows from the dogs. The saddest part is the ending. As John Dunbar (now Dances with Wolves) rides away with Stands With a Fist and Wind In His Hair hollers at him from the clifftop. \"Shumani Tutonka Obwa Chi!\" \"I am Wind in His Hair. Do you see that you are my friend?\" I always tear up when I see that.With the gorgeous scenery, the flawless acting, the moving story, and the stirring music, I'd recommend this movie to anyone old enough to understand.",

There is no excuse for the atrocities that occurred, yet it was also inevitable, given the circumstances.

Their struggle to survive, their love and compassion for each other, their joy, anger and sadness. Kevin Costner does an outstanding job here, both as a director and actor, but I would also like to mention Graham Greene, Rodney Grant, Wes Studi and Floyd Red Crow Westerman, who really gives an impressive performance in their roles.

She really hasn't spoken it since she was a child of 4 or 5, yet it all comes back to her fairly quickly, when she is asked to communicate with Dunbar. It is a major stretch to believe she could so easily begin to converse in English after all of this time. Also, her accent was very strange and very annoying.All of the other actors were top-notch, as was the cinematography and just about everything else about this movie.However, since Costner's role was the most important one and key to the whole story, his performance cast a pall on the movie for me.",

I did find the ending a little unsatisfying. It was a good, suspenseful build up followed by a text crawl saying what happens to the Natives. I'm not asking for a grand final fight scene, just something with a little more substance than words on the screen telling me what happens.Overall I thought the movie was fantastic, it has a very good subtle sense of humor, grounded action scenes, and well written characters who you root for, and a good look into the initial colonization of the western united states.

Instead I have to watch other people enjoy this movie and I am unhappy. It's been something like 21 years since this movie was made and it's still do not have anything for the deafs to read what the characters talks about. Oh sure, I read the book, but it's not the same, man. I liked watching the action happens and read at the same time any words that appears, like normal. Watching people flaps their mouths all the time and being unable to understand what they say just about riled me up a lot these days. I'm sick of it. I bought the DVD anyway, and now I'm watching it and as usual mouths flappings and no idea what they say, even though I hear their voices and that distracts me to no end. So I decided, to hell with you hearings, I'll find my subtitles somehow and burn a clean copy just so I can see if I can get the ESHIs up and running, and if so, then, finally, after 21 years I'll read what the characters say simultaneously while the action's going on. I don't give a damn if it's illegal or not. I'm just sick of cheapskates hearings who can't be bothered to includes ESHIs on ALL DVDs for all of us deafs who really loves movies. So there. Bleah! (tongue out, making raspberry noise.) And the funny thing is, the people who made this movie made billions and yet they are too cheap to make DVDs with ESHIs. How cheap can you be? I'm so disappointed with hearing people's lack of consideration, instead they all greedy and don't care about anyone who would like to enjoy a simple movie like this one that just are powerful. Thanks a lot.P.S. I loves it when the Indians were talking in their funny language, and there it is, English Subtitles showes up to show what they was saying. I wish this could be the same for the English speakers, so their words would show up for the deafs to see and read and understand. When will you hearings realised that the universe do not revolves around you hearings. So come on, pay up and get the new DVD version with ESHIs on it, OK?

He purposely rides his horse along the enemies sideline trying to get shot. He survives and is awarded for his act of \"bravery.\" With his leg fully healed, he relocates to a western fort in total solitude. Other soldiers unaware of his exact posting, he is left to fend for himself. As Dunbar rebuilds his new fort, he encounters nearby Sioux members. With no intentions of intimidation, Dunbar seeks out this indigenous tribe. He soon meets Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell), a white woman who was raised by this tribe. She mutilates herself while mourning for her lost husband. He returns her to the Sioux people and tries to communicate with them, after discovering the language barrier is too great Stands With A Fist translates between Dunbar and the Sioux. Thus beginning a relationship between white man and the Indians. Dunbar adapts to the culture and learns the language while romancing Stands With A Fist. Eventually Dunbar is given his nickname of \"Dances With Wolves.\" After he helps the tribe defend themselves from a rival Pawnee attack, he marries Stands With A Fist and is fully integrated into the Sioux. Of course the tribe must relocate due to pressure of the white men, Dunbar of course says he will accompany them. When he returns to his fort, Dunbar is confronted by U.S army men and is arrested as a traitor. While he is transported, the Sioux track them down and kill the white soldiers and free Dunbar. Dunbar then makes the decision to leave the tribe with his new wife to prevent any further danger on the Sioux. The last shot of the film tells us that 13 years later, the last of the Sioux were subjugated to the American government.This was Costner's first film as director and for a debut, it is excellent. As far as strengths, the film has a soft, leisurely pace, which combined with a gorgeous score from John Barry, create a very lush canvas. Visually, \"Dances\" is strong, with compositions that are simple yet ethereal. The tone is also quite delectable. Almost poetic, as if Costner invites us to yearn for a more simpler time in American history to enjoy his tale.As far as it's flaws, the most obvious is probably the relationship between Dunbar and his wife (who is the \"native\" girl in the film). Although Costner handles their love scene very romantically, it's almost ridiculous the transfer of bodily fluids represents bringing two cultures together and all differences are virtually erased. This symbolism is rather stupid and has been used in several other films. More recently in James Cameron's \"Avatar\".8/10. For other westerns, see \"Unforgiven\", \"Rio Bravo\", or Sergio Leone's filmography. For a more unconventional western, see \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\".",

The motion picture is told through the words and experiences of a civil war soldier, Lieutenant John Dunbar, and Costner makes it an intensely spiritual journey which challenges the individual in so many ways... After his suicidal and successful ride on the battlefield, Lt. Dunbar accidentally leads Union troops to victory against the Confederates... He is allowed to select his own reassignment... John opts to retreat into the wilderness, to the furthest frontier, where both the Sioux and Pawnee Indians still rule... The film perfectly captures the finest kind of American audacity when Costner rides out alone in the Lakota plains, wearing full dress uniform and holding the large American flag to formally introduce himself to his Sioux neighbors... and the worst of America, the cruelty exercised by the army when it's found he's a Yankee soldier turned Indian and arrested as a traitor... But it's the gentle humor and intimate moments of the movie which give Costner's ambitious epic Western its special flavor: scenes with Dunbar and his wild wolf Two Socks not daring, at first, to eat from his hand; his funny first encounter with a peaceful man Kicking Bird (Graham Greene); his love story with a stolen white woman living with the tribe called Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell); his relationship with a fierce impulsive warrior Wind in His Hair (Rodney A.

I've never seen such a musical score complement a film so well.What's special and unique about this film is that when the protagonist character John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) slowly transforms into a Native American soul, you (the viewer) feel like you are going through the transformation process along with him. That's what makes it like an experience, rather than just a film.What's more, if you are a white American guy with a deep observant genuine soul and personality, you will relate to John Dunbar's character - his alienation from his white culture, as well as his connection with the Sioux tribe. (Thus this film has a Happier Abroad theme to it as well) Dunbar is the only deep observation genuine white character in the film, along with his lover, because the rest of the white characters in this epic seem so degenerate and hollow, or robotic, in comparison.I would try to see this on a big screen though, so you can appreciate the scenery, which most of this film focuses on, even more than the characters. Set aside four hours and dim the lights to see it. Then you will understand what I mean. I think it's one of the top ten best films of all time. And it's Costner's best role as well. On IMDb, almost everyone gave it a 10 out of 10. Also, on Amazon.com nearly every reviewer gave it 5 stars out of 5 as well.You can get the DVD version on Amazon.com for 5 dollars or download it from Amazon.com for a few dollars.I think it's a Happier Abroad film (referring to the movement I started at HappierAbroad.com) too because in the story, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) experiences social connection, harmony and genuineness with the Sioux tribe, and then realizes how hollow and empty his white culture is. His soul slowly becomes Sioux, to the point where he doesn't fit in anymore with American life. The soldiers at the end who capture and persecute him look so degenerate, soulless and depraved compared to the Sioux tribe he joined. Only then do you realize the comparison.Anyway, this is a must see film. It reflects the spirit and feeling of our movement at HappierAbroad.com. Everyone should see it to understand our point of view better.",

Watching Dances with Wolves it's easy to see why Kevin Costner has been trying to make the same movie every time since (usually with awful results). It seems like the pace of the movie matches that of the people it's trying to portray, and it forces the viewer to take it all in at Costner's graceful speed. Cinematography is lush throughout the film, and it serves as a great reenactment of the time of the American plains. Mary McConnell puts in a great performance as Stands With a Fist, and Graham Green is his usual subtle self. I would highly recommend this movie as a good way to round out your viewing experience - this is Costner's masterpiece.",

With the recent death of John Barry who composed the score I am reminded to watch it again, but the extended version this time. What a pity that the longer version is not yet available on Blu-ray. Worthy of all awards it received.To say Costner could not act is nonsense, he is excellent in this role and his direction par excellence.

I don't know much about Indians, so I cant assess the truism of the story. then again, it's not a movie about Indians: it's a story about cultural differences. it's a story representing a sad reality.

Perhaps Lakota filmmakers wouldn't have gone to such great pains to represent everyone in a Lakota village as an upstanding human being, realizing there are, and have been less than sterling individuals among their people, as with all people.But the American Indian nations, and the Lakota in particular, have been very grievously wronged by this country. This, and the fact that not every film-goer is exquisitely sensitive and perceptive, may have led the filmmakers to accentuate the personal virtues of the Sioux, and to represent each white, except Dunbar and Stands with a Fist, as reprehensible. For the American public, that rarely gives a thought to Indian peoples, and even less often a kind thought, this film is a gentle introduction to an extraordinary nation and people that preceded us to, and created a thriving culture on this land many thousands of years before we came.",

            "review_title": "Epic historical western",
            "content": "The first director's work of Kevin Costner - Dances With Wolves - is an epic Western movie that tells the story of Union army Lieutenant John Dunbar (played by the very same Costner), who travels to the frontier to serve at a military post and afterward encounters Native Americans, which inhabit that area. It's one of the very few movies that condemns the actions of the US government towards Native Americans and the violent settlement of the West. It does not justify the actions of Indigenous Americans (like killing and stealing) either and aims to narrate the story objectively.Guns, horses, fight scenes, and Indians - all these are Western movie attributes inherent in Dances With Wolves. Nonetheless, it still doesn't look like a typical representative of this genre. Its essence is somewhat different, at least to me. Growing up, I watched quite a few movies of this genre. At the back of my mind, they were all about a cowboy - a wanted cowboy, in most cases - who killed villains and fought for justice, but not the generally accepted justice, it also could be a justice of his own. Western movies definitely stood out to me among other movie genres and evoked certain emotions of fun and entertainment. However, it is pretty different in the case of Dances With Wolves. It was a rollercoaster of varied emotions and feelings, which I shared with John Dunbar as if I experienced what he did through the screen. Those were the emotions and feelings of confusion and perplexity at the beginning of the movie, namely in the scenes of a bloody field hospital, in the scenes of a mocking depiction of a Civil War battle, and subsequently John's encounter with a weirdly shocking officer (masterfully played by Maury Chaykin). Later, those were the feelings of calmness and peacefulness during John's stay at Fort Sedgewick with beautiful scenery of American Great Plains and the feelings of concern and interest in John's confrontations with Indians following his assimilation into their community. The strongest emotions of all were the emotions of rage and resentment for the gratuitous actions of the US army shown in the movie and all the injustice they provoked.What also distinguishes Dances With Wolves from a typical Western movie is the presence of a love story. While in the tribe, John Dunbar falls in love with a beautiful young white woman (played by Mary McDonnell), who was raised by the Sioux and named Stands With a Fist. Female characters were not central characters in this movie genre for a long time and became playing leading roles closer to the end of the twentieth century.A considerable part of the movie is devoted to Native Americans, namely to the Sioux tribe. Having made friends with Sioux, John Dunbar writes in his journal: \"they have gentle humor I enjoy, it seems every day is a miracle. I have never known people so eager to laugh and so dedicated to family.\" Hence we discover their other, a better side, in contrast to what USa propaganda promulgated to its citizens. Sioux don't wish for a war; they simply want to live on their ancestors' land.Western movies are known for their action, crossfires, and horse racings. Dances With Wolves follows this trend but at the same time uses a slow narration pace. Considering that the movie is almost four hours long, it is neither boring nor slow. The musical score complements the movie wonderfully and helps to capture all the emotions of the story.Well-written and nicely filmed, Dances With Wolves is more than just a movie - it's a message to us to remember our past and learn from the mistakes we have made. I wish this movie were simply a work of fiction, but knowing that the historical facts underlie the basis of its plot, makes it even more engaging to watch.",

We hope the harmony situation can last long, longer than the movie showed. But there's no way to expect that the tragedy of the Indian culture never come. Ancient civilization is bound to be replaced by modern one, though it may take blood, tears, darkness and sin to go through this. It's inevitable. As one saying (in China) goes, men are created to die. Though this analogy seems pretty sad, it's quite true. As soon as a man is born, he is moving to death every day, every hour and every second. So does human civilization. Human beings have gone through the original society, agriculture society, and now we are going through industrial society. It's impossible for us to foresee what the next society will be like after, say, 10000 years. So we can say that the industrial societies we build today are made to die, just like the original society and agriculture society. It's cruel to say this, but it does expose the cruelty that the world we live in and history we went through truly posses.This movie showed us this bloody and glory,miserable and honorable substitution process. So it's sure to be an epic. It's an epic dedicated to the human civilization.Also, being an epic requires magnificent scenes. This movie created a quite perfect one with the prairie, the sky, the buffalo and the wolf. Why do I count \"wolf\" in? Well, this movie spent a lot on that, didn't it? First, the name, \"Dances with Wolves\". Then the real wolf, there are lots of scenes about it. More importantly, this wolf, \"two socks\", is a symbol of Indian civilization. Outside the Indians look like cavemen, which is terrifying, this is similar to the wolf. But inside, they are kind, generous and warm-hearted, just like the development of the relationship between \"two socks\" and John Dunbar. So the denouement of the wolf marks the denouement of Indian culture.P.S. The music played in this movie is so wonderful and it contributed to the epic atmosphere. I think the only music which is better than this one is \"My Heart Will Go On\" in Titanic.",

Yes the movie is long and sometimes lagging but never boring.I wish K.C. would Direct more movies.I remember back when i was working at Block Buster Video in 89 & seeing in the theater man what a good time.And then it came out on video tape.Everyone thought the movie was great.Believe me you'll love this movie. Give it a try & see.To me this movie is a top ten movie with all the greats like Scarface,Goodfells,Silence of the lambs,and all the Rocky & Rambo movies,Ghost,and Roadhouse.This movie should be at least a 9 in my opinion.",

Why don't you read your own history ? e.g . Burnham , Scouting on Two Continents.

I say that referring to the\nfirst part of the plot (doesn't make me expect much of the film) or the communication we can see between them (although it's comprehensive at a time). It actually doesn't fit for me in these three hours, it could be better optimized.\nDespite not being fully deedful it's stirring and you notice that feeling.

I am a veteran in Canada, and one of the disappointments I had, was, having known many American soldiers over the years, this movie did not portray them anywhere near those whom I have known.It is a period piece but I doubt it very much that the soldiers were depicted anywhere near the psychos they were depicted here. I have been an admirer of Zane Grey all of my life and I think you should have read his books before this movie was made. Many aboriginal people are great and Mr Grey recognized them as such. My issue is that politics should stay out of it completely. No more Political Correctness!!! It cheapens everything...Human compassion and empathy has to come from the heart but not to the detriment of one over the other. Again I reiterate, read Zane Grey's books. They were way ahead of their times and it wouldn't surprise me to find that they have been a huge inspiration to the great intentions of nowadays. Even if as a result of political considerations it has gone off the rails...",

Especially, the buffaloes chasing, it was amazing, even it was little big longer than it should be.I also liked that the story didn't start with a white man who hates the Sioux then became friends, it starts with both sides wants to know each other without any one get hurt.I highly recommend it to anyone wants to watch a good movie.",

Now available on Blu-Ray, I can only hope that a new generation will discover - and the rest remember - what an enduring classic this is. Based on the 1988 novel by Michael Blake (the e-book of which was also just released this week), Dances With Wolves tells the story of Lieutenant John J. Dunbar as he retreats from the battlefields of the Civil War to the expanses of the American frontier. Left alone and forgotten at the abandoned Fort Sedgewick, the lieutenant's solitude is broken only by the strange visits of an old wolf and the constant companionship of his horse, Cisco. That is, until a nearby Indian tribe returns to their summer home a few miles away. Though initially fearful of one another, the Native American people introduce Dunbar to a new way of life - a life that gradually draws him away from his identity as an officer of the Union Army and into a new identity as \"Dances With Wolves.\"",

            "content": "Lieutenant John J. Dunbar became a hero accidentally because of that he wanted to suicide but led Union to winning. After that, he volunteered to go to frontier. On the way, he heard some bad things about Indians. When he got to the Fort Sedgwick, there isn't anything. He was there by his own, and met Kicking Bird who is medicine man of Sioux tribe and was attracted by Sioux's culture. They became more and more friendly to each others. Dunbar felt that they have a lot of difference, because Indians are optimistic and innocent. He was with them and help them to defend their children, women, and food. In addition, he felt he is a part them. They help him to be marry, even poor families did so. It's a little different to what I know in the movie. In other movies, cowboys are always very tough. In this movie, it is more emphasis the difference between Sioux and pioneers' concepts. Dunbar isn't very rugged, but he has higher technology than Sioux. There are lots of difference, but it doesn't comment which one is true, it even makes me feel Indians' concept is more important than modern concept. At that time, the bad conditions make people hard to live, pioneers only can rely on themselves, I think that's why Thanksgiving is so important to Americans. Dunbar has a hero ability which is can-do spirit, he can live in the Fort Sedgwick, but he go to Sioux tribe and help Sioux to find buffaloes and defend their village,We are always threatened by environment nowadays, I feel that Indians' concept is completely good for us. In this movie, Dunbar doesn't really want to fight to nature and native Americans. Primitive life style is sort of cruel. However, living in that style can be really sustainable development. Dunbar is a hero whose type is what I like, because he is sensitive, brave, and kindhearted.",

            "content": "I think the movie is trying to speak for Indians. It describes a white officer Dunbar in the United States who volunteers to go to the west front to station. At last make friends with Sioux warriors who even have a different language and culture. Later on, the white people regard him as a traitor, and treat him with violence. What's more, they even want to execute him with hanging punishment. After Dunbar seeing what white army did, he starts to feel shameful for the white army and he stands totally on the Sioux's side and insists that his name is \"dances with wolves\". Dunbar tries to persuade Indians to move the camp because he knows he cannot change what is going to happen, but in the end, the Indians' leader, Ten Bears only smiled and talked of simple pleasures. He reminded Dunbar that at his age, a good fire was better than anything. I think Ten Bears was an extraordinary man. Finally, the Indians were suffering from a massacre.The movie's title is \"Dances with wolves\", there really is a wolf that always stays around Dunbar in the movie, and I think the director is trying to express something; he wants people to meditate. When someone mentioned wolves, the first impression comes to my mind is \"loneliness\". The wolf in this movie metaphors a belief of grief and strength. When I watched over this movie last weekend, at that night, I thought much about that movie and I lied on bed and even cannot sleep as early as before. I am not sure that's because of the regards of the friendship built between Dunbar and the Indians or because I felt sad when I realized the harsh reality that the tragedy came from human's nature of desire and cruel.The white people think the Indians are ruthless and rude who cannot have a conversation with. Actually brutal and rude Indians are exceptional. Just like what Dunbar says when he knows more about the Sioux people:\" nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not beggars or thieves. They are not the brutal men they have been made out to be. On the contrary, they are polite and have the familiar humor I enjoy. The communication is slow however. The \"Quiet\" is frustrated as I am. Most of our progresses were based on failure rather than success\". I like these words in Dunbar's journal, so I wrote these words down when I saw the movie. I always thought that if I were him, what would I do?\"Dances with Wolves\" is the name of the movie, the name of a white lieutenant Dunbar, but it also give us a feeling of beauty and sadness. It shows the close contact between people, between people and animals, between man and nature. However, \"wolf\" is alone after all and is not comprehended by \"the people\", I like the howl of the wolf at the end of the movie, and I think we can feel its destiny as well as Dunbar's from this sad howl. I think the misunderstanding is one of the crucial reasons leads to the massacre to Indians other than exploring frontier. Besides, we should have lived in harmony with Indians together.",
