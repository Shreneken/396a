            "content": "Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.",

            "content": "If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.",

            "review_title": "Best Sequel yet",
            "content": "In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, \"Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash.\" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, \"Hold My Hand.\" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's \"Take My Breath Away,\" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",

            "content": "This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development \"hell\" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate \"Iceman\" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!",

            "content": "What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\u00e9, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",

It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.",

            "content": "See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the \"Top Gun\" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

            "content": "It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing \"back\" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.",

            "content": "I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the \"Top Gun\" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of \"Goose\" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' \"Danger Zone\" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.",

            "content": "Having loved Top Gun, I clearly wasn't going to miss Top Gun: Maverick, and also being a fan of Tom Cruise, I knew the best place to watch it would be the big screen. I totally enjoyed the film as I watched it with a helping of popcorn. There were moments where I felt excited, emotional and even laughed along with the other viewers. It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.Tom Cruise shines in his performance where he is required to display a good range of emotions and has a good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, while also impressing us in the action sequences as he always does. Speak of which, the action is very beautifully executed as well as filmed. Every time the jets turned, I felt like my head moved along in the same direction. This effect is repeated multiple times and ends up immersing the viewer into the thrill of the action. It's very clean and neatly done, and never violent at all. The film has no adult content, due to which you can watch it with your families.The music and score are terrific, and the cinematography is another major plus. Some might find the initial few acts a little slow, but the action sequences completely steal the show, especially in the lengthy and spellbinding final act. The editing is top notch, as the film never feels long or stretched. I was actually surprised how short it felt, and in a good way. Top Gun: Maverick is a very feel-good action movie with realistic action and emotions to deliver an experience of a lifetime. If you enjoyed Top Gun, chances are you will find yourself loving this film even more, for Cruise once again proves he's the man to look for when quality action is what viewers crave. Must watch on the big screen. Period.",

It was just OK movie and nothing more.Today i saw \"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.Overall, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.",

This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.Having said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).Its fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)",

            "content": "Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.Here is my take and why I think its an \"okay\" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer,\nyounger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.",

The genuine aerial stunts really put to shame the endless CGI tripe that is slopped into theatres every week. The action here feels viscerally REAL - something that has been sorely missed from recent blockbusters.The new cast are all perfect. It's obvious they are having the time of their lives - and that infectious joy was felt by the whole audience. Charming, funny, arrogant and heartful at all the right times. I hope we will see them reunited on screen (and much sooner than 36 years!) The nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise does not look out of place. The practical flying scenes really cannot be praised enough. It's an action masterclass, I can barely fathom the work and effort it took to capture such ambitious footage.The film is self-aware and knows exactly what the audience is there to see. Clearly a better script than the original (although lacking the iconic quotes.) Killing off Meg Ryan seemed a bit unnecessary, especially after they made the effort to bring back Val Kilmer for a quite jarring cameo. Honestly the references to the original were slightly overkill to begin with, but thankfully settled down once the plot got going.I thought the film had come to a very satisfying climax, then a happy surprise to realise the final act was only just beginning! You can't deny that Tom Cruise pulled it off - a real movie star, in a real blockbuster hit. Oscars for sound, cinematography and editing are surely locked down. Simply the best film of 2022.",

The romance segments were kept short and neat this time around, giving some growth and redemption for our hero without dulling the sharp storytelling.After watching I was smiling from ear to ear.

I feel like that changed the way movies will be made forever. It was the perfect blend of old and new, with absolutely incredible audio and visuals and some of the best storytelling I've ever seen in a movie. I just witnessed history.There were multiple points in which the movie could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. Maverick saves Rooster and then Rooster saves Maverick and then they team up to escape just for Hangman to come save them. I was on the edge of my seat, emotionally invested, and inspired by the performances of all involved. But, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell stole the show.Could they have picked a better Rooster? Miles Teller was a spitting image of Goose and gave the performance of a lifetime. You could feel his pain and you could feel his struggle and how much everything meant to him. It was paired perfectly with Hangman's character, who was executed without flaw. That's what this movie was to me. Flawless.But this last part is for Tom Cruise. You can't tell me that man is almost 60. I won't believe you. His energy and charisma is what truly carried this film to a place in movie history. Hitting Mach 10, continuing to go after he hit Mach 10, going through the course in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. No matter what was thrown his way, he found a way to exceed expectations and teach everyone lessons along the way. His scene with Val Kilmer was so special. \"It's time to let go\". His struggle with how to handle Rooster being explained that his mother's dying wish was for him to convince Rooster not to take after his dad was powerful. I laughed at the many moments of perfectly timed humor, I was sucked in during the moments of breath-taking action, and I cried during every emotional moment this film had to offer.",

What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor.",

Managing to retain the spirit of the original whilst also adding stronger stakes, a more emotionally involving narrative and better written characters.Tom Cruise is perfect as Maverick, bringing all the charm and star power but also adding much needed dramatic weight and sorrow to the character. He also has great chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, who is a strong love interest with lots of warmth and humanity.All of the new cast fit in perfectly and are all really memorable but Miles Teller is definitely the standout with a satisfying character arc and has equally great chemistry with Cruise. Val Kilmer's inclusion was a superb decision and is handled with immense love and respect.Joseph Kosinski's direction is absolutely amazing. The film looks amazing overall with some nice homages to Tony Scott's iconic style but the standout is definitely the flight sequences which are truly astonishing and satisfyingly practical.Sifting through hours upon hours of footage, the flight sequences are edited together in spectacular fashion, extremely comprehensible and never boring. The film itself has excellent pacing, naturally building to a thrilling climax that just keeps escalating.The soundtrack and music by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga and Hans Zimmer is also perfect. All the classics you expect are present and used in satisfying ways and the new music is appropriately epic. The new songs by Lada Gaga and One Republic are so good, utilised at the right moments and equally catchy and memorable.",

The cinemas will be absolutely packed and the movie will keep striking hits at the box office, but it's just Tom Cruise returning for another 2-hour round of exciting dogfights, poor story and bad pacing.There is absolutely nothing special about Top Gun: Maverick; it's just a pointless waste of time, especially considering its 1986 predecessor was more even more decent than this movie is. It'll definitely offer big audiences who lived through the 80s with their powerful levels of nostalgia, just like Scream fans would've received a nice touch from the new Scream, which is perfectly reasonable.This film actually lives with some pretty good direction, admirable cinematography, emotional connections and tamer content, but that doesn't overlap how it turned out. In fact, those are the only perks throughout this movie. The story is overlong and very boring to watch, just after being predictable and filled with attempted elements that just don't work out.

            "content": "In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to \"get out\" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.For a very basic overview, Maverick tells the story of the titular Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), still breaking in cutting-edge flying machines with no designs on sitting behind a desk. But in a world that has perhaps moved on from his ways, Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to help train a new class--including one Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whose name may sound familiar to fans of the original 1986 effort--for a seemingly impossible mission. Along the way, he rekindles a relationship with an old flame (played by Jennifer Connelly) and comes to terms with some unfinished business--both emotionally and in the skies.First and foremost, TG: Maverick is a 10/10 film--and easily, at that--because it perfectly balances the \"new stuff\" with the legacy material. Five minutes in, I knew that Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski had the right formula. There is not a single wasted or boring moment here. Not only that, but the focus is squarely on Cruise's Maverick pretty much throughout (as the title might suggest). This isn't some cheap handoff to a \"new crew\" with Cruise shepherding the transition. This is a down-and-dirty, perfectly planned out melding of old and new.Cinematically, I can count on one hand (if that) the number of times I've been as enthralled from a theater seat. The phrase \"see it on the biggest screen possible\" might be bit trite, but in this case it couldn't ring more true (I saw it in IMAX format and was completely blown away!). The cinematography is one-of-a-kind, the sound reverberates through the entire theater, and the drama/laughs are palpable throughout. I can definitively state--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that seeing TGM in a theater is better than any home theater setup imaginable. It simply was created for the theater experience.A final movie-specific observation: the ability of this film to garner tears, laughs, and thrills in equal measure is nearly unparalleled. Everything it does--from re-introducing a legacy character hero, to the airborne theatrics, to the subtle or romantic character work--is crafted with incredible care and precision. There is something here for everyone (another cinema hallmark, come to think of it).It is easy--and sometimes popular--to write off Cruise's work due to some of his personal foibles. At this point, however, one does that at his/her own risk. Is he now the greatest cinematic star of all time? Unanswerable question, of course, but Top Gun: Maverick puts him in the conversation, to be sure. Without his dogged persistence in making sure this flick wasn't unceremoniously dumped onto a streaming platform, who knows what may have become of it (through all the delays and hand-wringing).Movies like this one definitively prove that the experience remains viable in the current entertainment environment (both for quality and money-making ability). The future of cinema is still murky, to be sure, but as Maverick himself intones about his supposedly impending extinction: \"Maybe so, sir...but not today\".",

            "content": "Hollywood had lost its way long before streaming services and a global pandemic nearly made going to the cinema obsolete. Content to strip mine the comic book genre and reboot/reimagine and regurgitate beloved franchises, it had become stale and tired. It's ironic then that a sequel to a nearly 40 year old film (You read that right. Scary isn't it?) might be the thing that points the way to their salvation.Top Gun: Maverick is a totally unnecessary film and on the surface it would seem to be Hollywood once again gnawing on a bone long since picked clean of any meat. The original Top Gun didn't exactly leave us with a bunch of unresolved issues or end on a cliffhanger. Just because a movie is good doesn't mean it needs a sequel. But here we are. And damn if they don't just manage to make it worthwhile, if still unnecessary.Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same story beats as the original, but the tone here is far less... 80s. Fitting as it's not, well, the 80s. That doesn't mean it's some sort of post-modern deconstruction of the titualar character or a naval gazing treatise. It's got plenty of humor and, most important of all, it isn't saddled with preaching a \"woke\" message or poking us in the chest with some ideological finger. It's a movie that just wants to entertain, and entertain it does.Whatever you or I may think of Tom Cruise's \"religious\" beliefs, I dare anyone to say that there is an actor working today who brings the kind of passion and commitment to excellence to everything the way he does. He truly is the last real movie star, and I find myself appreciating him more and more with each passing year.My quibbles are just that. The romance between Cruise's Maverick and the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly's Penny is a tad perfunctory, even though they do share a nice chemistry and Connelly is particularly good. The enemy is also faceless and nameless, likely in an attempt to not offend any particular market; though to be fair this was also the case in the original.But these minor issues aside, Top Gun: Maverick is a refreshing throwback to a time when Summer films were fun, and after nearly 20 years of increasingly banal comic book, cgi shennanigans, it really hit the spot that much more.",

Navy pilots tend to be the most aggressive in their flying that it puts a tear in my eye. This was the coolest way to do a movie of this type. The flight scenes were just great and you feel like you're right there with em. One of the pilots told Tom that he was never going to do the maneuver they did ever again. This maneuver was at 50ft and he said it was too dangerous. Knowing the speeds that these guys fly you could eat 50 ft in a split second and find yourself in the ground. They must have really been pushing it.Miles Teller (\"Rooster\") went to Tom and asked him if he was willing to do a Top Gun 3. So Miles told the media that he and Tom are discussing it. I hope they decide to do so.The ONE THING that got me in the movie was the Cobra Maneuver. In every demo/flight show I have seen, there has been nothing like that. First they go canopy to canopy and it was quite close, but then peeled off so closely in a circular manner I just gushed! Folks that's really dangerous! But these guys are the best. They probably had about 3000 hours in the aircraft. By that time you're an expert.",

I can't believe the original got worse ratings than this sequel. This movie is just not that great, I'm sorry to say. The acting is crap. I don't remember Tom Cruise being this bad. I loved Jerry Maguire! Anyway, I don't even care that the big mission was completely unfeasible. I have a problem with the rest of the storyline being completely hackneyed and derivative. This movie is too much like the original, for example, Goose's son is Rooster (also a fowl name), his son also has a moustache, he also plays the piano AND played the exact same song at the same bar his father played in all those years ago. *eye roll* Same old story with the top brass not liking Maverick coz he always breaks the rules, they give him a hard time, he almost gets kicked out of the navy but then turns out to be a hero. *yawn* As others have mentioned, there is zero character development in anyone. The dialogue is insipid. I was so bored I tuned out about 75 minutes in. The story is predictable and uninteresting. The \"romance\" between Maverick and Penny is flat and uninspired. They had no spark or chemistry, but that is probably because THE WRITING SUCKED.I give this movie three generous stars for the great action scenes.Is it a joke that this is nominated for best motion picture?",

Thank you, Tom Cruise.Finally, a wonderful non-Marvel/Disney action movie; I am so tired of the entire tired Marvel eco-system. We really have to admire Tom Cruise for this accomplishment. And, what he has done for the Armed Services in creating interest for selfless service to the interests of the USA, superb. Thank you, Tom Cruise.I love watching Tom Cruise in interviews. He's so intense and focused. It is a lesson in drive, determination, and mind over matter. Just exceptional. He's now the guy at the top of my \"who would you like to have dinner with\" list. I really admire him; he's my own age, and I am adjunct faculty at two universities, one of which I teach in a graduate master degree program in leadership.Now, apart from the emotion of my deserved admiration for Tom Cruise and his stellar accomplishment, I think this movie was a great night night out at the theater. This reminded me of Ford v. Ferrari, a good story that exhilarates. Yet, all in, similarly, a bit forgettable and predictable in the story. That is, when I watch a movie, I reflect on whether the movie teaches me something, or draws out of me some unforgettable emotion. Does it change me, like reading a meaningful book. Consider all the life lessons taught in Godfather I and II, or the seminar one-liners of Jerry McGuire, or the original Top Gun.So, notwithstanding the unbelievable accomplishment of the sets, and planes, and jets, being crazy great, as the overall movie goes, I give it an 8, because it still misses the character development and relies on the original more than it perhaps should do. Truly, I want to give this movie a 10, because emotions tell me to do it for Tom Cruise, but the movie is really an 8, all in. But go see it on the big screen, it's really great cinema. Thank you, Tom Cruise. Do it at the theater to support the movie-making that Tom Cruise is doing. Great cinema, and not Marvel.Really, deeply and sincerely, thank you, Tom Cruise.",

It falls into the same traps these films do with too many callbacks and rehashed scenes.That said, there is a very honest story about changing times and aging which ultimately drives the movie. Good cinema is subtle about real world situations (best example being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. People not watching it when it was released probably would miss all the commentary on politics from the era.) So in that sense it's pretty bold and genuine.The flight sequences are...outstanding. It was mostly shot practically which is why is looks so much more impressive than other movies. Directing is good, not great (sans the action sequences, which are great.) Acting is great. Connelly, Cruise and Teller are all A-listers for a reason. So anyone who says \"there's nothing good about this movie\" are just haters. You can't by any stretch of criticism say the action sequences and acting aren't some of the best you'll see all year.It is very much a throwback to blockbusting movies from the 80's and it really feels like it. But we haven't had that in so long, it was nice to revisit it. I don't think it's one of the greatest movies of all times, but I gave it a 9 because it could be the greatest movie from the last 3-4 years. It didn't ask you to have watched a bunch of other movies to appreciate it (like Marvel) it wasn't preachy with its messaging, it didn't drag, it was humanizing but indulgent with drama. Just a perfect summer movie for the times.",

A significant achievement for its leading man and a career touchstone for director Joseph Kosinski, if there's one film you see on the big screen this year make it this one.4 1/2 pairs of aviators out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

These guys are hot-heads no doubt about it, but that's what people pay to see.There are some very good action sequences in this film. When you're watching a car chase in a movie it is very easy to keep track of where everyone is at. In a plane chase though it is very hard to get context of everyone's situation. It can be a little confusing at times but I thought the film did a good job of keeping us in the loop (so to speak) as much as they could.There's plenty of fan service to the original. I thought Val Kilmer's scene was handled very well. Touching, sweet, funny and as respectful as it could be. The film is also quite well paced.

This version of Maverick is quite different from the first movie, as age and experience would dictate, but he's every bit the daredevil that we saw in 1986.

This is no doubt Maverick's movie, but Rooster steps up in a supporting role rivalling that of Goose and Ice man in the first movie.

It goes beyond simple dog fighting and air battles to multi-layered challenges that draw the audience in further with each escalation. It also honors popular characters from the past and brings back the original Top Gun aesthetic and memorable music tracks.

I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch.

            "content": "As \"Top Gun: Maverick\" opens, we are in the \"Mojave Dessert, California\", where Maverick, now a test pilot, is working to fix one of his planes. He is called into a meeting where he's told that Admiral Cain is planning to shut down the program, that Maverick is being transferred back to the Top Gun, this time as a teacher. Before Cain arrives, Maverick takes the hypersonic prototype on one more flight, attempting to reach speeds of 10G. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this long-delayed sequel to the 1986 original \"Top Gun\" is directed by Joseph Kosinski (\"Oblivion\"). Here he reunites with Tom Cruise, and what a reunion this turns out to be. The movie's script is surprisingly well developed, and hence I was unexpectedly invested in the story and these characters. Then there are the flight scenes. Let's just say that I haven seen anything like it before. Yes, it's that good. The cast is quite good. Cruise is supported by Jennifer Connelly (perfect as the love interest, and thankfully the movie makers decided not to go with someone who is half Tom Cruise's age); Miles Teller is excellent as Rooster (the son of Goose); Jon Hamm and Ed Harris (as higher-ups in the Navy), and last but not least Val Kilmer, who plays in just one scene, but it's a touching one. Bottom line: I was simply blown away by the movie, which is the rare sequel that is superior in every which way to the original. (As an aside, Tom Cruise opened the screening with a heartfelt thank you to all viewers for coming out to the theater. It couldn't have lasted more than 15-20 seconds, but I thought it was a really nice touch. You can say and think of Cruise what you want, but you can't argue that he doesn't take his job seriously, and he'll do just about anything to promote his films and schmooze the crowds.)After having been delayed for 2 years due to COVID, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" finally premiered in theaters nationwide, to great success both at the box office and with critics (there is good reason why this movie is currently rated 95% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes). Of course you don't have to believe the hype, so I encourage you to check it out (the bigger the movie screen, the better), and draw your own conclusion.",

            "content": "I was never anticipating Top Gun Maverick. I thought Top GUn was good, but not great. I couldn't care less about the film, but most people and my friends said it was amazing. So I went to see it. And sure enough, it was one of the best experiences I have ever had on the big screen while watching this, and holy sherbert was this a film to have and has no right to be this level of good.Pros: Because Rarely do you get a sequel that measures well against a Blockbuster like what Top Gun was. But I have to say, and excitedly, Maverick does just that. I enjoyed the action here, great stunt flying by this highly skilled team of aviators because this action was the best action I have seen in a long time. I take it back because the action and suspense were breathtaking. Never had I wanted to beg someone to make it out of life in the most messed up and dangerous situation. The cast was great; Jon Hamm stood out to me as a big presence. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic; the romance scenes were extremely tasteful and did not detract from this film's core 'action.' The cinematography was first-rate, and the story was solid; the acting was spot on. Jerry Bruckheimer preserved the magic, and There was enough reference material in the movie to remind or retell the original story for those who had not seen Top Gun keep everyone up to speed. Bringing back Val Kilmer was a nice touch as well. The great story they put together to work that in. But Maverick and Rooster were the show stealers of this film; their problems with each other were like a father trying to protect and reconnect with his son. A big plus is that there were more PRACTICAL EFFECTS than CGI. One thing in the modern era where everybody loves to use CGI instead of practical, this was a huge plus for me.Cons: Nothing much, but I wish there were even more action scenes, as they were all good and entertaining.Overall, the film was outlandish; they made me like this with some breathtaking action, and I couldn't believe I would skip this film. But I was so glad I saw it on the big screen. 10/10. Perfect.",

            "content": "\"Thirty-plus years of service. Combat medals. Citations. Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years. Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die. You should be at least a two-star Admiral by now, yet here you are. Captain. Why is that?\" Vice Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain (Ed Harris)Top Gun: Maverick is top of the line defining the humanistic action film that stands not far behind my favorite of the subgenre, The Magnificent Seven. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) returns to Top Gun school to teach the best navy pilots to fly an almost impossible mission and to lose their cockiness as well. The losses he has sustained because of his devotion to excellence are codified above.Almost 30 years after his peak, when he lost a pilot and now faces the pilot's son, \"Rooster (Miles Teller),\" in his class, Maverick shows why he is the best teacher who was once the second-best pilot in his graduating class. That he thinks of himself as an \"enabler,\" not a teacher, is further proof that he could be the best teacher, an element of which is humility. Indeed, this wildly fun adventure is as much about teaching and learning as it is about heroism.It shouldn't be lost that Teller also played an upcoming student, Andrew, in Whiplash, where J. K. Simmons plays his tough teacher, Fletcher, much in the manner that Cruise plays \"teacher\" Maverick. Both father figures demand the best, giving no quarter until students master the drill and lose their overweening pride.The motif most young males come to this movie for is the tough-guy aerial play, and there is plenty of that. Yet, their testosterone represents all human beings, male and female, who want to be more than they are and think battle is the key to attaining glory. This Top Gun shows the need to be humble as one pursues lofty goals, right down to the level of love, where Maverick finds another almost impossible task of wooing back his former love, Penny (Jennifer Connelly).This humanity-rich drama also comments on the pursuit of excellence and its concomitant demand to be selfless to serve mankind. Additionally, reconciling enemies and turning enmity to kindness becomes the formula for success, right up to a rear admiral, Ice (Val Kilmer), who endangers his own reputation to support his former rival, Maverick, and defeat an unnamed enemy threating nuclear warfare from its uranium hideaway.And so it goes-Top Gun: Maverick, while dishing out heaps of action cliches, also serves up a paradigm for success dominated by a willingness to overcome pride while also saving humanity. That's tops for any movie. Summer is now officially here with Top Gun rightfully taking top of the box office. Rarely does a seemingly superficial adventure promise the salvation of humanity and save summer at the same time.",

High octane concepts, rock songs, synth scores, colourful photography with plenty of sunsets and fast vehicles.Top Gun in 1986 was the epitome of this type of movie which began in the early 80s with movies such as American Gigolo and Flashdance.The aesthetics provided by producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. Director Tony Scott provided the sheen.36 years later, the sequel arrives. Dedicated to Tony Scott who died in 2012. This is a Bruckheimer/Simpson production even though the latter died in 1996.Joseph Kosinski who made the belated sequel to Tron is the man hired to direct this tardy follow up.Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot on an experimental plane designed to go to Mach 10. He has been passed over for promotion many times because of his rebellious attitude.Maverick is now regarded as a dinosaur. Under the watchful eye of old foe turned friend Iceman (Val Kilmer.) Maverick is back to Top Gun school.He has a few weeks to prepare a group of hot shots to undertake a dangerous mission to destroy a uranium plant in a rogue country. The plant is guarded by SAM missiles, hostile mountain ranges and there has to be several miracles for the plant to be blown up.Maverick does not feel cut out to be a trainer. Especially as one of the pupils is the son of his late friend Goose. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller) is angry at maverick over his father's death and being held back in his flying career.Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same beats as the original but with a fresh lick of paint. It even has a knowingly homo erotic football scene on the beach.The mission is a homage to the original Star Wars. Cruise has insisted that CGI is minimally used, the aerial photography is the tops.This is a fun popcorn movie. There is little that is groundbreaking or new. It is an alternative to the Marvel blockbusters.Cruise wisely references the original movie with several clips. There was genuine emotion in the cinema to see Cruise again with Val Kilmer who has been recovering from a serious real life illness.",

Notwithstanding appearances, he is actually very considerate of his colleagues.This sequel completely misses the point. Maverick is now an undisciplined showboating pilot.

The collaborative screenplay (five credited writers) hits all the expected story beats, no matter how cliched or predictable they may be.Tom Cruise is still very much a charismatic star. Jennifer Connelly does what she can with a stereotypical role. The rest of the cast, both young and old, fill their roles suitably, with Miles Teller doing a good job following in Anthony Edwards' flight path as his offspring. Val Kilmer gets a bittersweet cameo. The production (with a huge assist from the U. S. military) is well done.What is missing are any surprises. It's 130 minutes of just what one would expect. Fan service takes precedence here - the best \"supporting actors\" are the vintage photos and stock footage from the original 1986 film -- doing a lot of the emotional heavy lifting; Heck, they get more screen-time than some of the actual performers. Almost all of the songs could have been on the soundtrack of the Tony Scott predecessor - wouldn't want to shake up the baby boomers turning out to see it by playing some of that newfangled post 80s music.Does it \"work\" as a sequel? Sure. Low bar that it is. The fact that quite a few folks are already touting this as a Best Picture contender says more about the poor state of big studio driven movies than it does about the merits of MAVERICK itself. NOBODY was calling TOP GUN an Oscar contestant in '86. Take away the nostalgia and MAVERICK isn't demonstrably better than the first film (the fact that MAVERICK has a 97 Rotten Tomatoes score vs. A 58 for the original demonstrates how low the bar has gotten). But, hey, in an era where GREEN BOOK, SHAPE OF WATER and CODA can win Best Picture and BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was a serious nominee - wouldn't bet against it.",

Maverick is, career-wise and socially still in the same place he was in 1986, which is hard to believe.3. Despite having pictures all over Pacific Fleet's lobby and being a legend in Naval Aviation, today's young top aviators have no clue who Maverick is.4. Unnamed enemy nation has fifth-generation fighter jets but no nuclear weapons, which is simply impossible.5. SAM missiles are easily visible on mountains but while cruise missiles were sent to take the airfield out, none were sent to take out the SAMs, which would have made the mission a lot easier.6. Tiresome trope at the beginning where Tom Cruise crashes the experimental plane, ends up in a diner around the Southwest that looks like it time traveled from the seventies or eighties, from the restaurant to the clothes people wore. I traveled all around that area and no one dresses like that. They all dress like Americans do all over the country. Waitresses at diners also all wear polos and pants, they don't wear dresses from the eighties. Hollywood seems to still think flyover country hasn't changed since 40 years ago.7. Pretty sure fifth-generation fighters wouldn't have to engage in a dogfight at close range with an F/A-18.8. Perhaps the most ludicrous scene in the film, the Hind attack helicopter is searching for Maverick and chooses to fire at him instead of capturing him. That doesn't happen, not even in Ukraine. Pilots are valuable to use as bargaining chips. Even regular soldiers are as we've seen in the past couple decades. You would think an advisor would have told them that scene was dumb.9. Other than a brief mention at the beginning, the movie pretends drones don't exist, which is a missed opportunity. Along with the Ukraine War, it makes the film look dated.10. Too much nostalgia for the old film, from the soundtrack that was copy and pasted with no variation, the need to include Goose's son, which was unnecessary, including Ice as a Commander. Cruise also doesn't show his age. The film needed to go in its own direction, not act like it was set one year after the original Top Gun.11. The training for the bombing run wasn't realistic. They couldn't copy the canyon exactly. Much of what Maverick did is likely already being taught to top aviators or easily accomplished by tech. If you know a lot about military equipment, or more than your casual viewer, the film is kind of silly.Top Gun was alright, but a sequel just wasn't warranted and was guaranteed to be off. It's a decent watch once, but look for this to be quickly forgotten like that Independence Day sequel. The high praise and reviews are kind of unwarranted.",

I'm also not comparing 80's effects to 20's effects. \"Maverick\" was simply a better movie.Maverick (Tom Cruise) is 36 years older and he's still a captain in the Navy--in other words he wasn't promoted. He was satisfied flying fighter jets and ticking off admirals.He was sent to the Top Gun school in San Diego to teach the latest batch of hot shots how to really fly. They'd need to be exceptionally good and willing to take risks to accomplish an upcoming mission.I never expected to watch this movie. I'd never seen the original, never planned on watching the original, and didn't plan on watching the sequel. The trailers looked like nothing but glamor shots of jets and hunky uber-macho pilots. Besides, what's with these decades later sequels like \"Mary Poppins,\" \"Dr. Sleep,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" and others.I was wrong about \"Maverick.\"It was more exhilarating and more engaging. Maverick wasn't the brash, cocky, irritating young buck that he was in \"Top Gun\" which made him hateable. He was older, wiser, more layered, more subdued, and had a greater purpose. All the characters, in general, were more than the one dimensional versions we got in the first installment.But getting down to brass tacks, \"Maverick\" was about the fighter jets. There were some amazing shots of the jets in action. I don't know how much of it was green screened and how much was real F-18's doing their thing, but it made all the difference. It was like being on a roller coaster. My animal brain was drawn to those machines in flight like they were singing a siren song. If every character disappeared like they were snapped away by Thanos, I would never have known until the jets dropped out of the sky. It was like Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer did a study and found out what images could hypnotize people regardless of a script and they found out. Yeah, there were known names in the movie like John Hamm, Ed Harris, and Jennifer Connely, but they were just set pieces to me. They were simply there to fill the void between the flying. John Hamm could've been a ham hock, Ed Harris could've been Special Ed, and Jennifer Connely could've been Kelly McGillis again in her advanced age and I wouldn't have thought any less of the movie. \"Maverick\" was one of those rare action movies that was able to find action that wasn't Fast & Furious Avengers CGI drivel and still captivate an audience. I think they've stumbled upon a winning formula that studios should rush to copy.",

His movie star status is so blown out that I feel like it often makes him a target for punks like me to poke fun at him... still, his films are usually enjoyable. The last film I really liked a lot he did was probably War of the Worlds or the Last Samurai, and I'm not really into the Mission Impossible series. BUT, Top Gun: Maverick is ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. Simply put... THIS. MOVIE. ROCKS.Where do I even begin? First I will acknowledge the most important aspect of why this sequel is so incredibly good. It's EXPERTLY paced and WELL WRITTEN. This film goes back to a formula that works so well... a formula that most modern film makers dare to revisit because they feel they aren't being original enough... or old fashioned. The simple fact is that this a feel good movie. This is something that most filmmakers dare go during such a tumultuous time in America. I often come out of action/adventure movies now nowadays feeling ashamed of being a member of the human race. I came out of Top Gun: Maverick with a sense of hope. That hasn't happened in a long time. Everyone came out of that theater with a huge grin on their face, even the ones that were acting a little \"too cool\" to admit that they enjoyed it. EVERYONE enjoyed it. It's impossible not to enjoy it... especially on the big screen.That brings me to my next point: The big screen. Seeing this film in the theater was a good choice. The cinematography involving the very real flying sequences was really, really good. You felt like you were going 10 Gs. It's AWESOME. Simple as that. The realism of the flying is incredible. I'm so happy they didn't go with CGI and kept this real.There is an emotional element to this sequel's story that really feels so satisfying. It's just hitting all the right notes at all the right spots. It even got me to tear up a bit. The Val Kilmer parts were so tastefully done. Really, really well done with class.I loved the original movie, in all of it's dated cheesy 80s glory... and this sequel isn't afraid to tap a little into that but not take it too far resulting in a \"throwback\" movie. Even though it feels old fashioned and nostalgic at times, that's a great thing. That's what people want, and it didn't do it TOO much. It got it just right and also felt incredibly fresh.I've never given a Tom Cruise movie a 10/10... not even the original. But this film deserves the 10/10. Tom Cruise's heartfelt thank you message before the film started made me chortle at first, but part of me thought \"oh dang, he must be really proud of this...\". By the time I was walking out, I see why he did that. He has truly created a fantastic, heartfelt piece of entertainment. I'd be proud too. I have a lot more respect for Tom Cruise now. I hope his films continue to deliver on this level.Now, go see it on the big screen as soon as possible. I'm not a paid off stooge leaving a good review. I'm a cinephile stooge with good tastes that just really loved this film. Believe the hype.",

Since then, I've seen a majority of his good films in an erratic order: The Firm, Cocktail, Rain Man, Days Of Thunder, A Few Good Men, Far And Away, Jerry Maguire, Interview with the Vampire, Mission Impossible, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, The Last Samurai, Collateral, War Of The Worlds, Valkyrie, Oblivion, Edge Of Tomorrow, The Mummy. These are all of his movies I've seen.Top Gun is a special movie for me because those days I played Fighter Bomber(1989) a game on the Amiga 500 system, a gift from my aunt. So dog-fighting held a special place in my heart(only in game not for real).And the game itself was really remarkable. You could refuel in mid-air! The sound effects and targeting system were awesome.Back to the film. It is a sequel to the original, continuing where Top Gun ended and subsequent events that follow Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in his return to Top Gun as an instructor to teach the next generation of ace fighter-pilots for the U. S. Navy.Val Kilmer makes a small cameo in the film. I was truly shocked to see how this handsome actor has aged. His role the Ghost And The Darkness about the true story of the Lions Of Tsavo is forever immortalized in my memory along with Michael Douglas.The movie showcases realistic dogfights of this modern generation along with weaponry. Acting is decent and not over-the-top. The movie shines in the photography, sound effects and music departments. The editing and direction is top-notch.All in all, I'd recommend this for people who like movies of this genre and those who play aeroplane simulation games. Fans of Tom Cruise should be satisfied to this possibly final entry and a fitting farewell to fans of the original Top Gun film.Do I have more movies to recommend to you? Yes: Firefox 1982(superior film with special-effects ahead of its time), Flight Of The Intruder 1991, Flight Of The Black Angel 1991, Interceptor 1992. And as an afterthought my favorite childhood move: Flight Of The Navigator 1986(the golden era of movies).",

From a nostalgic point of view, I cant believe 36 years have passed between then and this sequel.The obvious observation to make is that Top Gun - Maverick is more a homage to the original film and characters than it is a sequel. The opening credits and aircraft carrier scene (with Kenny Logins Danger Zone blaring out) promises a treat but I'm afraid it falls short of expectations.The major problem is that the wise cracking one liners, over the top egos and amazing soundtrack of the original is replaced here with a paper thin plot, elementary dialogue and minor character development. Even the \"mission\" itself is something these days that would have been executed with technology and without using fighter planes. Its also really sad to see Maverick and Iceman at the end of the road and the general sense that the young men we once saw playing volleyball are now relics who have become irrelevant. There is too much use of the original as a lead in to the plot points and even having Goose's son as a big part of the story feels more nostalgic than it does necessary. Maverick's rekindled love story with Penny Benjamin at Miramar is tender but convenient, (Still working in the base bar after all these years ?) but the character is entitled to a happy conclusion to his story arc.As an action blockbuster it is really entertaining and with the cinema experience, the aerial sequences are gripping and very well done. Personally I would have liked to have seen more exterior shots during the action rather than facial closeups, but I suppose that was done to keep the characters identified during the chaotic final attack and dogfight.All in all, Its a by the numbers follow on which probably should have been made 15 years ago or not all. I'm sure part of my disappointment is how much of a pop culture effect the first one had on my generation and that this is a pale imitation compared to it. Six out of ten might seem generous, but I guess I just don't want to \"lose that loving feeling\".",

Nor is there any real sense of competition amongst them, unlike the original where they were vying for the top gun trophy.The topless football game in the sea is a very poor rip off of the topless volleyball in the original.There is no enemy. The main danger comes from surface to air missiles.And finally, the shark is well and truly jumped when they steal a 40-year old F14 that is magically charged and fuelled, then take off from a runway they destroyed half an hour into the movie.Seriously, I could go on but I won't.Two stars for the aerial photography and the skill of the actually pilots, but there is nothing else to recommend here.Perhaps this is what the original would have been without the genius script that was actually about one man's struggle with his sexuality with a few aerial battles thrown in, rather than just a movie about fighter pilots.",

I felt my IQ drop a good 30 points just with the forced use of call sign names intro in the bar.It's seriously below cartoon IQ level right from the cartoon start, then the unnamed rogue nation to fight against, the uncomfortable to watch dudes struggling to keep their abs tensed till the shot is done beach football play, and so on. It was so over played, like a daytime soap, every cheesy plot point, every hammy emotional moment hammered home to make sure you didn't miss a beat, even if you were really, really slow. They expected so little of their audience, and delivered to that very low mark.That this film is getting such high reviews makes me wonder who's sitting at home in their darkened home theatre alone watching this and buying it.The pluses.Great flight footage.Jennifer Connelly was good as the retro fitted love interest.Glen Powell's 'Hangman' with his chiseled features and smugness was on target.The negatives\nThinly disguised war p0rn selling a 'hey, we're good guys' image that doesn't exist.The plot was an excuse to do some lovely flight footage but if you actually comprehend what it's telling you it's about a nation that sees fit to fly into a foreign airspace and destroy and murder a large number of faceless people because it doesn't like other nations developing the same tech as it has and because it thinks it's a hammer and everything is a nail. Diplomacy is off the table and those 'enemy' pilots with wives and family, they don't matter, kill kill kill. But hey, here's a funny bit about putting your phone on bar and having to buy everyone a round.I hated the delivery. There was an opportunity to recognise the dated stupidity of the original and have a knowing laugh at it but that plan wasn't even hinted at and instead we're delivered it straight faced with glowing man love for frat boy antics, soldiering and war.This might as well have been a recruitment commercial, maybe it was. I hate that this exists and that we haven't grown the capacity to see it for what it is. There's nothing truly epic about this. It's not a quality piece of drama with masterclass acting showing us deep into the human soul and it's not a witty and fun piece of entertainment. It's dumb and debatably dangerous propaganda. An embarrassment to the world of film making which already has a very low 'hard deck' standard.",

It doesn't leave a sour taste afterwards. There were a couple cliche moments but it does not damage the overall movie's impact.What I lovedRight from the get go of the opening sequence, they make it clear that this is a reboot of the original with the old font and the music. They make sure to put enough homage and references and successfully remain true to the original Top Gun style, but just done better.They set up the characters effectively and doesn't miss any loose ends from the original. I was particularly impressed how Maverick was portrayed because even after 36 years, I feel like Cruise perfectly recaptured the essence of the character. Not only was he successful in that, he added an even better element: a man's struggle to preserve his legacy. A much more sophisticated and nuanced storytelling compared to the original.All of the aerial scenes were perfect. I loved that you can actually hear more of the dialogues and had better facial shots, which helped the audience to connect with the pilots more. In the original, it was sometimes difficult to do that partially because you couldn't tell who was who. This made the flight sequences much more enjoyable and understandable.Not a single dull moment in this amazing reboot. Honestly, most reboots are like 50/50 but this should be heralded as one of the finest reboot efforts in history. This movie felt particularly better because while it paid enough respects to the original, it also fixed all of its problems, which I think is what you should exactly do in the reboot. So far, this movie has been doing extremely well both critically and commercially. Best deserved for everyone who worked on it.",

It can be very tricky not to overcook this kind of legacy sequels, especially those of eighties darlings, and to achieve that, you ought to know and master the qualities and characteristics of the original product. Here, director Joseph Kosinski masterfully guides and directs his craft, always in full control and taking a significant attention to tiny details which ultimately results in a sequel that is skies above its predecessor in terms of quality and fun.Anyone who saw this film will definitely applaud the action scenes, their intensity and hyper-realism. But for me, what truly shone in Maverick was a sense of chemistry, a connection between the characters through their journey that enticed me to follow them, cheer for them and believe them as who they were and what they did. This, in my opinion, is the filmmakers' greatest achievement and what distinguished Maverick from countless other technical razzle-dazzles.One last point I need to mention is that the enemies here are of unknown country/origin/race. I think this is a very smart and interesting move, no devilish Germans/Russians/middle eastern terrorists versus pure 'Murican heroism to be found in this film, none of that nonsense, just some good action and good old-school story.",

Wouldn't have gone myself, but was asked to go. You'll have to suspend disbelief on many levels to allow for this movie just to start with. The Jet scenes can be well shot, but ridiculous, and the story is way overlong and superficial - nothing more than a rehash of the last with less interesting characters to try to balance Cruise's ego-centrism. The video-game-ish plot is paper mache. Younger characters are extras for Cruise. 1986 was a fun time but trying to recapture a mediocre movie from 35+ years ago can't generate anything better than mediocrity, and for this reviewer its actually worse.

In short, it's been designed to appeal to those who worship the original, giving them more of what they love (including another gratuitous bare-chested beach scene for those who like that kind of thing).I can't say that the first Top Gun is a particular favourite of mine: the action was fine, but everything else felt really corny to me, even in '86. Likewise, this sequel's dramatic moments - the bar scene, the love interest, the rivalry, Maverick's soul-searching - make much of the film feel like a very silly parody. I've got Hot Shots for that! Fortunately, when the film leaves the ground, things improve considerably: Maverick's opening Mach 10 flight is edge-of-the-seat stuff, the training scenes are thrilling, and the final mission is some of the best action that I have seen in a long time, ending the movie on a high, viewers leaving the theatre with a grin almost as wide as Tom's.

The story is of very simplistic nature, a very basic one that we all - in whatever context set - watched a zillion times before. For sure Maverick is good pop-corn cinema with some fine moments, and tasty for the right audience, but not as good as many reviewers here on Imdb claim boldly. In my opinion for example, The Edge of Tomorrow is the far stronger movie - it got good acting, a fine production, lots of action and spectacular visuals too, but, last but not least, a well crafted and superior script (compared to Maverick).

The story is half back in the 80s and half in the new wave of Mission Impossible where they are trying to ground these with such spectacular action scenes and moments between the characters.The action is truly where this movie excels! I never thought id be able to see such practical effects and filming since the Mad Max reboot. That movie changed how so many movies are made that its the revival from just all CGI back to a combination. How the G Force actually effects everyone is another amazing thing to see compared to the OG.

There are so many elements of this film that you truly just have to see to believe- everything works in such a smooth manner it ends up feeling so well crafted that it's honestly hard not to be impressed. Tom Cruise makes his return to his iconic character Maverick and does a fantastic job (as always), alongside Miles Teller's rooster who was everything I hoped his performance would be. Unlike the 1986 original, this film feels a lot more fleshed out. It has a decent plot and story structure and although those are clearly not the most important things to this movie- it takes the time to set up everything in a meaningful manner that allows you to care about the characters at hand rather than just watch planes flying across the screen. The cinematography is electric, and much better than its burnt orange counterpart- and the film in general doesn't at all feel repetitive or bland in its storytelling- in fact it's quite thrilling to watch at times. Being on the edge of my seat, watching Tom Cruise guide youngsters into uncertain undescriptive danger may feel like a bit of a cliche at this point- but it works so well in so many ways that I could not help but enjoy almost every minute of it.

Even so, it's hard to believe they would come back to it over 30 years later. When it was first announced that this would be happening, bringing back a now nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise as character Maverick, I was highly skeptical. Shouldn't Maverick be retired by now? The trailers for the film didn't do much to sway my opinion. Then the positive reviews came in and I was still skeptical.Having seen the film, I was completely wrong. This is easily one of the years most entertaining films yet. With the completely dependable Tom Cruise not missing a beat, easily stepping back into the shoes of Maverick, and high flying, practical action that will...ahem...take your breath away, this 36-years-later sequel surprised the hell out of me.The film's overall structure is pretty similar to the original film, with lots of training at Top Gun followed by a tough mission. We meet the near dozen characters whose top tier pilots will be taking on the mission. The biggest difference here, put out early on in the film, are that the stakes are immediately raised. This is no longer just following the pilots as they train, leading into a military career. The nearly impossible mission these pilots are to be sent on is laid on the table right away. We know what's to come. There's also an emotional elements established outright, with Maverick still filled with guilt over the loss of his friend and ROI from the first film, Goose. This is compounded by Maverick having a soured relationship with Goose's son, Rooster, played by Miles Teller. We also get some familiar character types here, the most notable being Hangman, who is the pilot that most comes across as how Maverick was in the first film.The film's emotional and more visceral stakes are well established and keep the film feeling like more than just another retread of the original film, but even if you don't feel a strong connection to those aspects, you'll likely still find yourself entertained. There's no shortage of action here and it's all superb. Cruise wanted this done with practical effects and it really translates into an adrenaline pumping, well shot, exciting time. The aerial action is outstanding, shot well and trumping anything we saw in the original film. It all leads up to what is arguably one of the most exciting aviation scenes ever produced for screen.As someone who doesn't necessarily call myself a huge fan of the original film, I wasn't expecting this to be something I would like as much as I did. I figured the film would lean hard into the nostalgia and give us a little bit of action, but I should have trusted Tom more. His high standards show here and director Joseph Kosinski, who's body of work (including previous Tom Cruise collaboration Oblivion) would never suggest he would deliver something of this caliber, has certainly left a mark demonstrating his action filmmaking capability. This is a movie likely to go down as THE blockbuster of the summer, even amidst major releases like Jurassic World: Dominion, Thor, and Bullet Train. Film goers looking for an exciting, action packed good time in the theater need look no further.",

            "content": "(If you haven't seen the first movie,, you obviously didn't grow up in the 80s or 90s.Do yourself a favor and watch it first.)Pete Mitchell, call-sign Maverick, has spent over 30 yrs as a pilot in the U. S. Navy. He has received numerous combat medals, as well as citations, and does everything he can not to get promoted beyond the rank of Captain (bc he doesn't want to be grounded). He currently works as a test pilot for military warcrafts. After disobeying a direct order from his Admiral (portrayed by Ed Harris), and reaching Mach 10 (!!!) in the special war aircraft he was testing,, Maverick receives orders to return to TOP GUN!!Upon arriving at the naval training center, Maverick is told that he was recommended by Admiral Kazanski (Iceman) for this special op. He'll have 3 wks to train the schools top graduates to fly an impossible mission.The 12 top pilots (all about the same age as Maverick when he came to Top Gun) arrive to the base, and one of them just happens to be Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw,, Goose's son. (If you still don't know who Goose is, he was Maverick's co-pilot, best friend, brother from another mother, etc,, who died while ejecting from the cockpit of their plane as it spun out of control)(GO WATCH the first movie!!) As soon as Rooster sees Maverick, he's obviously (to the viewer) not happy to be flying under his command. (Later, we find out that Maverick pulled Rooster's papers/applications from flight school. Setting him back 4 yrs. Maverick did this at the behest of Rooster's dying mother.) Will Rooster forgive Maverick?Will Maverick be able to teach the pilots what they need to know to complete and survive the mission?I remember seeing the teaser for this over a year ago, and my first thought was \"No!\" Why are the just now making a sequel?!? Why are they dredging this up only to make some terrible sequel in the 2020s (so far,, I haven't been a fan of this decade). Well,,, I couldn't have been more WRONG. This is the EXACT kind of summer blockbuster our country needs right now. American fighting men and women in the US Navy taking it to the enemy!!Cruise, despite his abnormal ideas, is an iconic movie star and he brings it better than ever in this one. Where Maverick was a hot shot pilot in the first movie (yes, pun intended seeing as how the first Hot Shot movie was a parody of Top Gun 1986), this movie sees him as that guy with several more decades of living and loss under his belt, and rather than thinking mostly of himself, his main concern is teaching these pilots how to survive their mission.Val Kilmer, despite losing his voice to throat cancer, brought a lot to the scene he appears in as well.The younger cast members couldn't have been better imo. Miles Teller has always impressed me, and I really bought that he could've been Goose's son in this.Not to mention,, Jennifer Connelly!!! Wow she was great as Maverick's love interest. Jean Louisa Kelly plays Iceman's wife, and she was great as well. (Two beauty's who only get better looking with time,,, \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d)I didn't think a sequel coming in 36 yrs after the original could possibly be good, but I'm glad to say that this surpassed the original (and that's really saying something) by a good bit.",

The level of skill it took to achieve what they did with this movie cannot be understated.This movie was an absolute blast. The romance was a bit corny but it gave you that 80s vibe.

            "content": "This is an excellent example of why so many legacy sequels have failed. So many movies nowadays take the \"next generation\" approach to their storytelling, that our heroes that we loved years ago serve no other purpose except to train the younger people and then die. When it was announced that Star Wars sequels were coming, I told my family that there's only one thing I want to see, and that's Luke Skywalker as a peak force user and Jedi. But Disney gave us none of that, and instead, Luke's only purpose was to train Rey for a few days and then die. It wasn't until The Mandalorian that my wish was finally fulfilled. This is the trap that legacy sequels fall into. They take the things we loved and burn them to make something new. Top Gun: Maverick does not do that. It is set up like that and is about Maverick training the next generation, but make no mistake, Maverick is in the title because this is a story about Maverick. He is the hero of this movie, not any of the kids we don't care about. That was so refreshing to see. This is a legacy sequel that knows what we want to see. Rather than trying too hard to create something new, it gives us more of what we loved so much about the first one (in addition to giving us something new). Hopefully people learn from this example. Beyond my thoughts about the movie conceptually, it's a fantastic movie. I highly recommend watching the behind the scenes features where they explain how Tom put the actors through a flight training program and guided people through the choreography. It's fascinating. As a result of what they did, the flight scenes feel so exhilarating. I'm not one for praising movies for being authentic or historically accurate, but in this case, the authenticity actually makes the experience more exciting, as if you're flying the aircraft. It's a filmmaking marvel. The soundtrack is great, and I love how Hans Zimmer wove Lady Gaga's song into the soundtrack. The heartfelt moments are earned and work really well. You care about the characters. The movie has one small issue, which is that the Penny plot dragged a bit. She really didn't need to be there. If Penny showed up in the first movie, I would've felt differently, but this is a character that came out of a quick throwaway line that we're supposed to care about. Luckily, while I think it's a waste, it's not annoying, so it doesn't hurt my rating.",

As I have often said sequels often are slightly poorer than the original but in this case I would say it is better which has only been seen in a few examples in film history (Godfather 2, Superman 2).The flight scenes are more thrilling and you can feel the action and the forces endured by the pilots.The cast do an admirable job and the spirit of the original film directed by the late Tony Scott is upheld by director Joseph Kosinski in several scenes.The film doesn't feel like a cheesy musical montage, more edge of your seat action.",

The flying sequences are the best anyone has ever seen on celluloid, the story is a clever one, which I won't spoil, but is full of little surprises.

I enjoy the '86 film for the MTV/Bruckheimer relic that it is (I mean this respectfully) but this is easily the superior movie. Its themes and performances are what I suspect will hold up on the small screen when the thrills are diminished.That said,This is pure Summer escapism that excels on a sensory level; the finest aerial footage I've ever seen and the sound design to support it. My theater wasn't even an IMAX and I was absolutely floored by the dogfights. That these stunts were largely in-camera is astonishing and it speaks to Joseph Kosinski as a filmmaker.

It's difficult to explain the feeling, but I never knew I was capable of feeling this way.When Maverick's flying, the seats are shaking and the sound is booming. It looks stunning and knowing that Tom Cruise is actually in the cockpit makes it so much better. Tom Cruise's dedication is something else. He put the other actors through a pilot training course and teached them how to direct themselves in the cockpit. Whatever projects Tom Cruised has touched in recent years has turned out to be absolute gold. Entertainment does not get better than this.Tom Cruise and Miles Teller put on a show. Phenomenal acting from both. Teller was the perfect casting for Maverick's deceased best friend's son. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is more than just breathtaking action. It's about family and legacy. Tom Cruise waited for the perfect script until he made the sequel, and it was well worth the wait. It's a beautiful story with layered and realistic characters, which will make you wonder who's shredding onions in the theater. Some moments are predictable, but that doesn't ruin anything.Don't think, DO watch this movie in theaters. It is quite the ride.

Great work on screenplay by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie.Musical scoring and new-theme vocals by Lady Gaga added to the marvels of \"Top Gun: Maverick\". Lorne Balfe, Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer, and Lady Gaga all brought this title to life through sound.Claudio Miranda's cinematography was excellent. Eddie Hamilton's editing was noteworthy. Amazing soundtracks as well. Jeremy Hindle's production design was great. The set decoration and hair-makeup teams also did amazing work. Marlene Stewart's costume design was relevant and evocative. The stunts and VFX crews did superb work.Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, was the heart and soul of this movie. Anyone else in the role would have botched it, in my opinion. Cruise gave fans quite the show, and he was every bit as memorable as we wished he would be. He did most of his own stunts in \"Maverick\" - huzzah for that.Penny Benjamin, played by Jennifer Connelly, was a wonderful 'comeback replacement' for Charlie, who was played by Kelly McGillis in the original. Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, played by Miles Teller, was amazing. Adm. Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, played by Val Kilmer - yet another comeback - was great, but received little screentime.Adm. Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson, played by Jon Hamm, was great. Adm. Solomon \"Warlock\" Bates, played by Charles Parnell, was good. Wo-1.

They maintained a 'true to tradition' feel by not performing irrelevant character de-aging. The titular character made a power-comeback to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, aka Top Gun, but with an interesting twist as to his responsibilities. The script gave fans everything they expected, and then some.In keeping with progress, I liked how they covered the need for unmanned drone programs and machines that could touch Mach 10, and over. That said, in keeping with the pride of fighter-pilot history, I liked how Tom Cruise made sure the Top Gun program came through, despite military pressure to sideline it.The idea of foreign uranium-enrichment toward nuclear power gains further added to the plot's significance, especially considering ongoing current affairs. I'm sure this script-element was a nod to what is happening in Iran - specifically, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) - but the writers were clever in avoiding direct mention of it.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" was 'danger zone' gold, and nothing can convince me otherwise. Military drama met high-standards combat pilot training in this heartfelt and unforgettable remake that not only lived up to its hype but delivered one of the best remakes in recent years.Part of me is glad that Jerry Bruckheimer had a hand in this production, and got to see its brilliance while he is still alive. The man gave cinema some of its biggest titles, so it was only fitting to watch him pull another rabbit out of his hat, or should I say another maverick.If you don't cry at the end of this movie, chances are you didn't see the original, or you were watching an entirely different title.",

Tom, aka Maverick of course and Val Kilmer, aka Iceman. Val has a minor role here since he has been battling throat cancer in his real life.

Jennifer plays an old-and possibly new-girl friend that runs a bar that pilots usually hang out in and Miles, aka Rooster plays one of the trainees Tom is training and he is also the son of Anthony Edwards, aka Goose from the original movie. There are lots of flying battles, both the training and against the bad guys, and there is no CGI or green screen used during these ariel shots. The actors were in real planes, filming themselves flying, after going through real training to make it look authentic-and it does.

            "content": "It's a by the numbers sequel where Maverick, who supposedly got over Goose's death by throwing his dog tags into the sea, didn't. By the end of the movie it felt like I'd watched a very long comic book. A comic book that is politically correct and where even the American characters who aren't particularly nice aren't all that bad.Maverick has to train a group of hot shots while staying under the radar of a rule following Admiral who believes the day of the pilot is over and that autonomous drones are the answer to modern air warfare.The mission is to bomb an Iranian nuke site - a mission perfect for autonomous drones.So despite only lasting two months as a Top gun instructor, and being a maverick, Maverick is selected to teach a group of young pilots to carry out the mission. He teaches his team by individually shooting each one of them down in training, having them play football at the beach and telling them how difficult the mission will be - while fighting his PTSD.Despite the unreal action - Maverick treats the US Navy like his own private flying club, flying between two aircraft flying it tight formation, then spiralling towards the ground with Goose's son in the other plane - this is a slow movie.The action comes toward the end, but as America is great and Iran is bad, we don't have much to worry about. Even the enemy 5th generation fighters decide to give up their advantage of stealth and decide to engage Maverick visually.To me it felt like this film lacked the character development, twists surprises and story. So much money, time and effort has been put into a movie which is more an echo of the first, rather than being a sequel with its own kind of magic.",

I was right back there watching this one. The flight footage was just as fantastic and the story, well, yes, the cheesiness was right there with the first one. The over-the-top bravado of all the pilots was as cliche' as could be and yet, there I was dabbing my damn eyes at the outcome.If you are younger and you haven't seen the first one, watch it before seeing this. It will make the ride much more enjoyable.I am looking forward to seeing it again and in today's era of movies, that is a shocking thing for me to say.",

            "content": "Maverick is just a really great movie. Other than the amazing visuals, it doesn't do anything too special. In fact, that's kinda the point. It does what every action drama tries to do but actually does it well.It made me realise something about cliches. They're not annoying simply because they're overdone. In fact, now I don't even think that's the issue. It's because cliches are often done with no skill or sincerity.Maverick has all the cliched moments you could expect in such a movie. The tension between young and old, men and women and tough and quiet guys, the guy who breaks all the rules and the higher ups whose blood pressure increases as a result, the suspenseful action scenes where characters could die at any moment, the smartarse comments, the teary memories, various comedic moments, etc. But all of them work and they work really well. They feel fresh despite being familiar. Why? Because it's done well and it's done with sincerity, not obligation or sappiness.Where Maverick excels is the gorgeous flight shots. Cruise apparently insisted on doing everything for real, Nolan style (they should really collaborate), and it shows, big time. I really feel like I've never seen a movie quite like this. That aspect felt like it was truly pushing the bar for movies as an art form. You CAN make realistic and amazing action scenes without it devolving into frantic, messy cutting and a predictable plot.I'd like to see this approach with other kinds of events. As in, the same level of attention to detail, respect for characters and themes, etc. This is easily the best dogfight movie of all time. It has raised the game. Like The Dark Knight raised superhero movies, for example.It's funny, I gave Top Gun only 4/10. I really didn't like it. It was kinda boring. I couldn't follow the action. I didn't care much about the characters. And there were lame, dated 80s songs throughout. But now I feel like I should rewatch it at some point. Even if just to understand this movie a bit more.Overall, I found Maverick riveting from start to finish. I really cared about the characters and the themes resonated deeply with me. Breaking the rules in the right way, you might say. Righting wrongs from the past. Staying true to yourself. Transcending expectations. Trusting your instincts.The music was good, the acting was good, the story was solid, though fairly simple. The strength is the amazing aerial cinematography and the countless gripping moments throughout. It all meant something. There's no flab. And it doesn't shy away from tough questions. I truly didn't know what would happen in the climax - and I cared! That's how movies should be!I really like the Ace Combat series of games for Playstation and this movie reminded me of them. The mission actually makes sense. And the movie makes it *really clear* what has to happen and how difficult it is. It also gives us a sense of the dangers involved but also a sense that it might be possible. It all ramps the tension way up for the big finale.Two final things. During the action, you can really clearly see what's going on. It's easy to follow. You feel like you're right up there with them - because they really are up there! And the action just keeps delivering. It had every right to end at various points, but it just keeps going on. It's not good, it's great. It's a really, really great movie. I can't wait to see it again!",

            "review_title": "Very basic by the numbers, but great flying",
            "content": "Good sequel, but plays it way too safe.In a modern day where Hollywood is trying to reboot everything and modernize it so much that they remove all the simple brutal atmospheres of years ago it's nice that we finally get a proper sequel faithful to the universe of the past. Characters have not lazily been replaced for representation or to add popular young stars. We get Tom Cruise flying and fighting himself. Without this the movie just wouldn't work as it would be a reboot. We also get the same beats as in the original. To a degree where it feels like a remake at times. But they refer back to the original story that was quite a spectacular movie which makes this movie so much better as it feels like things matter. Because the new guys need time to grow on us. You can't just replace characters and think we will like the new ones automatically. Instead the movie relies on nostalgia and just builds on top of what the first one did while adding a bit new to it. Pretty smart idea.We get fast flying, proper training for the dangerous mission, and Maverick doing stupid stuff in the air while being the best pilot around. Pretty cool. Especially the mission has some great dog fights. The movie knows what it needs to do. On the other hand it plays it extremely safe. It's basically the same story repeated and the scenes are rapidly flashing in front of our eyes. We seldom follow characters around. Scenes just come and go in short moments and we jump from location to location often even missing key decisions and events. Clearly this was a 3 hour long movie and script they cut down to 2 hours. This also means we are missing quite a bit of the storyline. They also lazily try to force in a terribly done romance that was unbearably cringe to watch. You need something for the women too, but at least make it well. This was clearly just plastered in to entice another part of the audience. For me it made the movie quite a bit worse. In the original the romance worked because it was part of the story not just outside the story.Overall it was a fun watch. But it's a very basic action movie. There is not much dependence on acting, emotions, depth, relationships. It's some flying and the most cliche scenes you can imagine. The high quality flying on screen is groundbreaking though. We don't see this level of flying in other movies. You really feel like you are flying with them at times. Which really does make and save the movie. But in 1 week I will have forgotten much of the plot as it's just not that interesting or important. We for example never see the face of any enemy and never really see any conclusion to the pilots or their careers. They also don't have personal lives. I figured there would be some girlfriends and wives. Maybe some kids. Nope, zero of that anywhere. Just people who are good at flying. Right, that's fine, but you need to show us they are real people. You already put in a female pilot on this top team. Something that is not seen in real life. So do something with this character. Instead she is just a pilot. She could have been a man and nothing much would change except for a few jokes. They could have made her date someone and let us care so much more about her life. Maybe she has a son at home and has just started to date another pilot. That would make it more emotional. Instead they are just ... people. Just good at flying. It should have been more. But for a sequel it's way better than expected.",

Cruise is now a top trainer for a new dashing young crew, but of course they figure out a way to reference the Edwards character and also bring back Kilmer for a key cameo. The second half of the film is given over to combat with an unidentified enemy country leading to bombing raids and the like at the climax. The aerial scenes are beautifully filmed and probably the most realistic ever depicted on screen; I just wish they had more substance to go with them.",

            "review_title": "Already saw it 61 times in cinemas; 28 in IMAX! This is my most-watched movie in cinemas now!",
            "content": "I first saw the original Top Gun only back a few days ago, knowing that this film is a great blockbuster, I couldn't agree more. Better yet, I couldn't believe with what I saw with my own pair of eyes. A 1986 film succeeded in doing spectacular stunts and you couldn't tell if whether they had used CGI or not.36 years later, Top Gun Maverick comes land into cinemas and oh my God, I literally had an orgasm witnessing the entire repertoire of Tom Cruise and his wingmen. They have done it again, and this time it's better and badder!The engine kicks in with a similar reading card with 1986's Top Gun, only now they add the word 'men & women' which I feel is like a tribute for all fighter pilots in our current world. What comes next is similar to what came in the original, mirroring scenes but now with a touch of modern trends and technological advancements. From then onwards, my mind goes that this film will be a homage to the original, copying scene after scene but... I was wrong. They did mirror certain scenes but that's about it, suffice to bring back memories of the original which was exactly what I wanted.What I like about this sequel is that it's not a film made for cash grab sake. It has a story to tell, a continuation to follow and a heart to making this an excellent film. It doesn't fall into the trap of most commercial films nowadays. The story flows like water, jumping from one plot point to another without feeling forced or doing it just for the sake of doing it. Yes, the major plot might be a bit gimmicky but the things that surround the plot that make the film feels authentic and rich with contexts.Is it an action-packed film? Absolutely. It's not only full of actions but you'll be at the edge of your seat, full-on adrenaline rush, pumping all your juicy hormones as you witness all the practical effects done by Tom Cruise and the team. This film is much more intense than watching a horror film. You will not be comfortable seating at your seat, and that's a compliment for this movie. Remember when you saw Mission Impossible 6: Fallout? That final mission where Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill were in a helicopter showdown? Yes, if you like that & if you still remember how high the level of cortisol you experienced, Top Gun will be similar especially during the final 30 minutes. Yes, that final act that will suck your air out, making you gasp and grip your seat as hard as possible. That breathtaking moment that will make you shake your head and hands, trying to dissociate yourself with the scene but couldn't as you can't take your eyes off the screen.To pile on the good notes, they also brought back some of the previous characters, mainly our favourites, not as a mere fan service but to also help drive the story forward, showing where they are now and what they had gone through all these times.Tom Cruise as Maverick is both attractive and captivating. It's hard to imagine anyone playing Maverick, so kudos to the Casting Director of the original for predicting that Cruise is the only one that is able to perform all these stunts... practically. I still couldn't wrap my head around his bravery and courage especially after seeing all the stunts, even professionals might not be able to do what he does. It's beyond your expectation and understanding. Just mindblowing!Let's not forget the amazing new members joining Maverick. They all did an awesome job and salute to all of them, bringing their respective characters to life. My favourite is definitely Hangman, played by the charismatic and charming Glen Powell. He's like a hybrid between Maverick & Iceman. I also love Phoenix who puts on a nice touch to women empowerment. Rooster, held by Miles Teller is engaging, he's the centre of the story that is important for Maverick.Talk about Rooster, I appreciate all the relationships they put in into the script. They're a lot of chemistry sparks produced between characters; Maverick & Penny, Rooster & Maverick, Hangman & Rooster, Phoenix & Bob etc. And these sparks are strong enough insofar that we care about all these characters. It will set you on a journey of what it means to have a family and a group of friends that love you dearly.The element of brotherhood in this is so strong, it's also the highlight of the film. I applause that because the sparks work, the brotherhood between characters in this also works wonderfully well. You might dislike some characters at the beginning, but you'll grow to love them by the end. I did hold back my tears at the end when I see all the things we want from a brotherhood, but my Gosh, I would have cried if I were watching it alone.Top Gun Maverick respects its audience as they craft a story that gives a hint of what's to come/ending, only to realize later that you have been tricked as the story goes along. They know you're an intelligent audience and they respect you for that hence, they know you'll be able to predict its ending. So don't get shocked if your prediction took a wrong turn later on. Why? Because the script is already two steps ahead of you.If I would highlight on what they could improve, I feel that they could have paced their story a bit better during the first 30 minutes. It takes a bit of a time for audience to fully immerse in the story, probably because of the urgent introduction they need to serve for the new characters.The other thing is that yes, the cinematography in this is off the roof! It's extremely riveting everytime they're in the sky however, seldom they are times when the camera crop is off putting, like that one scene where they're playing volleyball, everything is perfecto from the thirst trap element \ud83d\ude02, One Republic's chill-vibe song to the perfect sunbathing but the scene falls short when we can't really see the ball throwing and catching up in the air as the camera crops the part where they need to be showing that, taking out the fun factor a bit.All in all, we need to have more Hollywood summer films like this. The one that is wholesome, knows no boundaries, respect the audience's intelligence and gives out a highly entertainment value for all.Verdict: 3 years worth the wait, Top Gun Maverick is a giant-sized blockbuster film that aims for the sky and successfully reaches to an altitude only a few could do so. Better than the original, this sequel is the real definition of high-octane, adrenaline rush & edge-of-your-seat viewing that pays tribute to the original while also respecting all the esteemed crews.",

Basically the whole love story I felt took away instead of added to the original movie.Well this one corrected all of the discrepancies and comments I had about the first. The love interest actually added a layer of dimension to Maverick in a way that fit well within the time and plot but didn't get lost in replacing it. There were definitely some call backs and a few easter egg like nostalgic things sprinkled through out this movie that actually fit and felt natural without being just an obvious nostalgic piece. That's why I would consider this a great stand alone movie as well. Take away the obvious callbacks and change the title and character names and this would be a great movie on its own! It has substance, a plot, character development, dynamic supporting plots, and it felt more fluid in it's delivery and purpose. I really enjoyed this movie and of course the little soundtrack throwbacks as well! It was way more than just a nostalgic cash grab, or follow-up sequel. It was a really solid movie that was entertaining to watch from start to finish. I would and probably will rewatch it again at some point.

            "content": "Entertaining for its stunning aerial scenes, but this is too much of a big Hollywood production for my taste, and it's problematic besides. I wish there had been some sense of realism, but this is escapist fantasy, and felt at times like a Tom Cruise vanity project. It was nice seeing his character, Maverick, as an old-timer, facing the days when drones may replace his kind, and being mocked (initially) by the young hot shots. The nearly impossible mission he is meant to train them for looks a little like a trip to blow up the Death Star and it's as contrived as hell, but it's suitably thrilling. Why not just use a drone strike or those tomahawk missiles that can clearly reach the target though? Aside from those kinds of issues, the film is predictable and cheesy as a whole, and in the subplots involving his old buddy's son (Miles Teller) and a love interest (Jennifer Connelly). The twelve pilots recruited for the mission check all kinds of diversity boxes, but none of the characters is developed in a meaningful way.Worse, however, is the underlying feeling I got of propaganda for the American military. The group of fighter pilots who are led by a guy who disobeys orders routinely are oddly positioned as the underdogs despite America's enormous annual military budget, and plan a strike against an unnamed enemy that sure seems like Iran. There are all sorts of American fantasies going on here: the renegade who just does what he wants and it all works out, the need for preemptive strikes around the world, the need for more of these wonderful planes from Lockheed Martin instead of something like, oh, health care, and the superiority of its people (after all, \"it's not the plane, it's the pilot\"). There is not even a thought as to who this generic, faceless enemy is, or the moral implications of the mission. After all, we wouldn't want to have to think too much, or be conflicted. It wants to be all wrapped up in a neat little package, the American Empire still dominant and making the world a safer place, when we should be understanding it's far more complicated than that.Yes, I know, but the scenes of those jets are incredible.",

So self-aware, in fact, that the line \"don't think, just do\" gets repeated three times.So ultimately, what we have here is a cast of really bad dudes with more testosterone than they know what to do with flexing their masculine bravado with lines about how they can fly airplanes better than anybody else can fly airplanes, right before exhilarating sequences in which they practice flying airplanes better than everybody else flies airplanes, culminating in a spectacular final forty minute sequence in which they all fly airplanes better than everybody else can fly airplanes, and along the journey they play a sweaty skins vs skins sport on the beach so they can learn how to get along. And that's it, that's the movie, it doesn't try to be anything more than that, and it turns out it doesn't need to be anything more than that, because it succeeds so overwhelmingly in its endeavor to be the best possible version of exactly that.",

Almost impossibly good considering he at his age would probably fall short on the physical compared to the younger pilots. He just Slaps!!!However, for such a Honorary Pilot, all his higher ranking commanders all talk to him like hes dirt.Jealousy? No.Its clear he does not want to go up any further then he has. So to make this a perfect movie, I think they could have written his Commanders to be a little kinder. They could have scripted it in such a way that they are 'only doing their jobs'.

The consistency of the staged story with the first part of the film gave the film a character of enthusiasm and was overshadowed by the memories of\nyear 1986. Tom Cruise is a wonderful actor and offers a lot through acting in his films. I think he is the type who makes the film and the filming staffs an important part of his life. That is why we see his creativity in his films even at this age. I'm sure this film will ne nominated for several Oscars for video editing and soundtrack, because of its wonderful effects.",

            "content": "After years of delays, Top Gun: Maverick finally flies onto screens better than ever. \"Better than ever,\" as in, possibly greater than its predecessor in 1986. As a movie that relies naturally on the technological advancements behind the aircraft used in the film, of course the Top Gun series progresses to new literal and figurative heights in its highly anticipated sequel. The film perfectly evokes a sense of nostalgia,without getting distracted by the past. In addition, it gives us a lot to focus on in the runway ahead. Tom Cruise promised if he ever made a Top Gun sequel, the flying of F/A-18 aircrafts (the primary aircraft used in the film) would be completely real. Mr. Cruise completely delivered on that promise to new boundaries the viewers aren't ready for.Following the events from Top Gun in 1986, Top Gun: Maverick picks up with the iconic characters 36 years later. The story starts with Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) as his career flying planes has slowed down. He no longer works with the Top Gun academy, and helps a local Navy facility test advanced aircraft. When his charisma impedes his judgment (like always), Maverick destroys a highly expensive government aircraft. Soon after, Maverick is given an ultimatum; he can either be grounded by the Navy and never fly again, or he can go back to the Top Gun academy and teach a group of young pilots how to complete a highly dangerous mission. Later he goes toe to toe with his greatest challenge, providing closure to the son of his deceased best friend Goose.In present day Hollywood, every film is trying to perfect the art of CGI and make it look as real as it could be. The beauty behind Top Gun: Maverick is the actual lack of CGI itself. The film doesn't need to \"look\" real, because it already is real. Tom Cruise is known for completing his own stunts, and 100% upped his game by having the entire cast do theirs as well. Every actor playing a pilot went through months of diligent training, learning the ins and outs of flying F/A-18 aircrafts. The amount of effort provided by the actors to master aviation for the film is quite possibly unlike anything any actor has done before.With a film that consistently performs death-defying stunts, it can be inferred that Top Gun: Maverick is incredibly intense. To add on to the layer of intensity, the film often engages with long action sequences (involving cursing and heavy violence.) Comedic relief often pops up at random times to lighten mood, which creates a nice blend of thrills and humor. Since a large part of the story is about Maverick's relationship with the son of his deceased friend Goose, a theme of closure is prominent throughout the film. The film also provides the moral that relationships can be repaired no matter the wall between them.Top Gun: Maverick soars far past all expectations, really redefining the definition of stunts in present day Hollywood. I give Top Gun: Maverick 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults. You can find Top Gun: Maverick flying onto your local theater on May 27, 2022.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick - Mid 9/10This movie takes a simple idea of mentorship to the max. This film deserves all the praise for being an excellent movie and an incredible sequel. In the art of filmmaking, execution is critical in keeping the audience hooked, and Maverick successfully did it from start to finish. There are three things the movie successfully executed, its visuals, characters, and nostalgia.First, the visuals; Maverick made sure to make this one of the coolest movies ever. They ensured all their jet scenes were top-of-the-line, from actual footage of real-life jets to excellent compositing of digital planes. The movie makes you believe you are watching a real-life mission. This movie is stunning, even the shots without the aircraft. The scenes on the beach can signify good times, like when the pilots play football, or uncertainty and sadness when Maverick tells Penny he's going on a mission. Props to the director for keeping the visuals consistent throughout the film's entire runtime.Second, the characters; this movie makes sure to highlight essential characters but give secondary characters their distinct characterization, signifying their justification for being part of the movie. I'll mention one example, the pilots. The first film only characterizes the important pilots, while the rest are just not doing anything. But Maverick makes all the pilots important by first showing them their nicknames and the goal of picking the best of the best. Although the pool scene shows the main pilots that the film will highlight, the rest of the pilots aren't just useless bags of nobody. They play a role in the story, and although minor, they mark themselves as actual characters in the story.Last but not least is nostalgia; this entire film is built upon one factor of the previous movie. That Maverick's old partner, Goose, died; in this movie, he's dealing with the conflict he has with Goose's only son, Rooster. This idea is the core conflict of the film. There may be an evil army, but the movie is more about the conflict of a family that isn't by blood. The movie also builds up legacy characters. In the first movie, we see Maverick as the cockiest pilot, but in this movie, we see him still cocky, but time has made him wiser and more meticulous. Even Iceman was essential for Maverick's arc and the arc of the audience that people may come and go, but what's important is what they left behind.And in that sense, Maverick has left behind a symbol where sequels of old franchises can work if it is built upon execution. My only issue with this movie is the lack of expounding of the pilots finally being as a team and Hangman's arc. This movie may not be perfect as a solo film, but it's an excellent sequel. Where audiences old and new can connect and embrace movies that can bring out the youth of everyone by being awesome and profound at the same time. It shows Hollywood can make good blockbusters if the right people are placed.",

After the latest incident, he's brought back to Top Gun to prepare the best flyers for a dangerous mission. Iceman (Val Kilmer) is now an admiral and pulled the strings to bring him on board. One of the flyers happens to be Gooses' son, Lt. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller). Maverick reconnects with old flame Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). Adm. Beau 'Cyclone' Simpson (Jon Hamm) is in charge and has no respect for Maverick.This is Tom Cruise, for good and for ill. Sure it's a sequel full of sequel goodness with respect to Goose and Iceman. More than anything, this is Tom Cruise. It's his personality. It's his cinematic persona. He's teaching the young ones on action movies and no matter what, he is still better than anybody there. This is Tom Cruise doing Tom Cruise. I really had fun with it initially but it got a little thin towards the end. I thought he may push it over the top by doing the ultimate sacrifice to close out the franchise. It would be the edgier choice but probably not the right business choice for Tom. He knows how to work a franchise. In this modern business environment, one doesn't throw away a franchise like this. As for the other actors, I would switch out Jon Hamm with a lesser known actor. Miles Teller is very good although I have another suggestion, Meg Ryan's real life acting son Jack Quaid. Jennifer Connelly looks hot and is relatively age appropriate. She's as good as any of his other romantic partners other than his real life partner. Iceman's deterioration is a little shocking but Val Kilmer has been that way for some time now.

            "content": "Top Gun Maverick (2022) :\nMovie Review -Top Gun (1986) was a film that gave Tom Cruise a new image and a large following. It was a trendsetter for him, and probably the only second action film that got him a cult following for years after the Mission Impossible series. Tony Scott's aerial action drama was a huge hit at the box office, and people were wondering why the sequel wasn't made for years. Late sequels are usually considered unworthy, but there are a few exceptions. Now I can say, late sequels aren't worthy enough, unless it's Top Gun Maverick kind of stuff. The Top Gun sequel is too late, but it is worth the wait. I wasn't even born when Top Gun was released, but I have seen the film multiple times on TV. I recently saw it again to prepare for the sequel, and I can say out loud that the sequel has surpassed the first film. It exceeds all expectations, including the demand for scripts and advanced technologies. The age gap is filled very smartly and all the modern mass elements are put together nicely. Rather, I'd say, the action mania is much bigger and better than its predecessor.Test pilot Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell has purposely dodged an advancement in rank to continue flying after thirty-six years of service. He is summoned to train a detachment of TOPGUN graduates for a specialised mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen. Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: \"Rooster,\" the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka \"Goose.\" Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it. He meets Penny (Jennifer Connelly), a single mother, and starts a new love affair. With the help of Rooster, Penny, and other team members at Top Gun, Maverick eyes achieving an impossible mission.Top Gun Maverick fulfils all the demands of the script, challenging the disadvantages of the late sequel. Usually, the late sequels go wrong with the main characters because they damage the main source material. With Top Gun Maverick, however, the scene is different. Peter Craig and Justin Marks take care of the writing department like a newborn child. They keep the essence alive and do not harm the main character. Even the new characters aren't bad at all. The entire team is fresh and looks like a perfect fit for the new story. However, the character of Penny spoils the rhythm a bit. What happened to Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the previous love interest of Maverick? Had they given a proper explanation to that character, I think I would have loved Penny's characters even better. The second bad thing about the film is its overuse of cinematic liberty on a few occasions. You can't accept a person to be clean and alive after his jet is shot high up there. Anyway, let's not give away any spoilers. The screenplay has a turbo speed and the overall writing still clarifies the mission in a foggy atmosphere.Tom Cruise, the ageless fella. What charisma he has, especially with this character. It's a tailor-made role, and he measures all the corners perfectly. The new Maverick will make you fall in love with Tom Cruise again, and all that previous nostalgia will fade away this time. He sets the bar high this time, not just as an actor but as an on-screen persona too. I will never forget Miles Teller for his outstanding performance in Whiplash (2014), and recently he amazed me again with \"The Offer\" (2022). He plays a very predictable character here, who is in the backseat most of the time. This does not count as one of his finest roles, but he's not a big letdown either. Jennifer Connelly looks gorgeous, not better than Kelly McGillis, of course, but let's just forget that deliberated 'love interest character' for the sake of cinematic mass appeal. The roles of Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman and Ed Harris are well written and well executed. Val Kilmer may make you emotional with his cameo, while Lewis Pullman, Monica Barbaro, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis and Danny Ramirez have got nothing new to offer, but fairly decent, indeed.What takes Top Gun Maverick a notch higher is the big-screen extravaganza. The action spectacle is brilliantly shot and tremendously well edited. The aerial action scenes are truly breathtaking, whereas the background score literally stops your heartbeat for a moment. Watching Top Gun (1986) in today's time certainly makes it look updated, but the action sequences in this sequel are designed in such a way that you will enjoy watching them even after 10 years. Yes, there are a few cliches, the comeback and all, but it's a mass market product afterall.Joseph Kosinski's previous outing with Tom Cruise - \"Oblivion\" (2013), came out as a terrible film. So, Top Gun Maverick is a terrific improvement for them. Joseph has a commendable job while dealing with the pressure of the sequel, nostalgia, and new-age improvisation. Top Gun Maverick is a top-class sequel for all the Top Gun and Tom Cruise fans out there, and the biggest credit goes to director Joseph Konsinski for that. He gambles with the idea of an aged legacy teaching something to new blood, and delivers an action-packed, blockbuster sequel by all means. Top Gun: Maverick is a big-screen experience that can't be missed. Do try to watch it in IMAX, and I'm sure it will be worth more than that expensive bowl of popcorn.RATING - 7/10*",

One that tells a great story, has great acting, doesn't get woke preachy, and you exit smiling, wanting more, and thinking about it for hours and sometimes days. This movie is one of those. A great flick. I do think that if you did not experience the Top Gun of the 80's in the 80's, then you might not experience the nostalgia that they obviously took advantage of - in a really good way. Regardless, Cruise and the entire crew should be proud. If Hollywood made more like this we'd spend alot more time (and money) in the theaters. I enjoyed every minute of it and am planning to go again, which I rarely do.",

The rest of the film is one giant cliche.The acting, the storyline, script and even underscore all seemed phoned-in to me. My biggest issue is how, once again, Cruise's character has to be overly propped/hyped up, just like in Top Gun, just like in A few Good Men, just like in the Mission Impossible series: his character has to be the best and most celebrated, which I find personally annoying, once again he plays the contrarian protagonists who we have to hear his resume over and over again, the new know-it-all macho pilots, the brooding son of a deceased pilot, the angry disgruntled CO, the underachieving nerd, the over-achieving female J. I. Jane, and of course the hot babe of which our hero has had history with, and has the overly mature teenager. Several times in the film someone's life gets saved in the split second nick of time by improbable actions, that we see coming a mile away. While the film is decently paced, the dialog exchange is slow and lumbered. One thing I DID like was the enemy is faceless which gives it a mysterious element, and a profound look at our humanity and our peace in the world. But aside from that, this isn't a film I need to see twice.",

I thought it was good, but for me it was rather forgettable. The 2nd reason was all the hype, especially a lot of people are so politically divisive these days they judge a movie purely base on political bias. However, this movie is definitely an amazing piece of work and it exceeded all my expectations.When I saw the 2 hour run time, I cringed. If you've read my reviews before, I'm extremely tough on run time and how smooth a movie flows. Most action films these days are 1 hr and 30 mins, to have a 2 hour run time you must have enough substance to drag it out and keep the people engaged. That's what this film did. It did not hold back the budget on the action and you'll get plenty of excitement through the film.The story paced well, even the drama element keeps you interested. The music was nostalgic, with an 80s feel and the cinematography was just unbelievable. It is a beautifully filmed movie that takes you on a 2 hour journey you'll not forget.As I've said, the 1st one was good, but I watched it once and haven't thought about it since. This one I believe is far superior in every way. That's also another thing I appreciate about this film, you do not really need to watch the 1st one to understand. They did an excellent job at writing the script so it is not dependent on the past. The last movie seems more of a reference and it makes you feel like this movie is the first movie and the 1980 one was a prequel written afterward. I think they call this a standalone sequel.10/10.",

Navy's top aviators, who, after more than thirty years of service, dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him, is approached for a career-defining mission. As a long anticipated sequel to one of the top ten box-office successes of the 1980s, it inevitably draws comparison with the original. The first film averaged out as mediocre; in the sky it flew, on the ground it faltered; aerial sequences were arresting, but back at base the pilot with a need for speed fought poor dialogue and a romantic pairing which produced little chemistry. Thirty-six years on, Top Gun Maverick averages out better as a stand-alone film. Some of the power undoubtedly came from viewers recalling Cruise's original appeal and use of the original film's striking soundtrack. The drama, while written thinly, is not quite as thick with American exceptionalism and competitive machismo as the original, and it eschews the macho posturing which made the original distinctive, if at times overweening. It has many of the hallmarks that made the original attractive without retreading the story. Although formulaic, familiar, routine, with plot twists that creak a little when it forces the story's envelope, it is an exhilirating action picture and has some outstanding aerial footage. A new theme, letting go of the past in order to move on, seems poignant and nostalgic, for Cruise as an actor seems to be looking in on his past to face his own advancing years; he is rolling back the years for a generation who recall their own youth. All in all, a film without pretension, a first rate cinematic experience.",

Then he receives news of a reassignment, to return to Top Gun school as an instructor. Interestingly, Tom Skerritt, who played Viper back then, was about 52 during filming. Cruise was about 58 or 59 here, playing an analogous role as the old veteran teaching the young kids the tricks of the jet fighting trade.My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay, a Redbox rental. Of course the picture is beautiful but the sound track is even more remarkable. The roar of the jet engines when planes took off actually shook our home theater room.Plus, the several \"extras\" on the disk are totally interesting, the no-compromise way the movie was made, including weeks of standard military training for the cast, to make sure they were ready for the rigors of real jet combat-type flying.

In this, my pet peeve was *everyone* still succumbing to Maverick's \"put on the brakes\" manouvre. As if nobody else had learned it in 36 years.Maverick reminds me of Star Wars (borrowing both the basic plot and visceral flying thrills). A great summer popcorn flick, steeped in nostalgia with tons of callbacks and a wonderfully ridiculous finale.YMMV: If you don't remember the original (or never watched it), there will be a ton of references that will be lost on you.

            "content": "Even though it has been out for a few weeks, I have now had the chance to watch Top Gun: Maverick and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set 30 years after the original film with Maverick having to teach a new group of recruits to give them the best chance of surviving a dangerous mission.Main Character\nTom Cruise is back as Maverick in one of his most iconic roles and he knocks it out of the park. This version of the character is really well realised, he still has that cocky bravado towards him but there is more pain to his role and he is thrust into this position that he is not completely comfortable with. This is one of his strongest performances over the last few years and it is great to see him really committed here.Supporting Characters\nMiles Teller plays Rooster, the son of Goose from the previous film and he is fantastic in the film. There is real heart to his performance and the dynamic between himself and Cruise is done really well in the film. It was probably my favourite part of the film and that is a credit to the two actors to deliver emotion to both of the characters. Jennifer Connolly plays Maverick's new love interest and I thought they worked really well together and it was just nice to see. She is a pretty cool character in her own right and it is a nice part of the film instead of being a boring side plot. Jon Hamm basically plays the military boss who disagrees with Maverick and though he is frustrating, Hamm does a really good job and he is a good contrast to Maverick in the film. All the young pilots are really great too and I can see big futures for their careers, especially Glenn Powell who plays Hangman. Probably one of the best parts of the film is seeing Val Kilmer reprise his role as Iceman, due to his real life illness it is difficult but I cant deny and say it is really well handled and adds plenty to the story.Story\nThe story is really well handled, it is way more serious then the original Top Gun and that was definitely the right root to take. There is a real raw emotion to the characters here and the situation they are put in, it feels like this group are training for a high stakes mission and the film did a great job of that. You really will care about them and want to see the twists and turns that the film is going to take.Script\nThe script is fantastic, the charm and humour that you would want from a Top Gun film is here. But it is the extra layer of emotion and care that rises it above, the characters are well written and the story is well crafted and built up well.Style\nThe films style is incredible, the flying scenes can now truly hit their true potential with todays technology and they are amazing. The cinematography is some of the best you will ever see and it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The film is also incredibly well paced and I was never bored with it being a brilliant film.Overall\nOverall, Top Gun Maverick is an Epic film and one of the best films in the last few years. It maybe the best sequel of an older film that has been made and this is a must watch for everybody in my opinion.",

I felt the first 45 minutes was a bit heavy on the corny and nostalgic side, and I had a hard time relating to the heteronormative of naval camaraderie, as well as the unabashed bravado of the pilots - men and women. However, the storyline is actually good (mission into enemy territory to destroy a uranium plant; which four pilots of the 10 candidates will be selected), and I feel this version separated itself from the first movie and found its own path in the last 45 minutes. Of course the ending paid tribute to the first Top Gun as a means to tie up the ribbon of nostalgia that threaded the entire experience. Overall I'll give it an 8 out of 10.

You get what is expected of a movie like this, but without a doubt the plus for this one is a super entertained, emotional and immersive film. The sound is great and the air sequences are exciting in a manner you can feel the passion , the excitement the pilot is feeling in their seat. I really loved the air sequences, cannot say right now another movie to highlight in that regard. Again, air sequences are fantastic. FANTASTIC. So real, so natural view, so immersive. Sound is great and of course IMAX is recommended. I loved the cast, all of them are nice and welcomed additions. There are some very emotional scenes that worth the ticket alone. Plot, is made to enjoy. Every bit. Lovely references to prior movie and superb cinematography. Music is good, however didn't find a new classic song for my particular taste, but maybe there is one for you. Super enjoyable product, the one that put you to search where to learn to fly. Absolutely recommended to see it in theaters. So IMMERSIVE experience that not even the best home theater will match. Well, if The Godfather had The Godfather 2, Top Gun has Top Gun Maverick.",

            "content": "Just an outstanding movie!Better by far than the original, with a vastly better script, and excellent acting. The production values are top shelf, including perhaps the most realistically portrayed in flight action ever recorded in a theatrical release.The script provides engrossing and entirely entertaining fare, from the funny to the serious, and manages to do it all without false pandering. It's serious, and yet still contains elements of pure fun.For anyone part of aviation, the efforts to record strictly in flight video, including inside the cockpits that the actors actually flew in, while the high-G maneuvers were flown, provided an element of reality that actual pilots can feel and appreciate.For example, no matter how tight you manage to get your five-point harness, you pull negative G's, you are going to float off your seat cushion -- precisely as all the actors did when they actually did it.The plot is pulled from very plausible modern day events, portraying events that could well happen. That is another part of the engrossing narrative. While the nationalities are officially neutral, it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots, especially when the final flying scenes are played out.In the end, the movie is pure entertainment, no holds barred, and magnificent in every single way. This is a must see movie, likely the best movie of the year.",

            "content": "Im going to keep this review as short as possible simply because it can be described in only word; Incredible. Tom Cruise has done it again. After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.After 36 years of the release of the first Top Gun movie, Tom Cruise keeps his steady form with a superb performance. To ensure top tier and quality performance, Tom demanded that the whole cast joins a 3 months training camp to prepare for this movie. The cast's commitment was evident in their great performance and amazing chemistry. The movie was so fun and entertaining to watch, especially the fight scenes in the sky. The minimal use of special effects and CGI was apparent, and I really liked that as not only did the scenes look real, they were actually real. Not to forget the funny bits scattered throughout and the amazing cinematography. The movie also referenced many things from the first movie while also being understandable to people who haven't watched that movie. In addition to that, the movie was super emotional especially towards the end where the movie really popped off.My only issue with this movie is that it was a bit slow-paced at the start, but the ending made me forget all about that.An incredibly amazing movie that I recommend to everyone (even if you haven't watched the first movie)",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick manages to do something that very few movies accomplish in these recent years, and that is to be better than the original movie.The movie picks up over a decade later than the previous one, Maverick is still the military, still putting his pilot skills to use. But as he's reminded of, he's part of a dying breed because one day there won't be any more need for pilots to actually pilot jet fighters. It's a reflection of our real world and how drones are now being used more and more often to carry out missions. However the movie also reminds people that the human factor is not entirely out of rhe picture. And that's where Maverick comes in.Given a last opportunity, given all his missed opportunities, he's tasked with training a new generation of pilots to execute a mission that requires pilots piloting real jet fighters, and even then there's no guarantee of success seeing these new generation of cocky pilots just can't cut it. Not at their level of knowledge, that is what Maverick does. He teaches them what is actually possible to do with a jet fighter.The movie chose the perfect cast for the job. They didn't tried to hide Tom Cruise age, if anything his character age and knowledge are what will make the mission even possible to be executable. Maverick knows he's made a lot of mistakes, he knows he has missed on a lot, and Tom Cruise in a particular scene with Val Kilmer (Iceman of the first movie) they perfectly give to the viewer what is easily one of the most emotional scenes not just in this movie, but other movies as well. Both Maverick and Iceman, didn't had the perfect life, but still a life worth living that gave them the perspective their younger selves didn't had. Although short, Val Kilmer participation was crucial so Tom Cruise character could reveal to the viewer the immense weight that he carries. Not just for his decisions but the decisions of others as well.Miles Teller perfectly landed his role as Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw. Son of Maverick best friend in the first movie Goose. The tension between him and Maverick is palpable, and both carry a lot of past they need to fix.Monica Barbaro was perfect as Phoenix. Showing she was as good of a pilot as any of her teammates, but above all she could remain cool and focused where her male teammates would many times let egos fly.Overall the cast was well balanced and each one add something to offer and teach the viewer.Although I don't believe in the perfect movie, this one is dam close to being one. It didn't forget who the recurring characters were, while also showing who they had become and why. The movie is well paced, not being too long or too short, it doesn't impose any political messages or agenda on the viewer and stands above all of that. It's fun, it's emotional, it's serious, all in the right amount at the right time. It closes the circle perfectly that began with the first movie, and shows that sequels still can surpass the original movie. Something that in these last 5 years, perhaps more, it seemed impossible. Given the number of sequels that failed completely to be sequels to the original movies.This movie is definitely a must see. Preferably see the first Top Gun and immediately jump to Top Gun: Maverick.",

With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller's Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit.The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook.That's it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film!Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original.",

It was a very good movie with lots of action and some humour and lots of scenes that will make you happy but also emotional. I thought they did a lot of call backs from the first movie and brought back some characters too. My only criticism is that in both movies they don't say who they are fighting which is kind of disappointing but I think they should just stop it at these two movies and not make a third as this one was a long waited movie in the making and does not need a third one even though I loved it. 9/10.",

The reason you would know this now is that they stop the entire movie down so Penny (Jennifer Connelly) and he can repeat each others' names like it was \"Candyman\" Wish I could say \"Top Gun: Maverick\" 5 times and get my 2 hours back. This movie is abysmal laugh inducing tripe. Let's get the pleasantries out first, cool dog fights.That's it.The rest is really wooden poorly acted lines. Which would be forgiving if it weren't for the fact that all they had to do was to deliver said line in a good way. Instead, these United Colors of Benetton sad sacks seem to blurt out the fun one-liners like it was...um...real? Horrid. In order to make that work, you need a Bill Paxton in there. Instead...ugh...these young Top Gun kids who look like they've never stepped foot in the military. Yes, I understand their direction...cologne ad for 2022. Tony Scott (rest his soul) was brilliant at making slick. They essentially stole all the b-roll from the original to re-construct the beginning. I would consider that insulting as this Kosinski cat is NOOOO Tony Scott. Scott was an artist, this dude just put wall paper over his painting.I think there's a lot of \"huh?\" moments. Like what is Penny doing at an admiral's funeral. Perhaps, there to support Maverick...sorry Pete. Or, I think if you eject at mach 10.3 you'd be vaporized. But I'm no engineer. See, Petey Pete Pete seems to sidestep...the odds. Don't get me started on them going through the \"two miracles\" that need to happen in order for them to \"Star Wars\" their way into TopGun lore. Not only Petey does it, the other ones do too. I believe you non-woke folk call it \"Mary Sue?\" Roll eyes and repeat.Also missing is the typical oo-rah bombast that came with Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer. These two made the 80's. Commercials that pretended to be movies. Yes, hollow, but still casted...you know...heavy hitting actors. They attempted this with dour yet hot school marm Penny (can't forget that name) to add depth. She's dull as mud. And kills the spirit of what Top Gun was about. Men with toys.That is what woke gets you. Miles Teller pretending to be a man. The fact that there was no mention of Kelly McGillis is maddening. Yeah, we know her slow decline into obscurity, but it's still really insulting not to include...something.Now I know at this point, the box office speaks. But it tells me society is sick and tired of Marvel and DC claiming the box office. If this is the beginning of a nicer blend of lack of message movies and just getting out there and hitting dynamics of relationships that don't require spandex, than grateful for that. But this is a kick off to a hopeful era, or the end of a pathetic one.Guys, here's a manipulation trick, secrets of the set...these moviemakers inject a crowd cheering at the end to get you to cheer along. Seriously. This has been a note given in script meetings.Look, this isn't a complete waste of time. There are nods to a bygone era where things were better. You know the times this era wants to erase. Those were when America could propaganda our ways into the hearts of millions. And, it seems it's happening again. Good. America rules.

But with all the praise Top Gun: Maverick got, we thought this would be a great popcorn flick to satiate our January-first couch potato needs.Were we ever mistaken! I don't know what type of reality distortion field the reviewers of this movie currently reside in, but I'm not even sure we watched the same film.The good: every single aerial scene had us on the edge of our seat. Amazing cinematography, flight choreography, and it felt like we were there. No idea how they pulled this off - we were blown away.The bad: literally everything else. Director Kosinski is back, continuing his trend of not caring about humans in this clinically directed nightmare. Every character comes across as a stand-in, which leave you looking for superlatives for the word \"cliche\". (Cliche-est?) the dialogue is borderline parody, with my partner and I taking turns predicting the next line with shocking accuracy. Then, the plot is complete nonsense for a variety of reasons:1. Really cool that Top Gun graduates are \"elite\", but... why not hire pilots with, you know, real world experience... like OLDER Top Gun graduates?! This is a serious plot hole that gets dumber the more you think about it. \"Let's hire talented rookies to fly this key mission!\" - why?!2. Three weeks. That's how long the writers continuously emphasize these rookies have to train. Which, on its face, is already absolutely ridiculous - but then, the training gets SHORTENED - meaning that the hour of sequences you just watched, happened in... just a couple days? The timeline makes ZERO sense here.3. Maybe, if you want us to care about our characters, you can help us understand the stakes? Pretty basic stuff. This movie is only a 2-hour first act, followed by the finale, where the team fight literally faceless baddies in the mountains somewhere. The rest of the stakes are petty, borderline-ridiculous interpersonal conflicts.Everything coalesces into an ooze of bad, with a script seemingly written by a 12-year-old, acting so cringe it'll make you lose hair (stop TRYING so hard, Jennifer Connolly), and a soundtrack so gratingly sentimental it made us want to mute our speakers. The original Top Gun was a dumb mess, and I'm glad to see the sequel outdoing it in stupidity.",

            "review_title": "Top Performance For TOP GUN",
            "content": "LIKES:The Opening: If you've seen the first film, you remember the excitement of the opening moment as Kenny Loggins hit song blasted through the speakers and the planes took off into the distance. It was an awesome setup that introduced so much potential at what was to come. Nostalgia reigns king, as the opening moment was more than happy to redo the technique and execute it in a flawless performance that get you ready for the adventure at hand. Perfect for fans of the original.The Music: The first film was filled with music of the 80s feel, each making a memorable moment in the film that fans replay in their minds over and over again. Well, to the most part, the modern day score accomplishes the mission again as they illicit the emotions you want in your sequences. Some classic tracks will fill your ears and take you down memory lane, while other tracks are the tracks modern movies dominate on the theater to really make the moment. Blasting orchestral works, those power ballads of love, and other moments await the brave pilots seeing this movie and enjoying the moment. Fantastic work with the music Mr. Kosinski and crew.The Acting: No surprise here, the acting has managed to reach great talents that help enlist the right people to make this sequel come to life and blow us away with quality. Teller is just as good as he is in almost all his works, capturing the emotions of the moment while also adding his own brand to the character and making it all feel natural. I love him in this very heavy role, and though there was more I wanted to see, I think he delivered the performance incredibly well. Jennifer Connelly as the leading lady brought stunning performances for me in both the look and feel of the bartender, and an adequate substitute for the original character. The coyness and sass is all there to go toe to toe with Maverick's personality, but still has that softer side that makes her realistic and fun. As for Maverick, Cruise must have never left the role, because he hits the marks on every aspect and it works so well. He's still got the same jokes, the same attitude, and bold nature we love as he tries things that most people would never dream of. And it's all been modernized to the continuing legacy of the famous pilot to once more accomplish the art of storytelling without breaking the character. He pulls everything of Maverick from the 80s and evolves it to the times, and in doing so accomplishes much with his character's revival in this story. The rest of the crew accomplishes their parts well as the pilot jockey bunch and much like the past, establishes a niche family that is very military feel. All in all, it accomplished much with the acting for this reviewer.The Realism: At least to most of the extents, Top Gun keeps its fingers on the pulse of reality in most aspects of the story. Like the first film, there are of course stretches to the realism nature of it, but the physics, the repercussions, and the training all feel like something one would find in a top military program. Top Gun Maverick takes the elements of the original again, beefs them up with the visuals and gives you the combat school experience of the Top Gun program. It was awesome to be back in the 80s with the updated visuals.Visuals: Speaking of that, the technology improvements have worked very well for this movie series and have not gone overboard in their use unlike...well most movies. Top Gun's sequel utilizes the changing military times and incorporates into the movie, while still relying on, for the most part, live action shots to give the authentic feel. It works well for me, makes the movie feel as lifelike as possible and still keeps things feeling very natural with the inclusion of the tech specs.The Story Elements: Top Gun was not just action oriented, the writers accomplished more than just shooting planes down. To accomplish the legacy writing nearly forty years later was a big set of shoes to fill and fortunately, it worked very well for me and my audience group. Maverick's tale has evolved and like the acting, combines the old and new together to make that familiar feeling story. The new age group going against the old, the military squabbles between Maverick and the top brass, and plenty of history trying to find its place in the character lives. It's a powerful message of the past sometimes getting in the way of the future, and while a little preachy or cheesy to some, it again feels very much like a continuation of the film we saw years ago. It works for the most part, and keeps the movie's pace strong and consistent to make sure all elements we expected were incorporated to a solid degree.The Action: It's nto the most action packed movie in comparison to other films in the modern day, but it again works to keep to the physics they establish, the characters, and provide the whoo factor you want in a movie. Maverick's opening flight gives you an idea of what is to come, and once the training is underway thing ramp up and go back to the familiar plane fighting antics you want. That's the beauty of the new technology and the modern abilities helping to ramp things up and give you the new age visuals. However, the ability to curtail that action into the story, is impressive and almost every scene feels needed, is necessary, and does not stray too far from the flight path in terms of fake abilities and breaking the world.The Top Gun Feel: The most powerful part for me on this movie, is the respect they had for the series and never leaving that Top Gun feeling. It's a tough market to respect the foundation and evolve the story, and I know not everyone will like it. However, compared to so many franchises this day, Maverick really does achieve the balance for me and managed to take the energy of the original movie, advance it somewhat, and yet not make it something completely different. That to me was a powerful source of enjoyment for this movie and it accomplishes much.DISLIKES:Predictable: For viewers like me, who have seen way too many movies, there aren't too many twists and turns to surprise you in this film. I had most of the big moments down and the foreshadowing is not gentle in the means of what they have planned. It is blunted by a little ambiguity and promise, but for the most part, you'll know what is coming.More Time With Female Lead: The first movie did a great job incorporating the romance aspects of the pilots and the flirting we sometimes saw between the leads. This movie does well, don't get me wrong, but I think there was more and better moments that could have incorporated her into the life versus what we got. These moments felt a little more shoehorned than other moments.The Main Mission/Timeline: You got to give them props on adding some suspense and consequences to the mix. However, this timeline also is a limiting factor and sort of speeds up and rushes through some things that I think we did not need rushed. I laughed at how convenient things were, or the stretches they made in the story that flies into Hollywood magic territory. In putting this, hard timeline, some of the realism got stretched and did not have the natural flow that the first movie did. Throw in how much they copied from another famous moment and you'll see the cheese factor come in a little for this movie.The character usage: Impressive in some point, but also weak, the characters of this flight squad are a little disproportionate given the terms of the story. Understanding a graduating class vs. The elite being pulled in are two different circumstances in my opinion and that means understanding when to use your characters to better degrees. While the secondary roles are decent, there are some inclusions that held little use and thus made me wonder why we needed 12 instead of a lower number with more focus on them. This is blunted by good use of the other characters, but again why make a big deal in the opening mission montage.The Interruption Of The Last Scene: I can't say much due to spoilers, but there is a moment in the final sequences that feels out of place. Though very funny and has some of the most humorous engagement, the last part of the mission feels a little more Mission Impossible/Great Escape, than Top Gun. While in the end they get this tangent to loop back in, it still was the part that was just not fitting in the rest of the montage, even though it has some of that emotional justification. Again, a bit nitpicky, but something that gets me given how the rest of the movie flows.The Verdict:\nTop Gun Maverick is a Mission Success in my book, in that it handled the big expectations quite well for me. It's Top Gun with a new paint in some degree, but it takes the elements of the 80s and modernizes it well A few liberties are taking, but the action, dynamics, characters, and story all feel like an extension of Top Gun with the time that has passed. Certainly, the character usage is not the best at times, and the timeline makes for a hurried and conventional skill set, but otherwise this movie did much better than I had anticipated. For something that could have crashed, Tom Cruise and the squad managed to balance old and new to levels I hoped we would see and made this soar. Thus, for this reviewer, I do encourage a theater visit to get back into the legacy, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. For those who want a score though, here they are:My Scores:\nAction/Drama: 8.5\nMovie Overall: 8.0.",

            "content": "In the summer of 1986, a little movie called Top Gun came out of nowhwere and became a huge hit at the box ofice not only because of the director who helmed it but its star Tom Cruise. The film would soon see greater success as an album and home video release made it a big 80s fad that still airs to this day. Now, after nearly 10 years since the original director died by suicide and years of delays, Top Gun 2 finally is out for all the world to see. If you cried when goose died in the first one, you'll cry again as Iceman dies from throat cancer and cheer when Maverick falls in love with a new single mom played by Jennifer Connelly, who grew up watching the movie. Miles Teller plays Rooster, who is Goose's son, who helps Maverick steal a chinese plane at the end of the movie in order to succeed. Like the original, it pays homage to the past and moves towards the present. There is a volleyball like scene which is fun as well as a bar scene. Some of the plane scenes might be too intense for those who want to see it in imax, although i saw the 4k regular version instead. If you got cash to spend, then maverick is worth watching on the big screen as well as online!!!",

            "review_title": "This movie is overhyped garbage.",
            "content": "I simply cannot understand all the glowing reviews for this movie. There are maybe two or three short scenes in the entirety of the movie that are any good, the rest of it is, at best, nostalgia-bait and at worst absolute trash. Where to begin...Let's start with the plot... who are the enemies in this movie? What are their motivations? Based on the mission briefing it seems they're enriching uranium and bringing a power plant online that apparently the navy isn't too keen on... why? What's so bad about this nebulous \"rogue state\" bringing a power plant online? None of this is ever explained, we as an audience are just left to make assumptions that this is bad for... reasons. I mean, that *could* be ok if those reasons were somehow easily inferred but they're just not and because of that the stakes feel entirely non-existent.Speaking of the mission briefing - I can't be the only one that said \"this is literally just Star Wars and the attack on the Death Star.\" I mean *COME ON!* They have to fly a treacherous path down a narrow trench, keeping a low altitude to avoid being shot down, in order to dive in and torpedo a small target before flying out? There are scenes throughout this movie that feel like they were lifted right off the Star Wars Episode 4 cutting room floor. It is absolutely absurd. I'm surprised Maverick didn't tell all the trainee pilots: \"It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.\"Furthermore, the aircraft carrier they're launched from also launches a whole bunch of tomahawk missiles at an airstrip belonging to the enemy that's a mere two miles away from the intended target. Why exactly can't these tomahawk missiles instead be used to take out the target itself? Why send 4 manned jets on a nearly impossible trench run toward the target when you don't have to? Speaking of - why does this mission need manned aircraft to begin with? I mean, the movie starts with an admiral coming to shut down the program Maverick is involved in so he can divert funds to the unmanned aircraft program he would rather be funding - a scene that ends up being entirely pointless because literally nothing about that is ever revisited or even plays a part at all in anything else that happens in the movie from that point forward.No reason is ever given - or even hinted at - for why unmanned craft couldn't have been used for this, or why they couldn't have simply destroyed the target with the tomahawk missiles they had, instead of destroying a nearby airstrip.So yeah... I do not care about this mission. The only reason anyone watching this movie has any reason at all to care is if, for some strange reason, they care about these characters dying. But why would we? We're not really given any reason to care about these characters because we spend no meaningful amount of time with any of them apart from Maverick himself.So let's talk about the characters... we're introduced to about a dozen or so pilots we're told are \"the best of the best\" (told, not shown) and then we get a very basic training montage with them before a handful of them are selected to actually fly the mission. Can any of you who rated this movie an 8, 9, or 10 tell me, without looking it up first, which pilots were selected to fly the mission and which ones were not selected?I'll even help you, here are their call-signs: Rooster, Hangman, Payback, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Fritz, Bob, Fanboy, Tex, Omaha, Coyote, Rhino, and Halo.I bet you can name a couple correctly, but I doubt very much you'd name more than that. But don't worry - it's not because you have a bad memory or weren't paying attention, it's just because these characters were boring and barely had any screen time. The movie gives you no real reason to care about any of them apart from Maverick and, to a *substantially* lesser degree, Rooster.Got your answer yet? Did you notice I added 3 names (Rhino, Tex, and Oxford) that weren't even among the pilots in the movie? Did you notice I left out Phoenix? No? Yeah, that's my point. More than half of these characters should have been *entirely* cut out of the movie so we could actually give the ones that (should) matter some screen time so that the audience has a reason to care whether they survive or not.Moving on - the entire inter-personal conflict between Maverick and Rooster is contrived nonsense that barely plays into anything at all. What's most disappointing about this is that it *COULD* have been done differently to carry much more dramatic and emotional weight - but instead of using Goose's death in the first movie as a catalyst for their personal conflict, they totally gloss over that and basically only ever use it to tap into the nostalgia the audience has for the original movie. Instead, the conflict between Maverick and Rooster is because Maverick pulled Rooster's papers. It's literally a dispute over paperwork.I mean... sure - that could result in a serious issue and bad blood between two people. I'm not trying to dispute that - but *WHY* is this how they chose to do that when they had such fertile ground to work with in the form of Maverick's relationship and connection to the death of Rooster's father? Why on earth did they sideline that and use it only for some \"Great Balls of Fire\" nostalgia nonsense? It just makes no sense whatsoever.What about Maverick's relationship with Penny? This doesn't even make sense. We're given some vague backstory about how he broke her heart in the past - but why then is she so quick to just welcome him back without batting an eye? All he did to get back in her good graces was show up at her bar looking handsome. Heck, if that's all it takes somebody please tell me where I can bump into Jennifer Connelly because I'll be there tomorrow.I could go on and on about how bad this movie is but this is getting way too long as it is so I'll move into rapid fire round...The music: again, this is really just playing to nostalgia for the most part. On some level that's fine - it's actually nice to hear the main theme again. Even \"Danger Zone\" was good to hear (although, it kind of felt like they shoehorned it into a weird spot in the movie). But it never tries to do anything new and leans far too much on nostalgia that it just comes off boring and forgettable.The dialog: \"Talk to me Goose,\" \"Talk to me dad\" - etc. Come on. This is just silly.The nostalgia in general: As mentioned many times already in this review the nostalgia is played up far too much in everything from the plot to the characters to the dialog to the music to the silly ball game on the beach, to Maverick \"buzzing the tower\" - etc. It's all just too much. A bit of this is to be expected but this sort of thing really needs to be kept to a wink and a nod - instead it was done with all the subtlety of a brick to the face.Believability: Not only is it absolutely *absurd* to believe that Maverick was able to exceed Mach 10 - which is literally more than *TWO MILES PER SECOND* - but when that plane exploded from the stresses it would have absolutely disintegrated Maverick along with it - there is *ZERO* chance he could have possibly survived that flight, let alone the explosion. This is, ironically, one of the most forgivable issues with this movie though - because it's all in the first opening minutes of the movie and ultimately it amounts to *NOTHING AT ALL* for the duration of the rest of the movie. Cutting it entirely would change nothing.Anyway, if you haven't figured it out yet, I hated this movie.",

It's a movie worth keeping. Hoo Rah!! (hey, that's Marine talk)Some have said that it is best to watch this movie in a theater, but if you have a large TV screen 50\" or more you are good to go and you will enjoy it just as if you were in a theater.Of course, there are some bumps in the road. Admiral Cyclone Simpson (John Hamm) wants to relieve Maverick of the job, but Maverick has a Guardian Angel in Admiral Tom the Iceman Kazansky (Val Kilmer) who rules the roost and Maverick stays. One other point of contention is Rooster: Lt. Bradshaw (Miles Teller) who accuses Maverick of pulling his papers at the Academy and messing up his career. This Rooster is the son of the Rooster, who flew with Maverick back in the day.Notables: Jennifer Connelly as Penny, Maverick's love interest; Lyliana Wray as Amelia;, Penny's daughter; Ed Harris as Rear Adm the Hammer Cain; Charles Parnell as Adm Bates; Bashir Salahuddin as Hondo.The rest are all Navy Lieutenants and the team Maverick must teach. Monica Barbro as Phoenix; Lewis Pullman as Bob - no handle; Jay Ellis as Payback; Danny Ramirez as Fanboy; Glen Powel as Hangman; Greg Tarzan Davis as Coyote; Jack Schumacher s Omaha; Manny Jacinto as Fritz; Kara Wang as Halo, and, of course, Lt.

            "content": "I'd been putting this on hold since it came out because I kept telling myself I need to watch the first one first but it wasn't happening so I just went into it blind, still enjoyed it. My first thoughts was about fixing the plane; why do mechanics, car or plane, often work with white t-shirts or vests on and always get them stained with oil, it's not a top gun thing but it's the first time I've noticed it. Anyway, the movie itself is great, was expecting a decent film but it's better than that, it's like a good old blockbuster, it's really just an action movie; I was concerned at first because in recent years most movies have had to have comedy element added to it but top gun sticks to being just top gun and I like that. Goes without saying that Tom cruise is much older now but he proves he still has it in him, the opening act was so blood pumping and it's the exact feeling I assume the first movie had.It's not only that though, action aside there're a few stories going on, Maverick and Goose's relationship with his father as well as maverick and Penny's relationship and all these made the movie surprisingly heartfelt which I didn't expect; not sappy but it carries some emotion. I found the amount of action quite limited though, most of it's crunched up towards the end and is amazing, I just think I misled myself going into the movie thinking it was going to be World War II level action for some reason. After thinking about it I realized it sufficed. I haven't seen many movies like it in a long time, reminiscent of 80's blockbusters. I don't expect it to snatch awards, it's just a fun watch and I think that's why. I absolutely loved the casting.I used to dream of being a fighter jet pilot and this reminded me why I thought it was so cool. Unfortunately it didn't leave much of an impact on me, I think it is a good movie but a forgettable good movie. It's still definitely worth a watch especially on big screen. On a side note, the scene when admiral Cain shows up as the jet's taking off right above him for test flight was so badass, my man didn't even flinch even though the shock wave shook everything else.",

For starters, I don't know if you've ever been to Pearl Harbor, but the Navy uniform is set in stone. It hasn't changed since the Top Gun original movie and it's not likely to change any time soon. (Proud Tradition and history people.)Secondly, like the first Top Gun movie, it is designed to get people excited about Fighter Jets which of course no one wants but of course we all know are an essential aspect of protecting a country from invasion(now more than ever I shouldn't have to outline the importance of the military.)So with that out of the way, the only other caveat would be an essential requirement that you have a love of Jet aircraft. (Or aviation in general.) If not, then what are you doing even looking at this movie???From start to finish it's without doubt a worthy sequel. While the ending was of course complete BS, it was without doubt a superb ending for those of us fans that not only love the original but wanted to see something make a comeback(now I hope that doesn't give anything away but I'm sure there isn't a fan who didn't expect this.)So wtihout knowing what I'm talking about there, I will say and it's not a spoiler as you know he's back, it was outstanding to see the great Val Kilmer reprise his role as 'Iceman.' Way to go Val!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Tom Cruise was in top form and in fact every actor in this film did an incredible job.If your a fan of the original, or would just like to see some fun with jet aircraft, you really can't go wrong with Top Gun Maverick.Highly recommended and one of the better sequels I've seen in the last 20 years.Now what are you waiting for, get out there and watch it on the big screen while you still can.",

It felt like I was watching some fanboys go out in fighter planes aimlessly having fun with no real goal. It felt more like a typical 80's fun film with no serious intent. Therefore, I was hesitant to watch it's sequel. However, this took me by my surprise...Not only does it honour its roots from the first one, serving a true nostalgic service to its fans, but it also builds and adapts on the original in a way that brings something new, fresh and exciting. It delivers an exceptional roster of characters and cast and the action scenes are incredible. What was missing from the first film was the electrifying tension and excitement of watching them swerve and survive in their fighter planes, but this one delivers that. Not only do you understand the world more, but you also connect with the film feeling as if you are in the plane with them. You begin to understand what's going in this world a lot more, and there are lots of awe inspiring moments that will make you go 'oh cool!'This one holds a much stronger narrative. There is a goal, an aim and a mission, a clear directive and a solid structure. The only comments I would make on the story was the quick change in Rooster's character. I felt as though it could have been more gradual and there could have been a bit more said and done to build his trust in Maverick, but it's nothing major I would complain about.My biggest gripe with this film is the meaningless relationship between Maverick and Penny. It doesn't add anything to the overall arc or story. The interesting scenes are the ones that revolve around the 'mission' aka the main storyline. But what we get are annoying little intersects where some irritating old flame takes Mavericks interest. She is simply there and holds no real value in the story. The ending where she turns up is so random, you completely forget about her involvement in the film in the big climax! We didn't need a love interest and especially not some random woman who we've never seen before in this world. She could have been completely missed and the story wouldn't have suffered for it. Maverick is a strong character on his own and the relationship between him and Rooster was enough to hold the film together, and so there should have been much more focus on this rather than him pining over an ex flame we don't know or care about at all. He didn't need a love interest.Overall, the film is a masterpiece both technically and creatively, and is an example of how time and advanced technology can make a sequel even better than its predecessor. A truly wonderful film.",

            "content": "Containing everything that the original lacked, missing other elements of what came before, and yet a brilliant revisiting with frequent callbacks and references without getting bogged down.The biggest success in comparison to the original Top Gun is that the lead characters have a background. They don't just have a personality, but a reasoning as to why they've been shaped that way. Maverick is more mature without losing his edge, and Rooster is given an effective backstory that Goose never had. The rest of the cast less so, but that isn't important and they just fill the gaps.Being dragged into the 21st century, representation is a clear difference. Fortunately it doesn't dwell on it, and a character is founded on their abilities rather than their gender, etc. The new roster all play their bit parts well, it's clear who is to be liked and disliked, and they continue the story. Even the new love interest is kept vaguely fresh, hinting at a past without dwelling on it. An inventive way to include Val Kilmer greatly adds to the context of the film too. Cruise cannot be faulted, and Teller fits in with great chemistry. Plus, stick a moustache on him, he really does look like Goose.The plot is exciting, and even though for a large part it is just training, it actually builds to something, something which is seemingly impossible. Keeping that interest right up until the mission is a success because the mission itself is gripping. Entirely predictable at every step, but that doesn't really matter, as they're all things the audience want to see. The enemy is still non-descript (bad guys only wear boring helmets), but you could make some fairly easy assumptions.Visually it is superb, cockpit scenes in particular have to be applauded. For many productions it would be all too easy to use CGI, however the lack of green screen adds to an excellent aesthetic.Not much of a soundtrack in comparison to its predecessor, plus fewer quotable lines, but plenty of references back to these to create a nice connection. Plus, anyone fearing the lack of beach volleyball would be relieved upon watching the beach touch football.Top Gun: Maverick won't be as iconic as Top Gun, but it is certainly the superior film.",

            "content": "That a Top Gun 2 happened twenty years later highlights that it was never a necessity in the first place. There's nothing new or worthwhile to the venture, and cheapened by weaving in political sub-plots to today's world. The Top Gun 'universe' is not better now than before.It just emphasizes the continuing ways that Hollywood is struggling from a creativity and production standpoint. The big time lone producers with guts and vision replaced by a conglomeration of financial backers and boardroom analytics who don't value the daring and creative scriptwriters and ideas people. Opting instead for employees who'll follow instructions. Or something like that.We had the era of remaking old TV shows into movies. Now it seems we're on the cusp of a new era. We already kind of saw this happen with Matrix Resurrections, now Top Gun got the treatment. Flicking back thru old hit movies with the idea of bringing actors back for the sake of nostalgia. What next? Point Break 2, Con Air 2, Pretty Woman 2, etc..I can already see it.This incites me to bring up another annoyance of mine. Sequels in general...There are certain movies pre-planned to be trilogies, like Harry Potter, which are fine. Or adaptions of a 5+ book series that need sequels.But a lot of the time it's a standalone movie that does well, that they milk to death which ruins it. Often it's from part 3 onwards that the rot sets in. It's easier to find a story in a part 2, something in the original script, a loose end, a what if, that offers a continuation. Part 2 often closes it. So when they then try to make up a story for part 3 it's often a reach, or rehashing the original due to a lack of creativity and the studio pushing something thru shoddily for a quick buck.So many movie franchises.... The Matrix, Alien, Terminator, Die Hard, Rocky, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Final Destination, Star Wars, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, etc....the list goes on and on. There are some ok ones at part 3 or beyond, but they're not common. I know it's probably film heresy what I'm saying, but the world would've survived with just an original or a part 2.I understand the motivations behind some of them -- creating franchises, universes, that can become financial juggernauts across other media too. But the vast majority of them end up falling into silliness and mediocrity, ruining the lore/canon of the original in trying to pad story in.Most fans of particular franchises are happy to keep diving into ongoing sequels. It's all just entertainment, not end of the world stuff. Still, that's my unpopular opinion.The world would've survived and been none the worse if there was only one Top Gun.",

They bring back legendary historical student Maverick to teach a group of cadets the best ways to accomplish the mission. Goose's son is part of the cadets which brings back old ghosts for both of them that complicates matters.This movie is directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) and stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky), Jennifer Connolly (Labyrinth), Val Kilmer (Tombstone), Ed Harris (Needful Things), Glen Powell (Hidden Figures), Jay Ellis (Insecure), Miles Teller (Insurgent) and Monica Barbaro (The Good Cop).The storyline for this is actually pretty good and does a great job of tying this picture back with the original characters and storyline. The soundtrack was perfect and used most of the songs from the first movie. The cinematography was out of this world and the training scenes and mission was awesome. These are the best airplane movie scenes ever created. The cast delivers magnificent performances.This movie isn't perfect, but the storyline and characters are wildly entertaining and the action scenes are among the best you will ever see. I would score this a solid 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is popcorn, movie theatre goodness straight out of the box. Audiences should have no misconceptions about this movie. It is just as cheesy and goofy as the first move in the duology when it debuted in 1986. Effectively taking viewers back with the same golden scenery and light-hearted tone, Maverick also brings moments of emotional sincerity that set it apart from the original film.Tom Cruise's Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell returns to the cockpit to lead the next generation on a heart-racing, death-defying new mission. The high-velocity dogfighting sequences are expertly execute to bring audiences into the cockpit and weave along with the pilots. The final thirty minutes, in particular, crafted a unique sense of intensity that will keep viewers thoroughly engaged and on the edge of their seats.The emotional core of Top Gun: Maverick is rooted in the relationships between Maverick and faces, old and new. The primary of these is between Captain Mitchell and Miles Teller's Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, son of Maverick's tragically lost wing-man, Goose. Cruise and Teller provide just enough emotional tension during breaks away from the high-flying jet action, but it knows its place in the film and never overstays its welcome. The same is true for the other quieter moments of reflection throughout the movie. None stay around too long to take away from the whole.The secondary characters are equally as entertaining, each exemplifying previously seen traits fans of the original will find familiar. The clear standout is the dangerously smug Lt. Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin, played by Glen Powell. Powell brings to the forefront an overly confident cockiness that fills the gap previously held by Cruise's Maverick, who is now more quietly assured in his older age. Powell provides a worthwhile foil to Teller's Rooster and, in the end, will still keep fans rooting for him.Top Gun: Maverick knows what it is and sticks to the script: beach scenes, corny dialogue, and jet-fueled action antics. Despite some minor slow character moments, it delivers thrills and schlocky goodness just as well, if not better, than the original.",

No chance.We had not been to a theatre in 8-9 years. Why? Our mega 12.2 theatre I built in our home. (Yes, it's a 12 cuz I utilize 2 centers.)Alas, my wife said \"Date night, we're overdue! We're going to the theatre for this movie honey! And BONUS, you get to take me to dinner first!\"\nI told my lovely wife Evie, \"Hang on there TigerLily; I'll need some encouragement!\"\nSo after working together on the acreage for several hours; she encouraged me.If I may digress:The box office guy just read the UPC on my iphonefor us to get in. That's pretty cool. No line.What's this? Your kidding me! I asked the guy, and he said it's been there for less than a year. The entire left side of the snack bar was dedicated to, and only sold the various wines (and you could buy a half a bottle), plus a boatload of IPAs and lagers with tappers everywhere. What's next, a theatre dispensary? Very cool!They completely converted the inside of the theater. All seats are new, large padded chairs, that recline electrically, all the way back, and each one has another button for a heater. That REALLY changes the experience for a big guy like me. Chair could've been even larger for a guy 6'3\", but it was quite comfy; and FAR SUPERIOR to what I (we) used to suffer through. These seats engulfed Evelyn, who's about 1 foot shorter. She was in heaven!Digression: Complete!We had heard really good things about this flick We we're curious, since sequels rarely measure up of course.The movie was indeed, (for lack of a better word), STELLAR.The writing, acting, and direction were all OUTSTANDING.Without trying, I'm so analytical, I can often taint a good experience by unconsciously critiquing while I'm watching.I don't think I had that switch shut off last night until maybe a half hour into the movie because everything was so \"right\", if that makes sense.Hats off to Cruise for doing such a heartfelt job. He deserves so much more than an Oscar for how he pulled his role off. It's truly remarkable. He IS the movie.You can really tell that this movie was in the making for many years. All aspects must have been repeatedly re-worked to get to such a polished product.And the idea about an old guy coming back and reliving his youth has been done several times before. And typically, it comes off as as contrived and often; corny/hokey.But how Cruise's (I got the need for speed\") character built in a bit of humility & wisdom, with burning desire and recklessness, again, just blew me away. And Kilmer's tie in is very good.The dose of 'heartstring pulling' was spot on.The action sequences utilize real F/A Super Hornets;\nF-35, Su Felon, and much more. And the tie in to the\nuse of the F-14 was fun & ingenious, and should you having singing at least a couple bars of 'Melancholy Baby'.No spoilers here. This 131 minute movie seemed more like like 75. Ya can't give a better compliment. Like the jets, this movie moves well.And finally, it's SUCH a great departure from today's mind-numbing CGI action flicks, some of which are good themselves. But moreover, the atmosphere projected, is very retro American. And it shouldn't be retro.Top Gun Maverick is a blast, with many feel-good moments. So have fun.",

            "content": "The film will have been out only a month tomorrow (as I write this), and it already has almost twenty four hundred reviews here on IMDb as it ranks in the Top Fifty of viewer all-time movie ratings. I saw the original \"Top Gun\" from 1986 only a couple years ago, but I'm glad I didn't hesitate to see this one just yesterday. The flight scenes are an adrenaline rush if there ever was one in moving pictures, and I defy anyone to state that it's impossible to not be in the cockpit when Pete 'Mavarich' Mitchell leads his F-18 fighter crew on the raid against an Iranian enrichment plant. If anything, I thought that was an intended tweak against the terrorist nation that the film makers sought to marginalize with the story line. I can't imagine the mullahs are very happy about the outcome of that little put-down against their regime. In real life, the successful raid against the enemy target here may not seem very realistic, but who cares when you hear the roar of those jets and experience the in-flight maneuvers of accomplished pilots performing those daredevil theatrics. The emotional ending with 'Hangman' (Glen Powell) making the save for Mitchell and wingman 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller) is about as pulse pounding as it gets when it comes to movie finales, so if you haven't seen the picture yet, let this be your recommendation to get to your nearest theater to experience the excitement.As an aside and on a humorous note, the last streaming movie I saw just yesterday had a line of dialog that was a precursor to the scene in this film when Tom Cruise's character bailed out of the experimental aircraft at the beginning of the story and found himself asking where he was in a small town diner. Arnold Schwarzenegger got the same answer to the same question when he parachuted into a junkyard in the 1996 film \"Eraser\". In both cases, the young kid responding to the question said - 'On Earth'!",

It's enjoyable and mostly well-made with certain scenes living up to the term \"blockbuster.\" It's definitely worth watching in IMAX, especially with the expanded aspect ratio.The flight scenes are once again fantastic, with the only flaw being too many cuts instead of holding on a shot. The story is investing with some good heart. The musical score is awesome. Tom Cruise somehow continues to do his own stunts, which adds a realism that we don't see as often these days. He even has a running scene like in so many of his movies. But I can't blame him, he's really good at it.On the other hand, I'm generally not a fan of 80's movies so that aspect didn't do as much for me as it will for others. And some of the nostalgia stuff feels a bit forced. They still memorize and sing the same songs 36 years later?In the end, I had a good time with this movie.

I was identified with Pete Mitchell's career issues (he would feel even worst if he had joined the company where i work), and i was glad i didn't have to watch Kelly McGillis (in my view the only total miscast of Top gun). Even Miles Teller which i don't particularly like was totally fine. I took off my hat out of respect for the action.At the end of the day -and even the following one- what remains is all the nostalgia this movie created.

            "review_title": "A great quality beefy fast food burger of a blockbuster, even if it's still a burger",
            "content": "To convey what I think of Top Gun: Maverick properly, I'll make an analogy that will take a moment. I'm not sure if anyone has heard of the Mythical Kitchen, which is an off-shoot of the YouTube series Good Mythical Morning with Rhett and Link, but Josh from the Mythical Kitchen is quite the craftsperson when it comes to making the most gourmet fast food you've never thought about. Some examples include a \"$249 Wagyu Beef Panda Roll from Panda Express\" or \"569 Wetzel Pretzel Taste Test\" or the most recent video, \"Josh Makes a Six Foot Taco.\" Josh can take a ton of ingredients, some I've never heard of and don't know what I would do with, and makes something that is absolutely spectacular looking and, of course, quite expensive - but the idea is that it's much, much more tasty and less like the school cafeteria taste you might get from your garden variety Burger King or KFC or what have you. This is all to say Top Gun: Maverick is a Josh Mythical Kitchen special where you can tell this has been made with intense, high-quality care.... does it transcend being fast food? Your mileage and/or colon may vary.First off, let's get the good things (sometimes even better than good) into this review meal (ill stop with the food analogy I swear, maybe): Tom Cruise is still a charismatic five foot seven icon for this kind of movie, where he brings much more swagger but also a lot more natural vulnerability, pathos and (maybe reading closer into it) a bit of world weariness underneath all of those decades of movie star \"I'll Go FURTHER than you... and then another step MORE\" chutzpah. So, if you want to see the movie for him more than any other reason, as I did, you'll get your money's worth.I also think he has much stronger chemistry with Jennifer Connelly- or maybe it's a better written character she gets to play, or a combo of the two- so their scenes on the whole are pleasing. And my goodness is the one scene he has with Val Kilmer one that can... well, the Berlin song isn't here this time (shock of shocks, the tiniest bit of restraint not with that song). It's certainly because the actor had his own cancer bout and so that had to be worked in to Ice, but their scene is loaded with so much dramatic energy, like you can tell how far the actors have come as stars but also as just people that it informs their scene and tops anything by a metric ton anything in the first movie for honest emotional weight.As for the new actors, they're mostly... swell. I don't know if I have a stronger word for it (ok, I like Bob and that he's just Bob and nothing more, good on you for not succumbing to a lazy nickname), buy they all fit their types - with H*ngm*n (hey, he scratched out the letters first) this movie's cocky Iceman and Rooster, Miles Teller's Son of the late Goose (is that a saying I dunno), is not.. quite Maverick or Goose, which is good, though he is saddled with the thing that we have seen in many other movies of this ilk of the son trying to live up to a father's legacy, or in this case what the best friend and confidant meant in that scenario. This isn't anywhere near the depth between Cruise and Teller that we saw in, say, Creed, but there's also not as strong or solid of a legacy to have from there anyway. Let's be honest, the death of Goose wasn't some giant mythological nexus point, it was one of those beats in a predictable action movie.Ok, I still got a little more positive, or a lot depending on your point of view, in comparison at least to 86 Top Gun; both the central plot is executed and carried out with a clearer precision (though ill get back to something that bugs me about a detail with it in a moment), as the stakes are set up from early on and the pilots are working on just that one mission, as opposed to the prior movie with it being almost more like a hang-out flick (with all those towels.. ); and the action and flying set pieces themselves are far, far more engaging and exciting, in no small part because of how film and camera tech now make it so we have a quasi verisimilitude with these actors in the planes and whether they're doing piloting or not (I suspect Cruise did because he's so bonkers, but did Bob? Shrug).And the climax of the picture is bombastic and with at least a couple of turns that I should've seen coming, if nothing else from my umpteenth viewing of Star Wars (does that make it a mild spoilers? Hell, this movie IS like a New Hope again... is it a better New Hope than Force Awakens? I'll have to sleep on that).But talking about stakes brings some issues to the table; even a gigantic hundred or several more million dollar popcorn vehicle for Cruise and company should have some politics besides 'America, good - Them, bad,' but this doesn't have that. Maybe the first movie didn't either, but that at least had the cover of the usual typical BS Reagan d-swinging Cold War poltiic where the US navy pilots could clearly be seen as engaging those kinds of targets even if not spoken. But here, we are told that \"the enemy\" is about to do a thing that will make them capable of enriching uranium. Hmm where have we heard that before in recent news? But there's no mention of any foreign adversary, like Iran or North Korea or even like Borneo or some crap. It's just... *them* and it makes it purposely vague.Maybe that will be good for audiences who don't want tricky or thorny politics into the mix, albeit its hard for me not to ponder about the times in recent years America has come so close to getting some (ie Iran) to draw back on Uranium/nuclear weapons only to be thwarted by Agent Orange and so on. I do get it to an extent, like it's hard to sell and get so many millions all over the world to watch your movie if you're pointing someone as a villain. But the vagary points to something that bugs me about the movie, which is despite all of its entertaining masculine piss and vinegar and how much one can get caught up in a sleekly shot, near perfectly edited action sequence, it's all kind of safe and impersonal deep down.Is there more to it than \"these Pilots Good, and as for you in the Snowy Mountains with your Enemy Pilots... shrug\"? Or what about the personality that could be put in by a director with a little more visual panache than what's required? It's a strange note to end here, but the one thing watching the two Gunss in as many evenings is that Tony Scott really did bring a strong, smoky, Painterly-but-super-commercially attention to lighting and compositions and, as dopey and silly as it all is, a kind of rampant hormone-driven miasma to 86 Top Gun (is it gay? Sure, and that makes it *fascinating* in a bizarre way). I can't tell you a shot that tells me Kosinski stands out from several others, which is a shame as he is definitely talented, and this is better than a number of other films he's made, but...I'll close here (frankly my Kitchen metaphors made me hungry). Top Gun Maverick, for all of its bravura and, at points, heavily winking nostalgia (like the annoying thing we get now where scenes and moments replay here, with little *twists) is a $406 Whopper with extra high-grade royalty cheese, or like a $300 bag of Doritos. I love a good bag of Doritos and I can dig a Whopper. Will I feel it later? Well.... my wing name is Colon, after all.(PS: I kind of get, even though it sucks, writing off the female leads of the last movie, as Kelly McGillis was uh too tall I guess next to Cruise and Meg Ryan whatever happened to her... no Tom Skerritt? He could've popped in here, no)",

They're both excellent movies in their own right.Okay, so I walked from my house today and passed the Charlie house here in Oceanside, CA on my way to the movie theater.

Quite a few references to the original, but again, not to an annoying level.Rooster (Miles Teller), looks very much like Goose and put on a stellar performance. The love-lationship with Jennifer Connolly's character wasn't the focus, so that was nice-the focus was truly on the flying, the mission, and the relationship between Rooster and Mav.As a veteran and mil spouse, I recognized the need for team building on the beach-and that was awesome. Jon Hamm's character (Cyclone) didn't see that, and honestly-that's en pointe with the military. Some leaders just over focus on the mission and forget that people do the mission and emotion influences that.

Grateful, smiling, people who have never worked a hard job in their life all share the same personality, sometimes have fake, motiveless arguments, then high-five at the end while someone with real soul sings a song to it (Lady Gaga).Miles Teller is the actor who competes with Cruise's character. He and many of the other young actors pretend to have ego and passion, but energetic scenes more resemble gang mentality and acting out, rather than individual drive and success (which is the point of an elite training school).",

            "content": "Come on, Mav. Don't think. Just do.Now that's a dangerous advice, but it's an advice that produced an amazing thriller. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Maverick is probably the best action thriller of this year.After the opening scene, I knew that I'm gonna get some amazing cinematography. The shots at the beginning are definitely going to be on my wallpaper lists. I loved how the beautiful blue color made it look like Tom Cruise was traveling in space. It was magnificent.In the first movie, the training arc was annoying for me because of the choppy editing and confusing technicality. Maverick improved on this significantly. I had so much fun watching Tom Cruise trashing on the graduates. The editing was clear and actually helped making the training thrilling and enjoyable.Another reason was Maverick had that the first didn't have: a clear direction. Maverick set up a destination that was high-stake that made me invested in the training of the characters. The border between life and death was clear.The third arc was where the intensity was at the highest. A large part was due to the great set up from the training arc. I was so invested to a point that I became emotional. Oh man it was so goddamn amazing and thrilling.Now with a host of new characters, it's obvious that some will be focused more than the others. I think the movie did a decent job balancing all the characters, although I would like to see the other less important characters shine more.One way was to have the training arc longer. At one point I looked at the time on my phone and was surprised that 1.5 hours had already passed. I felt such good vibes from these characters that the movie went by fast. At that point I wanted to watch another 1.5 hours of this movie.The romance improved from the first. It was a lot sweeter, but I still had the same problem of not having as much significance as I wanted.There were important moments that happened to the old characters that returned from the first. This didn't hold as much weight as I wanted to mostly because of the first movie's fault for not setting up the characters that well.Overall, I had a blast and will for sure watch it again. This time it will be in IMAX. Can't wait to be blown away again. 9/10.",

            "content": "So I just walked out of the theatre catching an early show of Top Gun 2: Maverick. This is going to be an honest and fair review for people curious to just how good the movie is (as that is what my biggest question was).First off, I'd like to begin by stating: this is not a \"bad\" movie at all. It's not bad, so you can get that right out of the way. That leaves the question: \"Just how good is it though?\" To answer that fairly, it must be broken down into pros and cons.Let's start with the pluses (pros). First off, I personally need to say that Jennifer Connelly alone is an absolute mega-bonus to this movie. For all of those JC fans out there, you will not be disappointed. In fact, I don't know if this is a beautiful movie, or if Jennifer Connelly's face makes it a beautiful movie, but I'd lean more towards the latter. The final result, however it is equated, though, is a beautiful movie.Next, we'll give a plus (pro) to the nostalgia factor. While an objective critic or someone who never saw Top Gun (1986) would be less interested in this and perhaps critical of it, it was definitely a strength of Top Gun: Maverick. Every single time there was a callback to Part I (1986) or reference or appearance or mention of the Part I characters, it really worked in the movie. Nothing felt overly forced except for maybe one small moment toward the end so it was nice to see them tie in a plotline to the original.Thirdly, let's talk romance and return back to Jennifer Connelly. This was another solid addition into the story. It added to the human side and emotional side, and I think without this balance of it, the movie might have suffered by being overly reliant on the air and flight scenes.In discussing the pros, the final thing to mention is the action scenes. While I didn't think they were immensely better \"overall\" than Top Gun (1986), the final mission sequences were incredibly intense. Intense is the perfect word to describe it. You will be glued into your seat, unable to move while taking in the air acrobats towards the end.Probably the best part about TG:M is that it is truly never boring except for a brief moment toward the beginning. It has that feel that you can't miss a minute. This is probably due to the tight editing. I had to go to the bathroom from the first scene, but I held it in the entire movie so I didn't miss anything. That's how fast it moves. It is very entertaining and fast-moving. The 2 hour, 10 minute runtime truly does \"fly\" by, no pun intended.Now, unfortunately, I have to be honest and admit that there are cons, and like many overly hyped movies, some of them are related to expectations and the movie being hyped so much before going in. This is subjective, but for me personally, I had heard some people who had reviewed TG:M early make claims that \"it was WAY better than the original\", it may be \"nominated for Best Picture\", and \"this is Tom Cruise's BEST movie\". To each their own, and I'm not judging the people who said these things because they may really feel that way because they liked the movie so much, but I would have to be honest and say that claims such as these are a little bit of a stretch, in my humble opinion.This by no means is to say the movie is bad. It's good. But I can't fully agree with these sensational headlines or claims I've read or heard. Now, to be fair, Best Picture is ultimately determined by competition for that particular year (and in recent years up to 10 movies can now be nominated), so it's not impossible, but if it came down to a conventional 5 nominees, this definitely probably wouldn't make the cut even though I wish it did because that would be cool. The one BP-level quality that it would have if any at all that might draw in voters is the emotional components. This movie will \"move\" you, mostly thanks to Connelly, but it probably won't be enough to get a nomination and many action movies also have the same ability and still don't get a nomination (even the 1986 movie had emotional aspects to it and that didn't get nominated). One category I do believe TG:M will have a great chance of winning is in Editing, and maybe it has a solid shot at sound and song (just like when it won for that category in 1986).I also don't believe this is Cruise's best movie ever or even in his top 5, maybe even top 10. Controversially, I think he was better in Part I than in this. And believe it or not I still like the first one better. That concludes an analysis on the cons in terms of expectations.My biggest criticism of the movie on its own is simply that I thought that it could have been even better. I understand the big budget and they're limited on logistics and what they can film, but I felt like: as good as the ending was, I had an idea for something even better, and because this is a Spoiler review, I can say that it would have been cool if all 4 partners were still in the air in an all out dog fight (and I actually thought this would be the end result based on preceding scenes) with the enemy jets rather than only Mav and one other companion.I also have to mention and complain about how Hangman came out of nowhere for the final splash when last time we saw him he was still on the Aircraft Carrier and called off so as a viewer, you are left wondering, \"where did he come from?\" We get it. He pulled a \"Maverick\" and disobeyed orders probably, or Hamm changed his mind, but they should have showed this so it wasn't sort of cliche. But to be fair, look, I get it, it's a movie and it is plausible that they sent Hangman. It's just that they should have showed it so it wasn't one of those shootout cliches where the hero comes out of nowhere.One final criticism is that some of the acting, only at certain times, could have been better. And I think Part I had better acting overall, even from smaller roles. But this movie has to be taken for what it is, which is a fun summer movie just to have a good time at.TG:2 is rated PG-13, and sadly they are mostly aiming at teenagers for some of the big moments in the script; the good news is that it is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, containing far less cursing than the first Top Gun and even less graphic love scenes (by far). There are handful of s words and one f word at an intense moment, but overall it is very mild compared to the first one. There is no nudity or intense sex scenes, but just innuendo on the romance side.As a whole, TG:2 is a very enjoyable summer motion picture. If you have any interest in the movie, you will laugh, cry, be thrilled, maybe even feel patriotic, and be interested in the military logistics presented for the missions. Cruise does his best at an older age to nail his lines, and while maybe not possessing the charisma that only a young, 24 year old hot shot rising movie star could display, he certainly carries the movie with a commitment to the role. A shout out must also go to Miles Teller, who is sufficient as Goose's son.If you are looking for a fun summer movie, anticipating the nostalgia for the Top Gun 1986 hit, want a theatre movie that the whole family can enjoy, or you simply like a well-made mixture of drama, action, and romance, you really can't go wrong by giving Top Gun:Maverick a watch on the big screen. However, I would recommend lowering expectations going in to see it so you aren't expecting it to be an Oscar winner or Cruise's best movie ever. It is definitely a good movie though. How good? That will ultimately be more subjective with this movie than any one I can think of.7/10.",

And it's playing in my neighborhood, so I decided to check it out. Boy was I surprised! TOP GUN MAVERICK is the kind of movie Hollywood is famous for: glamorous people doing exciting things while giving the audience thrills and chills and suspense with an upbeat ending. Hollywood has been in love with aviation from the very beginning. The very first Oscar for best picture was WINGS, about pilots in World War I. Audiences were thrilled by its daring arial photography. With the technological advances of 95 years, the arial sequences of TOP GUN MAVERICK are even more exciting. The story is one that has seen many incarnations over the years: the old timer is called back to action in order to teach the young people how to do it. But has he lost his chops? Will he win the trust of both his superiors who are almost hoping for him to fail, and the young people who consider him a bitter has-been. Yeah, we've probably seen it before, but never as spectacularly thrilling. It's also a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The movie has been a record-breaking box-office success worldwide and it's easy to see why. It's nothing terribly profound, but extremely entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

But as a sequel navigating the modern outrage mobs and other cantankerous spoilers and wreckers waiting in the wings to bring anything good down this thing is a solid ten. Tom Cruise doesn't look almost 60, he is in unreal shape for any age, but the work and dieting he must put in to look like this at 59 is nothing short of amazing. There is less cheese than was in the first movie, the music is great, and to see these people grunting and huffing while pulling real g-force maneuvers in real airplanes is so great. Tom Cruise had to take a huge amount of abuse to make this a reality - you can see the actors in planes sweating and suffering tunnel vision and black outs and redouts. One must have a healthy respect for Tom Cruise for being one of the very very few in hollyweird that actually cares enough about his craft to put in the work. I hope this kicks off a new wave of serious remakes that can even outshine the original if done right and I hope this kicks off a new wave of movies that skip the idiotic computer generated trash and get back to practical effects like this movie. This is basically an 80's movie done right - take all the good music and good looking people, reduce the cheese and come up with an engaging multi-faceted multi-layered plot that develops emotion and take it to eleven on a scale of ten. Even if the scenario and outcome is unrealistic nobody cares because the practical effects make it far more watchable than the hot garbage superhero movies and everyone is having so much fun we just want to see the happy ending. Great movie, exceptional sequel and if this thing had actually come out in the 1980s it would have melted everyone's face off in disbelief. For this practical effects movie to do so well in 2022 is a testament to its greatness. The people who made this movie earned a high rating and a big box office return. This type of movie could save the cinema and bring people back to theatres.",

But the last 30 minutes were packed with action and suspense, which was a lot more enjoyable.It's a shame, because this movie could be great with more action and appealing story. But no, they played it very safe and made an average movie.The first Top gun wasn't exceptional either, but was at least enjoyable to watch.

It's a little bit cliched, but there's only so many new things they can come up with. There's the disgruntled offspring of the dead best friend. There's the grudging admiration of an old rival. There's the reluctant affection of an old flame. There's the bolshy kid with an attitude. All pretty standard.Then there's the flying. Not standard. Not at all. Top Gun was beautifully formed. Maverick takes it up several notches and does it brilliantly. Without CGI. And it shows.The script is well done, the dialogue is witty in places and cheesy in others. The acting is excellent.And here's a thing. In the cold light of day my experience tells me that a major part of the main mission planning is nonsense. I'll not go into details because I don't want to put a spoiler. But sat there in the cinema, engrossed in the film, I didn't care.

            "content": "There is absolutely no denying it - TOP GUN: MAVERICK is the very definition of a \"Summer Blockbuster\" movie - the kind of film that will appeal to a wide variety of audiences who want nothing more than to escape into a world of heroes (and villains), good vs. Evil, with lots of fast chases and things exploding.And that is just what you get with the sequel to the 1986 hit - a summer blockbuster, which will do well at the box office - just don't expect tricky plot developments or in-depth character examinations. The plot and the characters are just there to deliver the blockbuster goods.Bringing back the main character from the first TOP GUN film, Tom Cruise as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, TOP GUN: MAVERICK shows Maverick 30 years (or so) after the events of the first film with \"just one more\" mission to go. Maverick is brought back to train a dozen hot-shot pilots, including one that is the son of his best friend - a friend who's death Maverick has been traumatized by during the past 30 years.Cruise, of course, is perfect in this role. He has the right blend of arrogance and charisma to pull of the fine balance needed between these two traits. Jennifer Connelly is on board as the requisite love interest and she more than holds her own with Cruise in what is an underwritten role as are all of the roles in this film by writer Peter Craig (BAD BOYS FOR LIFE) with Direction by Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION).Miles Teller (the son of the man who Maverick is mourning, who blames Maverick for his dad's death), John Hamm (the a-hole boss that thinks that Maverick is \"writing checks his body can't cash\"), Glen Powell (the arrogant young hot shot) and the rest are all one-note caricatures that leaves the audience not really caring about their fate.Only Val Kilmer (reprising his role as \"Iceman\" from the first movie) comes out of this unscathed for his character is suffering from throat cancer and cannot speak above a whisper (much like Kilmer in real life). It was good to see him on the big screen again.But...you don't come to this film for the characters, you come to this picture for the high-flying action sequences, and...in the last part of this film...you get 'em in spades! Unfortunately, you get way too LITTLE action in the first part of this film, it's mostly nostalgic fond remembrances of the first film, so I found myself wriggling in my seat waiting for the action that I knew was to come.It's the perfect summer movie and one that is far more superior being seen on the big screen. It is the type of flick that one doesn't have to pay to close attention to, but when it does grab your attention, it does it well...enough.If you have the need...the need for speed...you can do much worse than TOP GUN: MAVERICK.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

The man just can't lose, and anyone who's been following Tom throughout his career knows that Tom almost always delivers. Why? Because he knows a good story, and he also knows what the audience wants.And I also want to thank Tom Cruise for insisting that there be no CGI effects for the flying sequences. I don't even want to imagine how this movie would lhave ooked had they used CGI. Too many movies these days rely too heavily on them. It was said that after seeing this film, you would feel as though you'd sat in the cockpit yourself. This is no lie.Maverick is back and up to his old tricks. He still isn't the most beloved pilot in the Navy. In fact, he's pretty much the opposite. You still have a hotshot pilot who pushes the envelope, both inside and outside of the cockpit.On the verge of never flying a plane again, Maverick is asked to teach the best-of-the-best, to prepare them for an absolutely harrowing mission that requires the best-of-the-best to even have a hope of completing it. If you thought the flying sequences were spectacular in the first one--and they were!--you ain't seen nothing yet! In this regard, at least, the film was not overhyped!Maverick has new trials to deal with: how to teach a new generation of hotshot pilots and get them to act as a team. The mission requires absolute precision. He also has to deal with the fallout with Rooster, Goose's son. And believe it or not, there's a lot more it than Goose's death. And lastly, Maverick has to find a way to prove to the top brass that--while he seems like he's asking for the impossible--what he's demanding is actually possible.The film is wrought with heart, emotion, and inspiration. Nothing is over-the-top, and there are even a few curveballs that you probably won't expect.We also have a good cast of young pilots, with Hangman, Phoenix (an inspiration to women everywhere!), Payback, Bob, and Fanboy, and Coyote. While the first film had more humor than this one, especially the banter between fellow pilots, this one is just as long on men and women dedicated and masters at their craft.The music of Hans Zimmer, Harold Faltermeyer, and Lady Gaga (who also helped compose the music as well) is certainly memorable and effective. And anyone who fell in love with the original Top Gun's opening sequence, will certainly not feel cheated or disappointed with this one!There are just enough references and momentous nods to the original without becoming overloaded or melodramatic. This Top Gun is telling its own story, and there aren't too many parallels between the first film and this one.I'm glad it took 36 years for them to get this sequel to us, as long as they did it right. And boy, did they EVER do it right! When it comes to films, there is only one bonafide mega-Hollywood superstar left. And everyone knows how that is! And he more than delivers once again.",

He destroys a very expensive plane on the very first scene and he is promoted to teacher?! WTF?The weirdest thing about the movie is that they are targeting a plant that is surrounded with defence weapons across a long cannon, where they need to fly no higher than 100 feet..... so drones do not exist in this universe?!The whole premise is stupid, I am sorry...

There is history and the baggage that comes along with it as adults which is also mirrored in his combative relationship with Goose's son, Rooster played by Miles Teller.The aerial cinematography and the action scenes are astounding, excellent, breathtaking but best of all - they're authentic! With little use of computer generated imagery, these scenes were all shot practically in camera at Tom Cruise's behest which makes it even more impressive feat.The cast while mirroring the first movies fighter pilot crew in many ways were all likeable from Phoenix, Bob, Hangman and Rooster and the soundtrack while heavy on nostalgia subtlety introduced the riff of Lady Gaga's Hold My Hand which perfectly encapsulated it's more emotive moments.Top Gun Maverick has serious heart; it's a love letter to aviation, perfect escapism and excellent sequel and a true contender for movie of the year.",

Their difficulties of their task was reinforced and it was inspiring to see their struggles.

Cinematography was clear enough so you can tell who is who.Great idea bringing back Val and it's so poignant with his illness. Jennifer Connelly is still so attractive and a pleasure to watch but maybe too chic for a San Diego bar owner.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is without a doubt a classic blockbuster, and for me it checked all the marks that it needed to as a action drama flick in 2022. Notably though this movie tends to lean in to being sentimental a lot more. I could see this being taken the wrong way but in my opinion it was done respectfully.Directing is something else here, I can't deny that every single fighter jet scene gave me goosebumps. This movie just nails that feeling of overcoming challenges, speed, intensity and everything else that comes to doing something extreme. Everytime we get back in that pilot seat I'm in. Pacing and editing also need a huge shout-out. This is a movie with incredible highs and lows. And there's a balance just right to make the pace for this 2 hour movie more than bareble. Visually it tends to lean to lots of sunsets and yellows. Making it have quite a distinct and warm look, fitting to the desert.This takes me to sound design, fighter jet movie, you have expectations. And yep they're met. Incredible sound, punchy, impactful and crisp. Dialog sometimes the only thing that sounds a tad mumbled. Music, Hans Zimmer gives a solid en trustworthy score. It does what it needs to do but doesn't innovate.Acting is top notch, everyone does their best. Some roles felt a bit small and I do feel that John Ham was miscast in his role. But it's a minor personal nitpick. Pilots are great, but Cruise is the standout no doubt. Fantastic range and just great during the many emotional moments.Story, flashbacks have been done well I think, there's a few callbacks, but for me they didn't become too cheesy though it was on the edge sometimes. Story realism etc was kinda meh, the enemy are basically bots, no personality. And some plot points like walking into the enemy base and getting out so stealthily whilst there's and alarm going was kinda silly. Also how Tom just does things in the Navy as if he is walking there alone.That said, a cinema worthy experience.",

            "content": "Seeing the incredible amount of praise that the film got over the opening weekend, I felt the need not for speed,but to see it on the biggest screen possible. Booking to see it on the Manchester Printworks Vue IMAX (the largest screen in Europe), I got set for a top viewing,of the new top gun.View on the film:Reuniting with the lead actor after they had made Oblivion (2013), director Joseph Kosinski is joined by his TRON: Legacy (2010-also reviewed) cinematographer Claudio Miranda in staging astonishing, high-octane Action set-pieces.Specially developing IMAX-certified Sony Venice 6K full frame cameras just for this film, Kosinski & Miranda brilliantly place the audience in the cockpits right next to the pilots, with blazing wide-shots and tightly edited close-ups emphasizing the breath-taking views,and high risk of being shot down by an enemy pilot, seen from the air.When on the ground, Kosinski balances the thrills in the air, with ultra-stylized wide-shots following Maverick bonding with the new recruits in a slo-mo beach sequence. Whilst keeping all the pilots ready to fly at any moment, Kosinski wisely scatters quiet, more personal moments across the film, from the nicely understated, lingering romantic glances between Hangman and Rooster, (played with a sweet charm by Glen Powell and Miles Teller) and a heart-warming reunion Maverick has with a old rival.Making it a condition when signing on that all the flying sequences would be done for real,and not CGI, the Cruise missile gives a mesmerizing performance that hits every target, thanks to Tom Cruise visibly showing happiness when training the new recruits in the air, (with Tom Cruise designing a real 3 month program to train the rest of the cast to fly) and a weight of intense responsible upon the shoulders of Maverick, over coming back home, in search of the next top gun.",

            "content": "There's always one thing about a long-awaited sequel, it's either good or bad and rarely sits in between. What makes it worse is the amount of nostalgia overwhelming the movie, not to mention the bad plot. Some sequels are like that, it's simply just a cash-grab movie.Top Gun: Maverick is nowhere near any of that, no wonder why Tom Cruise didn't want to make a sequel right after the first movie if the story isn't worth telling. The movie tells about Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, he's called back into action after more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators to teach a new generation of pilots at Top Gun. The mission is to destroy a rogue nation's uranium factory in a perilous mountain setting and later he becomes the team leader.Talking about the plot, well, it's quite a simple one. There's nothing special or big about it but whatever they're trying to tell, it delivers. The movie is very emotional I kept smiling and sometimes cries a little because of the nostalgia it brings (even though I'm not growing up with the original). The movie pays homage to the original extremely well.The Dogfighting sequences are one of if not the best in any action movie. The actors are literally inside the F-18 Super Hornet and F-14 Tomcat up in the air with cameras in front of their faces. But they aren't actually controlling the planes except for one guy (you know who that is, yes, it's Tom Cruise but he only flew the P-51 Mustang by himself in the final scene) and the camera placement around the aircraft is perfect making the sequences look intense. The cinematography is beautiful as well.I don't need to talk about the new soundtracks, they're just as iconic as in the original. Top Gun movies have one of the best opening scenes of all time.(SPOILER SPOILER)RIP Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, he's one of my favorite characters in the franchise.",

            "content": "I saw \"Top Gun: Maverick\" with my cousin during a 4:00 p.m. Thursday Screening. I thought while \"Top Gun: Maverick\" has mighty wings and isn't boring, it didn't take my breath away. Before I explain, I wasn't fond of the original \"Top Gun\" at all simply because I didn't get to feel the need or see it through the gay way. Mainly I didn't get the chance to grow up with the 80s or be a massive fan of the 80s stuff as many others did. However, due to the positive word of mouth, I wanted to give it a chance because I like to give movies chances and I am open to surprises. Here's my takeaway:It's definitely not a bad film, that's for sure. It also ain't no cinematic masterpiece or something that is considered cinema. It's just a fun-time popcorn nostalgia-fest flick that's all.There are many impressive visual and production sets displayed throughout. The advanced technical moments when the jets are flying are impressive and the effects on the flight sequences are well done. Those moments were the selling parts of the entire film and I applaud the production, sound, designers, and stunt workers to make great action sequences. Just like the Mission Impossible action sequences, it really did help to grab the attention. Gets you to feel the need and run into the danger zone. The camerawork is also pretty good. There are many good wide shots of the environment, good shots of the jets, and some well-done camerawork once the jets are flying up in the sky. All the performances are good, but nothing really wowing. Tom Cruise is good as usual as he puts lots of effort into his work. He plays well as a pilot and military-type person. Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, Lewis Pullman, Glen Powell, Val Kilmer, and everyone else did their job to play well. No bad performances.But that's pretty much it since like the original, it's just another basic military action drama movie that is really really predictable. Every moment felt like something you have seen already a million times. Like you already know what is going to happen next, you already know what this character will do, what the next scene will be, and many pieces you can just easily pick up on. At times it really almost felt like a rehash of the original film but with updated technology and new characters that's all.But hey, that's what it is. Top Gun: Maverick is for nostalgia purposes and just pure food popcorn entertainment. Just to have fun. Nothing to care about in the plot. It is mainly impressive for the action and visual moments or for some people, only to see the famous celebrities rather than the narrative itself. The purpose is for nostalgia, that's all. Nothing to find anything new but to gain nostalgia or simply be entertained. I didn't really care about any characters at all. You got some of the original characters back and they are there. The loveable characters are back but in my opinion, I didn't connect with any of them as many others were able to. I didn't find Maverick likable or anyone else since the characters were bland or annoying.The original soundtrack I enjoyed but this new soundtrack was just alright. Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, and Faltermeyer's scores were just alright. Lady Gaga's song for this movie just didn't work for me since I am not a fan of her music. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad. The directing was alright but nothing stands out besides the visual parts. Director Joseph Kosinski is good with visuals and CGI works as it provides with his previous films like \"Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Only the Brave\" Even tho I thought Only the Brave was fine and Oblivion and Tron: Legacy were disappointing, undeniably, Kosinski is great with what he does.Don't get me wrong. It's not a bad movie. I understand why people love this movie and why the original holds a special place in their hearts. A lot of people put their efforts and talent into this film. But at the end of the day, this movie wasn't my cup of tea. It's more for nostalgia purposes and for fans of the original. It really felt like I was watching a 2-hour military ad that is trying to tell me \"Hey Kid! Join the Navy! If these people can do it, so can you!\". At the end of the day, Top Gun: Maverick is an impressive visual fest but nothing too special. But I still enjoyed the flight sequences but that's all.But if you love this movie, that's great. I'm just a terrible person who didn't get to experience it like everyone did (I'm being sarcastic) and I'm glad you enjoyed it.",

Included in the team of special trainees is Goose's son, Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller), with whom guilt, resentment, and tension are thick.The film is excellently shot; similarly done to the original film. Multiple perspectives from the air combat scenes create a realistic story for the characters. Acting is great and the plot flows nicely, with decent character development overall. There are a few faults, such as the trainees who are introduced and then never really seen again, but it doesn't distract too much from the main narrative. The other note to mention is that, aside from Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, none of the original cast members are in this film, save for some previous footage of Anthony Edwards' Goose character.Worth a watch!",

However, after his death, the project was shelved, eventually taken up by Joseph Kosinski who took over in 2018 and after 2 years of delay, Top Gun 2 saw the light of the day.The sequel starts with #TomCruise returning to the role of Maverick which made him a household name. This time he will not just be flying the planes but also training the new bees who have been selected as the \"BEST OF THE BEST\" pilots in the word, to destroy the uranium setup at the enemy base.From the director of brilliantly made Tron Legacy and Oblivion, Joseph enhances the franchises with more adrenaline pumping flight sequences. The movie opens with a bang where Tom Cruise uses his swag, wearing his famous jacket and sunglass as he zooms past into the center where he flies the Mach 10 super sonic flight. The sequel delves into the crux of the plot - getting new joiners onboarded where we get introduced to new actors joining the cast.While the training sessions are engaging, it is the main mission on-air flight sequences which is an absolute masterpieceb that should be watched in theaters for ultimate cinematic experience.

            "content": "After failing long awaited Sequels/soft reboots a million times, Hollywood finally got 1 right!!! And this is that 1! Fail a million times, you are bound to get a great try eventually. And it's mostly thanks to Tom Cruise, he produces most his movies and he clearly has an EXTRA HUGE passion for what he does, and it shows! Love or hate Tom Cruise, it's extremely respectable what he does. He goes the extra mile by doing all his own stunts, used real jets in this movie to minimize CGI, but most importantly, the story here was ON POINT!The movie surpasses the original Top Gun in fundamentally every aspect. I never was a huge fan of the OG Top Gun, of all the big 80s classics, I always found it one of the lower tier ones. The sequel vastly improves upon pacing, character development, emotion, action scenes. I almost cried multiple times during Maverick.You don't really need to see the original to follow and get super invested in this movie, but it does help a little but. The movie is basically a super well-executed build up, with an amazing payoff in the third act. It's been SO LONG since I seen a movie's build-up done this well, and when it finally gets to the big pay-off, not only does it deliver, it KNOCKS IT out the park!!! It is one of the most edge-of-my-seat thing I seen in a movie in a VERY LONG TIME.My only 2 minor complaints is it's a bit formulaic, but that isn't bad at all when everything else is constantly knocking it out the park. My 2nd minor complaint was the love interest was just decent, but not bad at all.This movie is everything what a big blockbuster should be. A huge action movie spectacle that isn't braindead at all like most big action movies. If you love action movies, you'll most likely love this. If you are in the military, you'll way most likely love this! If you like amazing movies, you'll most likely love this movie! I cannot recommend this movie enough! I hope this movie makes a ton of money, because we need more like it.",

            "content": "I had high expectations for \"Top Gun Maverick\", considering the hype and an IMDB rating of 8.5. But it became all too apparent within the first few minutes of the opening scenes, that this \"new\" film was basically a rehash of the original Top Gun, with updated aircraft and a lot more focus on Tom Cruise. The dialogue was mostly average, and often cringeworthy, and very cliched. But it's not all bad news either. The fighter jet scenes are nothing short of exhilarating, and you can see that a lot of effort went into filming them. Sound effects of the jets in action add to the immersive experience of this film. All in all though, I came away with the sense that I'd pretty much seen it all before (I just re-watched the original with my daughter before watching the new film), and the outcome was ever so predictable. I have no idea why this film is currently rated as the 58th greatest movie of all time. That's an insult to some truly exceptional films which are ranked well below this one. For a film to be ranked in the Top100 of all time I think it needs to be more than a mere 2-hour entertaining diversion, it really needs a solid script, engaging characters, and a story that that we might still be thinking about long after the hype dies down.",

Every time a character takes flight the audience flies with them and it will put you on the edge of your seat! The movies starts off a bit cheesy, but hits full speed once we return to Top Gun.

Once again, Tom Cruise proves that he's a versatile actor, who gives 100% in every film while perfecting his stunts and even flying his own plane.

Tom Cruise has always been underrated as a performance actor due to his action work overshadowing anything else. In Top Gun Maverick we see a glimpse of Tom Cruise we used to see in his earlier movies.Top Gun Maverick is the perfect summer blockbuster you would be seeing this year, the movie surpasses the original by having a more relevant plot and better choreographed action sequences. Miles Teller does a decent job as being the \"prodigy\" but this role required someone like Lucas Hedges or Will Poulter to square up against Tom Cruise.It was great to see Val Kilmer again, but his role was nothing more than a cameo. Jon Hamm and Jennifer Connelly are very good casting choices who were able to measure up to Tom Cruise and play their parts convincingly.

The results are worth it, no matter how good the CGI is your brain makes that connection immediately so when you see something real it's always refreshing, specially in action movies.For me that's the highlight of the movie, fantastic action sequences, breathtaking scenes (literally) during the plane fights, it's one of a kind and one of the best practical approaches I've seen for an action film.The story is not bad, they manage to design a good plot however, it has two major problems for me, it relies heavily on the story of the previous film (not necessarily a bad thing but also not original) and in all honesty it's not\nthat great of a story, it's engaging enough to not make the movie all about flying jets but a bit dry.It's hard to make a connection with the characters because there's not much back story and for me personally I wouldn't be emotionally invested mostly because, although they don't emphasize on the theme of war at the end of the day this is what these pilots are trained for, so all that risking their lives and having to do their mission, I don't agree or see the appealing in real life war, I understand the comradery between the individuals that fight but war makes no sense to me specially since most of the times soldiers are fighting for the interests of powerful people and for them to become even more rich, rather than actual interests for their country and its people.With that aside it's a great cinematic experience and highly recommended to watch in the cinemas!",

            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the sequel to the 1986 action drama film \"Top Gun\". Directed by Joseph Kosinski (\"Tron: Legacy\", \"Oblivion\", \"Only The Brave\") and starring Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and Miles Teller, it exceeds the original film in every way possible by delivering a follow-up worthy of being considered one of the best sequels ever made.Thirty-six years after the events of the first film, pilot Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) still remains in the rank of Captain due to him intentionally avoiding promotion, which would result in him being grounded. Under the orders of his friend and former rival Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), Maverick is given the job of training a group of newly graduated members of the \"Top Gun\" program to undertake a dangerous mission. Upon meeting the young pilots for the first time, Maverick notices that one of them is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of his deceased best friend \"Goose\" (Anthony Edwards). In spite of the initial tension he has between Rooster and the rest of the pilots, Maverick eventually earns their respect in the air as a skilled tactician capable of leading them through enemy lines.If you are ever required to name movies that define high-octane 80s action to a tee, I'm sure \"Top Gun\" would be fairly high on many people's lists. This is because it was able to appeal to virtually all audiences, with some great fighter jet stunts for the guys and a love story for the girls. Though the film was far from perfect, it managed to blend all of these tropes together so harmoniously that it rightfully cemented its status as a part of pop culture. I think Roger Ebert summed it up best by saying that \"...the good parts are so good and the bad parts are so relentless\". This belated sequel, which was 36 years in the making, is so entertaining that to merely call it better than the original would be a huge understatement.What I think separates this film from other sequels that capitalise on nostalgia was its ability to stand on its own without too much reliance on the original. In the first film, the plot was simple enough to follow that you could basically ignore most of the dialogue and watch everything unfold through its groundbreaking action sequences. Later, things would be counteracted with some cringe-inducing 80s clich\u00e9s like the soundtrack blaring loud synth rock over a love scene between two characters. Here, the film keeps its 80s roots to a minimum by presenting a more modern look at how much naval technology has advanced over the past three decades.One scene in particular shows Maverick flying his old fighter jet, complete with all the archaic bells and whistles, alongside the high tech present-day jets piloted by the younger crowd. Despite being a technical dinosaur by today's standards, Maverick is able to manoeuvre his jet through the air with relative ease, showing these young folk that he is still a force to be reckoned with. In most sequels that feature an older version of the original protagonist, we tend to see them in a more vulnerable state, where they would believe they're in danger of being bested by the current youth. Here, on the other hand, Maverick is still just as confident and level-headed as he was in the first film, which is a refreshing change from that old formula. It's almost feels as though he's been in suspended animation over the past few decades and has now been thawed out for our own enjoyment.Taking over from the late Tony Scott, Joseph Kosinski steps into the director's chair to deliver a workmanlike, streamlined film that will make any doubters realise that this is a sequel we never knew we needed. As previously mentioned, the film doesn't play too much into the audience's assumed nostalgia for the original but it has just enough of it to remind us of its overall significance. Like \"Tron: Legacy\", another belated sequel directed by Kosinski, there are enough flashback scenes and minor Easter eggs to spark the memories of fans of the original while simultaneously informing newcomers of any back story they need to know. With that said, it isn't entirely necessary to have seen the original to understand the full scope of the sequel's story, except for one major thing.In order to fully grasp the importance of Maverick taking Rooster under his wing (pun very much intended), you need to be familiar with Maverick's close friendship with Goose in the first film. Since Rooster is Goose's son, the audience needs to know why Maverick is so insistent on ensuring his safety. The use of selected flashbacks to remind viewers of how close the two were would have been very helpful here, not just for the uninitiated but older fans as well. Unfortunately, the film only briefly glances over this, so some of the emotional impact will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen the original. Aside from that, everything else in the film is conveyed very effectively, especially with how Maverick is able to have remained such a skilled pilot after so many years.I'm sure many will agree that one of the best things about the original film was its brilliantly shot dogfights. Even today, they still stand out as some of the best choreographed, best edited aircraft combat scenes in cinematic history. But if you thought it would be impossible to outdo such exhilarating moments all these years later, you'd be dead wrong. This film takes what made each of those scenes so memorable in the first place and triples their entertainment value. The third act alone is one of the most exciting, nail-biting climaxes I've seen in recent memory. Planes pass through beside one another and flip upside-down with such jaw-dropping precision that you'd swear it was done through CGI. But no, according to some research, there's not a single bit of CGI used during these flight scenes. Instead, it is all real manoeuvrability pulled off by highly skilled pilots coupled with an equally skilled cinematographer. And best of all, there isn't any use of shaky cam to ruin the whole experience. Reportedly, these creative decisions were made at Tom Cruise's insistence so we have him to thank for that.Even after more than three decades, Tom Cruise is more than capable of delivering another exciting performance here that, like everything else in this film, is better than the original. His take on an older Maverick is quite satisfying to watch, showing that despite the whole world changing around him, he has remained true to himself throughout even the worst of times. It amazes me that this man is almost in his 60s but can still hold his own both physically and mentally alongside much younger cast members. Regardless of what you may think of his personal life, you've got to hand it to someone this committed to giving the audience exactly what they want.I also liked Miles Teller as Rooster, the young and ambitious son of Maverick's late best friend Goose. When he was first introduced, I half expected him to be arrogant and unlikeable given the hostility some of his fellow pilots initially show towards Maverick, but for the most part he tries to remain respectful. As the movie progresses, you really get the sense that Maverick and Rooster are forming a surrogate father/son bond, which makes their interactions so much more interesting. Without giving away spoilers, the film's final act makes great use of their teamwork, especially when things seem at their lowest point.In this growing age of nostalgia-based sequels, it is a pleasant surprise to see one that not only eclipses the original in mere entertainment value but also redeems it of some of its faults. Many years from now, people will look back on \"Top Gun: Maverick\" as a textbook example on how to do a sequel right, from the action scenes to the character motivations. Companies like Disney should take note because there's a difference between expanding upon an old story and milking a dormant franchise until it's completely dry. I can't help but wonder if there will be more belated 80s film sequels to look forward to in the future, because this one has truly taken my breath away. Regardless, I'd say things are looking pretty good.I rate it a solid 9/10.",

There's so many things to admire and soak in.Tom Cruise. Enough said. The man will go down as a movie legend. Already was, but this movie shoots him into the stratosphere. His persona throughout, his guidance to the other actors. He's a real movie star. Up there with James Dean, Steve McQueen. A legend in his own right.The effects, if you can even call them that, are insane. I've never had so much fun in a cinema. You feel like you're right there in the cockpit because the actors really are. Makes such a difference to know it was all shot for real. Will make it very tough for other airplane movies moving forward. Just breath taking stunts.So it's an instant classic. One you'll want to share with everyone you know. Take your kids, grandkids, so they don't miss it on the big screen. Like Jurassic Park, it's a moment in film history to enjoy being part of! A must-watch, movie event of the year. Worth the wait!

            "content": "Did Top Gun: Maverick meet my expectations? Yes it did and I'm so glad I got to experience it at the cinema, it has to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. The big reason being Tom Cruise who served as producer along with returning as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. At the insistence of Tom Cruise, there are minimal green screen and CGI aerial shots in the film, and even the close up cockpit shots are taken during real in-flight sequences. This meant that much of the cast had to undergo extensive G-force training sessions, to withstand the physical demands of the G-force pressures during flights. That's the main reason why the experience was so epic, the jet sequences were top notch and sounded perfect. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is superior to its predecessor in every way. With the aerial flight sequences and emotional weight being better by miles. I also need to praise the cinematography, it was visually a stunning looking movie.After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him.The cast includes many well known and recognizable actors, names like: Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, Ed Harris and Val Kilmer.Top Gun: Maverick was directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie, from a story by Peter Craig and Justin Marks. I found the writing to be such an improvement than the previous film, with it feeling more mature and just succeeding better with its themes. The direction was also quite great. The sound design, musical score and soundtrack was brilliant, the two latter ones being what made the first Top Gun iconic. With songs like Danger Zone returning, the addition of Slow Ride and Won't Get Fooled Again is used perfectly. The editing is another highlight.Though the film is similar to other action movies, maybe too similar to the first Top Gun. I still feel like it was an unforgettable experience and extremely entertaining, and at the end of the viewing, my high expectations were met. Tom Cruise was the reason this film worked for me, making the first film to have actors flying and doing all the aerial sequences. Just wow. Tom Cruise personally designed a 3-month aviation training course for the new actors to become ready to handle riding in an F-18. It made the film stand out like no other film. Another thing that stood out was how it was shot entirely on IMAX-certified Sony Venice 6K full frame cameras, specially developed for the film in order to shoot the cockpit sequences. Top Gun: Maverick will most likely go down in history as a box office hit and also a brilliant action film.",

The film was completely ruined by the childish love (lust) story. So much so that I never finished watching that film.I therefore wasn't really interested in seeing 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Boy, am I glad I decided to give it a try! I actually can't believe how GOOD this movie was! So much so, in fact, that it is one of the best movies I've seen lately. There was just so much here I enjoyed!Tom Cruise reprises his role as Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell. The film is set 30 years after the events of 'Top Gun'. Maverick is a Captain in the navy and one of the best pilots. He is ordered back to TopGun, where he is to instruct twelve elite Top Gun graduates for a dangerous mission. Their target is an underground uranium plant in a canyon, which has to be destroyed before it becomes operational.The first two acts follow Maverick guiding and teaching the graduates, and it was pure excitement all the way. He found ways for them to bond as a team, so they could work together. I actually enjoyed this part of the movie. But, by golly, was that final act exciting!!! It was breathtaking with stunningly good action sequences. I mean, jaw dropping! It was insanely good!!I also loved the fact there were no annoying comic relief characters. In fact, there were NO annoying characters. No silly one-liners. No attempts at humour. It was excellent, believable storytelling. Tom Cruise gives an emotional performance. Penny (Jennifer Connelly) allowed for the romance interest. Unlike the 'love story' in 'Top Gun', here it was beautiful and realistic, and above all romantic.The aerial stunts, photography and cinematography are amazing, and the film also has a beautiful score. 'Top Gun: Maverick' was just the perfect movie in every way. This was STUNNING!",

The plot is very simple; here, he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger pilots, among them the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Lieutenant Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, to eliminate a uranium target. That's it. But the sheer finesse and bravour with which Cruise, Connelly, Teller and Kosinsky pull this off is impressive.Spectacular action, stunning cinematography, a great score paying homage to it's original predecessor Topgun (1986), is all perfectly executed, and that justifies its cheesy style and simple plot.

Guess that old geesers like me that did see the 1986 versions will be fulfilled equally as young guys that haven't seen the 1986 version.

            "content": "\"Don't think. Just do.\"Top Gun: Maverick is such an invigorating and riveting film. It is packed with action, humor, and has a ton of heart. In addition, the film packs an emotional punch, and tackles the main conflict with sincerity and pathos. Top Gun: Maverick has quite a simple narrative and can be followed fairly easily. This was definitely a memorable and a once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience (at least for me). It's veered in suspense and excitement. I was utterly enthralled by the amazing visuals and earth-shattering soundtrack. Lady Gaga deserves a Grammy for her hit song \"Hold My Hand\" which is featured in the film's end credits. This song fits perfectly to the mood of the film. My favorite scene is when Rooster and Maverick steal a plane from the Iranian military. Also, the opening scene where Maverick tries to reach Mach 10 is quite chill- and anxiety-inducing. The cherry on top is that some humor is sprinkled throughout the film which makes the viewing experience even better. The film is immersive from the get-go and maintains its momentum till the credits roll. I was left in awe and could not leave the cinema until the credits were over. I liked the idea from the producers and director to include flashbacks of the original 1986 film. As someone who hasn't seen the first film, this stylistic element helped to understand the context behind Maverick and Rooster's strained relationship.Final verdict: 9.7/10.",

The movie was really tight.. and I think it could have used a bit more room to breathe in between the action scenes.. and with the characters so we got to know them a bit more. But a great ride and I'm looking forward to seeing it again as soon as possible. So fun!I also really appreciated the filmmakers dedicating the movie to Tony Scott.

Arguably the best movie I've ever seen on the big screen and one of the best movies I've seen in a while period. In what I think is Tom Cruise's best movie, he shows how much he's matured as an actor and how far he'll go to bring the audience a realistic movie void of any over the top cgi which seems to plague so many modern movies today. I'll admit I didn't want to see it a second time even though I really liked it the first go around, I did it because my Mom wanted to watch it again and so I went with her and my Dad. As I said before I loved this movie, not only the great, realistic plane sequences, but the story and the characters, every single one of them. I think this is the movie that finally cements Tom Cruise as not only one of the greatest action stars of all time, but the best in my opinion. Top Gun: Maverick reminds me of one simple fact. There's nothing like a good action movie, even better when it's a sequel that far surpasses the original.",

And the visuals are fantastic during the flights scenes.The part I personally liked most, as someone who knows a lot of military, former and current, was that the movie also showed those who support the flyers.

            "content": "30 years after the events of the first film Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has purposefully avoided advancement in the Navy and continues to operate as a test pilot even in the face of pressure from the pentagon to shift focus to unmanned drones. Following an incident where Maverick takes a prototype jet passed the limit, Maverick seems poised for a discharge however thanks to the intervention of Maverick's former wingman Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), Maverick is instead transferred back to TOPGUN to train a batch of 12 pilots for a mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in a hostile nation-state before it can be activated in three weeks' time. Of 12 fighter pilots, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller) has a history with Maverick as Rooster still carries animosity towards Maverick over the loss of his father and Maverick's wingman Goose and the fact Maverick pulled Rooster's academy papers and derailing his career. During this time Maverick also rekindles his romance with an old flame in Penny (Jennifer Connelly)Undeniably Top Gun is one of the biggest cultural benchmarks of the 80s as the film was not only the highest grossing film of 1986, but it's also responsible for launching the careers of Tom Cruise as an A-list leading man and director Tony Scott as a uniquely identifiable hand behind blockbuster filmmaking with his high-speed editing and magic hour photography influencing an entire generation of filmmakers. Despite being Tom Cruise's first major blockbuster, Cruise had initially expressed no interest in doing a follow-up as he said as much during a press tour for Born on the Fourth of July in 1990. During 2010 however negotiations began with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Tony Scott, Tom Cruise and Paramount about a follow-up to Top Gun addressing the end of the dogfighting era and rise in drone warfare, but the development was curtailed with the unfortunate suicide of Tony Scott in 2012 leaving the projects fate in doubt. Eventually the project regained traction in 2017 with Oblivion director Joseph Kosinski reteaming with cruise as director and the film began production in 2018 but was delayed from its original 2019 release due to the complexity of the aerial sequences and became the poster child for Covid delays as Top Gun: Maverick much like the James Bond film No Time to Die went through a cycle of release dates and reschedules as offers from streaming were rejected by Cruise who insisted it be released in theaters. Once released the film became the biggest of Cruise's career making nearly $1.5 billion against its $170 million budget and has earned rave reviews from both critics and audiences to boot. Top Gun: Maverick is not only a worthy sequel to Top Gun, but in many ways it exceeds its predecessor while also revisiting everything that worked about it the first time.As with the previous film, Top Gun: Maverick is a showcase for some incredible aerial photography. What really helps sell the illusion is that the actors actually were in the jets for interior shots during filming giving authentic reactions to traveling at those speeds while for exterior shots actual US Navy pilots flew and to see some of the elaborate aerial sequences and know they're done without CGI is truly a sight to behold and really shows the enduring appeal of Tom Cruise as an action star because he dives (quite literally) into the action. Top Gun set the standard for how to approach aerial photography and despite attempts by imitators such as Fire Birds, Iron Eagle, or (heaven help you) Stealth, no one has surpassed that standard until now as Maverick features some of the most intricate and engaging aerial dogfights and sequences ever captured on film with the editing and filming making you feel as though you're in the seat of the action.Of course, if Top Gun: Maverick just delivered on the spectacle it would just be an above average actioner, but the movie does give some solid story and characterization that was lacking from the first film and allows Cruise to deliver one of the best performances of his career. With Cruise's approach to Maverick, it's very much a reflective piece as like Maverick Cruise is getting up in years and he's still the best at pulling these dare devil stunts (such as in his Mission: Impossible series) but eventually he will have to let go despite his best efforts to do otherwise. It's undeniably the character interactions that have made this movie as resonant as it has been as like many modern \"legacy sequels\", we do have a fresh faced batch of recruits playing against the veterans of this IP, but they're much better written than you typically see in this type of film and especially in Miles Teller as Rooster who's the emotional core of this movie. With Maverick and Rooster there's something of an estranged father/son dynamic as Maverick still carries the weight of Goose's death very close and has tried to respect Goose and his dead wife by protecting Rooster even if that means Rooster hating him, it's emotional scars like this that really held me with the movie, but easily the biggest was with Val Kilmer reprising his role as Iceman who has been dealing with throat cancer (like the real life Kilmer) and despite Iceman's presence in this film being mostly via text, it's the buildup to the major scene where Kilmer and Cruise come together one final time in a scene that was heavy with emotional resonance especially if you know the off camera animosity between Kilmer and Cruise that came during Top Gun and there's something cathartic and emotionally cleansing about this scene that's already good in its own right but adds even more when taken into context for the real life undertones.Despite the strengths of Top Gun: Maverick I do have some criticisms. I personally didn't feel the romance with Jennifer Connelly's Penny was all that developed and it felt a little unnecessary given all the other elements on display. The fact that Penny is an \"old flame\" of Maverick's also struck me as a little odd as it seemed like maybe there was an initial draft where this character was Kelly McGillis' character Charlie but now it's a wholly original character, but it doesn't feel like we have the attachment to this character that we should. Connelly is perfectly fine in the role, but this is more a hiccup of the writing. I also felt it was rather humorous just how far out its way the movie went to keep its antagonist faceless because the enemy nation state is never given a name (not even one of those fake names with the \"istan\" suffix) and even in the climax where we get a look at the ground there's absolutely no identifiable markings, language, or even geography to identify where we are relative to the rest of the world so our antagonist is basically a faceless swarm of missiles and jets. I will say at least the movie is built up to this climax as opposed to the original where the climax was tacked on, but the lack of a tangible antagonist does seem rather odd but given the importance of the international market I understand why they did this, and there have been instances like this all the way back to the 1950s such as with Captain Nemo's \"Hated Nation\" from the Disney adaptation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.Top Gun: Maverick delivers on the thrills of the original film and exceeds in the story and characters and making for a more enjoyable sit. While I did have issues with the film such as the lack of an antagonist character and the Penny character feeling slightly extraneous, the film works well where you expect it to and delivers the action and entertainment that has become synonymous with Cruise. I don't think I agree with this being Cruise's \"best\" movie as I personally think Live Die Repeat and Mission: Impossible 1,4,5 & 6 are more entertaining on the whole, but this is still really solid blockbuster filmmaking.",

            "review_title": "Nostalgia at its best",
            "content": "While reaction to this 36-years-later sequel is overwhelmingly positive, it is inevitable that there are cynics who characterize \"Top Gun: Maverick\" as not more than an ample collection of clich\u00e9. However, if clich\u00e9 can be made to look so good, keep them coming!People who watched the original \"Top Gun\" 3 decades ago may find their memory somewhat vague (or not). It would have been the same for me had I not made an effort to watch it again recently (and still felt the excitement). Those who tell you that \"Top Gun: Maverick\" can be seen as a stand-alone are only half-right. The moviemaker have indeed made every effort to give the audience a complete \"what happened before\", through dialogues and flashbacks. But the emotional pull is not the same as having recently watched \"Maverick\" (1986). To those who have never seen the original, my advice would definitely be to see it prior to watching the current sequel.This nostalgia trip recreates and repackages scene and moments from the original, in a way that is both familiar and new. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is still here, some thirty years older, but with the same dauntless spirit. His best buddy Goose who died in the originally is represented by his son, the cute little chap we saw briefly in the original, now a top-notch pilot \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller). \"Iceman\" (Val Kilmer), rival and friend, is still around, but an invalid. For romance, while we have a new character Penny (Jennifer), the tender love scenes reminisces those with Charlie (for Charlotte) in the original. Even the beach volleyball scene is replaced by a beach \"dogfight football\" scene (offense and defense lumped together) that involves all the 12 potential candidate for the final team of 6 for \"the mission\" (I'll come to that). As to the hair-raising circus in the air, those looking for nostalgia from \"Top Gun\" (1986) will not be disappointed. If they are also Star Wars fans, there is an additional bonus.Here's how things goes. Picking up from where we left off, using dialogues and flashbacks, Pete stayed as Top Gun instructor for only two months and returned to the field (including Bosnia, Iraq). With proliferation of decorations, he \"should have made a 2-star admiral\" but remains a captain to-date. \"Your kind is heading for extinction\" comments Rear Admiral Chester Cain (Ed Harris) who has summoned him to tell him that he has been posted back to Top Gun on a critical mission. Realizing that this is likely the opportunity for his last hurrah, Pete is a little disappointed to find out that he is there only to teach the team but not to take part in the actual action himself. Still he throws everything he has into this challenge.A word about this \"mission\". The thing that wouldn't escape your notice is that while in the original there was a clear adversary, the Soviet Union (it was the Reagan era), this time the absence of any geopolitical reference is conspicuous. The strike target is a nuclear plant but the location, and thus the power behind it, is vague. Enemy aircrafts look generic. During the dogfight scenes, enemy pilots' faces are entirely wrapped in black helmets. It may as well be Darth Vader behind the mask, or a Martian, for that matter.Throwing himself completely into the task, Pete starts by dumping the inches-thick playbook into the garbage can. \"I'm sure you all know it inside out\" brings a round of mixed cheers and jeers. \"So does your enemy\", he crisply adds. \"What they don't know is you limits, which I'll keep pushing in the next 3 weeks\", he concludes he opening speech. This promise he makes good, relentlessly.Upon his first encounter with his class, Pete messages Ice (whose strong recommendation had landed him this job) \"they are not ready\". \"That's why you're here\" comes the reply, without missing a beat. Later, we witness a most poignant scene, Pete visiting Ice for support and advice when things get tough. Because of throat cancer, Ice can hardly speak but uses typed messages to communicate. Finally he struggles to whisper his encouragement. Their parting banter brings back bitter-sweet nostalgia. Ice: \"who is the best pilot, you or me?\" Pete: \"This is a nice moment, let's not ruin it.\" The heart-wrenching poignancy is that Ice's excruciatingly painful ailment, while scripted, reflects the actor Val Kilmer's predicaments in real life. That Kilmer courageously accepted this role brings tears to one's eyes.What does this team comprise, these cream of Top Gun graduates? More diversified than Pete's time, that's for sure. There are initially twelve from which six is to be selected, with the remainder as reserves. The most notable among the selected are \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell) the updated version of Ice (no relations though), \"Phoenix\" (Monica Barbaro), with looks to kill but obviously not selected for her looks, and nerdy \"Bob\" whose uses his real name for his call sign. And, of course, forget aforementioned \"Rooster\", son of \"Goose\".The best way to describe the mission is: the gauntlet-running climax in the original Star Wars, plus a few additional bells and whistles. Its successful completion requires \"two miracles\" and that doesn't include bringing the team home alive. THAT depends on something called the \"coffin corner\", their success in negotiating it. The Top Gun in-charge \"Cyclone\" (John Hamm) explains to Pete that \"every mission has risks and they accept that\". \"I don't, sir\", Pete snaps back. He wants to push the team to unimaginable limits (the only way to succeed in the mission) AND have all of them back home alive. At this apparent horn-locking, Cyclone debates with himself whether he should fire Pete or, \"shall I risk my career and appoint you team leader?\" At which point the second-in-command enlightens Pete \"I think it's a rhetorical question\".Top Gun: Maverick's success can be attributed to the synchronization of all the key cinematic elements: cinematography, background music, editing and sound (especially sound, for this movie). However, at the end of the day, it's the cast.There are solid veterans such as Harris and Hamm, particularly the latter. Watching Hamm's \"Cyclone\" as the full embodiment of military authority, it is difficult to imagine him as the over-the-board outlandish crook, Buddy, in \"Baby Driver\" (2017). Watching Kilmer, as mentioned, is heartbreaking.The two key supports both shine, in different ways: Teller and Connelly. While young, Teller is already quite a veteran. His most riveting performance today is in the TV series \"The Offer\" (2022) where he is the lead, portraying Albert S. Ruddy, the producer of \"The Godfather\". If you like Teller's in \"Top Gun: Maverick\", \"The Offer\" is highly recommended. Connelly has never turned in a bad performance in her 53 acting credits. Here, she radiates charm, and more charm. While there is little background to her character other than Pete's old flame, the chemistry between Connelly and Cruise is captivating. Kelly McGillis in the original Top Gun is a hard act to follow. Connelly has filled in the vacuum splendidly.At the end of the day, it's Tom Cruise. Critics have written plenty in his praise, just for this movie. So, all I am going to say here is that Cruise is testimonial proof that stardom is alive and well.",

            "content": "I have no words to describe this movie. And I believe most of the reviewers don't either. I hope I am not overstepping when I say this movie is the spiritual and, in some ways, superior successor to its predecessor. The fact that most of the plane scenes and stunts were filmed in real life, the cinematography was reminiscing yet breath-taking, the music beautifully composed and the characters engaging and charming; elevates the movie to the stratosphere.What Top Gun brought to the 80s when it came out, this movie brings to an updated era (today) that desperately needed this kind of movie. A movie that even though it's one of those \"yet another sequel to revive (or start) a franchise\", dares to be great. Where sequel movies from franchises like Terminator, Ghostbusters and Matrix, fail to relaunch the franchise; this one passes with flying colors and with great action filmmaking to back it up.The callbacks and soundtrack pushes the emotional moments of the characters forward while establishing new arcs for them in a brilliant concise way. It's not trying to be a deeply layered movie, it delivers a great emotional core and conflict for the main characters while keeping all the flying scenes enthralling and impactful. Even more so than on the first one. Perceived today as a \"love letter\" to the 80s movies, Top Gun was a simple charming blockbuster movie with a very young Tom Cruise to drive it entirely as he navigates through the parade of archetypical characters and a cheesy (yet endearing) romance. Elements I enjoy quite much but which now perhaps wouldn't work for a modern audience. However, this movie makes it work. It plays with archetypes to establish strong emotional connections, relationships and quips that feel charming and amusing.IN CONCLUSION, The movie overall delivers what everyone liked about the original but through an updated lense, new characters; emotional, visual and musical references to the past while building a strong concluding future; and finally and most importantly, while delivering an enthralling and gripping actions stunts and mission very reminiscing of those \"Impossible Missions\" of the latest Tom Cruise involved MI. I went in with no expectations at all and left with a changed heart. I may have forgotten the first Top Gun, but I for sure would never forget (and probably would revisit) this one. A bombastic, chilling, real-stunt-made, old school blockbuster movie that delivers great action, music and character work. I'm glad to learn I can still be surprised, glad to learn not all old-franchise-reviving-sequels have to be (only) a cash grab.",

All of this worked for decades, before some post-post-structuralists decided to dismantle it. It seems like, they didn't win for gods sake. It's also amazing how the team managed to transport the vibe of the first instalment to this second iteration without making it feel dated. I just really wish, that directors and producers will pick up on this success story and apply this winning formula onto modern-day topics as well. As the movie pointed it out: You have to let go. But the basic principle of heroes actually succeeding without annoying the audience with \"the dark side of the character\" is a winning principle, that will hopefully be applied to many other topics as well - not just action movies.",

Tom Cruise gives it his all in the movie, and you can see that being expressed! Maverick is a compelling character with motivations and character development, and it's a perfection arc. The film does a very well job at pacing its story, and not rushing anything while being hella entertaining!It does a good job at everything, and balances everything super nicely. I'm still unpacking everything I just saw, and am seeing it again this Wednesday, I might edit this review and add more Positives, or even some Negatives! But, as for my Out of the Theatre Review, this movie is a huge win in my book and I found it to be way superior over the first movie, doing everything right!SECOND VIEWING: Perfection. Tom Cruise is perfection. The visuals are perfection. The sound quality is perfection. This movie deserves all the success it's getting. Get Maverick to a Billion at the Box OfficeCurrently at 9/10- Subject to Change.",

I like how Val Kilmer's real life throat cancer was incorporated into the story, producing poignant moments. I was surprised how emotional I was at the end of the movie. Well done.The other important element of Cruise movies is the verisimilitude of the action sequences. The man is amazing in his willingness and ability to do practical stunts.

The next two films coming out are in my top 5 on my watchlist over the next year. (May have to wait a bit longer on the second.) But why Maverick worked so well, is that it is essentially built around the Mission Impossible structure. Christopher McQuarrie has written the last two and the next two MI films and he was also one of the writers here. Since he also wrote my favorite film of the last 25 years, \"The Usual Suspects\" I think I can call him my favorite film writer. But think about how this film unfolds. It is exactly like the MI films. There is a mission that is planned for and is almost impossible to complete. Our hero develops a top notch team with unmatched skills and pulls it off. We are prepared for what the dangers are and when they are encountered we are on the edge of our seats. My favorite film of the year. And I think Christopher McQuarrie needs a special shout out , for what he undoubtedly did to help make this film so special.",

            "content": "I've been a Joseph Kosinski defender ever since seeing TRON: Legacy, and it's nice to have some vindication seeing the acclaim Top Gun: Maverick is getting. (I think most Kosinski criticism comes from failed wanna-be's, jealous since they never got a big blockbuster thrown into their laps). This is now the second home run for Kosinski when it comes to reviving an 80s product, modernizing it while still retaining respect.I wasn't even necessarily the biggest fan of the original Top Gun (Tony Scott is essentially a lower budget Michael Bay) but it was still decent. And despite TG:M being one of those dreaded 'legacy sequels' we have too many of these days, it can stand on its own cinematic feet without support from the original. (Again, much like TRON). Tom Cruise deserves much of the credit here-much like the character Maverick he's pushing the actors to their limits, to the point of using real planes for the aerial sequences, and you will certainly be able to tell as the pilots' heads are twisted around and their faces visibly pummeled with the gravitational effect. Add that to a story well told and the movie is an unexpected success, confounding the 'movies are dead' streaming simps and illustrating William Goldman's iconic summary of the movie business: 'Nobody knows anything'.Side Note: It's so nice to watch something that doesn't involve actor's heads transplanted on CGI cartoon bodies. The movie still isn't the most terribly realistic, but then neither was the original in some ways.Side Note: Again, I think Kosinski is really the only Hollywood heir to innovative greats like Robert Zmeckis, James Cameron- -even George Lucas (at least in terms of unique sound design). If you read about Tron Legacy or Oblivion you can find out how both these films were way ahead of the curve technology-wise, and now TG: M shows a similar skill in practical effects. Fingers crossed for his upcoming film Spiderhead, though that is on Netflix and we all know how standards are there.*Actually, James Cameron is returning this year with another long-delayed sequel.

            "review_title": "Mixed feelings...but I didn't hate it (first one still better though)",
            "content": "I was a teenager when the original Top Gun came out in 1986 and it was spectacular. I do believe that it has really stood up well to the test of time. It had a wonderful cast...Val Kilmer (my crush at the time), Tom Skerritt, Meg Ryan, Anthony Edwards, Kellie McGillis, Tim Robbins, and it really launched Tom Cruise's career. The film also had a fantastic soundtrack that was lead by Berlin's \"Take my Breath Away\"and Kenny Loggins' \"Danger Zone\". The story was tightly told and worth every penny of my hard earned money to see it in the theater. If you haven't seen it.... I highly recommend it.Now for this sequel...I went in thinking the original was perfect, why do we need a second film? I will start by saying that I really appreciated the effort made to resurrect the character of \"Ice Man\" and use the original actor Val Kilmer, who was my personal favorite in the original film. Along those same lines, I am disappointed that no effort was made to include Meg Ryan's original character as the mother of \"Rooster\" and wife of \"Goose\" or Kelly McGillis' character as the feisty flight instructor \"Charlie\". I am guessing they wanted a \"younger\" looking female to pair with the resurrected character of \"Maverick\" (Tom Cruise), which is why they picked Jennifer Connelly who is not only 10 years younger than Tom Cruise...but 13 years younger than Kelly McGillis. It saddens me as a female that Hollywood does not allow women to age and perpetuates the older man/younger woman relationship. Bit of a double standard. I have nothing against Jennifer Connelly, but I found her character confusing and out of place. I don't know if it was intended to be confusing, but between the implication of a previous relationship, the motorcycle and the house that looked identical to Kelly McGillis' character Charlie's...I felt like they were trying to just slip her in as the same person which created confusion for me and took me out of the story. The sailing humor...and the boat trip was really out of place, sealing the deal that Penny was no Charlie.I appreciated the story and the wonderful flight footage, great for any thrill seeker, but the best part of this film is the actor Miles Teller who plays \"Rooster\", the son of \"Maverick's\" deceased wingman \"Goose\". It was a nice tie-in to the original film and if it didn't exist might have made this film a pass for me...but it's existence and the flight footage keep this film as a recommend.Rough plot aging navy pilot and loose cannon \"Maverick\" (who has learned nothing in the thirty years since the last film) is brought back to Top Gun to train the best of the best for a super secret but necessary mission to destroy an unnamed enemy's nuclear site. It is an impossible mission and Maverick is the only one who can do it...cue the dramatic music, beach football (personally I preferred the beach volleyball in the original film...a must see for the ladies), and amazing flight footage.This film was very testosterone heavy (you either like it or hate it)...the women were forgettable and almost an afterthought, not like in the original film where you have such memorable scenes as Meg Ryan shouting \"take me to bed or loose me forever\" and who could forget motorcycles, white sheets and Kelly McGillis. This film distinctly lacked the sexiness of the first film and the overall female touch...which makes the film very unbalanced towards the testosterone, but if you are ok with that...the rest of the film is good.So my highest compliment is, I didn't hate it.",

            "review_title": "Top Gun: Maverick Doesn't Just Meet Expectations, it Soars Past Them",
            "content": "With it's enduring popularity and influence in pop culture, I always wondered why they never churned out a sequel to Top Gun. After reading a little bit about the behind the scenes of this movie, some of it had to do with Tom Cruise's dissatisfaction of how the original Top Gun was shot. I walked into the theatre hoping for some eye-popping and thrilling stunt sequences and Maverick certainly delivered on that front. The action was breathtaking to see on the theatre screen, leave it to Cruise and his team to bring some juice to the acrobatics to help re-invigorate the franchise for modern audiences. I can't speak to the technical specifications or how much of the movie is accurate to real life but nothing felt outlandish enough to shatter the illusion of the movie. The dogfighting and aerial manoeuvring will have you dipping and dodging in your seat and Top Gun: Maverick and even if you're not familiar with the previous film, it will keep you engaged while you get to know the characters.Transitioning to the character, we join Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell at the tail end of his career. He's satisfied with his current assignment (he's working as a test pilot) but he's still haunted by the events of the first movie. Over the course of the movie, he has to confront both his past demons and his career arc when he's ordered to start training pilots at Top Gun again. Val Kilmer also returns as Tom \"Iceman\" Kozansky, who has been acting as Maverick's shield, keeping him in the Navy after all of his shenanigans. While TG: Maverick is very romantic when calling back to the original, the returning characters all were treated with care and their arcs feel organic from where the first one finishes. I also really enjoyed most of the new characters; Phoenix, Bob, Hangman, Payback, Coyote and Fanboy all are distinct and fun characters to watch develop. Rooster's conflict with Maverick is earned considering what's transpired between them. The only character I had a problem with was Cyclone who is just very one dimensional as the disapproving chief that's always on Maverick's case.Tom Cruise is a complete enigma off the screen but you can count on him to bring his 'A' game whenever he's starring in a big action movie (other than The Mummy..... but let's not talk about that). He's great as Maverick again, he nails both the \"wild card\" nature of him flying but also the emotionally conflicted man off the tarmac. I was pleasantly surprised by both Jennifer Connelly and her character of Penny. Penny looked like a throwaway love interest for Pete in the trailer but Connelly is so smooth and at ease in Penny's shoes and she is every bit as good as Cruise (although in a smaller role). Miles Teller is up to the task as Rooster, I haven't always been his biggest fan but he gives an intense performance with a couple of moments where he's allowed to be charasmatic. It was nice to see Val Kilmer again as Iceman, they do their best to fit him in with his limitations (he is almost unable to speak now) but his character's relationship punctuates Maverick's need to grow so well that I couldn't imagine the movie without him. Jon Hamm is fine in the movie, his character was problematic but that's not the fault of his performance. Bashir Salahuddin, Monica Barbaro and Lewis Pullman were the standouts for me in the new supporting players but the entire cast performed capably and nobody stuck out as being off key with their acting.If there's any fault to find in Top Gun: Maverick, it's that the movie is so jam packed with nostalgia and love for the original film. If you're a Top Gun superfan, this will be a positive as most of the call backs are done in an almost sweet way. But if you're part of the uninitiated, it could be a little grating. The sentimental/cheesy slant of the first one has carried over as well and one of the friends I saw this with was rolling her eyes consistently. I think the movie walks a fine line without being too corny but perhaps not everyone will feel that way. My last nitpick is that TG: Maverick can't seem to decide when it wants to wrap up, I thought the movie was steering towards wrapping up at least a couple of times but it just kept going.I was so pleased when I saw the box office numbers later in the same week for Top Gun: Maverick. It's a throwback that borders on too sentimental but with the awesome action set pieces, solid acting and good enough story about letting go of your past and learning to live with your demons, it's going to make my list of my favourite theatre experiences this year. If you haven't seen it already and are interested in a more old-school action blockbuster, this isn't your standard entry in the genre, it's exceptional and well worth your time.",

This avoids some of the silly plot tropes usually in these movies, but the ending, when Maverick and Rooster are shot down, walk onto an enemy base and steal an old F-14, is just silly. He also shoots down two fifth generation enemy fighters in this old, retired plane. Why did the enemy have one? Because: Plot. But it was fun.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the first Top Gun movie from 1986. This sequel is directed by Joseph Kosinski, the director of Oblivion and TRON: Legacy. In the film, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is called back by the Navy after more than thirty years of service as a Top Gun pilot. Here he is asked to train new Top Gun pilots for an important and dangerous military mission. During these training sessions, Maverick tries to train the young pilots in his own ways, so that they can push their own limits. In this way he hopes to send them more successfully on this mission and to be able to see them alive again at home base. Due to the difference of generations and the clashing arrogance between Maverick and the younger pilots, this is just not as simple as Maverick had hoped.After about thirty years, they manage to present this second Top Gun film in a modern, yet also recognizable way. There are many moments in this new film that fans of the first film can recognize and appreciate. Furthermore, there are also enough moments to make the film more approachable for the younger generation. So young and old can both enjoy this film. It's nice to see Tom Cruise now in a leadership role teaching younger pilots. Compared to the first film, for example, he has now changed from student to teacher, who tries to do everything in his own way. Because of this, he sometimes gets into trouble with the people above him, but he tries to stand his ground for a successful end result for himself and his students. They have beautifully portrayed this sequel and actually filmed it all at the request of Tom Cruis. For example, no green screen or CGI recordings were used. Thanks to improved filming techniques and this way of filming, the film feels more realistic as if you are actually in a cockpit during these aircraft training sessions and missions. For this realistic feel and way of filming, they used real airplanes. A large part of the film cast also had to meet many physical demands such as undergoing real G-force training sessions. As a result, most new members of the film cast deliver better and more realistic work during their airplane scenes. Only a few have used a stunt double, but fortunately this is not reflected in the film. The actors who play the pilots in training come across well as a joint group of students. Because of the script, the film also focuses on other things besides their group, so that the group does not always come across as strong as a joint group. Things went a bit better with the older group from the first film. With this new group you only really get to know the students who eventually go on the dangerous mission. In addition to the training scenes and final mission, the film is also about Maverick trying to work on a new romantic relationship with Peggy Benjamin played by Jennifer Connelly. Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly have good chemistry with each other in the film, but it just isn't as strong as the chemistry Tom Cruise had with Kelly McGillis in the first Top Gun film. Kelly McGillis is unfortunately not in this sequel, because the director and writers couldn't really think of a role for her character in the front of this sequel. Kelly McGillis herself has indicated that she probably has not been asked back either, because she has grown older and did not want to train herself again for the role. Returning actor Val Kilmer has more of a cameo in this film, as due to his declining health he is unfortunately no longer able to do much acting.",

            "content": "After thirty years in the Navy Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell finds himself back at top gun training the best of the best to fly a mission that has never been flown before.This is so far one of the best films this year, and easily beats out the original. From top to bottom this film is exciting and visually stunning but the unexpected addition of a few elements is what pushes it over the top.The relationship between Tom Cruises Maverick and Miles Tellers Rooster is what makes this movie so great, just as the relationship between Maverick and Goose was in the original. But the relationship that really improves is the romantic one between Maverick and Jennifer Connelly's Penny. The original film had a relationship but it took up too much screen time and didn't feel real, this time around the relationship is much more subtle and managed far better.The entire cast of students is great and you can really feel the sense of a team growing during their training.The flight scenes are incredible, every shot is picture perfect and you can feel the urgency throughout the entire film.In terms of gripes there really aren't many. The only thing I would have like to see more of was the relationships between the students. Like I mentioned you can feel the sense of team throughout but individually I would've like to see a bit more.Overall this film is incredible it is top to bottom fun and the added elements of quality characters make for a very meaningful film.9.5/10\nA+",

            "content": "So, I haven't even seen the first one (or if I did, it was so long ago I can't remember it), and it has taken me awhile to bother watching this one...not really a genre that interests me. But what is not to like about seeing jet planes shooting through the air at Mach 10.... WITHOUT the use of CGI, but the real thing. And wow, you certainly can tell.The thing that impressed me most was the lack of \"The Message\" being shoved down my throat - Hollywood take note, this is what people want, not what MCU/Disney is churning out now...forced diversity and all that nonsense. Just a good ol' fashioned story. I am hoping that the \"Woke Go Broke\" message is finally getting through to the studios - it ain't what people want.Anyway, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. I always love a bit of Jennifer Connelly, and I thought Miles Teller was excellent in War Dogs - I am surprised he hasn't become more well known...well he certainly will be now! It was great to see the real thing on the screen, rather than CGI - it really does make a difference. I am a bit annoyed with myself for not getting my act together and seeing it at the Waterloo IMAX theatre in London - I kept meaning too. However, seeing it on my massive TV still did the trick, but I can imagine it would have taken the movie to another level seeing it with IMAX (is that \"with IMAX\", or \"on IMAX\", or \"in IMAX\" ...?)So if you are like me and not really a fan of gung-ho action movies, turn off ya brain and go see it anyway - it's a blast!!",

Jerks like me on the internet will likely have a field day picking apart all the implausible material in this film.But the filmmakers present this story in a way that oozes sincerity and care for all the characters both old and new, and with a passion for entertaining the audience with pulse-pounding action set-pieces.This is an immensely satisfying film.

Rooster still bears a grudge against Maverick.An action-packed sequel to Top Gun (1986). The plot is quite cheesy, contrived and unrealistic and also quite predictable in many ways but the action more than makes up for this. Some incredible flying sequences, all done using actual aircraft rather than CGI.Tom Cruise does what he does best, be an all-action hero, and does it very well. Of the original cast, only he and Val Kilmer are in this one and Kilmer only has one scene. Jennifer Connelly fills in for Kelly McGillis as the love interest (one of the more predictable sub-plots within the film).

I don't know how much of that(if any) was calculated, but in hindsight, I suspect it only helped the film at the box office.Only a week removed from another nostalgic sequel, Jurassic World Dominion(5/10), I had become even hungrier-for(and more wary-of)something like this.No worries here.Maverick is an action film-lovers' delight. The flight sequences are beyond amazing, and the film doesn't skimp at all in this regard. The film has other strengths as well.It's kinda nice to not use or need as much CGI in a blockbuster action flick. The pacing and spacing of the action sequences is also well-balanced. The film never drags, and at the same time, it isn't sensory overload(think Transformers). It also borrows some things from some other action/aviation films; Firefox and Iron Eagle come to mind.Of course the film is very nostalgic, with many nods,references, characters, and plot continuations from the first film, but unlike Force Awakens, World Dominion, and others; Maverick takes very good care of most of these nostalgic moments. One nostalgic scene with Kilmer is deftly handled, and a love scene(or a lack of one) with newcomer Jennifer Connely(newcomer to TG anyway) is tactful. The last 30 minutes of the film is nonstop exhilaration, and the film is worthy of repeat viewings. That's not to say that some scenes aren't a little too \"safe\", because they are, nor to say the film doesn't have it's fair share of unrealistic moments, it does. Either way, the audience will be having way too much fun in the cockpit to care. Some of the emotional chords do ring true. Solid performances all-around never hurts.Miles Tellers \"Rooster\" is a perfect continuation of the maverick/goose storyline, but perhaps my biggest gripe with Top Gun Maverick is that Teller and his undeniable talent are perhaps under-used, and the film is one or two emotional scenes involving Rooster away from a 9/10 for me. It's very close to 9, and I may revisit after another viewing.Overall, I can recommend Maverick without hesitation - it exceeded already high(and even-further elevated) expectations. It shares some of the same strengths and weaknesses of the first film, but it's in that very rarified air where the sequel surpasses an already good original.83/100.",

And while I was satisfied with this sequel and denouement, I wanted more before the credits starts to roll, and oh boy did I get more. And after I could I could take no more. I still GOT MORE. I was in awe, at the edge of my seat, speechless and mindblowned.The IMAX 4k + insane manoeuvres, flights and stunts were incredible. That one scene where one enemy pilot avoid a missile by doing a spiralling-dead-butterfly-I-don't-know-what manoeuvre will stay with me for a long time and I almost started rooting for him afterwards.Yes Top Gun Maverick is a little on the nose and predictable but I had a blast watching it.

It includes the old heroes and some of their family members, but in a realistic historic way. Maverick is still Maverick and he will do \"whatever it takes\" and a true hero we can all root for. Val Kilmer is there in spite of his medical condition and the movie is done around it and a respectable way.The aviation hobbyists between us will appreciate the sky-high fighting actions, which are phenomenal and shows many kinds of planes and flying styles, all in-between constant action and solid progression of story-line. The movie-lovers will appreciate the solid character building, the dialogues and the quick pace up to its final conclusion.On topic of diversity and inclusion, there is a defensible representation here, but not in a 'woke' way, which is way too common in recent Hollywood productions. I feel many directors can learn from this movie how to appreciate women, and women of service in particular, without having to make the white male an immediate enemy.Overall very recommended, possibly this summer's greatest movie! I can see how a fan of the franchise will score this a '10' but for us, mere mortals, I feel it is a very solid 4 stars. Exact score: 82 / 100.",

            "content": "It's not often that I'll call a movie 'Perfect' but Top Gun Maverick is a perfect movie. Even more impressive, it joins a club of very rare movies whose sequels are actually better than their classic originals.As far as returning cast, Val Kilmer does so much with so little and leaves an indelible mark on the movie; likely his last.Charles Parnell's Warlock and Bashir Salahuddin's Hondo were great additions to the continuing story and played wonderfully alongside Tom Cruise, adding levity and sincerity with precision.Jennifer Connolly is simply stunning and endearing as Maverick's love interest. How she manages to look better with each passing year... one of life's greatest mysteries *wink wink*The young Top Gun class is as vibrant as they are diverse and echo the original class mightily. Their similarities are not hackneyed however, as said similarities allow us to see them through Maverick's lens as instructor, which informs his evolution and self-awareness. Watching the original movie recently certainly helps with this.Miles Teller shows again why he's one of the best actors of his generation. His range is on full display here and there are moments where he remarkably captures the essence of Anthony Edwards' Goose.This movie has everything... drama, love, nostalgia, action, comedy, wit, tear-jerking... I mean, EVERYTHING!The subtlety with which the nostalgia is dealt with is the masterstroke. Many directors/writers try to pack too much in, especially with massive gaps between installments... some get so caught up in wanting to recapture the spirit of the original that they end up doing an accidental remake; not this movie... as I said, it's perfect.RUN, don't walk, to the theaters to catch this on the big screen! It's definitely worth it!10/10.",

Great to see some of the classic characters back but the new ones hold their own, especially Rooster the son of Goose, Hangman and Bob. The relationships between all the characters are believable and grow well through the film.The action scenes are edge of your seat stuff, something to be said for not using CGI?Sometimes you wonder what is the point of sequels, this time I'm glad sequels exist just to see this outstanding film.

The movie didn't just explore the present era but also used the past to connect the two together in a masterful way. The story was good and believable plus the fact that no CGI (except for the enemy fighter jets which are SU-57 NATO designation \"Felon\", Russia's 5th Gen aircrafts) was used for the flight/dogfight scenes, definitely made the movie to be in a league of its own. The only reason that they had to use CGI to show off the Russian SU-57 \"Felon\" fighter jets was that I am sure Russia would not have permitted the use of their own best new 5th generation aircraft for an American movie where their aircrafts are blown out of the sky by 4th generation American fighter jets.The work these actors including Tom Cruise had to go through to capture the reality of all events was simply masterful and you see why Tom Cruise delivers again and again as a box office draw, even after decades of movies. Anyone who saw the 1st \"Top Gun\" 1986 movie have to see this movie because it's beyond a cult culture movie. I know this sequel is the last \"Top Gun\" movie and it saddens me because after watching this movie, I was left wanting. But, as the saying goes \"All good things must come to an end\". And this movie had it all, from start to finish. It gave me shivers and the nostalgia factors made me choke at times. That's how good this movie brought out emotions from the viewers who were of age to see the original 1986 movie when it first came out.Nothing in this movie was overboard, everything was carefully measured so that it would have a multitude of moments that touched every chord of emotions. I remember when the first Top Gun movie came out, the military had an incredible influx of men/women wanting to join the military's every different branches, some wanted to be pilots, some infantry, Army, Marines, Rangers, some special operators and so on. I wonder if this sequel will have the same effect of patriotisms that the first one had?Bottom line, if there's only one movie you could/would see out of all the other movies that are out and coming out right now, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the movie to watch. There's never been a movie like this and nor will there be another movie like it ever again. It's perfect in all its multiple facets and worth every penny to watch. So, if there's only one movie you can watch this summer, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the one to watch. I've already seen it 3 times.",

Exploration. Discovery. Learning. A year later I would be studying and flying to earn my Private license.My recollections of my youth always seem a little fuzzy and without crisp clarity but I wont forget how Top Gun (1986) left me feeling. It was a spectacle like no other I had ever seen. Everyone was young and beautiful. Cool beyond words. But those machines I fell for the machines. Since that time I have been a fighter jet nerd. Models, RC models, simulators and a career in civil aviation.Top Gun Maverick was setting up to be a complete failure as my outlook on such similar projects had be set by other failures of this nature. Supposed grandiose sequils/prequils ended up in flops. I have seen every aviation movie there is to see and I with few as an exception I have ended up just sitting there counting Hollywood's mistakes in their portrayal of flight and the endless minutia that surrounds it. I still have the expectation that things will be accurate. Really accurate. But mostly I am disappointed. You would think that with all that money they would hire at least a private pilot to consult and tell them which way the ailerons should move when a plane banks right.Within 5 minutes I didn't notice that my hands were clenched, and I was tensed up, a clear sign I had bought in. Not everything is perfectly correct, but Tom Cruise made sure that as much realism landed on film to lock in on the nerds like me. The number of flares before exhausted the manual pitch override lever to over G the airframe. Bullet count and difficulty in hitting a target.Another point. They didn't need to oversell the female fighter pilot idea. They didn't need to \"She Hulk\" this woman. She was short and stout, just like you want them for high G tolerance IRL. She worked just fine in the film. A smooth seamless fit.A wonderful movie. I can't remember when the last time I screamed at my monitor and clapped my hands \"F#%K Yeah!\" Who does that anymore?Nice work Tom. Those of us in the know understand it was your consultation that made this movie what it is.",

Maverick makes sure he doesn't get a promotion as this would not allow him to fly anymore & would keep him grounded.Top Gun: Maverick is a jaw-droppingly excellent film. Director Joseph Kosinski has given us a movie that has all the elements that made Top Gun(1986) a classic & cranks it up several notches. This results in a feel-good, action-packed & nostalgic adventure. The action/flying set pieces are phenomenal. What's super impressive is that all the actors actually shot the film inside real fighter jets & no CGI is used. These flying sequences are the highlight of the movie. Tom Cruise is spectacular as Capt. Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell. Cruise effortlessly steps back into the role that defined his career. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Penny Benjamin. Miles Teller is outstanding as Lt. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw. Jon Hamm & Charles Parnell are excellent as Adm. Beau 'Cyclone' Simpson & Adm. Solomon 'Warlock' Bates, respectively.

Also, I remember the original quite fondly, and I was eager to see Tom Cruise defying the natural deprivations of others his same age.On the last score, only, I was not disappointed. Elsewhere I could not go along with the overly lavish heaps of praise. Mr. Cruise's feats and the aircraft's stunts were impressive, but I could hardly tell one plane from another in the super-rapid editing, jumping from one wing of fighters to another in breathless, jumping-bean cuts.The closeups of pilots in their cockpits were framed alike, adding to the difficulty of following the aerial dog-fighting, and my attempts to read helmets for call signs were defeated much of the time by the choppy cutting.After a time, I just gave up, rested my eyes, and let auu major attraction of the movie-the meaningful movement of aircraft-go right over my head.I wanted to get into the characters' relationships. The parental legacy, in the person of the son of our hero's former flying buddy, was intriguing. But the complexity of real and undeserved guilt was never resolved in therapeutic detail. Instead, it-and far too many other issues of male bonding-were blurred, one guy couple to the next, in repetitious & predictably firm handclaps accompanied by long, silent eye contacts, deep soul-to-soul stares between macho buddies.I know guys are supposed to be long on the physical and short on the verbal, but couldn't they have some variation in the physical?Jennifer Connelly provides a welcome relief from all the maleness. She gives some real depth to her under-written character. I would have appreciated more development in her character's line.",

Dramatic tension is inevitable with one of the pilots, Rooster Bradshaw being son of Goose, Maverick's wing man in the iconic 1986 film of which this is the sequel.The plot is completely derivative and predictable, the characters two dimensional. But you know that before the film begins. Don't whinge about it.The flight photography is constantly stupendous and never confusing; the story rips along, very well paced by director Joseph Kosinski. There's a few meta jokes pertaining to the first film, again as you'd expect, and the soundtrack is superb.The film's main flaw, such as it is, is its casting imbalance. Tom Cruise dominates throughout; with one notable exception toward the end, none of the supporting cast ever really get a chance to shine.

It has everything the original had and more. Loved every minute and the time flew too quickly. Kudos to everyone involved in bringing us back in time-in a most modern way.

            "content": "Top Gun is one of those movies that you'd hear your parents reference all the time; about how influential it was and how awesome it felt to see it. At the time, when I was introduced to the first film by my mother, I found it to be 80's schlock (not that it's a bad thing) and it was pretty entertaining to say the least. I could see the influence it had during its time, and what came of it's pop culture. I do believe it rang true with lots of folks in that time frame.Fast forward a hefty amount of years, and this sequel comes out. Surprisingly, I had no interest at first, because I didn't really think it was necessary to have a sequel. With that said, I ended up going to see this in theaters with minimal expectations of a decent movie.Boy, was I surprised and blown away.Top Gun: Maverick is ONE of the best action films to see of all time, and that's not an overestimate to the genre either. This was top-notch solidified action intertwined with its predecessor's story, and it was such an amazing experience to have in theaters. Top Gun: Maverick to me was the Terminator 2 to our parents, in my eyes. It was such a good film, in so many ways.The sequences, the flying, the story, and the development and pacing were executed perfectly and felt very paced and very decently written. There's a lot to see in this film, and it respects the audience that had seen the original years ago. It's very opening for new fans and old fans alike, catering to both audiences knowing what it's about and what it gives to us.I could understand why the first movie was talked about so much, and why so many people loved the original, because the sequel only sealed the deal with what made it great originally. I'd recommend this to anyone, because it's a must-see for sure, and SEE IT IN THEATERS! You will not be disappointed that you did, this is a movie that has to be experienced in theaters. Do not waste the film's potential by staying at home to see it, it deserves the big screen.",

The views from the cockpit are incredibly realistic.This isn't your run-of-the-mill superhero flick, a reference made directly by the admiral played by Ed Harris in the beginning. The heroes don't wear tights and capes, just G-suits and regulation helmets when appropriate. The opening credits, another classic scene with classic Kenny Loggins.Seeing 'Iceman' and 'Maverick' on screen together again, that's pretty special. Thanks for that.",

            "content": "Today I wanted to talk about top gunning maverick and it was very very impressiveTo talk about the elephant in the room, I hate the first top gun. I think it is absolutely terrible. It's incomprehensible, it's boring, it has really bad action, it has a really forced subplot romance, it has bad acting, bad camera work, absolutely awful use of an otherwise good soundtrack, and end though this isn't a complaint, it's very homoerotic. I would give that movie a high 3/10.This movie handles every single element from the first top gun much better than the first top gun does. I really enjoyed this movie. The acting, cinematography, dialogue, romance subplot, action, story, and literally everything else that you can think about has been astronomically improved. I was genuinely impressed by the end of this movie.Let me talk about what I don't like first, the first thing is that again the Romance subplot feels kind of forced in, but the chemistry between Jennifer Connelly and Tom Cruise is very good and I believe their story, even if it is kind of the most unneeded part to the story. You could remove this part and I don't know if it would effect the story very much. I get why it's there, like relationships bring in another audience demographic.The dialogue can be very cheesy at some moments, like, too cheesy. Occasionally you'll get a nice drip of fondue on your movie and hopefully that's okay, it might bother some people more. I think I did cringe once unfortunately. Even with this, it's so much less corny and cheesy than the first one. Besides that, I can't really think of much I didn't like. Maybe the movie could have been about 10 minutes shorter, but I dunno.The story is leagues above the first movie. It is concise, it makes sense, it isn't incredibly boring and I believe the situation at hand. It makes sense to me the reactions to Tom cruises character, it makes sense to me for several events in the movie to be happening in the way they happened. Also I should mention I don't mind Kelly McGillis not being in the movie, like that's fine, she wasn't really important honestly and could have been removed from the first movie too lol.I really appreciate all of the characters... character? You can really enjoy almost everyones performances in this movie. Tom cruise does a mostly good job(there was one time he couldn't cry and he was blinking a lot he did that in the first movie too, that was kinda aggravating), as previously mentioned Jennifer Connely did a fantastic job with her role and the chemistry she has with Cruise really makes me believe her, all of the pilots did very good, but there was some inconsistency with Miles Teller, still good but I didn't believe everything, the pilot playing hangman gave a truly intimidating performance that was actually very good, and I liked bob.The story isn't the best part of this movie though, the action is so exhilarating. This movies action feels like a roller coaster. It is intense, it is fun, this movie never feels slow, especially during the action scenes. Some of the shots they get during the scenes is just incredible, it blows me away. Honestly, I'd recommend this movie mainly for this. It had my palms sweating, I was on the edge of my seat.The cinematography, sound design, soundtrack and sound mixing are all very impressive too. There are some genuinely jaw dropping shots in this movie. I really love the soundtrack and I would listen to all of the music in the movie on their own, but the way the film uses it is very effective.Overall I'd recommend this, very impressive movieLow 8/10.",

It feels like an 80's film with modern day sensibilities. I honestly didn't think Hollywood still had films like this left to deliver. The commitment to the Ariel Stunts paid off!!! I was blown away by what I was seeing, it was truly astounding! Hollywood needs to go back to practical effects in a big way in order to wow audiences again! Use CGI when needed but stop using it for every little thing. There's a shot of the jets getting in formation that you can tell was done for real and it honestly gave me chills!!! Cruise is clearly having fun playing one of his most famous characters again, he always commits to the theatrical experience and it 100%pays off here! The whole final act of this film kept me on the edge of my seat unlike anything in the last 5 years! I can't recommend this film enough,definitely needs to be seen on the big screen!!! 9/10.",

            "content": "I'm not the ideal audience for this movie: I was never a big fan of the original, and it's many years since I've seen it. But it's impossible for me to be unaware of its enormously iconic stature, and how prime a plot of the eighties cinematic landscape it occupies. The same goes for its decade-defining soundtrack, with 'Take My Breath Away' and 'Danger Zone' and the Harold Faltermeyer theme tune. The use of that theme in the sequel brings shivers up each time it is used, and seems to evoke some strange, holy magic from the past.The biggest achievement of this film is that it does not fail or tarnish any of that legacy, which in times like these is almost enough of an accomplishment in itself. This should be the universally-adopted template for all the new reboots and sequels that want to avoid crashing and burning and alienating all the people that want to love them the most. Really, it's stupidly simple: all you need to do is respect, love and know the source material but then build on it and deepen it. Give it more weight.There *are* weaknesses: the younger cast of up-and-coming pilots mostly aren't good enough or memorable enough to fill the shoes they need to, and a lot of the middle of the film sags whenever they're onscreen. Some of the attempts to have them do things that will evoke recollections of and nostalgia for the earlier film fall flat and look like cheap imitations, and there are several scenes that just feel like they are there because the plot *needs* them to be there, and so feel lacklustre, false and too-obviously manipulative. The romance subplot with Jennifer Connelly also feels superficial and unconvincing, and the time spent with her a distraction from what we all know we're here for.All these weaknesses are made up for by the aerial fight scenes and accompanying adventures in the last act, which are more perfectly executed as action movie entertainment than any other film of the last 10 years. It's so by-the-book but it works, god-damn it, way better than any of the Disney, Marvel and Star Wars travesties we've yawned our way through in that time. The whole experience is a triumph - and long-needed reaffirmation - of the mysterious power of a movie to still be able to make you laugh with delight and want to stand and cheer.I could have done without the Lady Gaga song at the end, though. That was awful.The main body of the film is a 7 or sometimes lower, with points here and there that are worth an 8 or higher, so the most representative score I can come up with is a 7\u00bd.",

However, this movie did not have the magic or lustre of the first movie. This felt like a rip-off of Star Wars. A bunch of pilots have to get these missiles in a very tight hole by using the Force.

            "content": "Top Gun Maverick plays exacly like you expect it would. Tom Cruise plays the classic traumatized hero roll. He's still a pilot for some reason, still a thorn in the side of his superiors (even though it's never explained why), he gets to pass the baton to a new generation, and there's conflict with the son of Goose, who's death Tom Cruise has never gotten over.There's a tame little romance in the film, there's a lot of team building stuff, there's the arrogant, highly competent guy who learns the value of teamwork, there's commanding officers threatening to shut the program down, there's some undefined threat by some undefined enemy (clearly Russia), which by the movie's logic justifies the US launching an unprovoked attack on a research and development facility which kills thousands. This may be my biggest gripe with the film. It basically says it's okay for the US to go around indiscriminately killing anyone who may be developing competitive military technology.Questionable morals aside, the film captures much of the feel good vibe of the 80s original. It's an incredibly dumb film, but it's acted, edited, paced and scored well enough to remain entertaining throughout.The aerial stunt and combat scenes are notable for using very little CGI, and they absolutely blow the cartoon physics trash from Marvel out of the water. I think all of this together explains the movie's success at the box office.It reminded people of what a real blockbuster without woke identity politics and lsd trip style cgi action scenes feels like. It may not be a masterpiece, but you will be entertained and you won't feel insulted afterwards. The movie has no malice towards its audience.",

And the chemistry between rooster and maverick and the way how it develops is just magnificent. I almost died crying when I thought maverick was dead! Then out of nowhere rooster saves his life. Then they fight together. He is just as goofy as his father goose too. I love love how maverick got back with the admirals daughter xD.

            "content": "\"It's Not The Plane, It's The Pilot\"I still regret my decision to not watch this film in the theatres, Not deliberately but due to some personal emergencies that I had back then. To tell you the truth, I was kinda envious of all those people who have had the golden opportunity to experience it on the larger screens, as it should be anyway.I have waited for months for it to come to the 'rentals' and my wait was finally over a couple of hours ago. I eventually got my turn to live it as many others had already done and I also wanted to see it by myself if the hype was all real, and I'm happy to declare openly that it was indeed legit.When it comes to the presentation and the all-around quality of the execution, this is leaps and bounds over its predecessor. This is more refined, mature, and far more sophisticated in handling things. Not only did the visuals and the aerial combats make powerful impressions, everything else such as the performances, the characters, and the music; all contributed to its success in an equal fashion! Even the story this time had more depth, which to be honest, I did not expect.If I'm being completely honest, I have a lot on my mind right now, but irrespective of what I tell, mere words coming out of my mouth won't do justice to it. I want you to go in blind, have it like an adventure, an adventure that you will remember for the rest of your life! Here's a little word of advice though, since this had just been released on streaming, and I know for a fact that many like me (who haven't yet seen the film) will tune in, my suggestion for you guys is to make sure to watch this on the biggest screen that you have in your habitation.It's alright if you don't have a 4K television or a Dolby digital set-up, not everybody's going to have it (even though that's the best way to go); but do give your best efforts to see it on your Television though, not on your cellphones, not on your fancy iPads; please stick to the biggest screen space that you can get access to! Trust me, this small decision of yours will ultimately make a tangible difference. You can thank me later!",

            "content": "The original 'Top Gun', released in 1986, has become a cheesy, incredibly entertaining classic, and it isn't hard to see why. The new film is better than the original, but still arrives with some flaws. As with the original, the film loses speed on the ground, but when it's in the air, it is absolutely fantastic.The plot follows Maverick (Tom Cruise), who's enlisted back into his old flight academy, where he is now 'Top Gun' (an instructor). It's pretty standard stuff, a few reunions, an old love interest and some great music are mixed along with it.The characters this time around are mostly useless, with the main B story romance serving as more of seasoning on an entree meal. It doesn't need to be there, but certainly adds a little extra flavor and complexity. But as a whole, the whole love story is useless. It doesn't amount to anything, and is clearly there to live up to the original, but lacks the energy of the first film. Another flaw: they kill off Kelly McGillis's character, committing a true filmmaking sin - killing off a character between movies, and adding a new one. And the new interest, this time played by Jennifer Connelly, doesn't serve a purpose, as I stated previously. Tom Cruise meets up with her for a slow reunion as we learn that they were once lovers. She's there sporadically for smiles, and of course, congratulates Tom Cruise at the victorious end. What does she do here? Nothing. It's a flaw that dents the movie, because of how baffling of a decision it is.The best part of the movie are the flight sequences, which go on for a very long time. They're wildly entertaining, constantly unpredictable, and, honestly, exhilarating. They're some of the best action sequences in years. It is too bad the characters are thinly developed and flawed, as this could have been the masterpiece that was so anticipated.Is the movie bad? Absolutely not. Is it entertaining? Extremely. Is it worth seeing, especially in a theater? Very much so. Is it the masterpiece blockbuster that could be compared to blockbusters like 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Hell no. But it's a pretty fun time at the movies.Top Gun: Maverick (2022)3 STARS (OUT OF 4)Directed by Joseph KosinskiScreenplay by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and Christopher\nMcQuarrieStarring Tom Cruise, Jennifer Connelly, Miles Teller and Val KilmerRated PG-13130 minutes.",

And why is Jennifer Connelly even there? She's a blank, a set piece, a cardboard cutout to fill some visuals with \"the girlfriend\". Actually, all the characters were rather wooden in their acting - but what can you do with dialogue that mostly consists of insipid platitudes?I think as a music video to match the songs in the soundtrack it's pretty good - as a movie it's pretty predictable and vapid.

            "content": "Tom Cruise rarley fails to impress whenever he's working in an action blockbuster and he always gives it his all. I was excited when I heard that this movie was being made, since it has been ages since I've seen a movie about jet fighters and dogfights since, well the origional.I was also worried that this movie would not be able to live up to the charm of the original Top Gun. Being over 35 years since that movie, I felt that this sequel would have been diluted or even had flopped because of the sheer amount of time it took for it to get made. But I can assure you that if your fearful that this will not live up to the 1986 film, put them to bed, because this is exceedingly better in every aspect that it is awe inspiring. Of course the technicality would be superior since this is not the 80s anymore and filmmakers have so much more at their disposal now, but the thing about this movie is staggeringly practical!What really helps this movie is that Tom Cruise is now a real life fully licensed fighter pilot, meaning that all the shots of him in the cockpit are real, not chroma keyed. I'm not sure if this was true for the rest of the actors, I think they were passengers behind the camera. It has incredible directing with shots that are wide, fluid and clear. No shaky cam or jarring and ammeter editing. It's always clear and easy to understand what is going on during the flight scenes which is amazing. This would have been so easy to screw up, but the dedication by Joseph Kosinski and his team was truly noteworthy.Miles Teller was definitely a standout actor in this movie too, I've enjoyed all the roles he has been in and he certainly doesn't disappoint here. The story is great too, it doesn't feel forced or shoehorned in even a bit, and is such an incredible balance of delivering the right amount of fanservice and nostalgia aswell as giving something new and fresh with the updated technology.Excellent blockbuster movie and one of Tom Cruise's best performances.

Like many marriages, it contains \"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue\".Tom Cruise may not be \"old\" but his Pete Mitchell is 36 years older than the brash young pilot we all enjoyed in the first film. In \"Maverick\", Mitchell is mostly unchanged: still a captain, still indulging his need for speed.Quite new are the visual effects. Though the film features actual scenes of flying-and is notable for that---modern technology figures in the weaponry and the displays.Both the original film and the sequel include scenes of dogfights. \"Maverick\" also includes a secret mission involving a team that must train to surmount nearly impossible odds. This is a plot point \"borrowed\" from many military films, like \"The Dirty Dozen\" or \"The Dam Busters\".As for the blue, consider the wild blue yonder that is the backdrop for most of the film. It is both a place and a state of mind, where most pilots live some of their best hours.The cast does a fine job of filling their uniforms. Though his film focuses less on romance than the original, Jennifer Connelly plays love interest Penny, owner of the bar where the pilots hang out. The film would not have suffered if her character were given more screen time.The film is fast-paced and emotionally involving, including some moments of real tenderness. I doubt another sequel will be made, and that is fine because \"Maverick\" feels like a fitting ending.",

For a certain audience, this is the type of film they've been missing. The kind we've not been able to experience in a while, and the kind that brings up great memories and allows us to bridge generations.It's definitely true that mileage may vary, depending on how stuck you are on accuracy in depictions of military life, aviation, etc. And I personally agree that the writing out of both Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan's characters in such a way that neither actress even got a cameo, despite being as important to the overall enjoyment of the original film (and Ryan's character being indirectly central to this one) feels \"wrong,\" when you consider how much time and expense was taken to make sure Val Kilmer (who is unable to speak -- his voice was created digitally using AI in the film -- and has other physical challenges -- corrected with a variety of practical and CGI tweaks -- after a nasty cancer battle) would be included. Is it the worst thing that the \"surviving\" female character is, while largely age appropriate, the one who is most conventionally attractive and young looking of the actresses and was barely a blip in the original film? No, not the worst thing, but it's a legitimate gripe and I don't begrudge others for whom it diminishes their own enjoyment/nostalgia of the film (famously, TOP GUN did shockingly well with women, who were into the romance and Ryan's grief in test audiences, leading them to play up both and shoot additional scenes and sequences, so it's legitimate that many women's nostalgic connection to the source may tie to those characters and scenes as much as it does to Cruise and Kilmer.)But note I still gave it an 8, because at the end of the day, this is an extremely entertaining film.",

He is truly believable as Goose's son, and that is key to why the movie works so well. The tension between the two underpins the plot.

Some good old fashion patriotism and action/adventure. Now of course there were no RED STARS on the planes to tip you off as to who the bad guys were. But it's pretty obvious the writers/producers were insinuating a rogue third world nation (cough Iran cough) with lethal intent toward civilization. There were good guys and bad guys, and I didn't even mind the Military politics involved ... because, sadly, that's what the Military has devolved into: One giant self-destructive machine. But in this movie, the US Military was able to get out of its own way and win the day by focusing on merit rather than some virtueless-signaling agenda.I gave it a 10 even though a 9 is probably more accurate. But I did that as a thank you to Bruckheimer/Cruise for reminding Hollywood and the public, that there really is a market for patriotic movies, even though Hollywood is 100% convinced that all the public wants is divisive, audience-insulting, anti-American, anti-civilization claptrap dressed up as \"inclusive love\".",

He's picked up this character again 30 years later and it's seamless. Johnny Depp didn't have this continuity with captain Jack in back-to-back movies (I'm looking at you 4 and 5) but Cruise plays older Maverick exactly right; he's still got the undertone of cockiness and swagger but now it's without the hotheadedness of youth, he carries a responsibility to look out for others that comes with age. But he's still cheeky Maverick. Throw in the quality of the last act's action sequences and it's just a feel-good time!Get yourself to an IMAX, pay for some overpriced popcorn and let one of the last remaining classic action stars do what he does best: entertain.",

            "content": "First of all, I just want to wish a Happy 60th Birthday to one Thomas \"Tom\" Cruise Mapother IV!\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the long-awaited 2022 sequel to the iconic 1986 blockbuster \"Top Gun,\" which turned its then-24-year-old star Tom Cruise into an international megastar and pop culture icon. In the 36 years since \"Top Gun,\" much has changed - technology, the military, even aerial combat itself.And that is what this film is pretty much about: How the art of aerial dogfighting and highly trained fighter pilots are becoming obsolete as technology (read: drones) has all but eliminated the need for actual flesh & blood human beings.This is the dilemma facing Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Cruise) as he is reluctantly called back to TOPGUN by his former rival Adm. Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer) to help train twelve elite naval aviators for what would otherwise be a suicide mission to bomb a secret military facility in a foreign - possibly Russia, or Russian-occupied - country. The problem is that despite these pilots being the best of the best in the modern United States Navy, their only real combat experience is through high-altitude bombing runs, not\nactual dogfighting. This is why Maverick is called back to train them, due to his experiences 36 years earlier in the first movie.But training these new pilots for this mission won't be easy, since amongst them, is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of his late RIO and best friend Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards, from the original \"Top Gun\"). Bradley resents Maverick for stalling his flight career for four years while he was still at the Naval Academy and he also blames him for the death of his father in 1986. (The tensions between these two is what ultimately makes up the emotional core of the film.)Joseph Kosinski is the young hot-shot behind the camera of this belated Jerry Bruckheimer-produced sequel. Kosinski is no Tony Scott (who directed the original \"Top Gun\" and committed suicide in 2012, and the film is dedicated to his memory), but he handles the story and the characters very well. If anyone was to fill Tony Scott's shoes, it was him.Admittedly, while the story is not as interesting as the story in the first movie, the characters definitely help to bring the script to life flawlessly. Tom Cruise is at the top of his game, as always, and he uses his age - Cruise just turned 60 today - to great advantage in showing us that while he is way past the prime of his youth (and he knows it) and many of his peers have succeeded him in the U. S. Naval ranks, he still has many tricks up his sleeve and many things to pass on to a new generation of fighter pilots. And he also finds the time to rekindle his affair with an old flame, The Hard Deck bar owner Penny Benjamin (lovely Jennifer Connelly), who lights up every scene she appears in.The other pilots are also quite colorful, though some obviously get more screen time than the others. Of course you have the arrogant and pig-headed \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell, filling in for \"Iceman\"); ace female pilot \"Phoenix\" (Monica Barbero), who is arguably the best and most level-headed of the bunch; her nerdy RIO \"Bob\" (Lewis Pullman); and then of course, there's Miles Teller's \"Rooster,\" who bears an uncanny resemblance to his father and even does his own live rendition of Jerry Lee Lewis's \"Great Balls Of Fire.\"One of my greatest concerns going into \"Top Gun: Maverick\" was the authenticity of the film's flying sequences. The original 1986 \"Top Gun\" utilized actual active-duty Navy pilots for the aerial dogfighting scenes, in addition to scale models for some of the more dangerous stunts. Here, it's even more authentic: the actors are actually in the cockpits of real flying F/A-18 Hornets (the actors reportedly had to sign waivers attesting that they did not in fact have a fear of flying), which succeeds in re-creating the dizzying, vertiginous flying scenes that were made so famous in the 1986 original.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a long-delayed sequel that was well worth the wait. The return of a now-60-year-old Tom Cruise, vertiginous flying sequences, a new generation of young Naval aviators, and the delightful callbacks to the original \"Top Gun\" all made it worthwhile.Welcome Back To The Danger Zone9/10 points for being Second Best.",

            "content": "It was a brilliant move to push back the release of Top Gun: Maverick, as it would have been insulting to the many people who worked so diligently to make this a truly unforgettable theater experience to see this on your home television during a pandemic. Tom Cruise somehow finds a way to go bigger and bolder with every new project he decides to embark on. I've never witnessed aerial stunts as visceral as those attempted in this movie, and the fact that they were successfully completed is nothing short of a marvel of filmmaking. Cruise also displays an emotional range that he doesn't often get the opportunity to showcase, and Miles Teller is solid, if unspectacular. But there was no purpose for Jennifer Connelly's character to exist in the film. Her storyline and presence were nothing but disruptive to the movie's plot and pace. Yet the craft of the film is undeniable. The cinematography was gorgeous, and it could be a serious contender for that category when award season rolls around. In the end, if the Oscar voters are on the same page as the general audience, it could win far more than that.",

            "content": "One of the most exhilarating, pulse pounding, heart thumping experiences in cinema! It's the kind of action spectacle everyone wanted. Craved for! Tom Cruise is back to entertain us galore! He isn't retiring any time soon. To compare Tom Cruise with other actors, I can say or even sing.....\"They don't make make them like they used to....\"(Kenny Rogers). Tom is of a different breed altogether. I have never seen as actor give his all like this for movies. His only motto is to entertain the hell out of the audience. And he does that with elan!A sequel to the 1986 movie named \"Top Gun\". A sequel that upped the previous movie and how! I probably watched the old one in the same year 1986 or 1987 on VHS. I read that it received mixed reviews from critics but the audience lapped it up and was a huge commercial hit, grossing $356 million against a production budget of $15 million in 1986. Now that's wow! It's soundtrack too was very popular with \"Take My Breath Away\" by Berlin being the numero uno song then. As well as Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins.In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".(Source - Wikipedia)\nI revisited the old Top Gun a day before I went for Maverick. While watching Maverick, I realized what a good decision that was!When the makers conveyed the idea of a sequel to Tom Cruise, he wanted it to have a solid story as well as real aerial stunts. No vfx! The challenge was accepted with Tom himself designing a training guideline for the actors. Tom Cruise is a certified pilot also. Their full on dedication and hardships can be felt in the aerial shots! The stunts by the highly skilled aviators! My God, do they invoke your deepest fears and excitement of flying and speed! Sheer adrenaline. Dopamine overload! WOW! WOW! JUST WOW!About the cast, once again, Tom Cruise was outstanding in his portrayal of \"Lt. Pete Mitchell\" aka \"Maverick\". He brought back his boyish charm as well as his hell-bent on proving himself attitude even after 36 years from the incidents of the first movie. Yes, age has caught upto him just a bit (it shows a little on his face), but what a powerhouse of an actor he is! Whatever he did when he was 24, he does much more at 59! An array of emotions were at display convincing us of why he is a bonafide star. One of the biggest movie stars on the planet! John Hamm as Vice is terrific as well, in a role quite detached from his very popular character Don Draper in the television series Mad Men, yet you see the shades of a no nonsense determined man in authority. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic! She was enticing as Penny Benjamin, an old flame mentioned in passing in the 1986 \"Top Gun\" by Goose (Anthony Edwards) and his wife Carole (Meg Ryan). Her character wasn't shown in the first part and back then it was more about \"Kelly McGillis\" as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, instructor of Top Gun and Maverick's love interest (She isn't mentioned at all in this movie). In this movie, the makers perfectly blended in Connelley's character and I found that both Tom and Jennifer had great chemistry with each other. A mature \"been there done that\" chemistry as aged adults. Perfect! To bring back Val Kilmer / LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky was a nice touch. Again the way they included him in the story was perfect. The emotions it evoked brings me back to what I mentioned initially (about watching the first part a day before I went for this one). Which made me relate and adapt into their world the moment the beginning credits came on. A few flashback scenes from the first movie, stirs up your emotions for sure. When Rooster (Goose's son) sings \"Great balls of fire\" sitting at the piano, we are taken back (Maverick's flashbacks) to the scene at the same place where Goose and Maverick belts out the same song! Oh man, that one pulls you all the way in!The young pilot trainees/graduates played by Miles Teller (Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw - Son of Goose), Glenn Powell (Lt. Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin), Lewis Pullman (Lt. Robert \"Bob\" Floyd) and Monica Barbaro (Lt. Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace) performed well. 1986 Top Gun was an emotion. Top Gun : Maverick is intense and soulful.The music/score are terrific. \"Hans Zimmer\" never fails to amaze and make us fall in love with his music. Kenny Loggins' 1986 hit \"Danger Zone\" is which was a massive hit back then, is used in the opening credits of Top Gun : Maverick, just like how it was in the old movie. Oh, that was a clever move to get the fans invested in the movie from the get-go! The moment the jets begin to take off from the decks of the aircraft carrier, the song sets in and nostalgia hits us hard! You might know that the 1986 \"Top Gun\" soundtrack was one of the biggest-selling movie albums of all-time. So it was natural for the makers to use it again! But the other classic song, Take my breath away\" wasn't used this time. In place of \"Take My Breath Away\",by Berlin, Top Gun: Maverick gives us a new track from Lady Gaga,\"Hold My Hand\". It sounds and feels like a classic number full of love and emotion. Beautiful. The reason Director Joseph Kosinski gave was that, the \"Take my breath away\" song was made for Maverick and Charlie in the old Top Gun. For Maverick and Penny, he needed something new and as good as the old one.Spectacular cinematography! Kudos to Claudio Miranda. I can't even think as to how he/they did this for real! (I did watch the making of the aerial stunts recently). Tom impresses us not only in his acting chops but in action as well. Though the action here isn't hand to hand combat, he really is flying the jets here. The F-14 Tomcat, Boeing F/A 18E/18F Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, Sukhoi Su-57 Felon and a fictional Hypersonic \"Darkstar\" Jet Based On Lockheed Martin SR-72! The \"Darkstar\" flying scene to be watched to be believed! And finally the North American P-51 Mustang, which is actually Tom's own personal plane used for the movie! Beautifully executed aerial stunts, taking us along for the ride when you watch it in IMAX! You actually feel like a co-pilot! That shows how immersive the experience is! Tom riding his Kawasaki Ninja H2 Carbon is just awesome! The same bike he rode in the first Top Gun. Racing the jet just like the old movie. As well as riding it with Jennifer Connelly! Iconic shots!Top notch editing by Chris Lebenzon and Eddie Hamilton. Despite it's 2hr+ runtime, it never felt stretched at all. And I'm sure they guys had a lot of fun editing the aerial stunt scenes! I heard in interviews and read that little to no CGI was used and everything was as real as possible. Which itself is a feat in these times!Top Gun : Maverick has action, drama, romance and humor...all in the right places and in the right manner. Beautifully shot. Well scripted and acted. People who haven't watched the original Top Gun, I say you must, as it will definitely connect emotionally with you in the sequel. And what's a Tom Cruise movie without a running scene! Yes, you a few angles of him running through a snowy forest in this one.You all know what a crescendo is, right? It's a gradual increase in volume of a musical passage. It brings up the excitement in the music as it nears the end. This is what you feel in Top Gun : Maverick. The crescendo towards the finale! A spellbinding, nail biting extended climax that cannot be forgotten very easily and you have to see it to believe it! I did sway my body and head at times as I got so immersed in the aerial combat! Sensational!The movie has a few expletives/profanities but no actual adult content (a sensual scene between Maverick and Penny is done tastefully without the need for nudity)\nA side note : TOP GUN MAVERICK shot 800 hours of footage, as much as the three LORD OF THE RINGS movies!And the 2h 17m we got from those 800 hours is pure gold!Fans and cinephiles alike.... Rush to the cinemas preferably IMAX) to watch this spectacle on the biggest screen possible, before it \"flies\" away and \"lands\" on OTT. You won't regret it one bit! (But do watch/re-watch the 1986 \"Top Gun\" before that).",

            "review_title": "A sequel in auto-pilot",
            "content": "First things first. Top Gun Maverick is entertaining enough. If you're one of those people for whom that is all that matters in a movie, read no further.Beyond that, there are two ways to look at this film. The first and most obvious is that this is a replica of the original movie. Moviegoers and critics alike easily find themselves drawn to the game of comparing the original to the replica and seeking to assess if one is marginally better than the other, losing sight that the very issue is that one is drawn into that game. Inserting marginal differences into a movie is not what creativity, story-telling or great filmmaking are about. And while the film has been hailed as (yet another) savior of the big screen, ironically one of the most permanent feelings one experiences while watching it in the theatre is that you don't really need to be there.The second way to look at Top Gun Maverick is as a satire or criticism on American filmmaking today. The parallels between the original and this sequel are so strong that they become surreal, so extreme that one feels they must carry meaning. From the initial text explaining what Top Gun is (identical to the one from the original film) to the son of Goose singing Great Balls of Fire on the same piano of the same bar with the same mustache and the same shirt as his Dad thirty years ago, the scenes and the shots parallel the first movie to an extreme, almost reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's Psycho, or of the constant time-loop repetition in Edge of Tomorrow (McQuarrie is listed as screenwriter in in that film as well as in TG-M). The only difference with the original seems to be the planned mission, which is itself a reproduction of the Star Wars A New Hope final scene -one of the most famous action scenes ever-, as if to underscore that even a change introduced in an American film today can only be a reproduction of some other movie.The very first scenes of TG-M would support this theory. In those, we see Maverick testing a new stealth plane to have it reach Mach 10. The scene has the distinct feeling of the final scene of a movie, and the most memorable images in all of TG-M. It seems to hint at what this different story was that could have been told. Unfortunately, the plane test is interrupted by an Admiral who prefers drones to manned planes, a likely analogy to Hollywood executives who want movies made on auto-pilot.",

I was very impressed.I appreciated the current flying techniques, seeing the different types of aircraft, & following a mission.I was also happy to see Mav find another love interest (and who better than Jennifer Connelly).His tension w/Rooster was palpable & the Hangman/Rooster relationship mirrored his w/Iceman.If I were to make any critiques, they are minor. I wondered during the span of the movie where all of Maverick's bravado & cockiness went. He was so sure of himself & arrogant about his flying ability in the original & deservedly so. I was so happy to see Val Kilmer in the film! I wish they didn't have him die, though. I kept hoping I'd see Slider, Cougar, Hollywood, & Merlin come back for the funeral. That was a bit disappointing, but overall, high marks for Vol ll of the Top Gun films.",

The plot line with Rooster, the son of Goose, pulls on the heartstrings just enough without coming off as overly sappy. Tom Cruise gives his best performance of the last decade. The music is outstanding, and the use of songs is much more in control than the first. Unlike the first movie, where the final battle comes out of nowhere, this entire movie builds up to this impossible mission, and the finale has so much tension and pay off.

Some of our elders, who took some of us to the movie, have passed away, some of us now have young children.I was excited when I heard that a sequel to the movie that left such a mark in our youth years would even be shot. Even when \"Danger Zone\" started playing in its very first scene, I was shivering.It would not be a lie if I say that the film is an invaluable blessing for a fan like me.

            "content": "36 years later, Tom Cruise returns as Maverick in the sequel to Tony Scott's Top Gun. Though, with the addition of Miles Teller, Jon Hamm and the inclusion of Val Kilmer; director Joseph Kosinski undoubtedly felt the pressure to turn up the knots, and match the original through utilising the pre-existing history, and writing its newest chapter. It is worth noting that Top Gun: Maverick is dedicated to Scott, who died by suicide in 2012. He had been developing his own sequel before his death.After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.Through a cleaner lens, Kosinski captures a slick Tom Cruise suiting up with his iconic shades and leather jacket before speeding through Los Angeles open space as the sun sets in the background. A fitting scene to translate: Maverick is back. The film runs at a fast-pace, much like that of a fighter jet, many scenes set in the sky add to the production's brilliance, allowing for humour and comforting exchanges, in fact, three of the six new actors threw up every day when filming in the jets.A carefully crafted picture that times well when to refers to the past, allowing fans of the original to remain invested in the story, though also providing context for those who hadn't seen. Cruise and Teller master their art in difficult roles. Cruise as an authoritative character who must show his experience and transmit his wisdom to the next generation, Rooster (Teller) is very much a copy of his father, caring, fun and a god damn good flyer.Allusions to the past help facilitate the forward direction of the plot, though, they also offer scenes of nostalgia, particularly in an exchange between Kilmer and Cruise, the former, whom suffers from throat cancer, ensured he encapsulated the respect and integrity of his famous name 'Iceman'.Sensational cinematography makes the film as celebrated as it still is today. The detail of the aviation school and the task-in-hand is extremely thorough in making certain that the movie strengthens its authentic feel.A fitting display for all Top Gun fans, however, also a job well done in the making of many new. If that's still not you, despite being released in May, Top Gun: Maverick is still on in UK cinemas today!",

But the other 60% of the film is about a 3/10.The plot was predictable and very 'destroy the death star with 2 rockets'. I can think of 4 plots more interesting than what they went with. They should've focused on the younger characters but instead they spend 20 odd minutes on the worst stuff with cruise and connelly.I get it's a fun good summer film. But everything everywhere all at once is a 9/10 and on the same scale this is a 4/10. Criminal for people to be rating it as high as they have.",

Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.I remember liking the original \"Top Gun\" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!",

Very little CGI but that's about all that was good.What's not\nTC being called an old man when he looks 20 years younger (or more) than his actual age. Not really believable, The excessive testosterone on display. The beach football was straight out of 1986 and looked awkward at best, Anyone else notice the oiled up actors? A little bit odd and uncomfortable. Jennifer Connelly would have been 16 in 1986 so age appropriateness for actresses is still not a thing? I wasn't sold on the love interest with TC. Their was no chemistry and it felt forced. About believable as her making enough money from the bar to own a Porsche. TC stealing a fighter to show off and being given the Team Leaders role. Aw shucks, ya fly so good you can have the job. Reality? He'd be locked up and face a court martial. Attacking a country on their own soil? A bit too far regardless of who it is. The story was entirely predictable when there should have been room for something new.So a 5, I did enjoy the movie overall but keep asking myself, is this as far as movie making has come in 35 years?",

            "review_title": "Top Gun Sequel Soars High",
            "content": "Taking place 36 years after the first Top Gun film, this sequel follows Captain Steve \"Maverick\" Mitchell as he confronts his past and returns to Top Gun as a trainer. He is to train twelve young pilots to prepare for an urgent and deadly mission. One of the pilots he must train is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Goose. Maverick faces the grievance of losing Goose again as he tries to find a way to make sure that Rooster and the other new pilots do not die in the new mission.What I like the most about Top Gun: Maverick is that above all else, it is a movie about dealing with a loss and letting go of guilt. Maverick is still racked with guilt over Goose's death 36 years ago and with Goose's son about to enter a life-threatening mission, Maverick hates the idea of even allowing Rooster to go the mission. However, it is shown that all he is doing is holding Rooster back. All it is doing is making the son of Maverick's best friend resent him even more. It is a good way of showing how pushing others back is not the answer.Maverick's guilt also bleeds into the training of the young pilots. In some of the training sessions, Maverick will emphasize the loss of a pilot's life by asking his trainees what they would tell the victim's family and friends. How would they deliver the tragic news? This is a powerful moment to not only show the dangers of aerial combat, but to also emphasize Maverick's motivation: to complete the mission with zero deaths. How will he complete that goal? He trains them to think outside of the box by using tactics the enemy pilots would not expect. If they learn unexpected ways to retaliate, they could get the upper hand against the enemy and there would be a chance to succeed without any casualties. The training sessions show that in spite of his rather insane methods, Maverick cares about all of the pilots and he does not want any of them to die or to feel the weight of losing each other. The theme of guilt and letting go of it is tackled professionally and it gives a humane layer to the story of the film.Performance-wise, Tom Cruise is at his best here. He is a much more mature Maverick here while still carrying the risky and fun personality from over three decades ago. The scenes where he is training the pilots are where he shows his chops the best. You can tell that this movie and this role means a lot to him as he takes his character in a new and interesting direction. As for the rest of the cast, Miles Teller as Rooster is great as the son of Goose, Lewis Pullman is memorable as the shy, but skilled Bob, Monica Barbaro is really cool as Phoenix and Glen Powell is enjoyably cocky as Hangman. Val Kilmer has a small scene as Iceman, but it is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. It was a sad scene, but Kilmer crushed it. Oh and Ed Harris is incredibly intimidating for the few minutes he is there. The cast is fantastic, but there is one minor weak link.Jennifer Connelly is fine as Penny, but the romance feels a bit out of place here. The chemistry between these two is better here than in the chemistry between Cruise and Kelly McGinnis in the first film, but even with that, I feel this was a missed opportunity to bring McGinnis back and develop the relationship between Maverick and Charlie. I think the romance could have replaced with more scenes of Maverick and Rooster's interactions.And now, for the dogfights... they are outstanding. I felt the rush of flight sequences from the moment Maverick flies a jet to a speed objective. I felt like I was there. The flight sequences are visually stunning and beautifully shot. None of the action scenes feels cluttered or difficult to follow. Most importantly, they are a blast to watch. The aerial combat is dynamic and the final set piece is one of the best and most intense I have seen in a theater. When I say the flight sequences are intense, I mean it. Not even the training flights pull back punches to how dangerous piloting these planes can be. This movie is worth seeing on the big screen for the flight sequences alone.Even outside of them, the movie still looks great with slick cinematography featuring some memorable shots. The sound design also becomes part of the experience as the planes sound pretty realistic which pulls you into the experience even further. The soundtrack is awesome too with the return of some classic songs such as Danger Zone and a great musical score by Harold Faltermeyer and Hans Zimmer.As someone who was not a fan of the first Top Gun film, I really like Top Gun: Maverick. I like it a lot more than the first film. It is fresh, action-packed, surprisingly deep in its themes and most of all, it's a ton of fun. Also, it is very funny. I laughed and chuckled several times throughout the movie. This is the kind of movie I love seeing on the big screen. It tells a great story while delivering on the action. I think Top Gun fans will love this movie. See it on the biggest screen possible.",

So is it really THAT great if you just want to watch a movie ONCE and never watch it again? I don't think so.You know movie is truly great when you want to watch it over and over again every year whether by yourself or with your friends and family.Top Gun Maverick (TGM) is the kind of movie that you will want to watch over and over and over again every year either by yourself or with your friends and family.The formula for a great novel/story/TV/movie is the same. You must have a great SETTING, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, PLOT, CLIMAX, RESOLUTION. We learned all this back when we were kids in school.Now the PLOT can be simple and straightforward, but it can still be good. It needs to be clear and not confusing as hell.TGM has all these elements. It's directed by Joseph Kosinski, whom I think is one of the smartest directors. No wonder TGM is such a awesome movie.In terms of story, TGM has more story than TG. Basically TGM has more of everything- more action, more story, just more.Which movie is better? It's difficult to beat nostalgia. TG was 30 years ago when many of us were just kids. And that's what TG was about - kids.Now TGM is about being adults.It's a tough call, but I would say that TGM is better than TG in every way, except for the nostalgia factor.",

However in its structure is very very similar to the first one (too much in my opinion), but actually in this case with better dialogues, characters interactions, direction and editing. Indeed even if the plot is nothing complicated and with surprising twists, I found myself on the edge of the seat for the large majority of the film because of the fantastic action scenes. The fact that they were real and not all CGI makes them better, more impactful and engaging. The length is also perfect for a movie like this, telling a simple story without dragging it for too long like other action movies do nowadays. In conclusion \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a solid watch, but nothing crazy. Maybe I was wrongly hyped up too much by the stellar reviews, but still it's super enjoyable and suggested.",

But they did. And as I sat down in the theater after hearing such good reviews, I was a little excited. But also scared that it was getting too much hype. And boy was a wrong to be scared. The elegance this movie has is something I have never seen before. There was not a single moment where I was bored. This movie starts, shoot off from the beginning, and made me wish it didn't have to end. This is the feel-good movie of the summer, and I doubt anything will top it. And let's not forget the amazing, James Gunn-like soundtrack. Tom Cruise is clearly starting to look his age, but still gave the performance like he was still living in 1986. The student became the teacher and did a great job doing it. And Miles Teller hammered down and gave us a raw, memorable character that persisted throughout the movie. And while Jon Hamm wasn't the most vital performance in the movie, he still gave a great one. This movie hopefully revived the franchise, because after such an Oscar-worthy one like that, Paramount would be crazy not to give out more. I hope to be sitting down, excited for the next one in a few short years from now.",

S. faces is un named and doesn't fuel any current conflicts. Really does set up the next generation of pilots to take over the job if Mr. Cruise decides to step away. A touching nod to Val Kilmer's character lends to the turmoil Maverick faces as an aging pilot.Worth the price of admission and going to be one that hits top marks for summer blockbusters.",

That's not to say that I hated this as the last 45 minutes or so does have some exciting moments and is well filmed, until the sappy finale, but a lot of the rest is a retread with nearly as many clich\u00e9s as the first with numerous stock characters. It also contains another love story with two actors that have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever without a moment of realism in any scene together. I'm also lost on the female character. There is no one in the first film that I am aware of named Penny, though her daughter warns him not to leave her again. Again?! This is over-the-top macho heaven once more and while no one is bad, though Connelly comes close, there is not an outstanding performance in the large cast. Cruise is just Cruise and not at his best, but his best as an actor seems far in the past. He seems more a stunt man in recent years. The Val Kilmer scene is touching and sad to watch. However, I am in the minority here, to put it mildly, so enjoy the show. Cruise and I couldn't be more different. I've absolutely no interest in how fast any kind of vehicle can go.",

This did not happen once during this movie. Even while following a somewhat predictable plot structure, Top Gun: Maverick never fails to capture your immersion from the first minute. Additionally, a few lines of dialogue in the movie felt cheesy just from reading the subtitles, but the actors involved really sold these lines to make it all but imperceptible.Writers for this movie understood our protagonist and what makes him click with the audience, and were able to incorporate this into the story masterfully.

            "content": "Just when it seemed like it had rendered itself completely irrelevant with its obsessing over superhero franchises and remakes, Hollywood threw out this lifeline to the fast diminishing population of adult moviegoers. And it was immediately rewarded with incredible box-office numbers. Unlike so many films in the action/adventure genre of recent, Top Gun: Maverick is a proper movie - traditional escapism for long-time movie buffs - which is as enjoyable to see as it is a relief. Granted, we are talking about a sequel here, but it's a sequel that stands firmly, independently and confidently on its own feet as an apolitical, unironic, straightforward movie made with aesthetics and thrills in mind. And one of the reasons the action works so well is that it feels organic. CGI is used as a tool, not as a foundation, which makes a world of difference for how the flying action looks. From the minute Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is reintroduced, and once all the nostalgia has quieted down, Top Gun: Maverick gets into its slick, well laid out setup of fighter jet training, an exhilarating real-life mission, and only a semi-vapid romance between Maverick and Penny, played with a perpetual pose by Jennifer Connelly. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, looks amazing and gives one of the most compelling performances of his career. When Maverick is told by his old pal Iceman that \"it's time to let go\" and Cruise replies \"I don't know how\", the actor looks to be tapping into more real emotion than he has ever done before. I, for one, believe that Cruise might not know how to let go, but luckily he has no need to just yet.",

I see in alot of these reviews it's like a burger from fast food, and I absolutely agree with that metaphor. But really it only has that fun, feel good bits at the end. The rest of the story is very eh, some good parts. I feel they didn't do the relationship between rooster and maverick well, I think by the end it should be all good but in between it should've been more focused on them. But In the actual story it doesn't focus on that much at all. Also the actor for Peggy looks nothing like she did in the original which is very off-putting. And casting choice in this movie is a problem in general, it has heavy amounts of a list syndrome. I liked jon hamm in this movie, but he didn't play the part he was supposed to well, and I don't think he's a good pick. Neither with all the graduates, they all were fine, especially in action. But I didn't believe they were navy pilots. And the camerawork in this film is hit or miss, parts it's awful, way too many close ups, and not even good ones. But at times it was really creative, sometimes good. The flying shots really show this, they work very well. And that's really the main part of this film, the best part. They're very fun and engaging. Maverick isn't as weird as he was in the original, it's clear he's grown up, but he's still a bit weird and I don't feel his relationship has any chemistry still. Though I felt she was an actual human more then the first movie, she still totally switches up though. The only other part I'd say was good besides the flying portions, specifically the end is the planning of the mission, and the build up there which was done pretty decent. The music in this movie was done far better then the original, and actually usually fits the mood of the scene. Alot of the sets for this movie feel so cheap, like alot of things about this movie Do. They just feel so lifeless and even fake sometimes. Over all though, I think this movie was well done over the original, but It leans too much into the 80s style and references. Which I feel is kinda cliche and boring with some of them. As well reusing the same 80s music and even the shots feels like with alot of this they're just nostalgia baiting. Who took that picture of mav and Iceman anyway? That's never explained but it's just everywhere. Also it feels like mav didn't grow too much, still reckless and almost gets people killed. How they explained the last 30 years is good though, I think that was decently done, not making it too obvious but not hiding it. I do struggle to care about mav though, his acting is worse in this then the original. And stuff just happens, randomly out of nowhere at times. This movie also feels like navy propaganda, I don't know if they were funded by them but it feels like it, as well not only that but just feels very American, stereotypically much.Over all score for me though is a 6.7\nVery fun, not critical, but does flying parts well with a decently engaging mission plot. Even if most the characters aren't well done.",

            "content": "When Top Gun was released in 1986, it made quite the impression upon audiences. People flocked to cinemas time and again to watch groundbreaking flying scenes interspersing a particularly juvenile version of the hero's journey. The hero in question was Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, and the original Top Gun was very much his film. It is therefore fitting that the sequel be in the same vein. Top Gun Maverick provides us with a lot more flying and a lot more Maverick. 36 years later, one can see how updated technology, of both the plane and camera variety, would make fresh flying scenes appealing, but surely, three-and-a-half decades later, Tom Cruise as Maverick can not be the same heroic figure that he once was. Well, no-one told Tom Cruise that and nor should they have. As a film star, he still has the presence and the bravura to remain front-and-centre of this hyper-charged vehicle.Of course he is much older now, although, in fairness, he really doesn't look it. In fact, Tom Cruise has defied the aging process much more successfully than the original Top Gun film. Technologically, Top Gun Maverick soars miles above its predecessor. Gone are the miniature model plane shots and scenes filmed in aircraft simulators. This film sees its characters genuinely taken into the skies, and it's a marvel to witness such adrenaline and action captured on the screen. The poor pacing, uneven tone and unbridled machismo of the original film is also improved upon in the sequel. The pacing is helped by having a much more developed plot, which provides a narrative context for the copious flying scenes. Each of the scenes is needed to move the plot forward and shows how the crack team are progressing towards their final mission. Taking the lead from the 2nd half of the original film, the sequel is suffused with a sense of loss and a need for redemption. Rooster (played by Miles Teller) is the son of Maverick's late best friend, Goose, and his character provides this redemptive arc. Rooster is both a surrogate son and a potential best-friend-in-the-making to Maverick. It's their complicated relationship and their shared connection to the late \"Goose\" that forms the emotional core of the film.As to the previous machismo, this time the film has a much more nuanced emotional palette. Maverick is much older in years and he has become wistful and reflective over time. The best scenes in the film, for my money, are at the beginning, when Maverick is surveying the generation of fighter pilots who have ostensibly replaced him. For a few brief moments, he's a good-looking older guy at the bar watching the young bucks cavorting and performing in the exact same way he once did. Maverick is a man who has seen all of his former colleagues either pass away or age out. He alone is clinging to the rigors and audacity of a youth that belies his actual years. But, of course, this is the world of Top Gun, and in this world Maverick is always the hero. The higher the stakes, the more heroic Maverick will become. Just as speed and space are no object, neither is time. It doesn't matter that Maverick is now twice the age of all the other hotshot Top Gun pilots, he'll outpace and outperform them because that is what Top Gun requires, the hero must prevail at all costs.There are many flights of fancy and there is a general sense of unbelievability regarding significant portions of the plot but there is always just enough risk so that the film never quite lets go of its emotional pull. Thus, it does enough to immerse you in the fantasy and provide the emotional catharsis that comes from a sense of triumph earned amidst the genuine possibility of tragedy. In this sense, the film has an old-fashioned feel to it. It takes its audience back to a time before the rules of big budget actions films changed. It holds to sacred formulas of heroic triumph and ultimate redemption that are no longer fashionable in this genre. It taps into a pureness and simplicity that audiences still clearly yearn for but which is now extremely difficult to deliver in a manner that is convincing and satisfying.More generally, both Tom Cruise and Top Gun Maverick represent a generation of Hollywood which is out-of-step with current trends. The film emphasises practical effects in an industry increasingly dominated by computer technology. It champions a white male hero in the face of 3rd-wave feminism, intersectionality and critical race and gender theory. It depicts ultimate triumph in a world which no longer believes in absolutes. And, yet, it finds a way to succeed.This film demonstrates that old formulas can still work. If it's daring, it is so because it is so wedded to an artistic temperament that long preceded its release. To paraphrase the film, movies of this kind may one day be obsolete, but not today.",

This film is unbelievably nostalgic to the first Top Gun film and truly a head nodder to everything that film was and still is. Top Gun: Maverick became something that everyone needed and truly became something that was nothing short of a dream. I can only imagine kids seeing the film and wanting to become pilots themselves as this film makes you imagine being a pilot and flying. This film makes you dream and go back in time, while at the same time focusing on what can happen in the future and all that pilots have achieved. This was a beautiful sequel that was done with outstanding music and and outstanding cast and storyline. This was the film of the decade that truly does show that you do not need CGI to make a great film, you just need a great story and even greater people to tell it.",

The only surprise is that Tom is getting old but too vain to grow grey-haired. Other than that, this movie comes with absolute zero surprises. I must say though that the flight scenes are quite good and partly convicting but won't cover up for the pool story, bad acting and the cheesy macho jargong. The only positive thing was to see Val. Unlike Tom he grown old with dignity. To my defence I've never been a Cruise or Top Gun fan.",

So I know the original front and back.Tom Cruise not only lived up to the original, but the new Top Gun adds on to the legend by not only tugging on our emotional and nostalgic heart strings, but surpassing it with INCREDIBLE action sequences. I can't put into words just how breathtaking the fighter jet scenes are. Just seeing the stress on the actors faces from the huge Gs they pull puts you directly in the cockpit with them.This is truly one of the most epic movies I've ever seen, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the US Navy get a big uptick of candidates just like when the original came out.",

This was my first movie theater experience where I was the only one in the theater and I was actually amazing.

Joe Kosenski does a fantastic job directing the film.The only complaint is that the film easily could have been 110 mins like the original and the 2nd act felt tired and the writers hit us over the head too many times doing the Rooster/Goose to the point of exhaustion.And as many have mentioned the plot was completely stupid with the cruise ship missiles only taking out the airstrip and not the mountain top SAR missiles. And the 5th generation planes with stealth mode fighting in visual mode against a 1970s F14 is laughable. Like a Tesla trying to race a tricycle with trainer wheels.But hey its Tom Cruise and the only part that was really missing was his motto of \"I feel the need for Speed\". .Otherwise it is a fantastic film and loved seeing the old relic pushing Mach 10 at age 60. And of course the Navy could not ask for a better promo ad to get more kiddos in the seat of a fighter jet. Too bad nowadays the F35 is a nightmare failure and most pilots are flying Drones inside a metal box in Nevada.A solid 8 and surely it will make loads of money yet sure hope there is no more sequels.

There was no point to sequel except usual motives ($) and as sequels go this is a very smart movie in regard to how it was constructed. They new exactly what people want and would like to see and gave them exactly that. But they also know not to overdue it with nostalgia. So, a good mixture and as title goes its a movie centered on Tom and he is again that character, so no passing the torch thank god. Most of other characters are ok but bland and forgettable.Main dramatic conflict of the movie is lame but you have to have something. That is also a big problem for me, this movie is even less realistic and more silly then the first one. \"The army\" is not strict at all and is all \"hugy\" and \"feely\". It has no ideological preaching sub context almost a given for present day and that's a good thing. Its not even a draft add like the first one, there is not as much \"America, yeah!\" moments as you would expect.Biggest disappointment in the movie for me are highly praised flight scenes. They are not that impressive with just identical closeups from front and lots of fast passed shaky cam. Arial shoots of original in my opinion are far more impressive and believable. End mission is also silly and unbelievable but that doesn't matter. The point of this movie and what audience wanted to see is Tom Cruise being Maverick again and kick ass and in that regard it completely delivers.",

            "review_title": "The epitome of American military forces pathos, but highly entertaining at the same time",
            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is an American, no THE American, movie from 2022 and this one runs for minimally over two hours if we don't count closing credits as you can add another ten minutes for those. The director is Joseph Kosinski and this is not the first time he has worked with lead actor Tom Cruise, but we will get a little later to cast and characters. In any case, Kosinski is not new to filmmaking, but also not extremely experienced. He has worked on a few films that also include American hero characters since his breakthrough in 2010, so him being picked for this one kinda makes sense. The key writer is Peter Craig. He is maybe the bigger name with his involvement with the Hunger Games franchise, the newest Batman movie and also The Town, maybe the best he has come up with so far. In any case, the parallel between him and Kosinski is that they both had their big breakthrough ten years into the new millennium. There are two other writers credited and these come from the original Top Gun movie from 35 years ago approximately. You can check their names if you like. One of them is still alive and I wonder what he thinks about the quality of this new film and if the high praise it has received so far is justified. Director Tony Scott died about a decade ago and you can read his name also at the end of the film. A few more words on the crew you could say here, namely on the music department: The names Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga in the same movie sure make for something unique. I must say I am not a Gaga fan though and her song towards the end also did almost nothing for me. We will see if she can score another Oscar nomination with it. I hope not. So yeah, for me as a German, there is surely more focus on the two Germans I have just mentioned. Now, let's look at the cast: It really from beginning to end all about Tom Cruise. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly plays the love interest. Miles Teller (Whiplash) plays the protagonist's former wingman's son. Mad Men's Jon Hamm plays the closest to an antagonist. Val Kilmer is I think the only one (except Cruise of course) who reprises his role from the old film and he looks a lot like Jon Voight here. No Meg Ryan. There's others. Of course here you can also check out the list yourself if you care.As for the film, I am not sure I have ever seen more American pathos in one movie. The consequence was unfortunately that pretty much every single character felt fairly stereotypical. And yet, somehow it all went right. I would not agree with the raving reviews or extremely high average ratings, but I was genuinely entertained here from beginning to end. I mean I am probably biased because I like most of the cast members. Huge fan of Cruise, his personal life is none of my business. Miles Teller is one of the younger actors I really like and Jon Hamm is always a joy to watch. Simply love Mad Men. But also the ones playing smaller characters are totally fine. Glen Powell is the best example. He seemed so familiar, but maybe it is just the face. I could not really say where I saw him before. There was also the possibility his character could end up as an antagonist, but eventually the opposite is the case. Maybe the coolest moment of the film when he shows up to save the two more central male characters and what he says there. And it fits. It is all about how people in the military stick together and they are really one team, one unit, so they could not have one of them become a true antagonist or so. If you can maybe criticize the characters, then it refers to the female characters. Not a great deal of depth to them. This applies to Connolly's role for sure, but maybe also to Monica Barbaro's character, even if she is super easy on the eyes. Then again, she is just one of the military characters that do not get a lot of screen time and even less elaboration. Despite making the cut. Most of the time, she is just there to admire Cruise's character. Admittedly, to move a bit away from the gender talk, you can also say that Bob does not have too much screen time either. He just creates laughs when he is introduced with his military (non-)nickname. Just like some others when they initially do not know yet who it is they are carrying out of the bar. Next day, the rude awakening happens. Oh yeah, Barbaro's character also had that moment when Hangman is criticized for being anti-female, another reference where you could think he is maybe a bad guy, but he is just cocky and that's it and also some of the others do not like him as much as Teller's character for sure. They want the latter to be their team leader.I do agree with those saying that perhaps the last half hour is the highlight here. They kept the mission pretty simple. Early on, it still seems almost like a casting show, but this is not what it gets to be about. Eventually, the focus is on the mission itself: What they have to do exactly, namely hit two precision shots from up above to destroy radioactive substance belonging to the enemy. At the same time, they do not only have to make the shots, but also be very quick and get out safely afterwards. This is emphasized especially on one occasion when Cruise's character (the film is fittingly named after him) talks to Hamm's. Oh and by the way, the enemy is not explicitly stated. They are called a rogue state or rogue nation and that is it. We do not see the bad guys' faces either. The one thing we do know is that it is rather cold in said country. Honi soit qui mal y pense. If you know what I mean with politic events in 2022. Okay, the film was made before that and let's not get into detail on this now. Focus on the film instead. What we must get into detail on is how gimmicky this film felt at times and how it was almost too much and sometimes crossing the fine line between being entertaining and being simply over-the-top. This applies to almost everything involving Connelly's character. How we literally see her fall for him. How her daughter tells Cruise's character not to hurt her again. That was maybe the funniest moment from the film when she sees him there jumping from her mother's window. The words he tells Connelly's character one one occasion were also fairly gooey.There are more scenes that did feel on the awkward side. I mean I like Cruise, but people who don't could really struggle here. Also when Hamm looks at him in the end and finally accepts his greatness. How Kilmer's character dies on one occasion. How Maverick at the beach makes sure the gang becomes a team and shows us his great topless body as well and that he is easily in strong enough shape to take on these youngsters. Like he did before during the training. There are so many other moments. Of course, I must mention the scene in which Cruises's character pretty much loses his job and then shows everybody what he is capable of and that it is possible to get this mission done. In the process, he steals a priceless plane as well. Hamm's character's words there, his reaction was also so entertaining to watch, even if a bit exaggerated, but he made the most of it. The actor I mean. And was there ever any doubt that Cruise's character would fly the mission himself and not just be a teacher? Probably not. I mean I had some doubt if he would make it out alive in the end. Everybody knew the mission would be a success and also that Teller's character would live, but you could always think Cruise's Maverick would die a hero here. Eventually, he did not. It happened in another big franchise recently and that was enough, so good that they let the guy at the center live this time.I must also totally mention the flight sequences. They are nothing short of spectacular and the heart and soul of the film. Of course, the landscapes with all the snow are a true highlight towards the end, but also what they called the dogfight in the end with the evil pilot guy was a true highlight. This they had to use to really show that it is all about the pilot when it comes down to man versus man and not about the (potentially inferior) plane. Also pay attention to the recurring idea of \"Don't think. Just do.\" This was also quite on the edge between cool and too much. But it's all good I'd say. Just like when Mach 10 extremely early on wasn't enough yet for Maverick. But I take it with the \"Where am I?\" \"Earth.\" quote. That was hilarious. Maverick surely survives really many of these critical situations up in the air with his plane coming down fast. The drama coming from flocking birds or characters losing consciousness because an elephant is metaphorically sitting on their chest was nice entertainment too for sure. Surely, a lot more I could mention. Oh yes, Ed Harris in the prologue. How could I forget about him!? I also think they established some nice ties to the original movie. Good job there. I suggest watching that one right before you see this one here. But it is not a must-do of course. You will nicely understand the story in here as well without even having heard of the film from the 80s. Not a requirement to know or have seen that one. So yeah, I give \"Top Gun: Maverick\" surely a thumbs-up and to be honest I almost felt myself at some point as if I was sitting in a flight simulator because the cockpit scenes were so convincing. By the way, could one say anything negative about this film when Cruise himself shows up at the world premiere in a helicopted he flew himself? Doubtful. Coolest guy ever. And right man for the role. Do not miss out on this quality film before it disappears from movie theaters. At home, it will not be half as spectacular, even if admittedly you can play a little drinking game with your friends where one has to take a shot for each cringeworthy moment and you will be pretty drunk when it's over. Not gonna lie. With this film, you get what you came for.",

            "content": "What makes Tom Cruise the biggest name in action movies worldwide is the daredevil persona he has carefully maintained over the years, combined with his almost vampiric ability to delay the ageing process. Making a sequel to an era-defining film like \"Top Gun (1986)\", 36 years after the original would have been taxing on any other actor but this man makes it seem like a walk in the park. When \"Maverick\" takes to the control of that fighter jet, you are sucked in again to the mesmeric, fast-paced world of \"Top Gun\", with the adrenaline-pumping and goosebumps-inducing narratives only strengthening in this brilliant sequel.We rejoin Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Cruise), a daredevil fighter pilot who still refuses to play by the rules and keeps turning down promotions that would see him grounded instead of being in the air where he belongs. Tasked with rejoining the famous \"Top Gun\" Naval Fighter Pilot academy, this time as a trainer, the movie follows his journey as a highly unconventional teacher, teaching a bunch of rag-tag hotshots that it is not the plane, but the pilot that makes a difference in high-stakes air combat. Director Joseph Krasinski stays true to the vision and world building so painstakingly done by the original film's director, the legendary Tony Scott, by paying rich tribute to some of the most memorable motifs and elements used by his accomplished predecessor.Miles Teller is expectedly terrific as the troublemaker from the class of students, while Glen Powell and Monica Barbaro ably play the other cadets that \"Maverick\" has to beat into shape for a crucial real-world mission. The fighter plane dogfights are painstakingly filmed, with the perfectionist in Cruise insisting that each member of the cast portraying a pilot in the film mandatorily fly in one of the fighter jets built by Boeing Co. So they could fully comprehend the physical and emotional duress undergone by a pilot operating under the strain of immense gravitational forces.Despite losing his voice to throat cancer, I loved the way the makers still managed to include Val Kilmer back in his iconic role of \"Iceman\", Maverick's b\u00eate noire. Jennifer Connelly is enthralling and captivating in equal measure as Maverick's love interest and I'm glad the director went an age-appropriate way in the romance than pairing up the 59-year-old Cruise with a young actress.The iconic BGM and the music of the original, composed by the legendary Harold Faltermeyer can never be matched and the makers smartly recreate the same with minimal changes, to doubly recapture the blend of soul-stirring music, bone-crushing action and exhilarating aerial combat sequences that made \"Top Gun\" such a cult classic action blockbuster.The cinematography from Claudio Miranda captures every dip, swerve, dive and turn with panache and realism, so much so that you feel all the tension and anxiety of the protagonists on screen. While the screenplay follows a familiar road, hitting all the feel-good high notes and redemptive arcs you would associate with such a movie, the \"Top Gun\" junkie in you can forgive the makers as they more than live up to the credo of this mother of all action franchises, that still makes you scream \"I feel the need, the need for speed\", 36 years on! Highly recommended! Catch it on the biggest screen possible because Maverick, he is back baby, in all his legendary glory!",

Surprisingly, the original hasn't dated. It's still a good film. Kelly McGillis looks gorgeous, sassy, fun. The Cruiser (tm) hasn't changed a bit.

My teenage daughter and her friend said they were bored. They didn't understand what was going on. I suspect it's their own fault because the film is far from boring. She did say she wasn't paying attention.It is what popcorn cinema should be. Full of action, wittiness, oozing sexiness....and above all thoroughly entertaining.Cruise still has that smile and it's still working.Miles Teller is good in this too. Quite a transformation from his roll in Whiplash.Some very touching, tear inducing, scenes in there as well.It's a lovely homage to the original.One other mention, Jennifer Connelly effectively takes over the love interest from Kelly McGillis.She's my age and God she looks fantastic. Beautiful, full of charm and wit and has a great onscreen chemistry with The Cruiser.TBH, The Cruiser looks amazing for his age.Anyway, this isn't going to win any major oscars.

            "content": "I am a huge fan of the original 1986 Top Gun. I was 16 years old when I first saw it and have watched too many times to count since. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But it is what it is. A fantastic summer blockbuster with great action, music and at least a couple of characters we care about. It was rock n roll in the sky and I love it.When I first saw the trailer for Top Gun: Maverick over 2 years ago I was really excited and was hoping it would at least meet my expectations. Of course it was delayed like a lot of films because of COVID but the hype machine has been in full overdrive for the last couple of months. Well for me and seems for most people the wait was worth it. I just saw it today and it met and in some ways exceeded my pretty high expectations!!! The story is simple just like the original but as with it coming so many years after their needed to be more drama and true in to some of the conflicts in the first film. Of course Maverick if still a captain in the Navy but still loves flying and breaking the rules. It's really not a spoiler but Maverick is called back to Top Gun to train some new hot shot pilots for a very dangerous real world mission. He is actually called back by his old nemesis/friend \"Iceman\" played of course by Val Kilmer. And also something that was already know is that Val Kilmer would be back for this film. His presence is really effective in this film. In fact he is part of what is the best scene in either of the Top Gun films. The main part of the story is that one of the pilots that called to Top Gun is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw. The son of Goose, Maverick's rear and best friend who died in the first film. Rooster is played by Miles Teller. He has conflict with Maverick about things in that past that held his career back. Maverick tried to protect him and he lost opportunities in the Navy and Rooster resents him. It isnt hight sophisticated drama but this film dies pay more attention to the emotional parts of the story more the the first film.Of course the aerial action in the film is spectacular. There was obviously slot more budget for this film so the flight scenes are longer and more complex visually. Like the first film most of the action was done with real jets but this one does have some CGI involved but the they work. I will say that even though they are like the first film they arent a fast cut and frenetic. Tony Scott didn't have the budget for longer scenes so he replied more on fast editing and the soundtrack to create the sense of speed and danger. This time director Joseph Kosinski does much of the same but the scenes are longer and more elaborate.The truth is that the success of the film hinges on it's star Tom Cruise. And he delivers. His performance is very good. Even though he i almost 60 the guy looks as young as the actually younger cast members in the film. He is just a movie star. He is one of the last true Hollywood movie stars He might be a kind of crazy character in real life but he is just one of those actors with the star power to carry a film. He does hereEven though the film relies on our nostalgia for the first film it isn't all just a carbon copy. . There are call backs to the first film but because the new aspects of this sequel mostly work I really enjoyed the winks to the original.I saw it in a packed theater and it was obvious that everyone was into the film. There is no better way to watch a film like than in a full theater. I missed that for the last couple of years Top Gun: Maverick is what a sequel should be. It recreates the feel of the first film but it's good enough on its own. That is rare these days!!!Grade: A.",

The military aspect of the plot was a rip-off of Star Wars IV. The majority of the movie focused on interpersonal relationships and how all of it came together to take the viewer from the past to the present with a deft touch.Cruise deserves accolades for this picture as a well blended vehicle. I suspect that he will be denied for purely political reasons. If not, he will have to be content to rake in much $$$.I don't think Maverick can wait another 30 years for a follow-up.

Well guess what... for distribution at 24FPS, the editors must cut countless hours of excellent rapid motion material that was too fast for 24 FPS.When Tom Cruise says that the movie is best viewed in IMAX -- he is fraudulently lying to your face (or ears).And actually Tom Cruise is referring to \"LIE-MAX\" since true IMAX film is 18K resolution, or 130 cycles/mm at 30% response (Kodak D96 developer, ANSI Standard PH2.39-1977 (R1990) -- EASTMAN 2366 datasheet.LIE-MAX is like 64kb/s audio on an iPod.

            "content": "I've never been a fan of the movie \"The Best Shooter\". The picture somehow passed by and was remembered for a good story at one time with several significant moments and a completely passing plot. However, the announced sequel to the film and the ardent interest in Tom Cruise's new work attracted my attention. The picture became even more interesting when it began to bypass large-scale blockbusters at the box office one after another. That's when I decided to watch this movie to personally verify the quality of the proposed sequel. And I really liked the picture.The film boasts an impressive budget of $ 140 million and an excellent box office, which is close to $ 1.5 billion. Such figures are not amenable to every mastodon, of which there are a lot only among movie comics. What impressed the viewer so much with the second \"Maverick\"? I won't say for everyone, but for me it became a high-quality large-scale action movie, where drama and full-scale shooting are successfully intertwined. When viewing the latter, they are somehow noticed by themselves. Verified shots, dynamics in flight scenes, unusual angles - all this really attracts and does not look somehow hackneyed in our modern era of blockbusters, where such scenes have become the norm for a long time. It is in this film that action scenes are especially memorable.I consider the close connection of this project with the first film to be important. An excellent and even somewhat cunning move on the part of the creators. The writers and director skillfully play on the emotions of the audience, who are repeatedly sent to the events of the first part, which happened more than 35 years ago. They do it both cheekily and cleverly. I, as a spectator, understand this, when here and there they tell and show what is connected with the first picture, but at the same time the success and sincerity of the previous film respond with a kind of longing for the past, when the main character was young, and my generation, along with the film, was just born. Now we are older, and Maverick Cruz managed to raise his friend's child, protecting him as best he could. Decades have passed, but the hero is still with us. Don't know. It's a strange feeling, but it's like you've lived your whole life, and for Maverick and Cruz, these 35 years have passed, he's back with us, his story continues, and you grow up with him. The more interesting for me was the appearance of Val Kilmer in this project. The actor has been fighting laryngeal cancer since 2015. In the film, this moment is played out interestingly.Some scripted moments look controversial. For example, I was little convinced by the storyline just with the son of a Goose, a Rooster (in the original, the call sign Rooster). The conflict between Maverick and Bradley, that's the guy's name, looks somewhat far-fetched and even implausible, given that Maverick did what he did, and the young guy himself could not influence it.The line with the heroine Jennifer Connelly was also weak. The actress played perfectly, demonstrating Maverick's long-standing love interest, but it seemed to me the whole movie that the girl was introduced here simply because the actress Kelly McGillis refused the original role of Charlie from the first film (I don't know the true reason for her non-participation, just an assumption). It would be wiser to develop this line, especially considering that the creators made so many important references to the first picture. In general, the heroine Connelly Penny fit well into the picture, her story with Cruz was revealed, but there was clearly a certain alienness of this narrative.The film itself looks dynamic and with interest, despite the high duration of the film. Director Joseph Kosinski did a great job, managing to present aerial combat scenes to the audience with unusual visual solutions, convey the same recognizable camaraderie that the first film was imbued with and competently depersonalizing the main antagonists of the picture. There is dry information about the \"enemy base\" that needs to be eliminated. What kind of enemy it is, why it was recorded there, is not discussed. And for good reason. The audience should be focused on the story of the pilots, their flight and the approaching attack. Competently, without any political agenda, this will suit everyone.The film is not replete with technical data so that it is clear which plane and what is better. However, through dialogues, it is easy to understand who has the advantage, why it is impossible to fight with some planes against others, and which of the air vehicles are more maneuverable than the others. There is no confusion and by the beginning of the final act you clearly understand what the advantages of the team are, and what awaits them in case of an error.The picture is remembered by several twists, but I was more impressed by the visual component and the music. The creators were able to transfer that spirit of the mid-1980s into modernity and at the same time do it, successfully combining it with the current rhythm of the narrative of the paintings. The scenes of flights and aerial shootouts are very impressive, and Cruz once again proves that he doesn't care when he is masterfully flying real planes even in his 60s.\"Maverick\" came out as a worthy sequel with a new and interesting story, excellent visual and audio sequences. The picture is designed to remind of the past, to show modernity, to reveal the old problems that still oppress the heroes, and also to give a couple of fascinating hours to the audience.9 out of 10.",

The film pays respect to the first but then goes above and beyond in its own story and edge of your seat entertainment. Val Kilmer is the man! It's so nice to see a reflection of honor in our military in a 1980s fashion. No agendas or subtle political messages, just good old fashion entertainment that makes me proud to be an American and shows love towards our pilots.

            "content": "After a long period of development, production finally started in 2018. After filming was completed the following year, the release was postponed several times for post production and Covid-19 it finally saw release in 2022...and was worth the wait.After a fun prologue, the film has a fairly straight forward plot-Maverick training a younger generation to pull off a mission- but the writers do fit in a good character arc for Maverick (dealing with his aging and his relationship with Goose's son) and similar to McQuarrie's work with Mission Impossible work, the mission has it's own complications, especially in the extended climax. While a little cheesy at times it succeeds in being very entertaining and surprisingly very funny at times.Cruise put a lot of energy into promoting the film and is clearly having fun reprising the role. The character is very enjoyable and pushing him into a mentor role he's clearly not comfortable with leads to some great character moments. Miles Teller is great as Goose's son who's journey-while predictable at times-is convincing and well performed. The rest of Cruise's team are a likable bunch and get an extended scene together acting as an introduction but in a film running only slightly over two hours, it's perhaps inevitable some of these parts are a bit thin. Jennifer Connelly is very charming as Maverick's old flame Penny (a character mentioned but not scene in the original) though it does feel like the role was a re-cast. Val Kilmer gets a short cameo as Iceman which, in acknowledging his real life health issues-is very touching and the emotional high point of the film.As to be expected in a belated sequel to a beloved film, there are plenty of call backs (especially a very similar opening/credits sequence set to 'Danger Zone' again), with some 80's nostalgia. There is lots of good use of action with some stunning plane sequences. Joseph Kosinski previously collaborated with Cruise on the visually stunning 'Oblivion' and the film looks fantastic, especially with the use of desert in the training and snow at the climax.There are flaws-the opening sets up a 'humans vs drones' idea which-other than to establish Maverick and 'Top Gun' itself as out of there time doesn't get much further exploration and it can be a bit predictable at times but is fun enough to ride out the cliche's.Ending with an enjoyable Lady Gaga song [if not quite as memorable as 'Take my breath away', this is a really fun time. It would have been easy to cobble together a rushed sequel/rehash back in the day but this, while respectful of the original, is a great film.As for Tom Cruise, he seems to be at the receiving end of some very bitter, cruel and vile comments at times, especially due to his private life. Yet he has an acting career nearly spanning five decades. All he has done for me is entertain with some brilliant and at times incredible films, especially with the last few Mission Impossible films where he has taken stunt work to a whole new level to give the cinema audience the best experience.Although he's approaching 60, I hope he has a few more films left in him like Top Gun: Maverick which is without a doubt my film of the year so far and one of the best sequels ever made.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise to be is one of the best actors of his generation. While he has played in some bad films (The Mummy, Cocktail, Losin' It), I still believe his movies are some of the greatest any actor has produced in the past 40 years. I thought Top Gun(1986) wasn't one of Cruise's best films. I would reserve that for Rainman, the Mission: Impossible movies, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, and Minority Report. Though Top Gun(1986) is not without its merits. It has excellent Cinematography, Visual Effects, Sound, and a great Soundtrack. When they announced this movie, much of me wanted to be excited. Though at the same time was worried that it would be like many recent remakes and not be necessary. To my surprise, I was proven very wrong.Usually, I don't make many trips to the theaters these days unless I am super excited about a movie. This was not a movie that I was super excited about, so I decided to skip it and wait for it to come out on DVD. When I began to read the reviews; and see the box office receipts for this movie, it almost blew me away. A sequel to a film made in 1986 is on pace to make over a billion dollars & it's critically acclaimed. At that moment, I just knew; that I had to go see the movie in theaters. The cherry on top is that I didn't even have to pay for a ticket. My mother, a huge Tom Cruise fan, won some tickets in a raffle.Top Gun: Maverick is perhaps the best Tom Cruise film I have ever seen. Tom Cruise is clearly the top-billed actor in this movie, but it wasn't just cruise's performance that helped this movie \"soar.\" Miles Teller (Rooster) of Whiplash fame gives an excellent performance as Goose's son. Teller makes you feel the emotion that he's putting into his character. While also being the son of an iconic original character, you can't not root for him. Glen Powell (Hangman) is a good antagonist (not villain) character for this movie. Monica Barbaro (Phoneix) showed that she is a future star as well as her WSO Lewis Pullman (Bob) played \"Bob,\" a funny goofball character. The performance by these young actors and actresses is some of the best parts of this movie, but you cannot forget the veteran actors. The veterans include franchise veterans Val Kilmer (Iceman) and Ed Harris (Hammer). Kilmer, whose battle with throat cancer led him to lose his ability to speak, had his voice digitally remade for one line in this movie, and it was worth it. Kilmer was the reason I got into Biographical films with his portrayal of Jim Morrison from the Doors in The Doors (1991) and Doc Holliday in 1993's Tombstone. Ed Harris, who has been in so many great films that it might take me a paragraph to write about, is in very little of this movie though he gives off the same \"Hard-A*s\" vibe from the original film. Two veteran actors new to the cast Include Jon Hamm (Cyclone) of Mad Men fame and Jennifer Connelly who I've liked since she was in Labyrinth. Which coincidently was released when the original Top Gun came out in 1986.When I write a full review, I always try and explain my favorite and least favorite parts of the film's plot. I would hate for someone to click on this review and have the movie spoiled before they see it, so I'm writing a review without giving away any plot details.This is one of the best films that I have seen all year. I would confidently say that I am giving it a 10/10.",

It's cheesy stuff at times, it isn't immune to giving us a bunch of fan service, but where it counts - providing thrilling jet sequences filled with beauty, stakes, and tension - it thrives. Absolutely incredible aerial photography, a finale action sequence for the record books, and a revived Maverick make this an action film worth catching.",

The entire film seems more like an ode to Tom Cruise who appears to want to prove that he still got it (lots of shots showing his arms, chest, putting t-shirt on, playing shirtless on the beach etc). Tom, you're a legend and you don't need to do that.What I'm super confused about are the multiple reviews giving this film 10 out of 10 and people reacting with anger whenever some critic (there are very few of them) dares to say they didn't like it. It's a very similar situation to Black Panther which was a b class /straight to DVD movie but got critically appraised because of political climate.I expect more big flashy productions with zero substance coming out as theatres need people to get back to the cinemas.",

However, it is rare and I underline the word rare!! To find a sequel that outruns the orginal 80s movie, specially in this era that is filled with much of political tensions, and PC stuff that are risky to cross in the making of any production, nevertheless, Top gun Maverick managed to ensure a secure come back and to deliver a great movie.Concerning the movie, I wont say much, so that this won't be considered a spoiler review, but if you are seeking that enjoyable heroic adrenaline nostalgic rush that was felt in late 80s and 90s and the early 00s movies such as die hard, brave heart, that these type of movies managed to deliver, in a beautiful romantic package, then this movie is indeed the cup of tea you need to be sipping.Top gun Maverick is very enjoyable nice movie that was directed in a great matter and detailed very well, it also contains the healthy right amount of masculinity that had gone in absence in most of the last decade cinematic productions, and yes it might have some exaggerated moments and allowing the hero of being a hero, but comen isn't that what movies are meant to do, setting role models and encouraging us to exceed our selves... Finally if this movie was made in early 00s I would give it 6 or 7, but due to the fact that it brought back the hope that motion picture industry is not dead yet, and still enjoyable good movies are still manageable despite all the barriers that the social and political atmosphere throws in todays world I give it a rating of 9.P.s Tom cruise is a great actor I always respected his acting and his ability to deliver dramatic and romantic performance while remaining the action figure he managed to be.",

It was everything I was hoping it would be. Yes, it definitely did follow the formula to some extent of the original, but that's what makes a sequel so good. The casting was good, the action was great and I thought the chemistry between all the characters was as good as the first one. I was so happy with this one!",

Love to watch movies and series in free time, at home or in the cinemas.80s movies are one of my favorite movies to watch as their not full of CGI and ALWAYS have great storylines. I have to thank my parents for that as they introduced me to Top Gun 1 and some other movies, when I was a kid.And now, for me 5 years later, Top Gun 2 comes out. What a time to be alive! So without hesitation, me and my parents, bought tickets as soon as the movie was released (in the Netherlands)...One word: AMAZING! I truly understand why the Top Gun movies are my parents favorite movies and I think they're not the only ones. The movie was so good that even my dad (who normally falls asleep while watching movies) was awake!Definitely would recommend this movie to everyone! And if your new... go watch Top Gun 1 first.Have a lovely day! :)",

            "review_title": "A Real Adrenaline Ride",
            "content": "When I first saw the original Top Gun, I really wasn't all that impressed. I found it to be incredibly cheesy and uninteresting. I continued to think negatively about it throughout the years but recently gave it another shot before the release of Top Gun: Maverick. I'm more than happy to admit when I'm wrong about something or when my mind changes, and I have to do that here. The first Top Gun is actually glorious for all the 80s cheese it has and the aerial scenes still hold up today. I actually had a good time with the original upon rewatching it. I was curious about this sequel, but I recently became very excited about it. After having seen it now, I can very happily say that Top Gun: Maverick is the definition of the word awesome. Here's why, even with everything working against me enjoying it over the last number of years, I highly recommend seeing it in theatres.Picking up over three decades after the events of Top Gun, this film once again follows Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), but this time he is brought back to the Top Gun program to be an instructor for graduates. Training the best of the best for a near-impossible mission, this film is filled with training sequences, all of which are thrilling. You don't go to a film like Top Gun: Maverick for the story, but it also delivers on that front. With just enough substance, a likeable cast, and some terrific performances in some very key scenes, I was engaged with this film from start to finish. My only issue with the film overall is the fact that it does feel like an updated version of the original (in all of the best ways possible though).From the same musical queues to very similar scenes involving familiar characters, this film borrows many of the classic moments from the first film. It also has a similar structure to the first film and even some of the cheesy dialogue is present as well. Everything else about this sequel is so well done though that these moments all felt like they were intentional and they worked in the context of the film. Sometimes it's a little too on the nose, but I forgave that, simply because this cast sold every moment of it. This new crew that Maverick has to work with has charisma for days.Ever since I saw Glen Powell in Everybody Wants Some!! I knew I was going to seek out anything he did next. He has the capabilities of being a real movie star and I hope he becomes more of a household name in the future. His performance as the cockiest pilot in the group really worked and his banter back and forth with Miles Teller (who portrays the son of 'Goose,' Maverick's old partner) also does a very good job here. There are many scenes between Cruise and Teller that made me tear up. The emotion is real in this film and that's why I felt so much for these characters. With that said, it's the aerial scenes that make these films stick with you and wow does this film deliver.Every moment these planes are in the air felt real and authentic. I never once felt like I was looking at an effect. That's obviously due to the fact that this cast was in the planes as much as they were allowed to be. From the incredible sound design to the engaging action that has real stakes, my heart was pounding and my eyes were glued to the screen. This is the most thrilling, big screen Blockbuster I've seen in a while. If you're able to see it on the biggest screen possible, I suggest doing so. This movie is great, but the theatrical experience will make it so much better. Top Gun: Maverick is a true thrill ride from start to finish and I can't wait to see it again.",

I was expecting it to be just another ruined classic by a sequel, BUT I was well surprised.After watching it for a second time, I have noticed some details that didn't catch my attention the first time: This whole movie was about, and only - Maverick.It wasn't about the best new pilots of the program Top Gun, it wasn't about saving the world from enemies, it wasn't about his old love, or about the new stealth-super-plane, it wasn't about Goose and his son - it was only and about Maverick and his Mission Impossible.They didn't payed much attention to any other character, not even to Phoenix and her co-pilot after they crashed their plane. They've been sent to hospital for some time, but that time skipped directly and they returned to action as nothing has happened.The whole action goes easy by, in the same way as it is a Mission Impossible movie - well packed action, straight to the point, tension scenes, no time for chit-chats, job done, lets all go home.Accompanied by the well known soundtrack and some other famous tracks.There wasn't anything that's missing and that makes this movie one of the best of the year. Maybe the CGI wasn't the best for year 2022, but still...Only one thing I didn't liked, something not typical for any other movie - they didn't say who are they attacking, what country or continent that was. That really wondered me. I guess it's all because of the so modern\nnowadays \"geo-political-correctness\"?Despite its simplicity - it was very well executed and I'm sure all the \"old fans\" will be happy.

First, the story is extremely ordinary and dated. I don't know how many times I have seen a film where an ex teacher comes back to business to train a bunch of unorganized students to accomplish a mission. Guess the makers wanted to invest less in the story so they went in with an easy one. Top Gun 1 had a much better story involving personals. Second, adding to the previous point, this time the students have no characterization whatsoever except Rooster. You aren't attached to any one of them. This is again because makers wanted to invest more in the stunts. Third, the romance in this film does not work and is forgettable.Now coming to the part which you must have read everywhere, the positives. I watched it in 4DX and had an absolute \"out of this world \" experience witnessing the stunts and this is where I give this film brownie points. Everything is real. No CGI, nothing. With 4DX, the stunts were feeling so realistic that I got completely immersed into the climax. The 45 mins climax is a treat for cinema lovers. Heres a little spoiler without spoiling much- there is a sequence in the climax that is a total rip off of Tom Cruise's own MI 7 (the last one which came out in 2018 with only difference that in that film, it was helicopters). Just breath taking. From next time, if a film releases with 4DX , i am not settling for anything less than 4DX.Tom Cruise, man how does this dude look exactly like he was back in 1986?? XD. Nevertheless he's done a terrific performance. His chemistry with Rooster only gets going in the climax. Others have done a good job as well. ICE has a small sequence.Overall, a movie only to be witnessed in theaters and that too, try 4DX . If you miss it in theaters, don't even think you will enjoy it on TV.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise told his film crew on the set of Mission Impossible 7 last year. Well, Top Gun: Maverick once again confirms just that.Like many others in my circle of friends, I thought the original Top Gun was nice, but never special. For a movie about airplane dogfights, the action in the air is very hard to follow and the editing is often confusing. Of course, Top Gun was huge in its day, but nowadays it seems rather just a bit dated.Thus, I didn't have extremely high expectations for Maverick, but the curiosity was there, as Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie advanced to become the pinnacle duo of the action movie genre in the last decade.And my goodness did they demonstrate that again here. Maverick is nothing less than one of the best sequels and action films ever made. Normally \"being on the edge of your seat\" is a metaphor, but here I was literally leaning forward, mouth agape, and constantly beaming with excitement. Before this film, I had the attitude that airplane maneuvers in movies couldn't be nerve-wracking. Thanks to the visceral editing, tangible, incredibly immersive practical effects, clearly existing dangers, and clearly established dramatic issues, my attitude has changed dramatically.The film spends a considerable portion of the second act preparing for the myriad dangers of the near-impossible mission for the third act.... and it pays off with one of the strongest third acts ever.It's a masterful example of storytelling where all sorts of conflict points, tensions and desires converge to create dramatic moments that literally take your breath away and move you to tears. It's the brilliant visual power of Fury Road combined with the visceral and surprising thrills of Fallout and the driving momentum of 1917.Despite all this, there is room to breathe; the film's greatest strength is the beating heart at its core, which is full of masculine vulnerability, an acceptance of aging, and a very realistic and grounded relationship between two adults in their 50s.I couldn't help but grin as I realized in the first five minutes that the plot of the film is emblematic of Tom's career. Maverick is an aging pilot who keeps choosing to do the riskiest things to advance aviation. He is said to represent a dying breed of pilots in a world that is increasingly turning to artificiality and\nautomation. It's a pointed critique of Hollywood's move away from truly risky blockbusters - and it works because the film gives Tom's Maverick a genuine human tenderness that he completely lacked in the previous installment. The relationship of Maverick and Miles Teller's Rooster makes for wet eyes more than once in the third act.Top Gun: Maverick is a prime example of a perfect sequel: terrific pacing, exciting build-up, cool surprises in both plot and characters, and stylish use of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is truly Hollywood's last superstar.Cinema.",

I don't know if he had to do extra routines to be in shape but he's part of the rare breed of Hollywood iconography which seems to age better than Bordeaux.Incredible camera work. Great close-ups. Lovely use of CGI. Great close-ups of action movements. Stella soundtrack. Great American theatre has come home. It's a blockbuster and it's served full and the audience has lapped it up.I am very glad that they did this despite my reservations. Somehow it's less cornier than the original and the action scenes are better because of the technology improvements and the MACH training is a fun addition to the film's agenda which I didn't expect but was a blast.It's acted very well. The script-writing is sound. The atmosphere is incredible. The dialogue is touching and the romance is there and it's a really nice homage to the original movie.In fact I think I prefer this to the original. Yep it's that good. They excelled themselves.

I thought every single character was played perfectly, I thought the action was great and I guessed I would be bored of watching them fly around but I was completely wrong, knowing most shots were 100% real in the plane drew me in so much. The story was okay, the pace was pretty good and there were some very nice hearty momentsNot much I didn't like, you can just enjoy a movie without it being a masterpiece, I would have liked a little more in plane time but other than that I can't complain!!I can see myself watching it again some time, an 8/10 for me.",

So it was very difficult to disappoint me to begin with. But I was still pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product, the rewatch potential is almost 100%Mr Cruise is pushing 60 but hits all the marks perfectly. Perfectly I tell you! He puts himself in the foreground, as expected, but gives the right amount of space to the younger performers. Jennifer Connelly is pitch-perfect as the love interest and they even allowed themselves a few self-deprecating jokes.I have enormous admiration for this cinematic achievement, for the engineering prowess behind the creation and construction of the planes on display and for the almost unreal skill of the pilots involved.

It's very 80s and how I remember the decade, the soundtrack is unbeatable and Scott made a very stylish film but I just don't dig the story line... I do like Cruise, he has made some great films but there is better 80s films then TG.With today's society and generation I'm really shocked to see TG2 has grossed a Marvel gross considering it's not part of the new cinematic experience. It's a product of the 80s, it's not all about cgi heroes ect yet it's managed to make that impact and I will give it credit for showing when made correctly and older film concept can still make a big impact. Much same with Terminator, that could still work with the big man but in the right hands... And one thing TG2 has done is made Tom Cruise the biggest movie star of all time, literally. We have had names since the 1920s that are legends that have made an impact but Cruiseman has been a consistent player since 1983 and always maintained a huge status.... But with the gross of TG2 then it makes him the no.1 actor star of all time over every single man/lady to grace the screen.",

            "review_title": "Better than the Original",
            "content": "I have to admit that I found this film somewhat better than the original. That is probably because it actually had more of a plot than the first film, which was basically about a bunch of hot shots going to a training school for elites, and then having a bit of a battle at the end. Okay, one could argue about the first film being about how a hot shot is humbled (or like Tarantino, claiming that it is a film about a man coming to terms with his homosexuality), but in the end, as far as I could tell, it was just an advertisement for the US Navy.Okay, one could easily argue that about this film as well, and in part you are right. However, I did feel like that it had more of a plot, and there was much more to the battle at the end than it was in the original. In fact, I was somewhat surprised that once the mission was completed, there was more to the film than I expected.There are two elements to this film though, one being that it is about an older fighter pilot struggling to maintain his relevancy, but also about a man who is struggling to deal with the ghosts of his past. In fact, one thing that is pointed out at the beginning is that Maverick has pretty much stagnated in his career. Despite the fact that he is a highly decorated officer, he still basically flies planes. However, his response to that is quite good, namely that he likes to fly planes.It sort of makes sense though because there is so much talk in the modern world that success if measured by how far up the ladder you climb, but the reality is that there are actually quite a lot of people that don't want to climb the ladder. I have worked with a number of people who are really, really good at what they do, however they have no interest in moving up the ladder, or as other say 'progressing their careers'. This is the impression that I get from Maverick, that he is happy where he is, and that is flying planes.Apparently Cruise was insistant that he did not want any blue screens in this film, which basically meant that all of the shots in the planes were actually filmed in the planes, the same being with all the stunts and maneuvers that were performed (though I'm not entirely sure whether Cruise can actually fly a jet, though he does know how to fly). Another thing that stood out is that in part the film still followed the track of the original film, which included a scene where everybody is playing ball on the beach. Though the interesting thing is that at the bar scene at the beginning, instead of being amongst the young people, he is sitting alone at the bar watching on. In a way, these two films seem to bookend Maverick's life, with nothing in between, despite the fact that we are given an idea of what went on between the two films. However, one thing is clear that while he has aged physically, he hasn't really matured all that much.As I mentioned though, compared to the original, I felt that there was a lot more meat to this film than the first one, which was just about a bunch of flyboys going to a training camp, and then fighting some MiGs at the end. This one, there was more urgency, and more of a plot, and more depth to Maverick's character than the original. Mind you, it was also quite interesting that they used the opening credits for the first film for this one as well.",

Also, not once does the star appears old or jaded.Herein, he is a maestro of supersonic fighter jets who can test them to record breaking speed and manoeuvre them like a toy with impeccable strategy to meet the concerned mission's need.Alongside, he also teaches his unconventional albeit highly effective flying methods to a new batch of military graduates bursting with youth, super confidence and passion to do something out of the ordinary.And he battles the ghosts of his past and rekindles an old flame.As an exceptional dancer makes the toughest of steps appear like a child's play, the combo of good direction, acting, cinematography and special effects in the movie, ably simplifies the world of supersonic jets, their architecture & manipulation and their limitation on different terrains and altitudes !!Everything is easily understandable and this is no mean feat.You will find the movie thrilling & entertaining and around midway, you will start predicting it's end, but it will surprise you with an interesting climax.In spite of woven around a top class military assignment, the movie is not gruesome to watch, as the bullet and bomb firing scenes are more on the lines of a hi-tech video game.Also, it's a family entertainer with no nudity or intimate scene.Top Gun Maverick is a 'Tom Cruise Special' giddy cocktail of - adrenalin rush, emotions and nostalgia, which needs to be watched in a theatre for full entertainment of the senses.Please don't wait for it's OTT release.Last but not the least, though the movie is a sequel of Top Gun (1986), a huge commercial hit by Tom Cruise and team, it can be watched as an independent film.",

I have no interest in watching back and forth gunfire and/or car chases. This however is NOT your typical action movie, and I was surprised by how much I liked it. Good story, well made, well-filmed, no gratuitous violence nor gratuitous sex. Yay!!I may disagree with Mr. Tom Cruise's personal views, but there's no denying he's a very strong actor, and he definitely comes through here, as does the rest of the cast.I never saw the original, but Maverick did a fine job with filling in the missing pieces.The story develops nicely and logically, and the build-up is steady and gradual. It will obviously please aeronautics fans, but there is also a healthy - but not overboard - dose of drama, sentimentality, and even romance. So ladies if you think this is one to skip, you might just be surprised like I was! There something for everyone here.I was also pleased by the ending. I don't like depressing endings, nor ones that leave you hanging, and Maverick had neither of these issues. I could actually watch this one again. Highly recommended!!",

Do yourself a favour, find the biggest screen in your area, preferably with dolby ATMOS and go see it.To the review of the movie itself? The second Top gun takes everything I enjoyed about the first movie and improves it while fixing some of the issues that I had to overlook in the firs one. Let's get those out of the way first. The plot of the first movie always seemed sort of crudely constructed, but it never bothered me as it was not the point of the movie. What I mean by crudely constructed? Fun areal exercises, a bit of drama and then a mission out of no-where just so there is a 3rd act with some stakes. Crude, but it never bothered me. So how does the second Top Gun fix this? The plot is still simple, but it is focused with well defined stakes. The team is preparing for a specific mission and the 3rd act is about executing that mission. The viewers understand the parameters, the dangers and the stakes, so you are engaged the whole time.My second issue used to be that the dogfights were always somewhat confusing. Boy oh boy does this movie improve on that front. The movie was shot in real F-18s and it shows. They set out to make you feel like being in a figher jet and they achieved it marvelously.Sprinkle on top of that some character conflicts and resolutions. Some callbacks to the original movie and some heartfelt moments that had me tearing up a bit and you have yourself an excellent time. Do yourself a favour and just go see it, I'll probably go rewatch it this weekend.",

So, is this movie any good, does this movie bring us some nostalgia alongside some fun new characters and an intriguing plot? Oh yeah, it does, and it does it quite smoothly and incredibly riveting. I mean, the whole bunch of action scenes in cockpits and the last 40 minutes of this movie - flawless cinema, absolute brilliance of work, and easily the best action blockbuster this year yet. We need more movies to use these machines because it's just too cool to not use them - I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. A bit of criticism here and there, maybe the storyline with Connelly is - is fun, but not certainly most interesting stuff in the world, and maybe some pilot deserved some more exposition but - I mean, it's nothing.

I remember I wanted to be like my dad when I grow up.3 years ago, I promised him I will take him to see the new Top Gun movie when its out. The movie got delay, and Covid-19 took my father's life.This week, I went to the cinemas 3 times, alone.Every time i (re)watched it, same emotions, same pain, same love.This is is by far the best Masterpiece Tom Cruise was ever a part of. Its a rollercoaster of emotions, too many flashbacks with just the right amount of humor and sarcasm.Everyone says how the first movie is actually better than the second one. Not in this case, as TG:Maverick outshined its prequel and put a closure on the life of Captain (highly decorated) Pete Mitchell. Yes, he is still a captain, a highly decorated one.The way the flight sequences were filmed is remarkable. Imagine a 60-year old Tom Cruise being crushed by actual G-forces in a jet fighter. Tom has aged a few years over the past 36, and this movie will be his legacy.Will I watch it again in dolby and in Digital, and on Bluray? Most definitely.",

The continuity in plot was nostalgic enough to please fans of the original, yet with enough depth to thrill those new to Top Gun.

So, I have certainly seen less realistic things in movies. In fact, I haven't seen a movie that I would call realistic on any level for at least 7 years now. The dialogue was quippy. Kind of like you would find in a superhero movie, and its meant to be. These aren't very realistic situations, so why would there be realistic dialogue. The characters are endearing.

You could feel the power and speed of the planes and the effects it had on the pilots. I was on the edge of my seat watching the dogfights and wondering \"will he/she die?\" Tommy Cruise shows his dedication to his craft and his commitment to realism. The conflicts between characters has SO MUCH depth and intrigue. These gut wrenching conflicts deserve heartwarming pay offs right. Well then go experience \"Maverick\" to see for your self.",

However, one does not need to see Top Gun 1 to follow this plot, even though relationships and the characterization of Maverick himself do build on the first movie.Favorite scene - two guys, behind enemy lines, up on the cliff, looking down at the enemy base and deciding what to do next. Funny.Oddity: With that Drone Happy Commander (Ed Harris) appearing early in the film and with his judgment call, I was expecting the plot to build on contrasting abilities vis-a-vis human fighter pilots and drones.

It is necessary to experience it in cinema and in the best theaters ..A special thriller drama movie, although it has some expected and repeated scenes, but this is what the viewer wanted, like the viewer's habit, wishes that things would end well and that the hero would win, not this dilemma because that's what we want, but I wished there was at least one victim in the movie other than the flashback that we saw with ..At first I expected the flight scenes to be CGI but was surprised that they were real and the actors reacted real about flying in the air and having this unique experience, except Tom Cruise because he is used to these risks ..I liked the story of the film from its first part, but when I watched the first part, I wished they had done one with the same story in our time with technical developments, because the first was catastrophic other than its technical disasters. There were artistic disasters in the performances of the actors and the story, thank God they did the second part in our time because the second was very beautiful and the same as what we wanted ..Tom Cruise as usual restrains skeptics of his abilities, as Tom Cruise is an actor of action-action movies and the like, every time he proves himself and responds to them while at this age mastering his roles and poetic drama scenes, a creative actor in every sense of the word ..The cast selections were great, especially Mils Teller, in which he is very similar to his father's role in the movie Guss in this thing, but Joe introduces you with the movie as well as let your mind connect the topics automatically ..Maverick's and me's nice relationship has increased the film's aesthetic and I'm surprised by some people who didn't like their relationship on the contrary. It was very nice, sweet and appropriate with Maverick's personality, it was when he hesitated to take a decision to resort to it ..Spontaneous comedy dialogues always give a great mix to the viewer and in this movie we have seen a lot of them ..I was never disappointed in the movie except the point I mentioned in the beginning and the experience as a whole, I mean ..My favorite scene in the movie when Maverick was kicked off the bar and saw Roster playing and reminded his classmate of the profession, it was a sad and expressive scene and we delved deeper into Maverick's character .((Performance is not according to the plane specification. But with the skill of the pilot))My Rating : (9.0/10)",

Jennnifer Connelly plays his current love interest Penny, who was mentioned in the first film, and Val Kilmer returns briefly as \"Iceman\" now a respected Admiral nearing the end of his life.Surprisingly superb sequel surpasses the first in every way, though pays its respects to it most satisfactorily while still telling its own story and introducing interesting new characters who could possibly star in future installments, if this turns into a franchise. A huge blockbuster hit that troubled Hollywood could learn many lessons from, as this film is most exciting and emotional, not preachy with the \"message\", but an old-fashioned patriotic feel-good adventure that hasn't been seen for far too long.

Bonkers.Never the less, this film was everything you should expect from a sequel so many years later. It offers interesting story from the original that didn't skew off into some absurd difference, it was as if they had this planned all along - maybe they did, just took this long to achieve it.Still the cinematography was on point, just like the original Top Gun, and the passing of a torch was successful here where it has failed in so many other Hollywood films. Why? Because it never once took a crap on the originals. It never once disgraced the fans, or the original films. Instead it was more like Logan in that it was also about getting too old to keep doing this, but having enough fight to still get in there and get it done.

            "content": "Sequels are a slippery slope to potentially hindering original movies, however Top Gun: Maverick succeeds where most sequels fail.The movie emphasizes on the relationship between Lt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Goose's son). In most 80s action movies, the audience never gets to fully understand how certain deaths of side characters affected the future of main protagonist. The choice for this emphasis in the sequel makes you truly care for Goose's character. The audience can feel even after 30 years how Maverick has been burdened by the death of his best friend. This movie however emphasizes on the idea of forgiveness. By getting Bradley's forgiveness after a series of events, Maverick was truly free from the weight he has been having to carry along with him in a very heart warming way.The film's tone is very tense when it needs to be. In high-stakes situations there is a good constant tension and a sense danger, but the directors do a magnificent job at not making this 'tension' exhausting for the audience. It was very suspenseful, and just when you thought it couldn't get better, it does.In terms of stylistic features, and other artistic choices, Top Gun Maverick is a clear example on why film can be such a breath-taking experience. From the high speed chases, to low-altitude flying environments, the movie is incredibly beautiful and very cinematic (I really want to point out a specific shot of Rooster thinking about returning to enemy lines to save Maverick). The choice for so much practical effects shot in real planes should definitely give the film the credit it deserves.Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick did an impeccable job at continuing the story from the original, despite it being totally unnecessary plot-wise (which is a magnificent accomplishment on its own). Bringing back key characters was the icing on the cake for most fans and the frame that dedicates the film to Tony Scott was heart warming.Three words to describe what the film develops on is limits, instinct, and forgiveness.",

            "content": "'Top Gun: Maverick (2022)' is, in many ways, exactly what you'd expect it to be. It's an earnest, almost cheesy ode to the American military that places emphasis on human pilots (as opposed to drones) who are able to disobey orders when necessary and never seem to get properly sanctioned for doing so. All the themes you'd expect - such as pilots vs officers, humans vs drones and Tom Cruise vs ageing - are here, although the picture is disappointingly decidedly less gay than its predecessor (to an almost revisionist degree). It's jingoistic, albeit slightly less jingoistic than the first flick, and clunky when it comes to everything other than its high-flying set-pieces. It's predictable and it gets off to a pretty rocky start, too. Eventually, though, you realise that you're not thinking about its problems, that they're not even relevant anymore. You realise that you're having a blast and that, ultimately, that's what matters. Every single time the characters get into their cockpits, the film transforms into an invigorating and expertly choreographed action extravaganza. Though the fact that they did most of this stuff for real doesn't inherently make it good, it's undeniably far more effective than any visual effects method of achieving a similar result because it never once requires suspension of disbelief. There are, of course, special effects involved in some of the sequences but they're so seamless and secondary to the overwhelming practicality of it all that they feel just as natural as that which was really present on set. The effects do what they're supposed to do: enhance rather than replace. In an era where some films can't even convincingly put five people together in a single room, practicality like this is even more important than ever before. Even if you aren't actively thinking about the very real ground whizzing past the very real people in the very real planes flying at very really dangerous speeds, you feel it on a subconscious level. There's nothing quite like seeing gravity yank an actor's face so much that they're almost unrecognisable, or two planes dance with each other like ballerinas in the sky. It's incredibly exciting, and credit has to go those involved with transforming arial stunts into actual action scenes. The flick had to be incredibly bad for the environment, though, which is obviously a major downside. It's worth noting that Tom Cruise is actually kind of great in a couple of the dialogue scenes, genuinely delivering a brilliant performance in the piece's most emotional moment. He may be known more for his apparent willingness to die for his craft, but he's a solidified star for a reason and it's important to remember that his earlier roles relied on his acting abilities more than his action abilities (and, in a way, aren't they one in the same?). In the end, the movie is a ton of fun that's simultaneously generic and one-of-a-kind. If it had a better story with more focused character arcs, it could have been one of the all-time greats. As it is, it's an incredible achievement that's often enthralling and deserves most of the praise it's been receiving.",

It is simply IMPOSSIBLE that Top Gun gets the same critical praise as \"The Godfather\" (1972). Ridiculous amount of fake reviews!Mind you, I am a big Tom Cruise fan, I have seen all of his movies and I dont even hate this movie, I merely think it is a bit tedious. I blame the director (same as for \"Oblivion\").This movie has got 75 minutes of talk, talk, talk. The first half is a talking heads movie. We see Tom being a teacher talking to his students about FEELINGS and we get to see Tom talking/flirting to his former ex lover Jennifer Connelly. BORING.Skip the first 75 minutes, because only the last 45 minutes are non stop flying action.BUT... even the action is not very thrilling, because everything is so PREDICTABLE. I knew beforehand that every fighting scene Tom Cruise did, was gonna be successful. And it was. There is no thrill in that!The biggest hype of this movie was about the real life flying scenes of the actors. These flying scenes were pretty looking indeed. But did it blow my mind? No, it was even a bit underwhelming to see Tom Cruise with a helmet and mask on, trying to \"act\", without seeing much of his face. His face looked a bit bloated in his helmet. That's not great cinema...How they achieved to make such a predictable, tedious movie about fighter jet pilots, with so much money available? Well, that's Hollywood for you. Hurrah for Hollywood.",

I totally understand why as well, this was after all Maverick's story since the beginning.I gotta first tell you that I'm not from the generation that experienced Top Gun when it first came out in the 90s, I'm a millennial. I saw Top Gun for the first time five years ago and I thought it was magnificent, a very period piece type of movie that works amazingly in all of its elements- actors, music, setting... and it is so iconic even I can understand it even if I didn't live during that time when it first came out. Fast forward five years and the new Top Gun is here! The reviews have been amazing, many saying that this is the rare case when a sequel surpasses the first movie and that everything is perfect. I totally agree with these aspects but there was something that lost me a bit in the movie.I understand that this is all 100% Maverick's movie but a lot of the characters needed further exploration and development- I know they tried to make the secondary characters I.e. The team that Maverick teaches as distinct as possible but the plot doesn't really have time for any of them which is a shame as I would've loved to see all of these new pilots get a team working relationship and try to overcome the task at hand which we don't really get, we get glimpses of this- after all this supposed heist is done in three weeks but due to the plot it gets shortened to two weeks which is a shame- I know they did this to heighten the stakes but a lot of the character development gets sacrificed... instead we get a lot of conflict that never really gets dissolved until after the heist which feels so forced. I was really bugged that we didn't get more scenes with Rooster, Hangman, Phoenix etc. It's not that Maverick's story isn't compelling per se, it is the emotional core of the story after all but goddamn could this movie have been better with further exploration on the other Top Gun crew, just like in the 80s movie. At least we got a hunky beach scene lol!The music is fantastic, very great use of the older tracks from the movie and the older score vs. The new one which is good! The Lady Gaga song is really awesome as well!All in all it is a good movie, not my favourite but it is good- I understand the praise but it needs a bit more work for me before it can be called amazing- nevertheless I had a fun time at the cinema! Which is all that counts really!",

Comparing it to the first Top Gun, there are some differences: The military is now woke and not only consists of white men, but also of other ethnies and women, though they are only allowed in the second row. The sexualised relationship in the first movie is toned down and replaced with family values and also hints of homo erotism between the male characters. The enemys are never shown as in the first movie, you never see their faces, its just briefly mentioned, that this is a nato operation against a nuclear plant - you could also argue that this is an aggressive act of war, not covered by the UN. But politics are not discussed, the military is just a tool - and the heros just work for the hegemonic position of the usa and dont bother committing a war crime. But as the soldiers the viewers are not allowed to think about it, because if you think, you are dead. Thats the main message of the movie.",

            "review_title": "The hype is real!",
            "content": "Tom Cruise is my favorite actor of all time and just based on his amazing track record in cinema, I was probably more then halfway sure that TOP GUN:MAVERICK was a good movie. All of the endless hype and praise is not enough for me to decide if a film is good or not. I've seen unbridled praise for overrated movies before and I'm sure I'll see it again. The last major film that I even liked was Joker from 2019 and that movie is now in my top films and performances of all time. So that's been a lot to live up to in the last 3 years and virtually every major new movie I've seen in the theatre or streaming has left my sorely disappointed. I waited for the general release of Top Gun Maverick and the wait was worth it! The original Top Gun from 1986 is iconic, an entertaining, thrilling testosterone-filled 80s summer action saga with rocking music and a plethora of memorable moments (Mav's serenade to Charlie, Goose's finger, Iceman's teeth bite, the volleyball scene, the fly-bys) and adrenaline-filled aerial combat sequences. But Top Gun is very much a \"style over substance\" film. This sequel reverses that by building on the rather thin characterization and relationships established in Top Gun and heavily being influenced by mega-star's Tom Cruise's expert acting ability that he's perfected over the last 3 decades. At the time of Top Gun in '86, Cruise became a movie star, but he wasn't taken seriously as an actor. Within 3 years, he received critical praise for Rain Man and got his first Oscar nomination for Born on the Fourth of July. Within the next decade, he would score 2 more Oscar nods for Jerry Maguire (for which he should have won) and Magnolia while jumpstarting the Mission Impossible series in '96 with in my opinion still the best film of the franchise. Within 5 years after Magnolia, Cruise delivered his best performance ever in the masterpiece Collateral, for which he should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Getting overlooked so often probably made Cruise opt to focus mostly on action movies the rest of his career. It's ironic that Cruise has been making MI sequels nonstop for the last 25 years when this film Top Gun Maverick may be better than all of them. Regardless of being passed over for the elusive Oscar prize, Cruise is one of the best actors in Hollywood. Dare I say it, but the insane popularity of this film might just score him his long overdue 4th Oscar nomination. Longshot, but here's hoping.The exceptional sequel opens up with Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (impeccably reprised by Cruise) at his current assignment station somewhere in the Midwest where he is the test pilot for an advanced stealth jet with the ability to push Mach 10. As a result of pushing it too far, the program is shut down, but Mav gets immediate re-assignment as a training instructor back at the Top Gun program in San Diego. The mission commander (excellently played by Jon Hamm doing his classic Don Draper delivery) tasks Mav to train the \"best of the best\" pilots for a dangerous mission in enemy territory where they must destroy a secret energy cache and they must hit the target to implode the base (pretty much a Star Wars Death Star attack). The movie boasts a cast of young stars in the making playing the mission pilots. The de facto main character among the young guns is Rooster (stalwartly played by Miles Teller). Rooster is Goose's son and Teller looks very much like Anthony Edwards, who was a scene-stealer in the original film. But in this one, the mood is more somber as Rooster is angry with and at constant odds with Mav, but not necessarily for the reason that people think. Of course there's a love story in this as Mav re-connects with the infamous Penny (effervescent Jennifer Connelly), the \"Admiral's daughter\" that got an early mention in the '86 film. But the absolute best part of the movie was the emotion-filled scene between Mav and Iceman himself (Val Kilmer making a memorable appearance). Cruise and Kilmer really acted superbly in that scene. This is where I feel that this sequel may possibly top the classic original, because the heart in this movie feels more palpable and real due to the history and gravitas that Cruise brings to his role this time. In '86, both Mav and Cruise were cocky stars-in-the-making. In 2022, they are smarter, wiser, world-weary veterans who have mastered their respective crafts. Also, there's all the aerial stuff! Lol Pretty impressive that the actors actually trained to fly jets so these sequences look as authentic as possible. But where Top Gun Maverick succeeds that so many modern movies fail is that it focuses on the heart of the story underneath, so all of the action is just icing on the cake.",

That smile, those rugged good looks and that natural talent is electrifying. This man is pushing 60 and is clearly at the top of his game. Bringing in Miles Teller as the son of Goose was genius. The relationship between them is contentious at first but the end result is well worth it. It was awesome to see Val Kilmer again, so touching to see him. That was one of the top moments in the movie. I also loved Jennifer Connlley as Penny, she is always wonderful and her chemistry with Tom Cruise is a great match.This movie was amazing... totally worth the wait. I was 16 years old when I saw the original on the big screen and I have forever been a hard core Tom Cruise fan. The original takes you back to a time where patriotism was celebrated and you knew we loved our country. Ahhh nostalgic good times. Well this film takes you back there too even though it is +35 later, the film takes us to a good place and it felt good to watch. For those 2 hours it was pure goodness. A sigh of relief that I didn't feel lectured about what I should feel or do, I wish every movie could be this refreshing. This is a movie I plan to watch in the theaters a few times.

            "content": "I didn't like the original Top Gun, I gave it a 5/10. My issues were largely to do with the characters, I found Maverick insufferable and the story was not captivating enough to make up for that perceived shortcoming.I found it odd when this sequel was announced (some 35 yrs after the original) and was surprised to see the strong anticipation from fans. That said, I think this movie did what it set out to do: make a sequel worthy of Top Gun. And even though I personally don't think of that as a high bar, I can appreciate that TG: Maverick is an improvement on the original.Good things: the action, in particular the aerial shots, were particularly great. Great stunts and a few jaw dropping maneuvers sprinkled in. I think Miles Teller is a bit of an idiot, but even so, he's a good casting as Goose's son in this movie. Callsigns in this movie aren't significantly better, but they seem to have a better background now. I especially like the origin of Hangman's nickname and I thought the inscription on his helmet (H_NGM_N with a noose) was a nice touch. By and large, the second half of the film is where the going gets good, and overall, very entertaining.But all these good things don't erase the fact that this film is still overrated, largely for the script and the continued need to make Maverick a larger than life character.Plot points that didn't need to be plot points were quite annoying. Like the film opening on Cruise taking an unsanctioned flight to save the flight program against unmanned drones (definitely not cliched not at all like the first half of Green Lantern). Not a big issue in itself, but when the plot later mentions that they need to run a mission where the parameters require they pull maneuvers hard for humans to withstand and get a mission done within a certain time limit with no room for failures and no casualties, it becomes increasingly unclear why they introduced the concept of drone airships that only served as confusion over why no one thought to use drones, which are almost purpose built for those wildly arbitrary mission parameters. Moreover, the movie sort of brushes over some of the other options they have available, like, idk, maybe a missile strike on the very exposed SAM sites, or 5th gen fighter escorts. Whatever the case, the failure to present other options is something I'm willing to overlook (rule of cool) as long as they don't make an effort to shoot themselves in the foot, which they did by introducing the elements of drones without any tie in.Another issue, larger than life survivability that we're supposed to write off. Surviving a flight control critical failure at Mach 10 and surviving with no issues (sure), surviving a F-14 Crash with no parachute visual, low altitude, and no injuries (sure), multiple ejections with no major aftereffects so we're not dealing with the weight of the Plan B consequences (sure). These are things fit for a Mission Impossible film, item's I'd usually be willing to overlook if this weren't a de facto 2 hour recruitment ad for the Navy / Air Force.Character dynamics also were strange. Maverick walks into a town he hasn't been to in 30 years. Immediately rekindles his relationship with Penny (who wasn't even in the original film I'm just finding out, actually this might be acceptable in that case, we don't know the terms they ended on). Unclear what happened between Rooster and Mav, because they seemed to made things up immediately after no large action was taken. Idk, other things like Hangman just being antagonistic for no good reason (he's a poor echo of Iceman).One more thing, the mission itself (staying low, flying through a canyon, firing into a ventilation shaft to stop a WMD with no margin for failure, trusting your instincts instead of a guidance computer/laser targeting) was awfully similar to the Star Wars run. Not the worst thing to happen, but kinda strange that happened)In all, way better than the original, though this had the benefit of modern filming and VFX technology to rely on. A very shaky start with zappy one-liners amidst a larger array of cringe dialogue and a poorly cobbled together plot. Ultimately a decent 2nd half packed with incredible action and relatively strong ending. Top Gun Maverick is what the original Top Gun wishes it were, but don't be fooled, while this action flick has great action, altogether, this is at best, a good movie.",

I do not think it will pass \"The Bechdel Test\".

I'll be honest, I had a long day and was pretty tired by when the movie started, things were slow, I hadn't watched or heard of the original Top Gun, hence had zero context, and 15 mins into the movie thought this was going to be a 2-hour long snooze fest. Boy was I wrong. Once the plot was laid and homage was paid to the original, the movie just kept climbing up the roller coaster, hitting a new peak every time. I now have a burning desire to be in a fighter jet or frankly any kind of combat aircraft.

The whole premise with Goose's son going from angry at old guy to understanding him has been done in so many other movies. The beach scene is useless except to show everyone's muscles. The \"admirals\" are generic bureaucrats that could've been played by anyone. The ending action scene was not surprising in the least. Sure some of the flying moves were great, but how many times do we need to see Tom Cruise fly upside down? I get the nostalgia, but man, besides liking the fact that they gave Val Kilmer a scene, it was really disappointing.",

The performances, story, emotional weight, sound effects, cinematography, nostalgic soundtrack, direction, screenplay, pacing, happy ending, and production value all deserve 10 out of 10, doubtlessly.Also, what is great about this movie is that it lets us sympathize not only with Maverick, but also with the pilots whom he trains and the character of the four-star Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky who is ill, especially when the person knows that the actor who plays this character (Val Kilmer) is also ill. Also, this movie shows us how dangerous, risky, and challenging the career of a fighter pilot is.Concerning the flaws, to be honest, I can't find any flaw in this movie. From my point of view, this movie is the movie that deserves to be called \"perfect\". So when it comes to the score, I gladly give Top Gun Maverick 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "People are so easily swayed with advertisement releases of hyped up propaganda promising much; the main reason we have so many Sheeple' these days, but offering far less than promised!I honestly found this incredibly dull and I was totally disappointed with the aerial scenes...of which so much had been promised.The plot of this was not original; I believe it was based upon the real life Israeli attack on a nuclear installation from a few years back. By the time Cruise was sent back to the Top Gun school I was already quite bored with the goings on. The mission lead up of training etc was so dreary, dull and forgetful that I had to force myself to watch the film in its entirety.I watched an Asian air force fighter pilot action film a month or so back and, it had some of the best aerial scenes and action capture since the 1968 Battle of Britain film.I am in awe as to why a great many people think that Cruise is a top notch actor. He is not, but he is seemingly clever enough to co star with people who are and thus make him look good. His action films are all special FX driven with CGI etc and his films as Jack Reacher are a joke, as the Jack of the books is 6 feet 5 inches in height and Cruise is what?....5ft 7 or 8 inches.Not worth the 36 year wait but the good news is that he won't be doing a third as he is way past the age barrier for a fighter pilot; a bit of welcome blessed relief for those who are in agreement with my thoughts on this drivel! \ud83d\ude04",

Plot was pretty simple a asusual Team on mission story , but way they build tense around the mission by showing its difficulties makes more intresting . Joseph Kosinski's as director done a spectacular job . Cast wise each and every cast gave their best . Tom Cruise doing this role after 36 years delivered marvelous performance . Miles Teller playing as Roose ( son of Goose character in Top Gun ) was literally show stealer . Jennifer Connelly done her part well . Relationship between Roose and Maverick was emotional . Each and every action sequence with flight jet was very well made , especially last 30mins literally gave me a seat edge experience . Only drawback I felt was romance track . They missed to explain the absence of Charlie's Character . Overall a must watch movie . PLEASE DON'T MISS IT TO WATCH IT ON BIG SCREEN .",

Therefore a basic plot, which however is overshadowed by a work of mistral direction, with jet scenes (F-14,F-35, ...) made without CGI, with an apt photograph.

The meeting between Maverick and Iceman is an emotional meeting, the pain is real as we notice Val Kilmer's inability to deliver his lines because of his speech impediment but he pulls through.Following the same direction cum cinematography as applied by the late Director Tony Scott we are been reminded of his classic work. And when the sun comes sun we see \" In memory of Tony Scott \" once again our emotions are been touched. Joseph Kosinski direction may be fascinating but not original as earlier stated it is a derivative of Tony Scott. The stunt coordination excellently fantastic, this movie is a really great score for Producer Jerry Bruckheimer.Most energy in this film is mostly in the jets as they glide in the sky, will they be caught by enemy power or not ?

The opening scroll explains what 'Top Gun' is at which point you'll be forgiven for thinking they've put on the original film.From there on out it's a perfect mix of old and new. Whilst the story introduces a bunch of new characters and uses a familiar story beat from the original, it separates itself from the from the likes of The Force Awaken and Jurassic World as it doesn't rely on the previous story beats to drive the central narrative nor does it try to beat down previous characters just to push the new ones forward.The story continues the journey of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, 36 years later, giving you some insight on how's he's dealt with the repercussion of the original 'Top Gun' and things that have and haven't happened since!After receiving a call from an old friend, he's forced to confront all of this again. This, alongside the introduction of a particular character, played excellently by Miles Teller, adds emotional weight to Top Gun - Maverick and is nicely balanced amongst the action.Speaking of action, Top Gun Maverick has a lot of it and it's good. There is only so much you can do with with these planes but the nature of the training/mission really helped to notch up the intensity during the flying scenes. This is another check in the W column for Cruise as he continues to prove himself as one of the last real actions stars in Hollywood.It's not all perfect, the romantic elements didn't have much time to develop and the focus on Maverick meant that we didn't get an in depth look at many of the new characters but it was a worthwhile sacrifice.",

The older he gets, the better he gets as well as his films. Cruise brings magic to the screen, an impossible mission only he can execute, and boy he does. The plot simple, but the execution is outstanding. This movie corresponds with the original from 1986 in many levels and in such a perfect way that it's like a miracle, you watch it, you see it, but it's almost hard to believe how good it's done. I wish there were movies like that but I doubt it, my only comfort is that as long as Cruise makes movies the magic will continue (so I'm looking foreword to his next MI projects). If you lived in the 80s and watched the original, it will also bring you back in time and back, which is another miracle, making this movie a masterpiece. 10/10, if I could make it 11/10 I would.",

The main reason for watching is obviously thje electrifying flight sequences which may be the greatest ever put to film due to choreography, editing and actors actually in the seats, which allow you to genuinely follow the flights instead of standing witness to meaningly jump-cuts. However Maverick also has its tender moments especially the relationship between Maverick and Rooster (Teller, son of Goose) which grounds the film and fills in the emotional beats throughout which were only present in the 3rd act of the original. Cruise rightfully is getting many plaudits for this continued dedication to the role of action star as he approaches 60s but Teller really shines here and this may be the movie which pushes him into the true superstardom which anyone who has seen Whiplash knows he has been destined for for almost a decade. This movie is a rollercoaster, you know it'll be safe and where you'll end up but it's exhillerating if you get onboard and allow yourself to be taken for a ride.",

Boy was I wrong! This is not a competently made cash-grabber, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is what happens when people who love what they do put their heads together to try and make a great movie for the audience.The last time a movie made me leave the cinema in SUCH GLEE was way back in 2012 when \"The Avengers\" took their deserved center stage. I can only conclude that (the living icon) Tom Cruise, (the always on-point) McQ, and the (never again) underrated Joseph Kosinski have MASTERFULLY HACKED into the collective subconscious and gave the world EXACTLY what we didn't know we so desperately NEEDED.The entire cast and crew achieved the impossible and not only made ONE OF THE BEST SEQUELS EVER (!), but the movie itself is a LIVING EXAMPLE of everything that we have been missing in movies for the last 10-15 years: viscerally real practical effects; a delightful throwback into simpler, saner times; and unapologetic fun.Hollywood will undoubtedly take notice, but only a handful of smart copycats will fully comprehend that this movies's magic formula is ANYTHING BUT EASY. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is so darn good PRECISELY because it was NOT easy to make, because the cast and crew had to invest real-life sweat, blood, and perhaps even tears to bring it to life, because it doesn't pander to the audience.It looks like the effort will be rewarded as Tom Cruise's love letter to cinema is on track to become one of the biggest box office blockbusters of all time. I couldn't be happier!Yes, the movie that had no right to be very good turned out to be phenomenal. I just might revisit the local cinema.",

Now add an aging superstar willing to fly actual fighter jets for realism... and you get TOP GUN: MAVERICK.It's one of the most PERFECT films of all time (like Back to the Future, Inception, The Dark Knight, Inglourious Basterds, etc.)Top Gun: Maverick (2022 movie) is a GREAT film for various number of reasons including the Action, Irony (\"your kind is heading towards extinction\"), Realism, Message, Stunts, Dedication, Emotions (\"it's time to let go\") and saving old style Hollywood cinema (\"Not today\").All the above things may divert one's attention to assume that it's being loved for wrong reasons like Spider-Man No Way Home, but don't let this divert you as well. It is ridiculously good despite all that and being entertaining.

I've never been a fan of Cruise, the manic stare and slightly psychotic grin are suggestive of a man who is trying too hard, but it can't be denied that his determination to succeed have resulted in some memorable movie roles and he doesn't seem to be slowing down with age.The action sequences are well handled - they're over-the-top, sure, but that's what we'd expect. The story is more or less non-existent and the main mission bears an uncanny resemblance to the original attack on the Death Star from Star Wars, including some faceless enemies, multiple turrets, a long gulley attack run and a seemingly impossible shot. (Although a little too young in 1977, maybe Cruise feels he should've been cast as Skywalker? Not something I'd want to ponder on for too long. Having said that, I think he might have made a better stab at the remakes.)I couldn't remember much from the original movie - so the 'emotional' bits where Maverick meets the old crew didn't mean a lot to me, plus you couldn't help wondering why he hadn't bumped into them before (if they meant that much to him).It's pretty much all surface, but worth watching for those action scenes alone and if you're a Cruise fan, or into homo-eroticism in general, you do get to see him play beach volleyball with the boys.",

S. Pacific fleet, Tom \"Icemen\" Kazansky (a starkly diminished Val Kilmer). Maverick's task is to train the best fighter pilots of the US Navy for an urgent mission to destroy a nuclear power facility of an enemy nation. Among those young pilots is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (a bullheaded Miles Teller), the son of Pete's best friend and co-pilot Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw in the original. Their relationship is more than complicated and one of the underlying plots following us throughout this action-loaded movie, with incredible highspeed stunts with F-18 Fighter jets.The crowd of young pilots has a similar dynamic to the team of Top Gun, with the rivalry between \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell) and \"Rooster\". Also, the modern age is reflected in the Navy, with the female fighter pilot Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace (Monica Barbaro) who is a bad-ass Top Gun cadet. Overall, this movie is great to watch on the big screen, loaded with stunts and action! A must-see of 2022 for everyone who likes a little thrill and action.

I must say each and every year his movies been escalating to pure quality of work. I think he is the only Actor who is a Star as well. He is one of those legendary actors who is too dedicated to his work.Coming to supporting caste, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm were great. Other supporting cast were not that impacting characters. May be this is the only thing i think needs improvement. Rest of everything were Literally great. Can't ask any more.Final act (30-40 Min.

Because it was \"Top Gun\" my wife & I splurged on luxury cushioned reclinin seats. In preparation, we rewatched the first \"Top Gun\" movie.This was MUCH MORE of the SAME - but perhaps a TIGHTER FOCUS as Maverick and his hand-picked crew were training for an actual real-time war mission fraught with dangers at every turn: fifth generation enemy fighters, scads of air defense missiles; an almost unapproachable target.The fighters taking off & landing on American carriers are ALWAYS THRILLING! As were the mock dogfight and real dogfight scenes.And yet through it all I was certain Maverick wasn't going to make it back. And I was happy, VERY HAPPY, when he did.EVERYONE LOVES & DESERVES A HAPPY MOVIE ENDING THESE DAYS!Especially when we're still being hammered by COVID, along with a new real war, and an economic downturn.I have to admit I found the scenes with Val Kilmer a bit depressing. I know why he was included in the movie - after all, he was the Iceman. But I still found it depressing.This is another movie I will add to my permanent collection. And I'll enjoy watching it over & over again.LONG LIVE MAVERICK!",

            "content": "I totally agree with some of the previous comments and reviews. This is one of rare feats where the sequel surpasses the original (The Godfather 2, Terminator 2, Aliens etc). For all those 40-50 something year old fans who grew up watching the original waiting for a decent sequel well here it is and it's SUPERB. In my view the movie has been well worth the wait as Tom Cruise has gone all out pushing himself and his team to the next level. Rather than rely on lame CGI like other movies (eg MARVEL) Mr Cruise has actual shots of fighter jets and superb aerial scenes with the actors themselves flying those jets, like no other movie.The makers have also kept very true to and paid homage to the original with the opening titles, the background music, the Danger Zone song and bringing back certain characters from the original. It also kind of has an 80s feel despite being set in modern times.The movie is surprisingly (for a commercial blockbuster) very well acted and has a good star cast. Although the story is very simple it's not as cheesy as the original and has a fantastic build up. The last 20 minutes or so are simply breathtaking. I have no idea how they shot those scenes but I can't wait for the behind the scenes/ making of documentary.In a nutshell the makers have made this movie FOR THE AUDIENCE and have kept in mind their fan base and not focused in on just cashing in on the Top Gun name / legacy. This is a worthy sequel and was worth the wait although I just wished Tom Cruise was a little younger not because he ruined anything but because i know he he is capable of so much more. Take a bow Mr Cruise. You are truly the last of the great Hollywood movie stars!I highly recommend this movie for fans of the original and fans of commercial blockbuster movies. This is a fine example of how you make an entertaining movie for everyone without compromising on quality.",

Both my grandfathers were Naval aviators in WWII, so I've always been interested in military aircraft and dogfighting. It was so cool to be able to predict what they were going to do and then see them do it because dogfighting hasn't changed much since WWI, other than the aircraft are faster and more maneuverable.What was most surprising was how good the rest of the story actually was. A mature Maverick was a take I didn't expect. The writers chose to have him evolve into an adult who still flaunts authority,but isn't the one note joke he was in his 20s. The baggage he carries and the relationships he rekindles and works to repair are head and shoulders above what we saw in the original.The only reason this isn't getting 10/10 is that the mission bears an extremely close relationship to let's just say a film from 1977 in the science fiction genre.Tribute to Tony Scott at the end made me tear up. He was a truly talented director and is sorely missed. Thanks for that Tom. I'm sure it was tough having done two films with him, both of which are some of my favorites. He was done proud.",

And of the young hot-shots, only Miles Teller as Goose's son Rooster has any distinguishable purpose... though mostly forced from either standard exposition or winsome glances at 1980's photographs in-between long, awkward, pin-drop silences when there's no bombastic aerial noise...Concealing an extremely weak plot that finally kicks into gear with a behind-enemy-lines twist, perhaps explaining the ridiculously high scores and glowing reviews: But that kind of last-minute-saves-the-picture stuff deletes any worthwhile rewatchability factor: Basically, once you've seen TOP GUN: MAVERICK you've seen it all.",

It was a blast, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The cast does an excellent job, and I was touched by the care they took with it, particularly the scene between old friends (you will know the one when you see it), which I did not expect at all.The downsides to this film are 2. First, in many ways it is beat-for-beat of the original. That's understandable, but a little bit of a disappointment. In particular, one of the headscratchers of the original is that it portrays an international incident with no consequences. So does this one. It's fun though, so I guess it's ok.The bigger downside is the timeline. Goose's son in the original is my age and would be about 40 now (38 had it released on time). He could easily be a Navy captain in his own right by that age, or at least a CAG. The explanation that Mav somehow held up his papers in the academy for 4 years both doesn't suffice and doesn't hold much water. Unfortunately, that realization takes me out of it a bit.On the other hand, the real strength of the film is Tom Cruise's portrayal of Maverick. In the original, Maverick is arguably the closest thing to a villain. Ice constantly says he's dangerous, and he proves that, and his inability to follow rules, over and over. He puts people at total unnecessary risk. In this film, he still takes massive risks, but he does so in order to better his team. He's learned how to be a team player, and more than that, a leader and teacher who really does care about the people around him. The level of maturity and responsibility (and feeling) that Cruise portrays here is the movie's greatest strength.See it in theaters. It's meant to be a spectacle, and it's a great one as long as you don't think too hard about it.",

Especially when Maverick is supposed to train Rooster and the other pilots for a mission they might not come back alive.The other pilots are also very interesting, I found much interest in them as I found in Maverick. My only concern that thankfully didn't came true was that they would be annoying characters that won't cooperate. But they have proven to be great pilots with great skills, their cooperation with Maverick was truly awesome to see near the end of the film.Of course the final battle sequence was amazing, a bit to Hollywood type of ending but for now I'll pass over it.Overall I'm really happy with this film, I'm glad my hype didn't die during the whole two-year wait and that I'm satisfied with the final product. Go watch it now and thank me later.",

The anticipation was huge, and 'Top Gun: Maverick' delivered in every way.To be clear, 'Top Gun' is my all time favourite movie. But I felt very confident that it's sequel would not disappoint. In the hands of Cruise and Joseph Kosinski it simply could not fail. It had the perfect amount of nostalgia and fan service. It followed the same blueprint as the original but still brought in new and exciting elements to the table. A near perfect sequel.The young pilots acting with the exception of Miles Teller was average. The chemistry between Cruise and Teller was very good, and you could really feel the tension of their relationship. Jennifer Connelly was excellent, and it was great to see Val Kilmer again.The star of the film... the jets. The aerial shots in this movie are like non other. It was absolutely outstanding. Breathtaking would be another apt description. The climax was one of the best movie experiences I have ever had, it just kept getting better and exceeding expectations. It's very rare that I have the desire to see a movie in the theater twice. 'Maverick' made me want to watch it again immediately.",

But now as he leads an all-star cast, I can honestly say that Top Gun: Maverick has left a reputation of honor to country, and dad to his best friend's son to take him under his wing and give him the future that he desires.Tom Cruise is no ordinary Joe; he is an American treasure. But the props of everything that this movie is about goes to only one man - the original \"Iceman,\" Val Kilmer. Between Tom and Val, they both led an all-star studded cast - Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Jon Hamm, Miles Teller - to teach that anything is possible when you put your mind to it and never think when you are flying a jet.Thanks to the talented musicians and the likes of Hans Zimmer and the ever-talented pop singer - Lady GaGa for an incredible score - this movie will go down in the books of anything is possible if you set your mind to it.",

They simply don't make movies like this anymore.It was an adrenaline pumping movie with a story that pulls the heart strings of both guys and girls, told by great acting, casting, nostalgia, and cinematic experience.The first movie made Tom Cruise the superstar that he is now. Since then, he made a lot of not so great movies and there are questions about his personal life since. This movie just redeemed him back to list of top actors on everyone's list again. It feels like they revived Maverick as the iconic character from the 80s to the 21st century, and Tom as the iconic actor at the same time.Well done and there are nothing I can criticise about this movie.I urge everyone to watch this in the cinema. It's a rare movie going experience that was lost in the last 30 years, and I think most in their 20s and 30s have never experienced so far.

Very good screenplay and cinematography, above all, I think the best part of the film was the acting. Tom Cruise really sells Maverick and he's far more likable than I remember him being from the first Top Gun.All the callbacks were great, I only really had issue with them not using one of them, other than that, very solid film in the high 8 range (8.5-9.0)/10.

Then, I found out that it was delayed because of the pandemic, that there were changes, and I thought it would hurt the quality and the script. I even read that it could go straight to streaming, and I thought that would totally ruin the movie.Finally, after a lot of delay and Tom Cruise's stubbornness, the movie was released in theaters. It happened! The movie finally came out in theaters, and then I was very pleased and surprised at how everyone reacted to this movie. The movie became a legend while it was still in theaters! It brought incredible revenue and became Tom Cruise's highest-grossing movie, and I was extremely happy for him because he deserves it, because I think that Tom Cruise is one of the best actors I've ever seen, and he is extremely dedicated to making movies!I didn't watch it right away when it came out. I watched it on Blu-ray first, and I loved it so much. I fell in love with this movie so much that I went to see it in theaters (they were still showing it) and watched it five times within a month. It had not happened to me in a long time to see the same movie so many times in the theater! What can I say about Top Gun: Maverick that hasn't already been said? An absolute masterpiece of cinema. The aerial combat scenes are the best I have ever seen in a cinema! The acting is amazing, the actors are great, and Tom Cruise is unique as always.The movie is beautifully shot, filled with unique, captivating, stunning scenes, and the plot is very well made and polished, but the icing on the cake is the appearance of Val Kilmer as Iceman. This makes the movie great, and the meeting of Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in one scene is extremely emotional, to such an extent that I would define it as one of the most emotional meetings of the last 15 years.I was extremely excited to see Val Kilmer after his battle with the insidious disease, and his presence is still as compelling and strong as ever. The film deservedly received such an incredibly high rating and brought in such revenue, I personally think that Tom Cruise should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, and for this movie he deserves not only an acting Oscar, but also for film of the year, as a producer!Tom Cruise once again surpassed himself and proved that he is one of the most dedicated actors and producers in the USA, if not the most dedicated to his audience! If more people were like him, there would be many more quality and stunning movies! If you haven't seen Top Gun: Maverick, definitely watch it, but the experience is even more stunning in a cinema, especially in Imax! Top Gun: Maverick is an enthralling, breathtaking, unique, shocking, adrenaline-pumping, emotional masterpiece! I would define it as the film of the year, and it is definitely in the top ten films of the last 15 years! Tom Cruise proved again that he is the biggest in Hollywood.",

First of all, I can say that I'm not a big fan of the Top gun in fact I watched first movie around 5 years ago but it was a good movie for me overall. I always appreciated first movie's stunts with aircrafts so my only expectation from the sequel was getting similar stunts.I have satisfied with stunts and flying sequences in the air plus Hans Zimmer works as a composer in this movie what can you expect more because Tom Cruise is the lead actor too. Maverick's struggle after losing his best friend in the first movie continues in a way he is traumatized with the incident and this emotional weigh still haunts him so you can easily feel Maverick and Goose's bond. Maverick still feels responsible for Goose's family on the other hand, Maverick has some personal struggles too but his priorities change when he was sent to Top Gun school again as an instructor. The Story is a nice straightforward a success story mixed up with some amazing images. There is one more thing I want to mention Ice character could easily has been killed off because of Val Kilmer's real life health issues but he has been included in to cast and his presence elevated the movie without his scenes my satisfaction could be decrease.There are so little things to speak about the movie negatively but if the enemy country could be specified as a real country it could be a little better but the movie still works fine the way it is. In the 1st Top Gun movie rivalry in the Top Gun school was more effective but the sequel is okay too. Some characters like Maverick's love interest in the 1st movie has been completely removed from the sequel too.Some characters like Maverick's love interest in the 1st movie has been completely removed from the sequel . Although it is understandable there could have been mentioned the love interest. We can understand that the relationship didn't work but having a small explanation could have been better\nBriefly, Top Gun Maverick is a very good movie whether you're a fan of the 1st movie or not. I suggest to everyone who likes the action genre to see it at a cinema. It's worth it but before you see it make sure to see the 1st one if you haven't seen it yet.",

And that's saying a lot for a sequel with a 36 year gap from the original. The film delivers a fresh experience while respecting the first film. It's a good thing when a movie doesn't depend on its predecessor too heavily, while simultaneously not forgetting what made it so good in the first place. There are callbacks to the original Top Gun, but it doesn't feel forced. It feels necessary. The new cast is very Top Gun-ish. Miles Teller fits perfectly in this movie. The stunts and special effects couldn't be better. The suspense and adrenaline. The soundtrack. It's just a good time. And that's the result of hard work and care for craft. Not some lazy cash grab.

It makes no sense.exaggerated timespan: enemy planes at 1 minute approaching supersonic, after several minutes of valley crawling + 2 \"impossible\" maneuvers, they are still at 30 seconds approaching.maneuvers and odds need no explanation.The movie is average, of course, but I give a 2 in an attempt to counterbalance the exaggerated acclaim from the old pops' feeling young again.",

Nailed it.A good story, which includes obviously some hark-backs to the original, with Goose's story and great, moving cameo from Kilmer as Iceman, but certainly doesn't just play on that, and stands up in its own right. Good support cast too, especially Teller, but of course the heart is Cruise and still very much carries it off even 30 years later. But (again obviously) what takes this into the stratosphere is the many incredible flying scenes, which are just unbelievable, heart in mouth stuff.A great film which definitely surpasses the original. A credit to all involved and most definitely deserves it's success, critical and financial. Cruise is a force of nature in the Movie world, on screen and off.",

            "content": "So my opinion on the first Top Gun movie is that it's not the greatest thing ever, but also not the worst. It's entertaining and fun, but really has no meat to the bone or anything. For Top Gun Maverick I have two words to describe this movie: EMOTION & HEART, two things that the first film lacked, but they are utilized to their fullest potential in the sequel. I already have massive respect for Tom Cruise as an actor, but with this movie, my respect for him has gone past 1000 because this is clearly one of his greatest works. Not only does he perform all these flying stunts for real, but this is definitely one of his most emotional performances of his career. Miles Teller is also great in the film playing Goose's son Rooster and you feel more the impact of Goose's death in this film than you actually do in the first movie and because of that you really feel the emotion and the dynamic between Maverick and Rooster. I also love the choice to have Jennifer Connelly play a past lover in this movie. You feel the chemistry and you sense the history between her and Maverick which is a romance storyline I can get on board with unlike Charlie and Maverick in the first which felt forced and unnatural. We are also introduced to new characters played by Glenn Powell, Monica Barbaro, Jay Ellis and many more and they managed to give these new characters enough personality to them to feel a sense of camaraderie. Every character instantly felt like family and they made us care in just a matter of 2 hours which is very impressive. The collaboration score Harold Faltermeyer, Lorne Balfe, Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga is absolutely astounding. They just take the original Top Gun theme and amp it up to make it sound fresh and modern.Top Gun Maverick is a movie I did not expect to be good. I remember seeing the trailers thinking to myself why did we need a sequel to this and how bad this looks, but boy oh boy did it prove me so wrong! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life and is my favourite movie of the year so far and I almost feel like no other movie will be able to beat it, yep beating The Batman surprisingly. I even almost teared at this amazing line at the end \"Thank you for saying my life\" \"That's what my dad would've done\" Top Gun Maverick is an absolute masterpiece in cinema!",

I just can't believe the producers and the directors could be this deliberately intolerant of some people's feewings.How can they even make money off this thing is the biggest question, when it is just 2 hours of nonstop action, beautiful scenery, and nostalgic '80s music? Who wants that? Who goes to the movie to be entertained? That's just ridiculous and wrong. How can a movie that doesn't cater to the demands of the few but loud ever make so much money?

He is forced to confront past traumas and make decisions bigger than himself. All the while proving to everyone yet again that \"it's not the plane, it's the pilot.\"\"Top Gun: Maverick\" did something I have never seen. Kosinski and the entire cast took an iconic 1980's film and molded it into an equally iconic film for the next generation to enjoy. So many have tried: Rambo, Terminator, Ghostbusters, Jurassic Park, and even Star Wars (just to name a few) but they have each failed miserably and their only legacy is mediocrity. Everyone of these films has featured their same cast yet outdated, their same plot yet watered down, and their same idea yet clearly forced into a film that never should of been produced.However, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" did not fail. It exceeded; it entertained. It successfully brought the original \"Top Gun\" into the 21st century. It has you pumping your fists and cheering for the characters because you grow to love them so dang much. It honors the original film while also making a name for itself. It features original characters while also bringing relevant, fresh personalities onto the scene. It has an original, captivating plot that leaves the audience crying, laughing, and applauding. It is thrill-seeking, fast, epic, and intense, but also underneath, it is soft, sentimental, tear-jerking, and authentic.Watch it! Soak in the high flying jets, the leather jackets, and the rad sunglasses. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is what cinema is all about.",

It delivers on the action and the third act of Maverick made me feel tense at times. Speaking of the action, it's amazing what you can still do with practical effects, as most of the aviation scenes were just that. Without spoiling, there is one character that is brought back from the original film and I thought it was cool how they used them. For cons, there are some moments that can come across as cheesy and the love interest aspect I felt could've been stronger and more integral. You can tell a lot of heart was put into the production for this film and I think it will be worth the wait for those who have been long time fans of the original. If you want a legitimately fun movie experience, I can't think of anything better at the moment than Top Gun: Maverick. Verdict: 8/10.",

I love how the chemistry existed between Maverick and Penny.

He's recklessness if that is really recklessness is just so good. A living legend.The soundtrack of this film fits so well also!! The way the songs were played each scene fits just right moreover the lyrics! No wonder the popularity and expectations of this film is so high. And yes, here we are very satisfied with the film.If ever there is a slight cons here, not sure if this is really a cons or i just really dont know how it works tho. One thing i notice is that the way they executed well the miracles and how they pass the coffin corner which they really have difficulty in the training is just quite smooth when it comes to the actual execution. Another is that there are almost no casualty, no deaths although the chances are always there especially when they are being chased by missiles and other jets.

We will be ushered into an age whereby movies are watched on small screens and the age-old cinematic tradition of watching a film on the big screen with a crowd is soon going to be nothing more than a hazy memory to look back on.Tom Cruise has another idea.36 years after the original, which was nothing more than a shot of corny 80s adrenaline, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell returns to headline a brilliant action film that beats it predecessor ten times over. Nope, that is not an exaggeration.Like many of the best sequels of all time (think, T2: Judgment Day and The Empire Strikes Back) its brilliance can be measured by how much it improves the first film or the films that came before it. Not only is Top Gun: Maverick the best action movie of the decade so far, it also elevates the original into something worth revisiting and revaluating.And from Miles Teller (Whiplash) to Jennifer Connelly (Requiem for a Dream), Tom Cruise is not the only cast member who gives it their all.

Top Gun: Maverick is the kind of movie you watch at the theatres!Set around 30 years after the events of the original, Pete Mitchell aka Maverick is now a test pilot but his program is scrapped due to lack of funding. Having rejected promotions to continue flying, he gets called back to Top Gun as a trainer. He is tasked to train a group of Top Gun graduates to take down a uranium enrichment facility.The effort gone into making this film is astounding! Three months of training, which included aerial aviation and with cameras fit inside the cockpit, the actors having to direct themselves. The result is an experience worth viewing on the biggest screen possible (even if you haven't watched the original).Tom Cruise is the most prolific action hero we have had in the past decade. Maverick had to be special given Cruise's obsession with performing realistic death defying stunts. The casting is perfect with Cruise & Val Kilmer reprising their roles.

            "content": "Firstly - I've never seen the first top gun.I walked into this just to pass some time and I did not expect what I saw. Holy crap. What a film.Movies and entertainment nowadays often have too many fillers, hype, cheap thrills, gimmicks and are often catered to meet the demands of short attention spans. It's tougher than ever to hold attention and grab people's hearts and keep them engaged without constantly having something to keep people's attention by any means necessary. This often means lack of depth, presence, quality storytelling and the feeling of an \"old school epic\".This is the type of movie that gives a nod to what used to be but no longer is. An epic.Quality music, great pacing, incredible aerial shots without any CGI or green screen. I mean, Tom Cruise even demanded that all the actors go through G force training so no shots are shot with CGI or greenscreen and what we have is a visual masterpiece, with an epic tale that grips you and takes your heart and holds it gently as it carries it all through the end of this incredible movie at Mach 10.I walked out feeling great, so calm in my body because I was at the edge of my seat without all the flash, hype, noise and all the other distraction that jacks up the nervous system. Instead, all I felt was anticipation, excitement, inspiration and a feel good feeling inside me that I carried with me for the next 2 days.I have watched Top Gun Maverick twice. I'm going to watch the first one at home, then I'm going back to the cinema to watch it a third time.This has found a home in my top 10 movies of all time where it will stay forever.Incredible movie, incredible experience, so yourself a favour and watch it asap on the big screen.Then go watch it again.",

            "content": "For fans clamoring for a modern & significantly better sequel to Top Gun, lo and behold, Maverick is the answer to our prayers. With one for the books kind of action sequences, this film completely blew away the original, a rare feat for reprised titles.Before we rave about the action however, worth to highlight that the casting done for Maverick was on point. The new faces were solid in their roles particularly Miles Teller, whose resemblance to Anthony Edwards was uncanny. Glen Powell & John Hamm as anti heroes, were perfect complements to Tom & Miles as the scenes they share were electric. To top it off, seeing Val Kilmer as Iceman sent shivers down my spine as it was surreal.As for the action, absolutely EPIC! Great work by Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise for producing an authentic \"aerial warfare\" experience that rivals that of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Amazing that they weren't conservative with these scenes either, as these tension-filled & intense sequences were abundant, resulting to an edge of your seat experience that the original plainly lacked.My only knack in Maverick is the unavoidable cheese-fest. It does add substance to the storyline and I'm glad it was dialed down compared to the original, but yes, the drama is a tad predictable and a buzzkill at certain points. Nevertheless, the fun and excitement are impossible to be spoiled!Overall, Maverick has definitely cemented its place as one of the best action films of 2022. The hype and build up to its release was well worth it as it is really a well executed film, brimming with energy, authenticity and well intentioned bravado. Sorry for doubting you Tom\nCruise!",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick (2022)Now that's how you make a sequel! Top Gun Maverick delivers spectacular action, retains the old bravado themes of 80s and pays a tribute to Tom Cruise's incredible dedication and passion as an actor. Despite getting old, Maverick never became affected by some post-modernistic disease that writers like to use for iconic characters. Instead, he remained a kickass pilot, an inspirational individual and most importantly a hero who isn't willing to take a back seat when facing a challenge.In this film, Maverick is recalled back to Top Gun to train the academy's best gradutes for a deadly mission. Being the only pilot with actual combat experience, he puts on his personal style of training that will push the students to the brink and mold them into true soldiers. While Tom's passion is the driving force of this film, what actually keeps it moving is the presence of a goal, unlike its predecessor. It is an absolutely nonsensical goal suitable for a James Bond or a Star Wars movie but nonetheless, it does the job of building up the narrative and delivering on the climax.Admittedly, the film does start in a slow way with lots of talking, but Tom's charisma keeps it afloat until the third act, which delivered the definition of a climax. Not only did I catch myself holding my breath, but I also had sweaty palms from the on-screen intensity. Because of the practical elements, the exhilarating action felt tangible and the realism on the actors' faces made me believe that they were actually inside the cockpit. The audio is second to none and i definitely regret not watching it in IMAX.Tom's passion and care for the film was visible in every gesture, emotion and action. The supporting cast was well selected and actually fit their roles without any nonsense, which is a rarity in modern cinema. It felt good to watch a non CGI blockbuster with heroic themes delivered by one of Hollywood's last stars. A huge upgrade on the original that deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",

DON'T think up there!And, you don't have to be a fan of the first movie to enjoy this one!

If I had any sort of \"complaint\" it's that as someone who doesn't have any particular nostalgia for the original film, some of this stuff probably didn't hit me as hard as it does for others.However the main draw of the film is the action in the air, and here it certainly doesn't disappoint either.

I'd say the answer is a resounding yes.Tom Cruise returns as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and assumes the role of flying instructor at his former academy, TOPGUN, where he has to train the next generation of jet pilot recruits for an impossible mission. Can Maverick train the new recruits to complete the mission successfully and make it safely back home? That remains to be seen.As a sequel to \"Top Gun\", \"Top Gun: Maverick\" packs an emotional punch along with plenty of tense moments to keep the audience on the edge of their seats where the flying sequences and sound effects alone make the film worth seeing in theaters. The action is great but there are also heartfelt moments involving Maverick's relationship to characters and events from the first movie, including the tragic loss of his wingman Goose. Although not many cast members from the original \"Top Gun\" reprise their roles in the sequel, Val Kilmer returns in a supporting role as Iceman and even though his cameo in the sequel is relatively minor, you can still feel Iceman and Maverick's strong bond from the original movie which further adds to the sequel's emotional core.Overall, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a fantastic sequel that retains the coolness factor of the original as well as delivering an emotional impact which makes it a sequel well worth the long wait.",

            "content": "What else is there to say about this movie that a trailer wouldn't tell you? Is it a soft reboot of the 80's cheese and US NAVY commercial that is the original Top Gun? Yes. Does it wallow around in its own nostalgia? A little. Does this movie kick more ass then any other summer box office Goliath this year? Absolutely.Between covid stalling the release and a gimmick centered around real life cockpit shots of the beautiful insane man Tom Cruise and friends, as they pull--honest to god--real G's, thousands of feet in the air... it seemed like \"Top Gun: Maverick\" was going to a be a shallow cash grab of a homoerotic fighter jet classic. This movie is a cash grab, but every second of the jet engines screaming across the screen and the camera mounted inside and out of these angels of death, more then forgive the nature of the films inception.Cruise--the endless charisma magnet--does nothing but ooze personality in every scene hes in. Usually standing next to stock cardboard pilots on his air force suicide mission crew. Miles Teller as Goose's son (hilariously dubbed Rooster) does what he can with the role, and Jennifer Connelly puts in a subtle performance as a jaded bar tender. But the second Cruise gets in the cockpit, the film is his.Sounds are explosive, delivering thrilling shock and awe. Music is fine with requisite callbacks. Editing is fast paced, keeping you involved, while begrudgingly pumping the brakes for softer character moments not taking place in an F-18. And the effects flipping between real life fighters and the in-cockpit performances are seamless.The film is truly a shinning gem amongst superhero fatigue and animated musicals when it comes to mainstream box office fair. Its story is forgettable but its moments are one of a kind. But all roads come back to Cruise.He is an enigma. A film making supernova. An utter and complete maniac. What he does to draw your eyes to a movie screen is nothing short of magic. He is the life of the party. He is hitting red on roulette every turn causing the table to erupt. He is jumping between buildings, ACTUALLY flying planes, throwing his body out of cars.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" solidifies Tom Cruise isn't done putting an excited smile on your face every time he steps in front of the camera.",

            "content": "Hey, Streamers, let's fly off into the Danger Zone. Yes, it's Top Gun: Maverick time. The sequel you have been waiting almost 40 years for, which was supposed to come out 2 years ago, is finally here. Now, I have never seen the original film, but I was keen to see what all the hype around this sequel was about. Tom Cruise has made good choices over the years and he's always going full tilt in these action roles, so I didn't expect for this to disappoint. Here's how it goes.Even though Top Gun: Maverick is a present-day sequel to the original Top Gun (1986), the movie really leans into that old-fashioned, 1980's action film vibe. Also, there is a big spoiler from the original film that is central to the story of this sequel - Maverick's wingman, Goose, died. Here, Goose's son, Rooster (Miles Teller), is one of the elite Navy aviators, who Maverick (Tom Cruise) is tasked with training for what's considered an important but impossible mission. There is tension between Maverick and Rooster because of their fraught history. There is tension between Maverick and his superiors because he is notorious for going rogue. Nevertheless, Maverick is the best and the mission requires the best. High-flying hijnks ensue.Top Gun: Maverick is the kind of movie that begs to be seen on a big screen. In my opinion, the story is not really great or innovative, so the actions sequences, stunts and camera work have to justify the price of admission. Luckily, they very much do. The aerial shots and all of the fighter jets flying have to be seen on a big screen to truly be appreciated. The rumble of the jets and the perceived danger add to the tension that builds up through the movie and explodes in the final sequences. While there is an attempt to build an emotional core to the film by focusing on Maverick and Rooster's relationship and also a slight love interest on the side, those relationships barely register and seem almost superfluous. Honestly, they could've cut the love story and the film would have been the same but 10-15 minutes shorter - that would have given them the ability to cultivate the Maverick and Rooster relationship, which would have been more impactful.Some of this movie is so retro as to be kind of corny. Glen Powell plays Hangman. He's one of the cockiest aviators in the Top Gun program. Powell plays it like the quintessential 1980's movie villain, which was groan-inducing at times, but some may love it. Tom Cruise is at his Tom-Cruise-iest, which isn't a bad thing. Movies need stars and Tom Cruise is still a movie star. He still has the charm to pull off Maverick's character. As the movie leans into the nostalgia, Tom Cruise makes it worthy of being on a big screen. This movie desperately needs that.Nevertheless, what was presented was certainly entertaining. There will be times when the flying will have you on the edge of your seat. That's why a movie like this is made. In that way, it is quite successful.Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick is tailor-made to be seen in a movie theater. The feats of stunts and action are worthy of the big screen. There are times when you may be on the edge of your seat. Although the story is a bit lacking, the rest of the movie makes up for it and the 2-hour runtime flies by in a *wink*. Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this spectacle on a big screen.",

It's fun, it's gripping, it's awesome. Practical effects return to show how much better they can be than soulless CGI. Legacy characters are respected and developed rather than being torn down. The audience is entertained rather than preached to or lectured.Movies like this have become an endangered species, and until bankruptcy starves out the media industry's current ideological infection, they are not likely to come along often. So, if you haven't already, treat yourself to this masterpiece, spend a couple of hours being reminded of what good storytelling can bring to the table, and enjoy that rarest of treats: a sequel that actually builds on and surpasses what made you love the original.",

I can't compare it to anything really. They keep you on the edge of your seat and are breathtaking. The movie is funny. The humor is almost indirect, but it works so well. The new characters are really well done. They do a really nice job of honoring the first film. This is probably the first movie I have seen of this new wave of movies to arrive years after their predecessor, to actually serve the older main character well. Maverick is a badass, and it's obvious even as an older dude. A lot of times these movies have the older familiar face there just to introduce new characters (Star Wars is probably the worst offender off the top of my head), this is not the case with Top Gun: Maverick and I love it so much for that.The bottom line is: if you are on the fence about seeing this movie in the theater, you need to get there and watch it.

If you manage to watch the bonus features, you'll really appreciate the lengths not just Tom Cruise went to, to ensure these shots were truly real, but many of the other actors who participated as well. There are few actors who would go to such lengths for the sake of a movie's integrity and viewers experience, and this movie exemplifies his devotion to the craft.All of that being said, I do feel like the hype around this movie is more indicative of Hollywood and the woke culture lately. People have endured an intense malaise for over a decade, with a testosterone crushing level of man shaming and non-stop depressing stories that leave people walking away from the theatre with lower and lower expectations.I did think the picture overall was great and embodied alot of the characteristics we used to know and love in older classic films. There was however alot of stereotypical scriptwriting and many scenes were very predictable. I found myself several times finishing the lines before they were spoken.Although I didn't think it was as worthy of the grandstanding others seem to be giving it, we still have to recognize that this is a sequel, and when it comes to sequels, I can count on one hand the number of times Hollywood managed to make the second as good as the first.

            "content": "In an age filled with movies relying overly on computer generated imagery, it is refreshing to see a film that primarily utilizes practical effects to achieve even the most difficult of sequences, and the approach has clearly paid off. With Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise and Joseph Kasinski delivers a thoroughly engaging, riveting and emotionally impactful sequel to a classic blockbuster, while simultaneously managing to improve upon the original in every possible way.There is perhaps no other actor other than Tom Cruise who has managed to consistently maintain the same level of global stardom and public relevance for over four decades. Nearly 35 years later, Cruise returns to his iconic role of Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the role that solidified his global stardom. Cruise once again showcases his acting talents and his unparalleled dedication to the craft as he along with other cast members, perform complex and difficult flight/aerial combat sequences that is all done practically by the actors themselves, with little to no usage of CGI. The rigorous flight training undergone by Cruise and the other cast members totally paid off, as all the aerial sequences, particularly the entire third act, forms the strongest aspect of the film. The dogfight sequences are quite possibly the best ever put to film and are constantly engaging and thrilling and keeps you at the edge of your seats throughout, due to realistic and accurate portrayal of them.Another strong aspect of the movie was its emotional weight. The film has numerous callbacks and homages to the original film that manages to tug at your heartstrings particularly for long-time fans of the original film, as they manage to evoke a sense of nostalgia in them. However none of these come across as cheap nostalgia-bait or fan service, which has become common in many new Hollywood blockbusters. Instead, these are perfectly incorporated with the story and are even necessary for the development of Maverick's character. The impact of Goose's death in the first film is present throughout this film and the effect the event had on Maverick was perfectly portrayed. Maverick trying to be a surrogate father to Goose's son, played by Miles Teller and his subsequent relationship with him, forms the emotional center and the true heart of the movie. Val Kilmer's return as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky was a truly delightful inclusion and resulted in one of the most emotionally powerful moments in the film.The cinematography by Claudio Miranda was another noteworthy aspect as the film is filled with gorgeous visuals. The sequences are made even more powerful by the exceptional music composed by Harold Faltermeyer and Hans Zimmer. May it be a heart to heart exchange between two characters or an intense dogfight sequence, the music always manages to perfectly fit and elevate the impact of the sequences.With exceptionally crafted aerial combat sequences, beautiful cinematography, emotional weight, nostalgic callbacks and a spectacular central performance by Tom Cruise, Top Gun: Maverick succeeds at being one of the best legacy sequels ever made along with the likes of Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049, while simultaneously paying respect to the original film and further solidifying Cruise's unrivalled starpower.",

The action part. The training is painfully uninteresting and cheesy. The smiling is fine because it's expected and creates a positive atmosphere for the viewer. It also makes the viewer more attached to the character when that character is in trouble later in the movie.The actual mission is the last third and I have the most to say about that. I should point out that it probably was not a third in terms of the actual portion of the movie that it covered. More accurately, it's probably about a fifth of the movie or less. This was the best part of the movie, but even this was not great or even that good. As mentioned, it's a fairly smaller part of the movie. But beyond that, the scenes are completely predictable. Now, just because something is predictable does not necessarily make it bad. The feeling here is that this action-part of the movie feels like watching the trailer over and over for 20-30 minutes. There is nothing that unique about the entire scene. The only positive aspect of it is that it's not boring.One last note, the storyline, it almost doesn't exist. The storyline is that there's a mission that has to be completed. That's it. In summation, the movie leaves a lot to be desired.",

While the original was great, and VERY 80's, it lacked much of a plot beyond a machismo machine layered around some nice flybys.The sequel does a great job of keeping the nostalgia to a minimum and to the beginning of the film to establish the players and bring a new audience up to speed. Instead of pushing full steam with a retread of the \"hey bros, let's go fly some planes to cool music\", you get a deeper character development set with diverse characters, and an actual target mission that serves as payoff for all the hard work of the pilots and their backgrounds.The action was TOP NOTCH, with plenty of gripping and exciting thrills. I love fighter pilot movies (which there are sadly few modern ones), Several times I found myself tense watching close calls. It has so much fun around every corner without relying too hard on the prior movie. Prod and happy to see Val Kilmer come back and get involved as well.Lots of fun and worth many rewatches.",

But those are about the only factual aspects of this movie. The basic underlying premise of the story was actually fairly good, It was even grounded in actual reality, though it did seem to intermix real world threats from two very different countries. But the detail and execution of the story were mostly ridiculous, and at times became completely absurd. Even most of the characters were over the top ridiculous. On the bright side, the action sequences and cinematography were absolutely spectacular, which is really what saved the movie from being a complete flop in my eyes. If you're one of those folks naive enough to believe Iron Eagle had any semblance to reality whatsoever, you'll love this movie. If action sequences are everything to you, to the exclusion of mostly everything else, you'll love this movie. But if you, like me, are sick of having Hollywood pushing completely ridiculous plots and characters, you'll be disappointed (again).",

            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the sequel to \"Top Gun\" that I always wanted, but until now, never had - it's truly perfect. I can't believe they were able to pull this off; not only did they make a film that lives up to the original, but I would also argue that there are many elements that surpass the first film. I love the original movie from 1986, but this in my opinion is a much stronger film! It's thrilling, intense, and surprisingly emotional, the film has a lot of heart. The opening scene alone, which parallels the original's opening in such an awesome way, was pretty much a religious experience for me, and I'm sure it would be for any fans of the original. Right off the bat I had a huge smile on my face, and that smile continued throughout the entire movie! It's exactly what I wanted it to be, and yet so much more. A truly epic, supersonic, exhilarating blockbuster!One of the things I really loved here was the story! It was the perfect continuation of the first film, and I loved how it truly dealt with the emotional fallout of events from that film. It felt like this was truly bringing Maverick's story to an end, especially in the guilt he has for the death of Goose. I love how Goose was used in this film, and how that internal conflict inside of Maverick led to such an interesting dynamic between himself and Goose's son, Rooster, who is now one of Maverick's students. Without saying too much, I loved how their relationship evolved throughout the film, how it both left them confronting their feelings about the loss of Goose and how this inevitably brought them together. I wasn't as much into the relationship between Penny and Maverick, as this felt like it just sort of happened to check a box, but it was entertaining nonetheless. The film also deviated a lot more than I thought it would from the original story, I liked that it really showed us something new instead of just rehashing the original. Don't get me wrong, it has some great nostalgic moments, but these are done sparingly and just enough to get a reaction out of the audience without detracting from the current story. In some cases, the use of a nostalgic element actually seemed to enhance emotional moments for the characters, and I loved that. I was also pretty excited to see there was an actual mission the story was building up to this time, and let me just say the 3rd act does not disappoint! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I loved how intense it was and how much it kept me on the edge of my seat, yet showed me everything I really wanted to see in this movie! (Also is it just me or was there a moment that felt like a Top Gun version of a Star Wars scene?)And oh my god... the aerial sequences here are unbelievable! I've never seen anything quite like it, and I don't think we ever will again. Not only is the sheer talent of the pilots of the jets on display here, but I'm amazed that the filmmakers were able to get the footage they did. Shots where the cameras are mounted to the plane, or even inside the cockpit are just jaw dropping and really enhance the intensity of scenes. This truly is a spectacular visual experience (it looks stunning in IMAX) and I'm so happy they committed to doing everything for real. Trust me, you can tell the actors are in the jets as you see their genuine reactions and the ways their faces react to the Gs. Tom Cruise somehow handles it like a pro, he's truly a madman but I love his commitment to the theatrical experience. It's like Tom Cruise just became Maverick in this movie, he looks like he's having a blast in all the dogfights and aerial sequences. He also looks like he hasn't aged a day, and fits right in with his younger co-stars in the beach football scene. I also loved the emotion he displayed in this, it's what truly makes me think this is one of his career best performances! Miles Teller was also perfectly cast as Goose's son, he really looks the part, but also played off of Tom Cruise so well (just like his on-screen dad) and really sold the emotions his character is feeling. And while on the topic of actors, Val Kilmer has one stunning scene as Iceman that truly was so perfect and heartfelt that I was nearly in tears, I loved that scene more than anything.Tony Scott would be proud of this film. I thought Joseph Kosinski did a spectacular job taking over as director for this sequel, and really crafted such a great film. It's a little more mature and emotional than the first, which I loved, but also way more intense and visceral. It's such a unique cinematic experience, one that deserves the biggest screen with the loudest sound! I loved the visuals, especially in the jaw dropping aerial sequences, and the sound design packed a punch, on top of using some of the great music from the first one! \"Danger Zone\" is here, and it's as good as ever! This movie was insanely good, it's everything I wanted it to be and more! I adore the first film, but this managed to surpass it in every way. It's wildly entertaining, exhilarating and heartfelt! I truly loved it and highly recommend seeing this, it's a must see if only for the stunning cinematography and once in a lifetime visuals on display. It exceeded all my expectations, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" really is a blast; it took my breath away! It's one of those rare flicks that reminds you how incredible a movie-going experience can be!*If you don't like the original (but how could you not, it's amazing), this is much better.**If you love the original... this is still much, much better!",

Any rating over seven is mere nostalgia and new toy excitement of. Red Tails, who presented a better adventure of superior realism and quality, got a 5.9. The 1986 predecessor was even more interesting than this movie is. Even so, it was a hit because it shows detail of new air combat technology never seen before, and that was it. Once again, they forgot that the characters are professionals, unique people with unparalleled skills, and present them behaving like pedantic children. At that level of execution, there is an atmosphere of respect and discipline that does not occur in civil society, possibly why writers have not been able to recreate it.",

Unfortunately even more dismaying is that Kelly McGillis could not reprise her romantic lead role and a new paramour played by Jennifer Connelly arrives on the scene to take her place. The characterizations of most of the new Top Gun elite are typically one-dimensional with the same dynamics that underlay the original Top Gun. Mostly predictable even to the ending climactic scene, the movie's script seems written without much depth. There is an unconvincing nuclear menace that needs to be taken out by the Top Gun crew unlike the more compelling originating enemy incident found in the action thriller Hunter Killer (2018). After 36 years one would expect some maturing evolution of characters and plots in a way that the more intriguing and serious rendition that came about with Daniel Craig's James Bond's character and a more edgy drama and plot design over the more traditional, staid, mainstream popularization that Pierce Brosnan or even Roger Moore brought to the earlier Bond movies. The training scenes were chaotic and hard to follow instead of just taking the opportunity to use two and a half minutes of real virtual experience in piloting an F-18. Unfortunately, the movie's complication of having to use F-18 over F-35 really made the movie disconcerting in terms of realism and only served to tie this sequel to an aging, unevolved movie version of the original. While entertaining and satisfying, the sequel really did not soar any higher than the first which after 36 years one would have hoped to have been able to achieve its true wings.",

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the cinematic experience.Many words have run through my head having just finished watching \"Maverick\". Words such as bravery, heroism, cockiness, trust, respect, love, commitment, and more. These words describe the essence of the film.In my opinion, \"Maverick\" is an incredible sequel that does the original film justice. While trusts in the past to tell its story, it manages to fly on its own two wings. The Maverick you came to know in the first film portrayed on a magnified level that brings more emotion to the game. I enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance in this film along with the newbies that make an appearance. The chemistry was very well done amongst the cast. I didn't find a single character/actor to not fit in. I was impressed.The story was only a little iffy for me especially near the end. I won't name the movie that the scenes reminded me off in fear of spoiling, but certain things should have ended sooner rather than later and it would've worked out well enough. However, with what was presented, I couldn't really complain as the tension had my heart racing throughout and left me anticipating what would happen next. What I thought would happen, I was wrong.Cinematography and score should have you fired up and bringing you back to the \"old days\". They were beautiful and attention grabbing and the level of detail and dedication was clearly displayed.Overall, a fantastic sequel that does the original film justice. 100% if you can make it to an IMAX theatre it's worth it, and if not IMAX, it's still definitely worth the trip to the theatre.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

Cruise has a habit of picking cinematic vehicles that preserve his legacy as one of Hollywood's highest-grossing actors, and this film continues in that trend, pulling off a rarely-seen feat where Top Gun: Maverick manages to be a sequel that lives up to the hype of the original. The action scenes were well-choreographed, and despite being a big-budget production, the story actually feels very contained in the best sense of the word. It continues in the spirit of Top Gun's 80's action while not coming off as cheesy. Miles Teller was also the perfect casting choice. All-in-all, an excellent popcorn movie that did its job and did it well.",

Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga did a great job mastering the music. It really brings all the feels and mind-blowing action packed film with a flow state pace for a sequel. The casting was brillant despite all the hard training they went through. All the actors played their roles perfectly. Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly were superb in their roles and it's really nice to see them together on screen. From start to finish, the film was really well written considering the first Top Gun(1986), and shot with real Air Force/Navy planes(Non CGI) F-18. The movie keeps you tight to your seat as you want to know what's going to happen next. I guess this might be the best movie of 2022 I've ever watched in cinema. It pushes you off the limits and urges you to step outside of your comfort zone. You learn a lot from the movie and it catches my breath away. An adrenaline-fueled ride of a movie. Highly recommend to watch in cinema. Don't think, just do.",

            "content": "In an age of Hollywood defined by big budget franchises, live action remakes and adaptations, it's easy to be critical of much of what has been put out. Originality is often shied away from because of the fact that it doesn't bring in the cash, so all that's left are massive franchises like the MCU and Harry Potter, or nostalgia heavy but ultimately flat reboots and sequels such as Jurassic World and Ghostbusters Afterlife. So where does another seemingly nostalgia baiting sequel such as Top Gun: Maverick fit in all this? For me, Maverick joins Spider-man: No Way Home as an example of how to make the perfect sequel in this day and age: Maverick never once feels like it's overly relying on Top Gun to make it worth the viewers time. This film employs flashbacks and subtle alludes to the first film with nuance and precision, so as to not flood the viewer with memories and distract from it's story. Speaking of which, the story more than stands on its own as a strong, feel-good action packed movie, with strong ensemble acting from all fronts, clever dialogue (mostly), electric flight sequences, and a brilliant performance from Tom Cruise. Maverick is a joyride of a film that manages pushes your sensory limits without completely overloading you, especially if you watch it in the theatre (which I strongly recommend). A pleasant surprise was Miles Teller, who sort of dropped off my radar after his star turn in Whiplash. He's cocky, cool, rash, and emotional, reminding me exactly of Tom Cruise in the first film. The writing is, at some points, formulaic but what's interesting is now matter how cliche it can feel, the viewer is reminded why the cliches became so widely used in the first place. From a technical standpoint, Maverick is an out and out masterpiece. The sound design is flawless, the camerawork is electrifying, and the editing is smoother than Tom Cruise's iconic slide in Risky Business. If any film should sweep the technical Oscars this year, I can confidently say it should be Maverick.Maverick feels like a glimpse of what a modern classic can be, and it's a shame that a film like this is so rare these days. Maverick is a near-perfect combination of brain and heart, and it's technical wizardry is icing on the cake. Is this suddenly the best movie of all time? No, not by a long shot. Is this even the best movie of the 2020's so far? Even that is debatable. But it's a giant leap in the right direction, and if this is an indication of what Hollywood has to offer, than I'm in for the ride. I strongly recommend seeing Top Gun: Maverick, even if you haven't seen the first movie because it's still as enjoyable and in every respect a better movie. My verdict is a 9 out of 10, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

It is a Tom Cruise production made in pure earnest of entertaining the audience and pushing the limits, which it does with glorious madness.Christopher Nolan has made the modern blockbuster complex and cerebral. Superhero movies have become theme park rides and special effects extravaganzas. Top Gun: Maverick achieves a rare beauty in simplicity. Tom Cruise, in the most sincere DIY mentality taken to the extreme, climbs in a fighter jet, replacing CGI with suicidal insanity.The aerial sequences are breathtakingly intense. Whether you have the technical eye to spot CGI or not, you feel the authenticity in the dogfighting sequences 100%. Watching a jet fighter zip by in between two jet fighters and breaking them apart with a sonic boom is anxiety-inducing. The way the actors are trembling, jolting, and straining against the G force in the cockpit gives full immersion into the action. I suggest seeing it in the biggest format available.The sequel story goes deeper and deconstructs Maverick, breaking down who the man is beneath the action hero icon, similar to Bad Boys 3. It draws from the first Top Gun and the nostalgia is meticulously handled; I liked the specific things they reference from the first Top Gun and appreciated what they left out. How the film handles Iceman, Val Kilmer's character, was very touching.The romantic subplot with Jennifer Connelly is simple formula but it works. Every male viewer imagines themselves as Maverick. All of a sudden the film informs you not only have you dated Jennifer Connelly, but left her hanging many times and now there's a chance to restart things again. You're not out of the movie just because there's no jets flying.I am dreading the release of Avatar: The Way of Water as its success may mean the world has to wear 3D glasses for another 5 years. For the sanctity of cinema, I am genuinely hoping the blue cat people to bomb.If blockbusters are going to have a trend, I would much rather modern blockbusters go in the direction of Top Gun: Maverick. The truth is... who can pull this off besides Tom Cruise?What movie star wants to risk their life filming inside a fighter jet, has the clout and resources to produce and coordinate this craziness, and the pull to cast other young actors to go through G-force and ejector seat training with him? This is ludicrous.When the credits rolled, an applause break erupted from my theater. That left me in shock. The last time I witnessed an applause break was a CGI Yoda fighting with a lightsaber in Attack of the Clones.I proceeded to the exit smiling and walking with wobbly legs. Man, I loved every minute.",

            "content": "If you are like me, then the chances of seeing Top gun in Theaters wasn't just possible. Nevertheless i can proudly say, i was able to watch the sequel to the classic and am i glad they made it so memorableTop Gun Maverick: Pete Mitchell returns as a Aviator he has been tasked with a rather impossible mission and train elite graduates across the country to successfully execute it.With legacy and Tom Cruise as the criterion, the movie already had a huge cult following irrespective of how it turns out. Managing and exceeding expectations was already a huge ask. But this movie does it better, it exceeds the expectations by a huge margin and brings out many surprises along the way. Tom Cruise is a Legend, i think he can do no wrong, may it be the stunts, his involvement in the characters, charisma, whatever you give him he aces it and the director realized this factor and used it to the movies' advantage. Everything in the movie is centered around Maverick and its surely a one-man show coupled with few brilliant performances for other actors who merely seemed like support characters. Maverick steals the show and carries the movie throughout no flaws what-so-ever.The premise is rather simple and easy to understand and if you've seen Top Gun recently (just before the movie like me) you will follow the love letters to the older version and relish it. An enemy base which needs to be destroyed because of the illegal activities involving nuclear reactors and if left alone might pose serious threat to global arena. Sounds more like a Mission Impossible montage, but since its a movie about flights, the trick is to get down via a narrow entry point, destroy target, exit with huge incline and survive to make it home. Maverick was called in to train the best of the best because why not? He is the Maverick. Strapped for time, and a impending doom, Maverick does what he does best. Showboating his skills and inspiring the fleet of aviators.The premise and story until then is more than sufficient to hit a home run, however the director had few moments, like training Goose's son, reconnecting with his first love, the move on from Goose's death, the bond of Ice-Maverick. All of these made such beautiful connections that you would want to see how it all turns out. This was a very difficult ordeal as it is and with so many backstories, the director gave a very clear and proper screen time to justify their involvement in the movie, truly inspirational directorial brilliance.Other thing you will relish in this movie are the flight scenes. It is obvious that there will be many; but in every scene you feel that the maneuvers, dog fights are actually happening. It was shot so well and not just the actors did a great job, but the special effects coordinator deserves a huge round of applauds as well. There were scenes when the plane banks right you lean and when the pilots feel the jet flush you will feel your breath stops for a moment before gasping for air. It was a real treat to eyes and a very convincing play by the director that makes you believe you are travelling along with the actors, a very very difficult feat to achieve, very well doneWas tom cruise love interest needed? Meh.. nope Do you root for others apart from Tom Cruise, not really.. but is that a bad thing, definitely not.Top Gun achieved Top Honors at all levels.",

            "content": "Top gun pilots, top rate movies\nTiming couldn't be more appropriate for me to watch this 2022 sequel today - exactly one week after I watched the original release Top Gun (1986). And let me tell you something. You need the background knowledge of the 1986 episode for a compete and thorough understanding of the sequel. Rarely is a sequel as good as its original release due to tapering viewers' sentiment which in many cases is an unfortunate reality. Yet this movie has broken the curse.There you go. Top Gun: Maverick (2022). What a group of top guns! And what a series of top rate movies! To an old school 70er like myself, the 2022 session is a long anticipated and much needed extension of the 1986 nostalgia. To me it's almost a remake of the 1986 Top Gun in many ways. The opening credit is exactly the same which provides a very good flashback of the old series. Interpersonal relationship in this sequel dreadfully and eerily mimics those in the 1986 release. The intimate relationship between Maverick and the woman, the rivalry between the two best trainee pilots Rooster and Hangman, are nothing short of a remake and reflection of how various characters interacted in the 1986 Top Gun.What surprises me is that the 1986 Top Gun only earned itself an acceptable 6.9, a far cry from 8.6 for its 2022 sequel. My take is that the Maverick session has more combat scenes than its predecessor, which makes it easier to attract young viewers. Still it strikes the right balance between its more drama genre and the fighting scenes. After all it is meant to depict the career and personal lives of naval pilots. Hence fighting must take a secondary place.Scenes and themes are multilayered and sophisticated. There are a good mix of tense yet upbeat, uplifting while emotional scenes. Argument breaks out between fellow trainees. Disagreement ensues between commander and officer. Flashback reverts back to deceased father and his successive pilot son. Mind twists between protecting deceased mate's son and fulfilling his career aspirations. All are naturally, logically, coherently, organically and consistently woven together and permeate into each other. It is indeed a great deal of information to process.No movie review is complete without making reference to its cast and crew. Acting is another masterpiece in this film. As I have applauded Tom Cruise in many of my previous reviews, I must say it is tremendously good to see him make a comeback to this sequel. Can you believe that? It's been 36 years since his debut in this movie, which leaves me wondering what has taken so long to release this sequel. Time has changed and people have moved on, only that it is the same Tom. Despite multiple signs of aging, he looks more mature and seasoned in 2022 than his 1986 image. Well, he must be as he has built up his acting skills over this many years. Noteworthy to say is that this show has a good mix of newcomers and establishment actors. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are Hollywood's rising stars. I somehow favor Powell as I can see huge potentials in him. His confident yet arguably cocky face places him well in elite roles such as NASA astronaut in Hidden Figures (2016) and the rich businessman in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (2018), as well as Hangman the elite pilot in this show.Top Gun: Maverick (2022), what a modern day classic film! Come back and have a revisit in 20 years time and I can assure you it still stands. Top Gun, top movie! You can quote me!",

Where is the magic of the 1985 film ? There is no kelly here.......the love interest is boring......how about the great 1985 soundtrack and i'm talking about the actual songs. Danger zone and take my breath away are legend songs. We have zero such songs in the sequel. The 80s magic is gone for good. Now i'm not saying the sequel is bad. It's just indefferent. Forgettable if u take out the action scenes. U just can't bring back the 80s magic. They stalled the sequel for too long. This should have been made like.....at least 20 years before with kelly involved.

            "content": "It is easy to be enthusiastic, nay, rapturous about Top Gun: Maverick. The feel-good Hollywood story of the summer; Top Gun 2 is the first movie in a long time to feel like a proudly American cinematic spectacular. Its major box office success and public popularity is impossible to root against. The celebratory energy of Top Gun: Maverick will enrapture plenty. But even accounting for Tom Cruise, Jerry Bruckheimer, and director Joseph Kosinski's shrewd spell-the influx of timing and properly placed ambition, giving a starved audience the kind of entertainment they needed-Top Gun: Maverick is still a super-charged rush of fresh air; a summer blockbuster both jaw-droppingly thrilling and emotionally fulfilling.Maverick doesn't rewrite the \"Legacy Sequel\" rules. 36 years after Top Gun, Tom Cruise's Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell has graduated from hotshot young stud to seasoned legend. Brass wants him to retire from flying and train the next generation, for there is a real-world mission to an unnamed place against an unnamed enemy that must be carried out. It's a thin premise, but not any more so than the original movie. In fact, Maverick is very much the same story as Top Gun. Miles Teller plays Rooster, son of Goose, the Maverick proxy. He competes with a handful of others for something like the Top Gun prize, as they train for the upcoming mission. The movie's first half is basically a remake, a criticism we've heard before of certain Legacy Sequels. You get the same action beats and the same emotional flavors, repackaged with varying levels of success.Where this movie really starts to cook is in the second half, when the money, talent, and ambition truly hits the screen. You expect the aerial filming technology to improve in the three decades since Tony Scott's impressive outing, and Maverick's second half opens up those possibilities. The training runs work out similarly for both films, with some magnificent real-life aerial footage mixed with ubiquitous cockpit close-ups. Maverick does it without the clunky blue screen gimbals, but that doesn't make its scenes discernibly better. No, it's the dogfights where the new film pulls ahead. On a gigantic screen, with thunderous sound, Maverick reaches action highs that few others have ever reached. I can't say what these filmmakers did, or how they did it, but it sure as hell looks like Cruise, Teller and the rest are actually flying these machines, dodging missiles, and pulling heavy Gs. The sustained tension and endless narrow escapes of the final chunk of the movie signify the type of action that really thrills. The kind that fixes your eyes to the screen and juices you up instead of numbing your senses.Don't discount the human factor, though. Maverick isn't a lesson on character writing by any means, but it does have a charming collection of pilots, led by Cruise and Teller. Tom Cruise leverages his stardom without coming off as vain. He's fun. A bit of an underdog, where someone else might have seemed too-good-to-be-real. In the sky and in his relationship with Jennifer Connelly's Penny, you want him to make it out alright. Miles Teller is the other important cog, heading the new crew. The breakout shot has been eluding Teller since his explosion onto the scene in Whiplash, but with Top Gun: Maverick, he may have finally found that star-making role. He's charismatic and emotionally well-shaded. When he's in the cockpit, you're thinking about more than just the plane. The movie hits some easy emotional targets (how hard is it to feel choked up by a touching tribute to Val Kilmer?), but that's a great deal more than you can say for other movies of this type.If Top Gun 2 isn't quite the movie its predecessor is, it may only come from Tony Scott's absence. His original film is the sexier movie; more mature, more confident, and better looking. But Maverick is the thrill-seeker's choice. A feature-length theme park ride, complete with pre-ride set-up and fist-pumping finale. People will wax hyperbolic about Top Gun: Maverick, and with good reason. It's a mammoth action spectacle involving human beings, on a universe we recognize, done (mostly) for real. I don't think that necessarily makes it a great film, but it does make it worth seeing in a movie theater. An experience like this one is what those big screens are made for.77/100.",

            "content": "There's been plenty of sequels that have been released many years later that have been very hit and miss. Some have tarnished the memories of the original movie, and some have been satisfying. Right from the opening credits, Top Gun: Maverick was going to be a great thrill ride. The story felt refreshing as it took a trip down nostalgic lane as well as bringing in new ideas as well as moving on to the present era. It was definitely great to see Tom Cruise return as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. In fact, I thought this was better than the first movie.US Naval Aviator Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) still feels the need for speed and has turned down opportunities for promotion for fears of being grounded. Maverick is still passionate about flying and he still continues in the role as a test pilot. Maverick still continues to push the envelope and this time he defies orders not to fly a hypersonic prototype resulting in a crash after he successfully reaches Mach 10. Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain (Ed Harris) manages to have Maverick reassigned to NAS North Island in San Diego to train a new group of Top Gun graduates. Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson (Jon Hamm) and Rear Admiral Solomon \"Warlock\" Bates (Charles Parnell) feel that the presence of the aging aviator is unwanted, despite the fact Maverick was only brought in at the request of former adversary turned friend Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer who makes a welcome return to his iconic role despite his health issues) who is now the commander of the US Fleet.Maverick is tasked with training the new group of top pilots for a secret mission to destroy a nuclear facility in an enemy compound. One of the pilots is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller) who is the son of Maverick's friend Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards who appears in archive footage) who was killed in an accident in the original movie which still haunts Maverick many years later. Other pilots brought in for the mission include Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin (Glen Powell), Robert \"Bob\" Floyd (Lewis Pullman), Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace (Monica Barbaro), Reuben \"Payback\" Fitch (Jay Ellis), Mickey \"Fanboy\" Garcia (Danny Ramirez), Javy \"Coyote\" Machado (Greg Tarzan Davis), Brigham \"Harvard\" Lennox (Jake Picking)\nand Logan \"Yale\" Lee (Raymond Lee).Maverick also rekindles his romantic interest with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly) who now owns a bar and is a single mother to daughter Amelia Benjamin (Lyliana Wray).The fun and excitement continues just like the first movie and things get more intense and thrilling in the second half.Tom Cruise shows that age will never slow him down as he returns as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. He's still cocky, charming, and still the same hotshot just like he was back in 1986. As said before, Maverick is still haunted by the death of Goose but still cherishes the friendship that he since developed with Iceman.The rest of the main cast include Jon Hamm, Miles Teller, Ed Harris, Glen Powell, Jennifer Connelly, and Val Kilmer who are fantastic. Miles Teller's Bradley Bradshaw brings back memories of his late father with the same swagger.Director Joseph Kisinski admirably pays homage to the first movie and doesn't he do a fantastic job. The sequel was going to make a return originally however everything was put on hold when director Tony Scott took his own life in 2012. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer turns everything up to 11 as he does what he does best.It's been 2 long years since Top Gun: Maverick was due in cinemas however the release was delayed following the COVID outbreak. The wait was worth it and the movie was excellent. I watched the original 1986 classic just as a refresher before the movie was released in cinemas today and I'm glad I did.I had an excellent time with Top Gun: Maverick and it was great to see Tom Cruise return to one of his iconic roles and shows that he still has the starpower. I left the cinema super hyped and buzzing. I'm so happy that the sequel did the original justice. It's definitely better than the first movie. Top Gun: Maverick still fulfils the need for speed and thrills and excitement. Welcome back Tom Cruise and welcome back to Top Gun.9/10.",

Having only watched the original for the first time a few days before this one I could really notice just how much of an appreciative love letter this was to the first one. Kosinski admires and respects the original film and that is clearly evident throughout the runtime. Cruise reprises his role as Maverick perfectly. He's not trying to play the exact same character in the first, he's playing an aged and lived Maverick who has still been carrying his emotional baggage from his youth. This clearly has affected his relationship's and I believe makes him a more three dimensional character. He is no longer just a rebellious pilot who was overshadowed by his father's prowess as a legendary pilot, he's a damaged man trying to find meaning in his life and tie up loose ends within himself. I loved the stark contrast against Cruise Teller brought as Rooster. I really felt their chemistry was organic and could tell just through their performances there was a deep underlying issue between them which connected them however ;also crippling them both emotionally. The best part for me about this film was the absolutely stunning and just overwhelmingly awesome cinematography. I found it much easier to navigate and understand the dogfight's in this film which is obviously due to the advancement in camera technology but at the same time it's the camera tricks used. The film is just beautiful to look at and is a great milestone for current cinematography limits. I would highly recommend watching this film, it would be much better to see the previous one to appreciate all the nods and references but I think it does a great job at providing enough detail and content that there isn't any point where as an audience member you feel distant if you haven't seen first film.",

I knew from the nostalgic and nerve-wracking opening sequence that this was going to be an enjoyable ride.The practical, realistic visuals are breathtaking, as they are the product of technical wizardry. The flight sequences are some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. They were genuinely exciting. The high-stakes third act is memorable. There are also numerous shots that are aesthetic.Cruise is great and his commitment, as always is unparalleled. He is, as Milles Teller said, a \"movie-making machine\". Truly a unique personality. Trough his movies, he underlines humanities sense of perseverance.On the story and character level, furthermore, the movie also does a perfectly solid job, as it is engaging. From sadness to laughter, it generates a lot of emotions, a signal of its quality. The dynamics are authentic and delightful. Val Kilmer presence was noteworthy.Finally, the inherent apolitical nature of the film is greatly appreciated. The fact that they did not choose to replace the Taiwanese flag to appease to chinese audience put a considerable smile on my face.In conclusion an exciting, joyous and tremendously well-done film that qualitatively and quantitively surpasses its predecessor.A true movie.I loved it.",

The aerial sequences are so breathtakingly awesome, I nearly felt like I was experiencing 9 Gs. The soundtrack (the sonic whooshes of the fighter jets) was off the roof insane. Tom Cruise as Maverick feels facinatingly fresh for a character who hasn't changed at all-both physically and mentally. Val Kilmer as Iceman was really touching to see on screen-I shed some tears. The supporting cast were all great-I really felt the camaraderie watching the Top Gun people playing beach side shirt less football. The greatness of this is a testament to the invincible star power of Tom Cruise, who not only acts but performs his own stunts and is a producer on this movie, as well as the work ethic of the star and every crew member of this epic blockbuster.

Then we meet said pilots aces...the most sorry, ridiculous, absurd bunch of teenagers you could possibly find. If you were casting teen Big Brother (how the hell is that show still on the air?) or some MTV garbage these clowns would be ideal. At issue is some country that is developing nuclear weapons and the US has decided to blow up that facility. The facility is hidden inside the bottom of the center of what looks like an inactive volcano. The only way to get there is through a curvy valley. So Maverick has to train these geniuses to fly at low altitude (otherwise anti-aircraft missiles will target them) through a valley, then up one side of mountain then down, hit the target, rush up the other steeper side of the mountain without blacking out, then evading the enemy aircraft. There will have to be two teams of two because it takes two strikes to blow up the interior of the facility.There's a love interest and ex for Maverick who runs a bar near the flight school. She has a daughter. There is drama between Maverick and one of the kids who is the son of the one pilot who died in the original Top Gun and Maverick promised his mom to keep him out of danger, which he did, so the kid hates Maverick for getting in the way of his career (even though here he is). The higher ups of course can't stand Maverick but have to put up with him because he was the choice of none other than Iceman himself, who runs the place and is very ill. That leads to a touching scene with Val Kilmer.Eventually, Maverick's stint as instructor ends just as he was warming up to the kids and before the mission begins. As everyone knows, this particular successful mission would require of several \"miracles.\" Even though Maverick has been kicked out he decides to prove that he is the only one who can train the kids by doing a test run himself because conveniently near the school there is a valley and mountain identical to the geography of the bad guys's country. He makes it, forcing the higher ups to re-admit Maverick...not as an instructor but as a pilot for the actual mission!So off they go to attack their target, Maverick gets shot down during the process. The one kid has a change of heart and decides to rescue Maverick, which leaves both in enemy territory, coincidentally near an enemy airfield where they find...an old F-14 for some reason. They start it up no problem and off they fly with enemy on their tail, when another kid, who is presented as the nemesis saves the day.Back on the ground, Maverick still has to resolve things with the ex.Top Gun: Maverick comes decades too late. Tom Cruise despite his status as a movie star plays things too low key and tongue-in-cheek for the role. Kosinski is the the wrong director for this movie; Miranda the wrong cinematographer. This movie should have tried to capture the flashiness and spectacularity that made the first iconic. But it doesn't bother. It should have launched the career of one of the secondary actors but it doesn't do that either. The couple of airplane scenes are alright, nothing spectacular. The coolest part here are the 5th gen enemy aircraft and their sinister-looking pilots. The climactic scene of the characters carrying out the mission is indeed thrilling but that's about it. This is the kind of movie that could have done with less story and character development but needed more aircraft/aircraft carrier action scenes.",

While the F-14 boasts a larger main radar, it is mechanically rather than electronically scanned and several decades out of date while the Su-57 deploys not one, but six, electronically scanned array radars as well as an infra red search and track system. The immense technological gap between the fighters, and the Su-57's advanced Himalalyas electronic warfare system and AESA radars, would likely leave the F-14 blinded and thus more vulnerable to being targeted at range. The Su-57 could also use its stealth capabilities, combined with its ability to operate without a radar signature using its infrared sensor, to neutralise Tomcats at medium ranges without allowing the adversary to gain a radar lock. The next generation fighter would have even more overwhelming advantages within visual ranges, since the F-14 does not integrate helmet mounted sights or high off boresight capable missiles meaning the Su-57 could engage it at very extreme angles. It would be further aided by its extreme manoeuvrability, considered the best in the world at low speeds, while the F-14 was considered unmaneouvrable even by the standards of its generation.",

The story, writing, and acting felt cheesy and very Hollywood. I had a good feeling about this one when the music starts playing over the opening and the \"danger zone\" song comes on during the aircraft carrier scenes. The actor names appearing in sync with the music was a nice touch. The writing is a lot more mature - no cheesy lines, dance routines, or childish acts on the part of any of the characters - making you a lot more invested in the movie. The history of Maverick, Rooster's son, and Connelly's character was introduced slowly and nicely, and the reasoning behind each character's motives are rational and well-done. The humour was light and appropriate, done at the right moments. Flight sequences were amazing - real, engaging, and accented the story instead of making the whole movie just about random plane scenes. The build-up to the end mission was well-done, and you really felt the stakes (I honestly didn't know what would happen). Nice aircraft all around. I'm not a pilot or plane fanatic, but there were some nice jets, both old and new. The conflict between the new era of AI and old-school fighter pilots was an interesting touch to the story, and also helps ground the movie, since those issues are very much at the forefront of future air warfare today. Overall, an extremely well-done movie, great music, mature storytelling, and surprisingly, one of those sequels that's definitely better than the first.",

The action sequences are anything but an afterthought, and are both impressive and easy to follow. I re-watched the original Top Gun later the same day, and in my mind there is no contest - Maverick is a better film in almost every aspect. Action-wise this is the best action film in recent memory, but it does have some minor flaws.The dialogue feels a little contrived at times, especially between the side characters. It's not bad per se, but a little over the top. Enough that it will take some people out of the immersion.My bigger gripe perhaps is the half-baked romance side-plot. It doesn't add much to the film, but at the same time I'm happy that it doesn't try to take center stage and lets the flying be the focus.All in all, Top Gun: Maverick is a fantastic action film that does not compromise on the action and flying elements. The stunts, cinematography, sound design and nostalgia are all on point. This is how you do a rehash, simple as that.",

            "content": "If you were coming into this film expecting the same cheesy action flick like the first Top Gun, you would be sorely mistaken. The overall tone and story of Top Gun Maverick is more melancholic and intense than I anticipated. While there are dog fighting and training sequences that are definitely in the realm for a Top Gun film, the driving force of the story is the conflict between Rooster and Maverick as they come to terms with the past.\u00ac\u00acBut damn, the performances given in this film are just phenomenal. Cruise possibly gave his best performance ever as Maverick! I know right?! He brings Maverick's signature cockiness, but matches it with compassion that wasn't present in the first film. Miles Teller is a fantastic foil to Cruise, as well as being a good casting choice since he looks nearly identical to Goose's actor, Anthony Edwards. Rooster is the opposite of Maverick in every way and the amount of resentment towards his surrogate father figure is both palpable and understandable.Of course it would not be a Top Gun film without some jet-on-jet action. This not only elevates the action from the first film but it really keeps you on the edge of your seat, putting you in the cockpit with the other actors. Before I proceed further, I would like to mention that many of the actors, Cruise included, actually flew these fighter jets themselves. These ingenious stunt sequences lead to what I have to say are some of the most realistic and suspenseful sequences I have ever seen! They also lead to some brilliant cinematography as well; beautiful shots of the bright blue sky to the claustrophobic nature of the cockpit. It was something to behold.Top Gun Maverick is not just a great sequel to a classic 1980s film, but one of the best sequels to ever be produced, arguably up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Phenomenal acting by the entire cast, gives tremendous weight to the atmospheric melancholy. And the action sequences are the best of the best, with gorgeous cinematography to help feel the dire and tense nature of a fighter pilot. Top Gun may have been entertaining with its cheesy popcorn action, but Top Gun Maverick brings more humanity and intensity than the first to make it possibly one of the best films of the year.",

            "content": "In 1986, \"Top Gun\" changed American blockbuster cinema forever. Besides being a powerful military recruitment tool, the film captivated audiences with Tom Cruise's charismatic performance as Maverick, captivating aerial dogfighting scenes, and a now-iconic soundtrack. While that film is unquestionably a cultural touchstone of its era, I never have loved it the way that some people did. That said, as a fan of Tom Cruise's action films, I was most certainly looking forward to seeing the sequel. To my shock, the film is utterly outstanding and far better than it had any right to be--blowing the first film out of the water.The plot is relatively simple. Maverick is back as a flight instructor, and has to instruct a new class of fighter pilot recruits (among them the son of Goose from the first film) to take out an enemy nation's uranium enrichment facility. That may seem like a relatively simple or generic story, but the film's technical craftsmanship and emotional core are utterly superb and riveting throughout its entire runtime. The flight scenes are just impeccably shot, with top-notch cinematography, sound design, and editing. You truly feel like you're in the cockpit, and the results are utterly riveting, visceral, and thrilling. The sharp editing ensures that you can always keep track of who is who and what is what during these scenes, while simultaneously maintaining a strong sense of spatial awareness outside the aircraft(s.) It's been a long time--maybe even not since \"Mission: Impossible--Fallout\"--that I've seen action scenes filmed this well and wholly committed to technical filmmaking rather than CGI effects. Every single sound feels like it was carefully crafted to most accurately and authentically recreating the fighter pilot experience as possible.Any reviewer impressed by this film could go on and on about how technically stunning it is, but what else sets this film apart from other modern blockbusters is a strong devotion to powerful, emotionally impactful plot and character development-driven storytelling as well. Unlike many blockbuster franchises, this film manages to tell a thoroughly compelling and authentic story in the here and now rather than spend far too much of its runtime setting up a million sequels and spin-offs. Tom Cruise still remains as charismatic as ever as Maverick, but he's more thoughtful and wise this time. The new recruits are all very strong in their performances, especially Miles Teller; the emotional and dramatic tensions between him and Maverick over Goose's death feel realistic and believably raw. Jennifer Connelly is also great as Penny, a bar owner and Maverick's love interest. Val Kilmer's return as Iceman is also emotional and compassionate, helping solidify the impact of the film's stakes on the viewer. The screenplay is much sharper, tighter, smarter, and wittier than the first film, and never lets go of ensuring powerful interpersonal relationships between characters are felt to create a gripping and high-quality narrative. Unlike many other blockbusters that feel they could have been trimmed by 30 minutes or so, the film is practically immaculately paced--with no scenes that feel too long or too short to keep the audience thoroughly interested and entertained through its entire runtime of a little over 2 hours.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" proves that you can have a summer blockbuster that manages to excel in the highest levels of technical and aesthetic prowess and never lose sight of a genuinely powerful, relevant, and thoughtful story--all while simultaneously keeping the audience entertained and thrilled from beginning to end. That's why I was so blown away by it, leaving the theater with a huge smile on my face. I hope others feel the same way too. 10/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. Without question, this was an outstanding Dolby experience. The sound design utilized the Dolby Atmos system and bass incredibly well, and the rumble was utilized in tandem with increasing fighter jet engine noises. The picture quality, lighting, and color contrasts were excellent as well, and noticeably better than they would likely be on a standard screen.",

Even considering the lockdowns for 2 years, truthfully their hadn't been a single movie worth watching in theaters in years. Besides the overdone superhero stories(because they've run out of ideas), what movie has been worth the outrageous amount of money we pay to watch in theaters? Any movie lover would agree w/ this.The movie was outstanding. Every character was well thought out. Considering the missing lead female character from movie 1, the female lead character was amazing. Honestly, she might have been better than the original female lead. Much more depth in her character.This was a movie that you \"get into.\" I've spent years watching the same overdone CGI films w/ minimal story lines. Because of the realistic method it was filmed w/, I caught myself really REALLY getting into the movie. Each dramatic scene in the movie really catches you. You almost become emotionally involved in each character. Something I haven't experience in quite some time. Sighhhh of relief knowing my money was well spent.... for once.The last point is why the movie was as outstanding as it is. I can't say enough about how the movie draws you into each scene. Great from opening to close. Not much I can say in criticism. I'll have to watch it again to find those. May even go to theaters for a second dose of this one.",

You truly feel that you are there with the pilots.This movie truly highlights why Cruise is one of the greatest movie stars of his generation. You will do yourself a massive disservice if you do not see this movie. This movie is probably going to end up being one of the best action movies of the decade.The callbacks to the original really feel you with a great sense of nostalgia, especially the opening song and Val's cameo, especially after recovering from throat cancer. After the opening song the rest of the score works perfectly, really adding to humour or seriousness of the scene.Overall the time will fly by, you will genuine laugh out loud at scenes, and by griped at the climax.

So I wish there were a couple more training scenes to make us believe that those pilots really are the \"best of the best\".The football scene was in there to show them how to work as a team and somehow, after that 5 minute scene, they're all best friends and working together perfectly?And lastly, I wanted a bigger moment between rooster and maverick at the end. They wrote a plot line where rooster hates him and is obviously somewhat blaming him for his dads death, and we never really get a conversation between the two of them about it. That could have been a good emotional moment of forgiveness and maverick being able to finally let it go.But overall this movie was so great! Everyone really brought their A game for this!",

This movie screams Freedom Rings from the first moment. The cinematography is unmatched. The lengths they went to in shooting the scenes in unbelievable. In a world where CGI has stolen the soul of cinema, Top Gun Maverick breathes the soul back into the film making process. You feel how special the movie is the entire time you're watching.Some people might scoff at the simplicity of the story line, but is my medium rare Angus Beef steak bad because it's simply seasoned with salt and pepper? Hell no! And you know what else it is? American, and amazing from start to finish. Just like this movie.Can I also say that nobody, and I mean nobody, can Tom Cruise like Tom Cruise does? It's seriously true. He has become a master of his specific type of movie. Edge of your seat, adrenaline pumping, thrill rides that keep your heart pounding from beginning to end. With scenes in his movies that you're sure have to be fake, I mean - there have got to be stunt doubles here right? Wrong. Why? Because it's Tom Cruise, and he's going to Tom Cruise it. Seriously, go look it up.And before you complain about the movie because, \"You don't like Tom Cruise as a person\" or some other such drivel, recognize that you probably know less than half of what you think you know, and even if less than half of what you think you know is true, who cares? Do I care whether or not the person who waits my table has the same political opinion as I do? No! I care if they get me my meal correct, on time and keep my cup full. Tom does all of that, and then sings you happy birthday and gives you a birthday present and convinces you that you've never had such amazing service in your life.So go watch this movie. In theaters. You'll have the rest kd your life to watch it on TV. Back to back with the original (which you will by the way, at least once a year. Probably more).",

            "review_title": "\"The Beginning of the End of Cinematic Blockbusters\"",
            "content": "There will be a time when Maverick's generation is obsolete because youth will fill in. There will be a time when Tom Cruise is no longer the face of franchises, and another poster boy will arise. There will come a time when stimulating blockbusters no longer exist to unite all types of movie-goers. The time when IP franchises dominate everything is gradually creeping upon us, but it isn't today. Top Gun: Maverick is one of the most cinematic widely accessible movies ever created. It is a beautifully paced, intense, dramatic thrill ride that anyone can enjoy. Whether you love him or hate him, Tom Cruise is singlehandedly saving the modern cinematic blockbuster.Ed Harris' character says this early on, \"The future is coming, and you're not in it... The end is inevitable, Maverick. Your kind is headed to extinction.\" That is quite a bombshell to drop on Maverick and the audience so quickly. Although, I think it serves as more than that. Of course, there is a group of young guns coming up that will push out Maverick's generation altogether. Going further, there will likely be artificial intelligence to push out the younger generation when the time comes. This line, though, stands for Tom Cruise giving a nod of awareness that he is aging. There will be a time (hopefully not soon) where Cruise and his recognizable characters will no longer be a part of Hollywood. Whether he retires or dies while making a movie, which would be more fitting, eventually, everyone's time is up. Maverick is not really passing the torch and even refuses in some facets, but he's calling for the younger pilots to be just as good if not better in their own ways. Through the titular character, director Joseph Kosinski is calling for the next generation to strap up and commit to filmmaking as the greats have in the past. I hope this chapter in Cruise's career is long, but I believe it to be his last.Pertaining to the film specifically, the characters were extremely well-written and each was accompanied by a surprisingly great performance. This was the stand-out of the film. Of course, staple actors like Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, and Val Kilmer all played perfect supports to push Maverick in a certain direction. Hamm and Harris both beautifully portrayed stern, hardened alpha males in opposition to Maverick's ambition. Although, I certainly was not anticipating multiple young actors to have relatively great performances. Miles Teller brings his A-game, similar to what we have seen in the likes of his 'Whiplash' performance. Glen Powell, playing the cocky, uber-talented Hangman, absolutely steals the show. Powell just exudes charisma and demands your attention on the screen. Hangman is fairly unlikable for most of the film, but somehow you still love watching him. Glen Powell was certainly the biggest surprise for me, and I will be shocked if this doesn't boost him into superstardom. The aforementioned Val Kilmer also has an emotional part in the movie that was a fantastic tribute to the Iceman. The Iceman scenes in particular were turning points for Maverick in my eyes, and they allowed Cruise to show off acting chops of his own.It's impossible to talk about this film without referring to the cinematography of the flight sequences. Whether it was a laid-back first day of training or the execution of the intense main mission, the flights are filmed gorgeously. With cameras in the cockpits facing the pilots, you can clearly see them and everything behind the plane while moving at unreal speeds. It feels like you're seated on the nose of the plane facing the cockpit, and, needless to say, it will have you glued to the screen. Seeing this in IMAX format was easily one of the best theater experiences I have ever had. I encourage everyone to go see it in a theater and in advanced formats if possible.Top Gun: Maverick is a film that exquisitely executes the modern legacy sequel. It is infused with nostalgia without being bogged down by it. It perfectly blends characters we love with new ones into a story with real stakes. It is intense, action-packed, and littered with memorable moments. This film doesn't go back to catchy lines just for hollow callbacks (like someone lazily saying \"feel the need for speed\"). That would have been the easy way out, but Kosinski and Christopher McQuarrie bring an emotional story with real sustenance to the table. There are plenty of moments of fan service and nostalgia, but they all feel warranted. In many cases, sequels taint the first movie, and it would have been very easy for this to happen when the sequel is a 36-year successor. This film couldn't exist without the original Top Gun coming out first, but, with that said, it far surpasses the 1986 classic.Final Score: 92/100.",

The movie ebbs and flows with natural highs, lows and moments of tension and brevity right up until the end. Nailed it.The bad: 2 things (and it's light criticism). 1-the romance was lukewarm. Whilst it didn't grate me - it didn't have much purpose beyond being 2 people going all googly eyes at each other. It didn't overstay it's welcome but did very little for the movie - it could have been removed and (except for maybe one scene) you wouldn't have noticed. 2-Too much Tom Cruise (i know, the film is called 'Maverick') but the film puts him as the saviour a bit too much IMO. They could have altered some events to let the new recruits shine a bit more - whilst still giving Tom plenty of opportunity to kick ass.Should you watch it: Absolutely. It's big, it's fun and it delivers on it's promise of pure blockbuster cinema that can be enjoyed by a wide ranging audience. See it on the biggest screen possible. Highly recommended.",

Toss in bad guys that look like Darth Vader in superior jets with a Death Star trench run, and what's not to love?This movie was made to be seen in a theater and for the audience that enjoyed the original. It worked on me. Now I'm going to do something I haven't done since I was a kid... go see this movie in the theater a second time.",

Who we have instead is Joseph Kosinski, and I'd argue he's even better.As the name suggests, this film focuses upon Maverick. If you're a fan of the original you won't be disappointed to see what he's been flying since, or that he's still flying.And it's those flying scenes that are stunning. Far better than the originals, better not just because technology has moved on, but because the actors are in aircraft being flown. Real aircraft, being filmed under the stresses of flight.Kosinski's previous successes are Tron: Legacy, Oblivion and Only The Brave. If you've seen those three films you already know he's probably the best director working today. Yes, he's that good.Top Gun: Maverick works because the director, Kosinski, somehow manages to make you feel that you're part of the film, that you're right there with the people in the film. The pace is perfect, the action precise, and yes you'll be on the edge of your seat!Kosinski should be getting an Oscar for Top Gun: Maverick.",

Many references of orignal are there and you can find them as easter egg which can make the movie watching more immersive experience.Music is top notch as given my Hans zimmer so you know its awesome and some orignal tracks.Lady Gaga and One Republic's music track is amazing especially the One republic's \"I ain't worried\" which serves as perfect successor to Playing with the boys song of 86.Action scenes are smooth and mostly real you can feel the G force on actors inside the jets. A truely theatrical marvel.But if you are looking for some serious story content or character development of mainly co stars then there isn't much as whole movie is focused on Maverick and Goose's son Rooster.I would say watch it alteast once; its a perfect popcorn flick.

Ive never felt such excitement over a film in my life, I've also never been so scared of a film being bad.After release I couldn't believe the reviews, I was so happy people were giving it 10 out of 10,I booked my ticket for imax and watched it. When I left the cinema I felt like a kid after you've opened all your Christmas presents, a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong,I was blown away by the film, it absolutely flew past (pardon the pun) and was visually stunning but it just wasn't the original.I waited a week and today I saw it again,I took my old man who's 63,he's not really a film person but he was loved it. He was laughing,ducking,shaking his head and even crying at the end. This film is without a doubt a 10 out of 10.If you're expecting a shawshank redemption or The godfather worthy storyline then forget it,that's not what this is. What it is is the best cinematic experience you will ever witness,the flying scenes are stunning,the acting is bang on and it is pretty emotional at times.This film isn't perfect,it still has unnecessary cheese and the sailing scene is utterly pointless. I would have preferred it to be more serious,I like heroes dying and sad endings but it is what it is.At the end of the day if you don't see this in a cinema through imax you are missing out.

I didn't become a fan even after watching this sequel called 'Top Gun: Maverick' directed by Joseph Kosinski. I like action movies when they are based on an interesting story, with characters that I can identify with as a viewer. In the case of the 'Top Gun' movies, the stories are boring for me, the characters are schematic and I can't identify in any way with the macho and militaristic culture propagated by these films, whatever the uniforms that the heroes wear. The 1956 'Top Gun' proposed to teenagers and young people of that time an amplified version of the fun things specific to the age before the Internet, mobile phones and virtual realities. It was a world fascinated by speed, motorcycles, cars and planes. Transferring some of its heroes to the second decade of the third millennium, 'Top Gun: Maverick' mostly relies on a retro effect despite the new aircraft models. Of course, the most precious retro element of all is Tom Cruise himself, an actor I admire for his past achievements in other genres, and for what he does in action movies (though I am finding the 'Mission: Impossible' series much more interesting) . The result, in my opinion, is a huge public success but not an artistic success.What I liked about this movie: First of all, Tom Cruise, the actor who manages to insuflate some life into action heroes, who looks at 60 like he's 40 and who makes this sequel look like it's done 10 years and not 34 years after the original movie. Retro elements (clothing, music, motorcycles and airplanes) that make the conflict between generations acceptable, which is one of the main themes of the film. The fine cinematography in some of the action sequences. The discrete romantic story between the lead hero and the heroine played by Jennifer Connelly, the only credible interpersonal relationship in the film.What I liked least: The militaristic atmosphere. The scene with muscular soldiers. The schematism of the characters. Predictability of the story. Pretentious dialogues - some serious, some that intent to be funny.What left me indifferent: the aerial combat scenes and the fact that the actors filmed in real planes and were intensely physically stressed. Pseudo-technical details of the aircraft or of the planning and execution of the military operation. Schematic sub-stories related to values such as friendship or intergenerational relationships. The bla-bla about discipline, indiscipline and initiative.At the end of the day, 'Top Gun: Maverick' is nothing more than a package for aerial combat scenes and another movie in which Tom Cruise defies the laws of ageing. There are many, many fans of these topics who have turned their enthusiasm into movie tickets and good grades for film. My opinion is that 'Top Gun: Maverick' is just another mediocre action movie. Luckily for the producers, my opinion is in the minority.",

I have some appreciation for movies that are Oscar bound and are genuinely pieces of art. No one, ever, would rate this rehash of a sequel like this a 10. Tom Cruise will never win an Oscar.Like I said, I was satisfied with this movie because I expected thrilling action scenes, nothing else.

All the predictable exposition is spelled out so on-the-nose you think the intended audience is in the 4-6 year old age range.However, I'd like to take time in this review to comment about the obvious planted user reviews that all give this film a 10. This film is nowhere near a 10. To the movie industry people who are guilty of taking over a user review like this: When I am looking to find out if I want to see a particular movie or not. I will NEVER bother reading a review that gives it 10 stars. Each \"review\" is a short paragraph of nothing but fluffy praise.Which is too bad. This film was intended to be a summer \"feel good\" time at the movies. Many crowd pleasing tropes are featured. Written like a bad TV show, a conflict was created by including the son of a pilot that died while flying with Maverick. To make sure the audience gets it on the nose, the son is literally dressed up identically like his father, complete with moustache and flowery shirt. He even sits down at a piano to recreate a scene from the first film, with even the same song. Even with that telegraphing the conflict, it is mentioned over and over by the other characters throughout the movie.The dialogue and characters have no real gravitas, which I blame the director on. I have seen two of his previous films; Tron Legacy and Oblivion. Both of those films could not really connect emotionally with an audience. Same here. When we are introduced to the young squad of pilots, nothing feels real about them. That lack of emotional connection with the characters contrasts with the single scene with Val Kilmer. Much is made of his appearance and the stronger emotions involved, precisely because this is missing from the rest of the movie.So what makes this movie a pleasure for the most part? The superficiality of the script is what audiences (in our country at least) are looking for right now, having suffered the Covid restrictions longer than most could tolerate. There also are great fissures politically, along with the depressing events in Ukraine. Time for that good ole' American shoot-from-the-hip mentality.What will bring audiences to the theatres is the promise of a feel good ending in a world of worsening crises. Top Gun 2 delivers. But there is a lot of dull filler when it comes to watching what our main characters do outside training. This of course includes Maverick being confronted by the dead pilot's son. Then there are the run-ins with the higher-ups for Maverick's shenanigans. Eyes will roll at how flimsy these run-ins are, with Maverick usually getting promoted instead of getting reprimanded. Who cares, right? Let's get to the actions scenes.The action scenes deliver as promised. Sprinkled throughout in the first and beginning of the second act, the flying sequences are adrenaline pumping. Use of GoPro style photography, showing the landscaping whipping by, makes the flying sequences very immersive. The big climax involves a video game-like scenario, laid out to the audience using video game-like animation. As before, any implausibilities are glossed over. It is assumed the audience is not looking for a great amount of military tech talk, and just want the good guys to win.MINOR SPOILER AHEADThe climax delivers the goods, a foregone conclusion since the audience was telegraphed the expected results since the first act. Maverick's character demands it. Even the younger pilots all survive.END MINOR SPOILERSo there is your summer picnic. Corny plot. Cheesy dialogue and characters. And Tom Cruise hamming it up as Tom Cruise. \"This is the only look I have\" says the movie star. Go ahead and see it on the big screen anyway. Try to stay awake through the second act for the exciting action finale. But don't pretend this movie is anything close to a 10. I give it a six. I never cared for this machismo type of moviemaking, and Tony Scott's original film looked and felt like an extended TV commercial (which was his background). With the advantage of thirty years of improvements in moviemaking, the sequel, with it's hefty price tag, has earned it's merits to attract a large box office. But be realistic, this is no different than one of those dumb Fast and Furious movies.",

            "content": "It does well enough for nostalgia. I wasn't one who thought there was much need for a sequel, but the opening did put a smile on my face as it was nearly a duplication of Top Gun. Then to see Tom Cruise again as Maverick being, well, Maverick, was fun, with the iconic jacket and sunglasses and bike and being the same cocky guy.But after that, it starts to go downhill, first slowly, then right off a cliff until it reaches about mach 10 in terms of being a really stupid movieIt starts to go off the rails right about the time Jennifer Connelly shows up. Here I always thought there wasn't very good chemistry between Cruise and Kelly McGillis in the original, but this movie makes that seem like Romeo and Juliet. At least in the original, McGillis inhabited her own space, that is to say she was call sign \"Charlie\", she was a civilian superior to Maverick and all the rest. In the sequel, Penny is such an absolute throwaway character. I mean supposedly they have this complicated history, but from the first scene it looks like she's pretty much ready to jump into bed with him from his first grin. If it had at least shown like she had been hurt by him or had moved on with her own life, but no, it's not even close - I mean, you can't have a meet cute with him having to buy drinks when the assumption is they already met a long time ago with a lot of hurt feelings in between. Just bad.Then the rest of the team starts to show up and it's worse. I mean Hangman and Rooster, as I said I'm all for nostalgia but not a total re-tread. How are they not supposed to be Iceman and Maverick from the original? Just a really bad version of it, perfunctory and phoney.Then the whole thing between Maverick and Rooster. Again so phoney. Hard feelings because he held him back? Give me a break. Yeah, I get it, can't be because Rooster blames him for his dad's death, because that would be so cliche and obvious, so instead it's just some tepid and pathetic excuse, may as well just have said Maverick gave him a frowny face on his report card.It does pick up a little with the training sequences, an ok moment with Iceman, and then of course Maverick showing he is Maverick by doing the practice mission better than anyone.But man, does this movie get stupid in a hurry and pretty much stays there. First it's Star Wars with the canyon and the missiles (laser cannons), and the two meter target (a bunker buster wouldn't have worked?). Forget about talk to me, Goose, I was expecting Obi Wan to show up and say, use the force, Luke. In fact during the training, I could swear Maverick becomes Darth Vader for a moment, trying to kill Luke and his wingmen - the force is strong with this one.Then the mission happens and it turns into Rambo. Oh look, Maverick has to take on a super duper helicopter, I was just waiting to see the Rusky behind the wheel. If that isn't enough, then it turns into Forrest Gump as Maverick runs about ten miles through the snow in about two minutes, run, Maverick, run. Then it turns into some version of Spies Like Us, as Maverick and Rooster steal an old plane, I was just waiting for Chevy Chase or Dan Ackroyd to show up.Yes, again there is a pretty cool air fight, even though the enemy plane was way cooler. But then it turns back into Star Wars again. Yeah, I was wondering when Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon was going to show up and I didn't have to wait long, I can't remember, does Hangman yell Yahoo! As he gets rid of Darth Vader, I mean the bad guy?Again the nostalgia was the best part by far. It's not that the original Top Gun was a great movie, but there are certain movies and tv shows that just perfectly capture a moment in time, and I certainly would say Top Gun is at the top of the list in terms of the 1980's. It's iconoclastic in that sense, it captures the zeitgeist as well if not better than anything else done in that decade. Perhaps a few more examples for me would be Wall Street or Breakfast Club or Family Ties for a tv show; not saying they were the best of the era, but there's just something about them that captures the thoughts and feelings of the decade. Maverick, on the other hand, is a mild diversion at best, a movie that might bring back a few memories of that time but unlikely to ever create memories of its own.",

I went with my boyfriend, who is attending flight school to become a pilot.This movie was absolutely incredible. One of my new favorites. It's nothing but entertainment. It's sweet, suspenseful, emotional, enthralling. It pulls you in. The stunts are incredible- CGI will never beat stuff like this. Tom Cruise is fantastic, with this and the Mission Impossible movies I've grown to really respect him.There's no underlying messages, no modern crap, just pure joy. Great acting, great score, great pacing. I love the fact that Maverick didn't sleep around with a bunch of women, and instead he stayed with the original one. It was delightful, a great change from the Bond-type player protagonist.The characters were all likeable. The action was insane. It made me very emotional, I cried several times. THIS is what it means to be a patriot. To love and fight for your country. Without loyalty and bravery like the pilots displayed in the movie, there is no hope for the future of this nation. (Not meaning to get super political, it's just a nice switch from the hateful content that's been spewed out recently towards the United States and the military).I'm going into brief SPOILERS for a moment to discuss:As I said above, I have never seen the first Top Gun and I had no idea who Val Kilmer's character was before this one. I knew nothing about him yet I still teared up when he was talking to Mav, and at his funeral. It hit me hard despite not knowing the characters, and that's how you know it was well done. The emotion was strong even when I didn't know him. You could feel his impact and connection to the characters. Impressive, and great performance. Apparently Val Kilmer is actually sick in real life. God bless him I hope he heals.This film was extremely intense. I was terrified during the entire mission sequence. It built up more suspense than most modern horror movies. I was so involved in the film that at the end when Rooster finds he can't eject and Maverick realizes they're going to die I started crying. I also cried once they landed safely and were embracing each other. A powerful, satisfying, fun movie. I watched it multiple times. Perfect for Summer.",

The writing is not bold in any way, it clings hard to the first movie and the political correctness is up to 11. There are far too many \"establishing shots\", dull, predictable dialogue for me to really enjoy it.And if we rate the film based on what experience it gave us, then compared to, say, Interstellar or The Matrix, Top gun: Maverick cannot be rated nearly as high.Is this what we want the cinema to be?

            "review_title": "Heroic Fantasy of a Dying Man",
            "content": "In all honesty I was never a fan of the original Top Gun mainly due to its over the top clich\u00e9 ridden plot and is quasi homoerotic theme, but I did enjoy this sequel because the screenwriters were clearly channeling two classic films: Star Wars and Point Blank. Of the first, the reference to Lucas's film are clear, \"trust your feelings\" and the bombing/fighter sequences which even have the enemy as duplicates of the TIE fighter pilots. But to me more interesting is the use of the death motif from the later Lee Marvin / John Boorman film, where the obviously dead protagonist, whom against all odds, not only survives but returns to seek the revenge owed to him. In Maverick this fantasy plays out as the dead Pete Mitchell seeks redemption for killing Goose, finding a meaningful relationship with a woman and the possibility a family, and finally, making peace with Iceman.At the beginning of the film we see Pete Mitchell's life, living in a trailer located inside an airplane hanger and waking up everyday to see the photos of the man, Goose, and the family he destroyed through his pride and arrogance. We also see Goose's son Rooster, in a photo of a twenty year old navy cadet (more on this later). All Maverick has in his life is his job as a 60 year old test pilot and who is quickly reaching the end of his usefulness. At work he is informed of the cancellation of the project to break the existing speed record but he nevertheless pushes the team for their, and his, \"last run\". So against orders he not only reaches Mach 10 (a feat never accomplished in real life, the best ever has been Mach 9.4) and with fatalistic glee pushes his ship to it's literal breaking point. The result is expected, the aircraft explodes and the last we see of it is it's disintegration as it plummets to earth in a fiery meteor-type ball, no parachute in sight.Fade to Black (BTW the only Fade to Black in the film)But what's this? A lone man wandering a country highway, helmet still in hand, enters a diner and takes a glass of water and drinks it completely. But he does say \"Hey I just crashed my plane\" or \"Can I use your phone\", no. He s asks, \"Where am I?\"\nWhy?Because he really doesn't know where he is, physically or metaphysically.He is in fact dead.Or rather in Purgatory.Yes, Purgatory, that way-station between Heaven and Earth where the soul goes to purify itself before entering heaven.The next thing we see is Maverick in front of a dried up cadaver-looking like creature played by Ed Harris (Hades' crypt-keeper) who while wanting to drag him off to Hell, informs Maverick that for whatever reason \"God and his Guardian Angel\" have intervene to send him back into his past to Top Gun school. Once there he re-lives many of his past memories. He reconnects with a lover who just happens to be beautiful, single, rich and owns a bar (talk about a male fantasy) and Rooster, who not only looks like his father but actually acts, sings and plays the same tune on the piano. When he leaves the bar he has several flashbacks of his sins and regrets.Maverick's assignment is to train a group of youngsters for a mysterious MacGuffin mission against an unknown and never named adversary. Why the Navy doesn't use more experienced fliers is never explained, but this freshman lot includes such appropriate named cadets as Phoenix (the mythical reborn bird) and Payback (The name of the remade film of Point Blank). The key players though are the aforementioned Rooster, and a cocksure Maverick clone, Hangman. These two represent the ying and yang of Maverick, the cautious and the crazy, the civilized man and the animal, and of course they are antagonists to each other. Their names say it all.What is your first thought of a rooster? A wake up call.What is your first thought of a hangman? Death's executioner\nSo herein lays the struggle for Maverick's soul.On Rooster it should be pointed out, in the original film he is a 4 year old, which would after 36 years, now make him pushing 40. But in this death dream, Maverick is the narrator, so Rooster is still the 20 year old from the photo in his hanger.For that matter, throughout the film, Maverick has his balls pulled out of the fire by either his Guardian Angel represented by Iceman (his multiple insubordinate acts, his destruction of expensive and irreplaceable government property, his reinstatement to the team after stealing an aircraft) or a deus ex machina intercedence (a successful mission preformed with 30 year old technology, evading missiles and later a gating gun equipped helicopter, destroying superior aircraft, stumbling across and escaping in an enemy held F-15 with no security but gassed/armed up and ready to fly). One of the most obvious divine interventions is when Maverick and Rooster having exhausted all methods of evading the enemy in the final dogfight, unable to eject and facing certain death, are saved by Hangman. And what are the first words Hangman says? \"I'm your Savior\"\nYes, praise Jesus, Hangman, you are.In the end, Maverick and Rooster arrive back at the carrier and are welcomed as heroes, like Vikings entering Valhalla. But the curtain has yet to fall until we're back at Mavericks hanger, where he works hand and hand with Rooster (all sins forgiven) and meets up with his new love and her daughter (the family he always wanted). Together they take off into the sunset which in this case is a representation of the light at the end of the tunnel and his final passage to Top Gun Heaven.Unfortunately, the proper coda is missing from this film, and an add-on by the director would be simple. A fade to black after the credits, followed by the image of the burning remains of the hyper-sonic aircraft from the beginning of the film, with a slow close-up to a partially melted helmet with the name Maverick emblazoned across the front.",

I scored that one with eight stars as it was really impressive for the year it came out. When I saw Top Gun Maverick got an even higher score I was really wondering if it could match the first one, let alone being better. Well the verdict has fallen, it's indeed even better. The shots in the air are really impressive. I watched this movie on my television at home, on a pretty big screen, but I can only imagine the sensation watching it in the theater. The story contains some scenes that looked like a copy of the first movie, which was good for the nostalgic amongst us, but the major flying parts, certainly towards the end were different and in all honesty much better. I guess in 2022 we can achieve much more. I don't know the budget for Top Gun Maverick but it must be huge and it shows. As for the acting well let just say that Tom Cruise aged very well, his role as Maverick was really enjoyable to watch. The rest of the cast did a good job too, making this Top Gun movie a movie that will be remembered in the future. If you were a fan of the first one I can only recommend you give this one a go, preferably on a an IMAX screen.",

The first film is unashamedly pure testosterone and is very much a product of it's time which I mean as a compliment. It was simply just fun. This new one by contrast is quite sentimental with how Maverick still mourns the loss of Goose, questions his value in today's society and rekindles a relationship that he knows he took for granted in his younger days. It goes for more serious moments and these are mostly well done, just some of the dialogue is a bit clunky and some of the new characters aren't that developed.Of course where the movie truly shines is in the action and in this area it surpasses the original immensely. They really ramped up the speed and aerial maneuvers performed and it was exhilarating to see on the big screen. There is an action scene at the end which is incredibly over the top and cheesy, but the action is so fun that you can't help getting on board and having a good time with it.I would only rate this lower than the original as I have no detractions from that one. But as most modern movie sequels simply try to cash in on originals and rehash the same ideas, Top Gun Maverick is refreshing in that it honors the original source material and does enough new things to make it a great film on its own merit.",

And he railed against \"the man\", or the admiral in this case who, tried to shut down Maverick, but Maverick always won through by breaking the rules and... uhh so predictable, why bother? Val Kilmer had an exceedingly strange and pointless cameo. There was love interest and a teenager. The teenager did nothing, just kind of appeared said something meaningless and went. It was a long film with very little content. If you absolutely love planes whizzing around then you might find something here. If you want depth, story, three dimensional characters, look elsewhere.

Results in crash of a $ 100 mil plane (your tax money), which could have killed innocents. Even his call name Maverick is unrealistic (along with Iceman, Payback, Phoenix, etc), aviators/pilots are specifically not given cool names. Nor would they want one, as would sound pretentious to their peers (as if they're a Hollywood actor in a role).Central story is predictable soap opera re conflict with son of Goose who died in 1st movie. And seems honestly strange that Maverick's wall is plastered with pics of Goose 26 yrs later. (And Q Tarantino's take on TG's gay overtones coming to mind)Movie - finally - picks up some in last 25 minutes with a decently handled combat mission and escape.

Individuals rarely enter the venue, one epidemic is still there, and secondly, there are not many blockbusters.However, in middle age, although I have not achieved my ambitions, still love high-quality blockbusters.1. I watched the movie three times, two of which I took my son to watch (IMAX and MX4D) together. Before entering the show, I was afraid that the child was still young and did not understand the history of the original drama. Because the focus is on the air battle scene, and the characters have little dialogue, lucky that my son also love it.2. The protagonist's halo made himself survive many hardships, including crashing the aircraft twice and violating military orders, but the audience continued to appreciate it.3. The literary drama and the fighting scene are equally divided, but there is no toilet time, because the character dialogue is short, concise and refined (including the opening sentence of the child~~earth), even the supporting role is very stealthy (Fat Hondo).4. There is actually no heroine in this film (if there is, it must be F18), but they can do a lot of words, explain clearly, and have a clear character. Among them, the heroines Phoneix and Penny's daughter are especially obvious.5. It is recommended to go to MX4D or IMAX, because the air battle scene is real, giving the audience a feeling of being there: the former is constantly changing the seat angle to simulate the fighter seat, and the latter is wide-angle and wide-angle display beyond the normal screen.6. There are many supporting roles, but the characters are vivid and real: Ice, Rooster, Cyclone, Warlock, Hangman have all played their roles, you will always remember that Ice emphasizes friendship, Cyclone is dehumanized, only chasing the target, and every sentence of Warlock is the key point, can't find a nonsense wording...7. The F14 at the end of the film is believed to be a lot of people who will shout when they see it. It is not the memory of the previous episode in the film. Most of them are not able to land on the aircraft carrier when they are playing games, or their mom will turn off the video games when they play halfway...8. If you are not a parent, elder brother or senior, you may not understand why the protagonist often asks his subordinates to come back safe. People die in the war. However, if you have a teammate or a not-so-bad boss, or you are favored by others, you would rather minimize damage, because you don't want to lose a friend.9. Don't want to spoil the show, friends who haven't entered the theater may ask themselves, if 36 years later, would there be another movie like this?",

An advantage this movie has than the first is it has a clear plot with them preparing for a mission and it's simple enough but the story, the acting and the way it's shot is all masterfully crafted to tell the story the best way possible. The whole cast is great in the movie, Tom Cruise of course is great as always and really brings in the action and his skills as being an expert flyer and then Miles Teller wow... he was incredible as the widely known Goose's son he really brought in the emotion and together with Tom he managed to bring in the story with his father and the redemption arc making them closer. I am absolutely obsessed with how this movie looks though. The colours really highlight everything on screen and the way the film is shot in every single scene helps tell the story and elevate it by having emotion with the shot. The cinematographers really work with the actors on this to highlight every little detail and bring the film to life.

Boy oh boy, did this film live up to the hypeTop Gun Maverick is without a doubt the best film I've seen this year. Even if you haven't seen the first movie, guarantee you are still going to have a lot of fun with this. The story is so well written, and everyone acted so well. Everytime the jet sequences were happening, I feel like I'm in the jets and it's putting me on the edge of my seat. Tom Cruise shines as Maverick once again and this time, he's teaching the jet pilots to be the best ever. One more thing, I was crying through half of this film!That's my short review without spoilers. It's an A+ film! Highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Thirty-six years in the making, 'Top Gun: Maverick' has finally arrived after being extensively delayed from its original July 2020 release date. Does this long awaited and highly anticipated sequel soar as high as its predecessor?1. First of all, I rarely ever give films a 10/10 rating, especially action flicks, but this one totally exceeded expectations. In recent years, superheroes and sci-fi fantasy blockbusters have ruled the box-office but the this year the crown goes to Tom Cruise. Not saying this film will break the bank but rather deliver something special that will surely resonate with fans of the original and those witnessing the glory of fighter pilots taking flight for the first time.2. Tom Cruise proves himself a legend above all actors of his generation and present day. He surely has immortalized himself as one of the greats that can never be touched in this lifetime. Cruise carries this film with the same charisma and enthusiasm as he did 36yrs ago. Regardless of the controversy or what people might think of him, his will to perfect his films and the respect he has for art of filmmaking is yet to be rivaled by another actor.3. It is no secret or spoiler that Val Kilmer appears in this film reprising his role as Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky, and despite his disability to speak, it never hinders the emotion he conveys when he's on screen. The new young pilots (who I thought I'd dislike) proved me wrong to the point where I actually felt for them and the dangers they found themselves in while flying. Majority of the weight falls on Miles Teller (Rooster) as he has the most screen time with Tom Cruise, and though their relationship may seem rocky at first, its the thing that truly is the heart of the film.I can go on forever as to how fantastic this film is but there just isn't enough words. I was overwhelmed with joy from start to finish and found myself weeping tears of joy by the last 15mins of this film. 'Top Gun: Maverick' is the definition of why we fall in love with cinema. This movie is special in its own right and has an indescribable uniqueness to it that ultimately warms your heart and makes you want to take flight again and again.",

His interactions with Penny are pure Maverick but also reflect the interactions of a more mature couple. The casting is all around wonderful, with memorable new pilots introduced. The female pilots in particular were handled well, being \"one of the boys\" without being sexualized or turning into Mary Sue's. Nods to the previous movie were integrated smoothly and every detail matters. Iceman was particularly moving. Rooster nails the mannerisms of his late father. The only minor complaint is that Maverick can't beat the original soundtrack, and acknowledges that by using several songs from the original.",

            "review_title": "Awful pacing & overemphasis on nostalgia severely dampen earnest value",
            "content": "I recently rewatched 1986's 'Top gun' for the first time in at least twenty years. I enjoyed it more than I expected, and more than I remembered, but it's not without issues; frankly I think it's distinctly overrated. It struggles with bad pacing, weak narrative development, and mostly unlikable characters, and I also think action sequences are a little disordered as they present. Suffice to say that I've been skeptical of this sequel from the time it was first announced; significant critical acclaim, popular favor, and award nominations have still left me doubtful, and even as I sat to watch I found myself thinking \"I can't wait to hate this.\" I was genuinely hoping to be proven wrong about this highly esteemed blockbuster. I'm confounded, and in some manner frustrated, that I think I was right: this isn't nearly worth its 130 minutes.I've heard other people describe 'Maverick' as purely a \"nostalgia trip,\" and from the start the film does nothing to suggest otherwise. The opening moments are just as tawdrily schlocky as those of the 1986 picture (almost shot for shot at first), and early exposition emphasizes with excruciating exactness that protagonist Pete Mitchell is still protagonist Pete Mitchell. As if it were possible, the editing, direction, and initial plot development are even more overzealous and poorly paced than they were almost 40 years ago. Revisitation of the score from Tony Scott's picture feels overdone and out of place; while I like the original music in concept, even the unique themes to present to us feel like they're being rushed, in the process sometimes killing whatever mood they're supposed to impart. An early callback to a line at the climax of the predecessor is no more convincing here than it was there; later, a new variation on the somewhat infamous volleyball scene comes across as extra cheap, not to mention extremely On The Nose. By the time only twenty minutes have passed almost the entirety of the plot is laid before us - and speaking of \"nostalgia trip,\" the mission that will be at the core of the narrative pulls directly from the first 'Star wars.'I love Jennifer Connelly, but her character's introduction is just about as weak and flimsy as they come, and Penny is written poorly; I altogether feel bad for Connelly, more than I have since Dario Argento's mediocre 'Phenomena' in 1985. That scene in which she first appears - also representing the introduction of most other characters to appear - is written, directed, and acted with such wretched precision, dispelling suspension of disbelief, that I found myself wondering if this wasn't actually a joke. Or were all on hand just taking inspiration from stage plays, and moreover taking that inspiration too far? Uh oh, here comes another Nostalgia Trip as a new character plays a particular song on a bar's piano. None of this is to say that there's no intelligence or cleverness in the writing, or no earnest effort from writers, director, or cast or crew. But as 30 minutes have blitzed past, all that possible value is subsumed by astonishing, aggravating velocity in the film-making and storytelling, and more apparent care for reliving the past than actually telling a story. As if to emphasize the point: I love the soundtrack, filled with classic rock; the sheer number and frequency of classic rock songs to greet our ears is plainly dubious. There are some worthy themes and story ideas broached in passing, including accentuation of the risks of the mission at hand, but they come and go so quickly and with so little active interest from the feature that we'd arguably be better off having not gotten a taste of them at all.Now, as before, action sequences are artificially embellished with curt editing and loose, disjointed cinematography that substitutes flash and bombast for earnest impact and excitement. (At least the course of events in regards to such action is more lucid than it was in 1986.) The romantic element rings even more falsely than it did before; there comes a point where I thought surely the scene playing out before us had to be a flashback, but no, it's the active narrative. 'Maverick' tries its hand at some sincere light humor or heartfelt scene writing, yet for as heedless as the picture launches itself forward at all times, the most honest writing nevertheless struggles to achieve its goal. With all this having been said, I can't say I think very much of the acting. The cast try, bless them. I admit I'm predisposed to liking Connelly, but even in her supporting part I think she might give the strongest performance. I know much as been made of Tom Cruise's portrayal, hailed in some circles as possibly the best of his career; I just don't see it. All the actors' best efforts are all but lost amidst the tiresome rapidity of the proceedings that dampens the drama.I see what this could have been. I recognize the strength in the story of Peter Craig and Jason Marks, and the screenplay of Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie. The plot is compelling in the broad strokes, and the scene writing; in concept the dialogue and characters are ripe for rich storytelling. There are a handful of scenes scattered throughout that meet with substantially more success than the rest of the movie; though still less than perfect, if the whole had been approached with as much attentive mindfulness as such select moments were, this really would be deserving of all its resplendent regard. In concept, the climax is absolutely phenomenal. It's too bad that the pacing is agonizingly forced, if not outright reckless. It's too bad the writing shoehorns in every possible callback that it can, making sure viewers are reminded that this is set in the same universe as Scott's antecedent. It's too bad the writing is actually overfull, weaving in a surfeit of thoughts that mean every component part is both squeezed into a corner and watered down, while almost every character except Maverick himself is essentially just a set piece. It's too bad that one line, whose early repetition is questionable, gets reused again and again throughout; it's too bad action sequences are chopped up as much as they are. This could have far exceeded its forebear in every way; instead, it's no better than on par, and for all the many aspects that raised a skeptical eyebrow at one time or another, I wonder if isn't actually inferior.Factor in transparent boot-licking of the U. S. war machine, no better than the 1986 feature and maybe even worse, and this is a lot to take in - and I'm sad to say, not in a good way. 'Maverick' adopts a much more serious tone, which I think is to its benefit, but otherwise weaknesses in its craftsmanship drag down the result so much that it almost becomes self-parody. I include pretty much the entire last 20-30 minutes, which come across as extraordinarily common - though well done in and of itself, this could be any action flick of the past 50 years - and tacked on such that the film as a whole feels woefully overlong; imagine if the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in 'Return of the king' were extended by another thirty minutes. Was this an ego trip, in addition to being a nostalgia trip? The final action sequence might be the single best part of the title, the one instance when it was firing on all cylinders for at least a time, but by then it's some combination of \"Too Little, Too Late,\" and \"Too Much.\" There is a great deal to admire in 'Maverick' in and of itself; I see the hard work and earnestness that went into it. I also see an overabundance of flaws that weigh upon the end result so heavily that one must actively work to enjoy it.This should have been a genuinely great movie. It should have been fully deserving of all the praise that has been showered upon it. Unfortunately, in pretty much every way it possibly could be, 'Top gun: Maverick' is irritatingly overwrought, significantly diminishing its worth. I can at least say that my impression improved over the course of its runtime - but it was an uphill battle the whole way, at a very steep grade, to even reach the point of saying \"okay.\" Despite everything, I wanted to like this more than I do. I suppose I'm glad for those who get more out of this nostalgia trip than I do, but on that note, maybe it's best recommended only for those who can't get enough of the 1986 movie. Everyone else can probably just move along.",

That is, until he's suddenly plucked to train this year's intake of young fliers to carry out a dangerous bombing mission to take out a uranium plant in an unnamed foreign country. Of course, Mav's first instinct is to aspire to lead the squadron himself but in this he's thwarted, at least for now, by his censorious new C. O. played by John Hamm. Worse yet, amongst the wannabe pilots is the son of his late lamented partner Goose, handily called Rooster, played by Miles Teller and it's no great surprise to witness the simmering tension between the two.After numerous simulated training exercises with his young charges, Maverick has to choose just the select crews who will go on the near suicidal mission. Will Mav get to fly on this, his proclaimed final flying mission, will he win the respect of his not-quite-adoring pupils, will he find love with Jennifer Connelly's old flame bar manager at the airbase and lastly will there be a big man-hug between him and Rooster before the end?Well, you won't need a heat-seeking missile to direct you to how it all turns out, but it certainly does so in an exhilarating and highly entertaining fashion. Bar one new Lady Gaga song over the end-titles, the soundtrack is very much retro-rock comprising The Who, Bowie, T Rex and even Foghat which makes you wonder who locked these prospective fighter-aces up with their dad's record collections.Anyway, there's lots of double-speak technical talk, amazing simulated flying stunts and as you'd expect, tear-jerking catch-ups and look-backs at Iceman (a brave cameo by Val Kilmer) and Goose, with the recreated \"Great Balls Of Fire\" wig-out by his son, under Maverick's detached, baleful gaze.Cruise literally cruises through his part with his million dollar grin and glint never far away, the mostly young talent around him provide strong support and I liked Connelly as the love interest.Never mind that the film makes the viewer complicit in another highly covert U. S. military operation and instead rejoice that nobody dies this time, at least not in action anyway.Somehow I suspect it won't be another 36 years before old Mav flies into the great blue yonder again...",

            "content": "'Top Gun Maverick' is all about its special effects. It's all about putting you in the cockpit with the pilot(s) and allowing you to see what they see, and to some degree, feel what they feel. And the film does this very well. Extraordinarily well, in fact. In fact, in setting up the details of the film's climactic scenes, the screen-writers did an excellent job. We, the viewers have been informed of the steps required for success, and so we know what steps and hazards still lie ahead. It's truly as if we're charged with flying the mission. And so we don't breathe easy until all the steps are completed.So then, Why only seven stars?Here's why.1. One sub-plot (Cruise has to instruct the son of an old colleague of his, a son who blames Cruise for his father's death) is complete melodrama. Making matters worse is the life or death struggle that pairs the two.2. Ed Harris and Jon Hamm play generals who are so 'by the book' that their characters are (a) indistinguishable and (b) robotic. How do you hire an actor as charismatic as Hamm and reduce him to playing an over-starched shirt.3. The Jennifer Connelly romance. Don't get me wrong, I love Jennifer Connelly, and liked her performance. But I needed to be filled in on how she and Cruise's character know one another; what was their relationship over the years preceding this adventure? I'm willing to say, Maybe I missed it. Or, It's explained in the original 'Top Gun'. But maybe not.4. Macho talk in the local bar; half as much would have been more than enough.Anyway, this film is a true 'One of a KInd'. In a good-special-effects way.So go and see it.If you haven't already.",

            "content": "Be aware that the high rating for this movie is purely biased due to the fact that it is a rebooted addition to a nostalgic action hit movie from the 80s. It also took a few years before this movie finally hit theatres, creating a lot of marketing and hype. I myself am even scoring higher because of this, I'll admit.Objectively, it's a pretty basic, non-unique story of making amends and teaching courage. The scenarios in the original were already ridiculous, but this went even more over the top, turning it into a cheesy mess.Also, the weird side story with Peggy and Iceman felt like an after-thought (even though it was nice to see Kilmer given his health circumstances).I suppose, in a way, they were trying to stick to 80s-style screenplay writing with the surface-level characters that have no depth - instead rely on action. However, with today's films and TV shows providing both depth and action, it ends up making Top Gun Maverick look half-assed. Some of the dialogue was also legitimately cringey because of this.The intro was fun in how they tried to mimic the first movie with the set and music. As for the rest of the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer's over-played, gimmicky orchestral music throughout the film pulled away from the authenticity and made it appear tacky - like a lot of today's Hollywood franchises.If you're a millennial or late Gen X looking for some cheesy nostalgia, it's a good film to put on when you're not needing a lot brainpower and want a couple chuckles. If you're new to this franchise, don't think too much into it - you might be left feeling underwhelmed.",

First you get to sit through Tom Cruise's hokey \"commercial\" at the beginning saying he did this for the fans. Was this to rehab his image? He's so creepy.I'm not sure what the problem was with Top Gun: Maverick. Lots of talky drama and Military politics. Blech. You have Jon Hamm playing a meanie admiral bureaucrat the same way he played Don Draper. Hamm shows a serious lack of acting range. The 2nd generation fighter pilots checked all the boxes as expected: the latina, the black guy, the nerd, the arrogant jerk. A few more thrown in for good measure.The first top gun was fresh and new. Perhaps the writers/directors/producers underestimated what needed to be done to make the sequel work? Their audience has since seen 35 years of schlock and formulaic and PC screenplays. What seemed novel in 1986 looks like laziness and boredom and stupidity in 2022.The only stand outs were two ladies. Jennifer Connelly as the Bond girl (I mean, Maverick's girl)...stood out by a mile. I've never understood why she hasn't been in more movies. And Jean Louisa Kelly makes a cameo as Iceman's wife. Both exuded warmth and depth. JLK was on the screen for maybe 3 minutes and she made more impact than any of the fighter pilots who monopolized all the other scenes. (ironically she stole the show in Mr Holland's Opus too. She's been doing it her whole career)Miles Teller isn't a bad actor, but in this movie, he's not likeable. At all. I didn't care about him at all. Goose was the heart and soul of the first movie. His son? The opposite. When you try to center a whole movie around an entitled, cranky, chip-on-his-shoulder son, you have Top Gun: Maverick.The only rewarding part was when Maverick humiliates the baby fighter pilots who think they have nothing to learn. He smashes their GenZ arrogance into a zillion pieces and it was glorious.",

The wait has been nearly 40 years, but they delivered and not by making a cheap sequel, too many of which we have seen in recent years as Hollywood aims for cheap cash grabs.This movie is an emotional roller coaster that is all about respecting and paying homage to the original. In multiple ways it even overtakes the original. The soundtrack and theme song by Lady Gaga is great (though maybe not as cool as the 80s songs), the flying scenes are the highlight of the movie and are just astonishing, making use of the latest technology. And finally Tom Cruise is magnificent in this movie as a middle-aged Top Gun instructor.All in all it is a recreation of the original for modern times, with a heavy dose of nostalgia, beach sport scene and all.The only negatives I see: Everything that is good about this film harks back to the 80s including Tom Cruise. But the younger cast, with the exception of \"Rooster\", is very forgettable. Iceman, Slider, and the others were much more memorable. There are also a couple dull scenes involving discussions between officers that somewhat slows down the movie and could have been done without.To sum up, the highlight of this film are the nostalgia, the soundtrack, and above all the flight scenes. I rarely say this but this film is one of the few that deserves to be watched in the higher-end rooms (Dolby Surround, etc).We sadly do not get 80s quality films from Hollywood often, this is one of them and without a doubt film of the year.

Whilst the flying and action sequences are breathtakingly done, it is the presence of and the performance given by Cruise that holds all this together. Because Cruise has spent so long making impressive action films, his ability to stretch himself on the acting front hasn't been seen much lately. He shows here what a terrific actor he can be, he's subtle, witty and charming and holds this exciting, touching and sometimes quite funny popcorn movie together with great support from a strong supporting cast, including a clearly unwell Val Kilmer. Good stuff and a cinematic treat.PS - You will simply not get the most out of seeing this unless you see it on the biggest screen with the best sound system that you can.",

After 36 years, as I get older, while struggling in life to achieve something that hopefully transcends my generation, seeing Top Cruise on the screen with the same Maverick character trying to achieve the same thing as he struggles in life touched me deeply at a different level. I felt the feeling of getting older while struggling to continue to be the best of the best despite all odds life brings. What Tom Cruise did on the screen to tell the remaining part of Maverick's story literally after 36 years, as he gets older, was no acting, it was real. And that's why this movie is unique and definitely worth watching.",

I often find movies very predictable, but this plot kept me saying 'Oh wow I did NOT see that coming!' throughout the entire movie.

Looking like the ghost of Tony Scott (who directed the first film) & even in the opening title crawl we see Don Simpson's name (he was Jerry Bruckheimer's partner back in the day), who's been dead for more than 25 years, we appear to have never left the world of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, still behind the stick as he's test piloting a new stealth fighter hoping to break that magic Mach 10 speed barrier. No sooner does his superior, played by Ed Harris, steps foot on the base, we know Maverick is up to his old tricks by breaking all the rules in order to win the day. Deemed a success but a failure (he crashes the plane) he's demoted (sideways?), to return to his roots so to speak & become an elite fighter trainer where one of the cadets in his rank turns out to be his old wingman's (Goose, Anthony Edwards) son, Miles Teller, who w/a number of others have been selected to run a treacherous mission to destroy a plant that has nuclear weapons in Mother Russia. Tension brews during the training between Cruise & Teller (over Cruise hindering his career's momentum in order to protect him) w/the outcome of the final mission never in doubt as Cruise's determined pearly whites & ray banned facade assure us all along. Never having been a fan of the original (remembering back in '86 watching it on home video muttering to myself 'I don't get it!\"), but damn, this film does everything right when it was so easy to get wrong. Bringing back Val Kilmer as Iceman was definitely a step in the right direction even though he & Cruise have only one scene together, his presence (& his real life hardships as a throat cancer survivor) looms in the background so large that if the film ended after he & Cruise's tete a tete, I would've been satisfied but even the mission itself is a popper (even though the final movements might be too much icing on the cake).",

He's pushed his superior's buttons for the last time, until high-level intervention gets him recalled to TOPGUN where he's tasked with training a young, elite group of aviators for a critical mission. Just two problems, first: his unique track record and unorthodox methods draw the ire of his new CO, who's blunt about the fact that Mitchell wasn't his top choice to lead the squadron, but second (and much more important): the team includes the son of Mitchell's late best friend/former RIO. Whether you're a big fan of the first one or not, it's hard to deny that more than three decades later this exceeds expectations with spectacular, pulse-pounding action in the air, good music, and an ideal blend of nostalgia and human drama to give it the rah-rah quality that it really needs. Cruise still has the charisma to carry this type of film, and he's aptly supported by a steady group of actors who are ideally suited to their roles. ***",

I knew what to expect from the movie, I knew it'll be incredible and I was 100% correct. The movie Top Gun Maverick is not a movie, it's an experience that can be attained only on the big screen.The awesomeness of fighter planes and the enthralling adrenaline rush a pilot feels while flying these powerful inventions is superbly felt watching the movie. The storyline is not particularly different, or great, it's a simple story with a simple to comprehend mission but extremely complicated to execute which is what makes the whole movie standout. The movie delivers magic and if it took decades to come out with this second instalment, after seeing how good it is, the wait is justified.I would've said this movie is a must-watch but that will be an understatement.

            "content": "Even though I hadn't watched the first Top gun before watching this and missed the first 15 to 20 minutes, this one did not disappoint - was worth every minute and the money.What went well:\n-The problem to solve or Mission was engaging, the flying scenes were exciting and the experience was exhilarating.-Every scene in the movie(of the 2 hours I did not miss) has a purpose and you realize that as the film unfolds. It is crisp, well written and performed.I went for the cinematic experience and trust me, it does not disappoint. Watch it on the big screen and you will love it. Worth every minute.What did not go well:\nThe end was a bit exaggerated. But this was not based on real life and hence the creators did capitalize on taking creative liberty, which at the end was satisfying.Some people may not find this entertaining, may be because of non-familiarity with defense/aviation movies due to related jargons/lingo used. Stating that since the couple beside me left at Intermission and I was shocked. I would not leave this one mid way.Overall, a must watch if you are a Top Gun or Tom Cruise fan. Also, a must watch if you are someone who loves action thrillers, this is a different kind but worth it. If you are enthusiastic about the defense forces, missing this would be a sin! And yes, Must Watch in Theaters for the experience.",

There was hint early in the film that the Tomcat could make an entry. But one couldn't be sure!As a fan who grew up seeing the OG on VCR, DVD multiple times. This was a fitting closure to finally see the TOPGUN on big screen!May Maverick live long enough to make a sequel!!!!",

I'm very critical of movies of the last ten years, so it's all relative when you say this is a good movie. It has elements of it like patriotism, popcorn entertainment, romance, and nostalgia that I loved, but the hyped up reviews by critics are baffling. It's a fun sequel, but it's not great nor better than the first one; there simply is not enough depth and the ending devolves into suspension of disbelief and deux ex machina. Also, there are no songs except for Danger Zone from the original soundtrack. But did I love the thrilling and nostalgic experience? Yes. Was it a happy ending? Yes. Do I think it was worth the price of admission? Yes. Could it have been better? Yes.It's really a solid 6/10 movie, but because it's Top Gun, an 80's classic, and one of the greatest movies ever made (if you were not born before 1980 then you would never know that), I round up my score to:7/10Just have fun and leave your critiquing brain at the door. It's summer popcorn fun just like the original, but just not as good. Part One is simply underrated and greatOne thing that needs to be pointed out to everyone: Tom Cruise is a \"movie star\", not a social media \"attention seeker\", a \"movie reactor\", a \"TikToc star\" or a \"reality TV star\". He earned his fame when talent was required, as well as dedication. For this current (hopefully shortlived, C Eye A controlled world of Dopamine Hit- Vanity Projects of \"wannabe\" fake stars and fake-fame seekers through the Federal Government controlled social media narcissistic attention seekers) moment, Cruise got famous when \"talent\", true talent was required. And yet, he never would've gotten famous today because it's not about real talent, but vapid narcissistic attention seeking losers.",

I believe that is the point of this whole film.One of the prominent nitpicks I have, because I'm not a fan of happy go lucky films, is that the mission should be impossible to accomplish even for an elite fighter pilot. It's only possible because Maverick is too talented for his own good, and throughout the whole film he is risking the safety of every normal and sane person besides him because he mistakenly believes, if he could do it, everyone else can. Not to mention, he has a strong plot armor that prevents him from dying after crashes, that takes away the tension and adds predictability to the plot.This is a film made for a broad audience because of its simplicity and action packed entertainment.I like that part, it's beautifully shot, but I doubt I will rewatch it for the story and characters.",

This movie is simply telling a story. There is no female army officer putting the toxic white male into his place. There is no female pilot (of color) which is the bestest ever and puts all the toxic white males into their place. This movie simply has characters and they just happen to be male, female, black, white etc. This movie was absolutely refreshing to watch, which is weird since everything you see isn't new at all. It just stands out in today's political climate. This movie was made for the fans and for people who don't want to get lectured in their entertainment. I'm not interested in army stuff, I don't care about jets or war or any of this stuff, but I really enjoyed this movie and I applaud this movie for just being a movie. Well done!

No one believes the phony-tough persona of Tom Cruise as a military man because he has never been in the military; that is fairly obvious from his behavior. We quickly get bored by his life and death struggles with one challenge after another that he miraculously escapes from. It doesn't work that way in real life.

If ever there was a reason to see a film in IMAX this is it: the stunts, aerial combat scenes and cinematography are undoubtedly impressive, more so I think than Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk.Everything is bigger and louder for sure but Maverick still retains the heart, emotion, thrills and feel-good spirit of the original whilst being superior to that film in every way possible. All of the characters are likeable, too, and there's also a touching cameo with Val Kilmer's Iceman.I've seen this three times now and I cannot recommend seeing it enough.

Half the soundtrack, half the cast, his bike and jacket, hell they even have scenes from the original in there and a pseudo beach \"volleyball\" scene of it's own.But there are only so many ways to take a film like Top Gun and make a sequel work, either you create an entirely new vision and story and risk alienating the original fans or you go the other way and make a Top Gun movie.The reason this works well as a sequel is because it very knowingly gives the same thrills and humour from the original. As far as the flying and actions scenes go, they are considerably better than the original due to the advances in technology and film making. Tom Cruise is still fantastic in the role as Maverick, Glen Powell as Hangman was an excellent choice to be the cocky rival, at times playing an inbetween version of Maverick and Iceman. He certainly wouldn't have been out of place among the original members.My only real gripe with this sequel is that it is a little too heavy with the callback and memory of Goose in the front end. While i'm sure younger audiences might not have known the character, they overplayed it a bit especially when Iceman is in the movie and has his own story within it which is a little glossed over by comparison.But in the end, the climax of the film and performance from Miles Teller as Rooster does win you over.",

Honestly it feels like we've had nothing but hot muddy puddle water to drink and Maverick comes along and it feels like pure mountain filtered water and ice cubes.Anyway enough of the state of entertainment. This film is just fun to watch. The world and it's characters feel firmly planted. It's the flight sequences that really standout, going that extra mile to film these away from some greenscreen sound stage really comes across on screen. Quite the visceral experience to watch, the cinematography here certainly warrants an extra star.Some parts of the film just seem a bit over the top and too far fetched. In most, that's the earlier part of the film with the super jet Maverick is flying.You already know what kind of film you're going in to watch and it doesn't disappoint. You're not going to get any dramatic plot twists or character revelations, the story is your fairly typical popcorn-movie plot but it's all done and shot superbly.",

            "content": "In my opinion, this movie is definitely better than the first movie, but I did notice that the story for this movie is eerily similar to that of the first. What I mean by this is that the movie might not be a shot-for-shot remake of the first, but upon close inspection, the story is beat for beat the same. The movie throws in some new stuff and changes a few things to try and cover this up and it does work to some extent but once you catch on to the similarities between the two it's hard to ignore. Despite the story being beat for beat the same the story for this movie is far from lacking and is an enjoyable one. Another element of the movie that helped make this movie enjoyable was the cinematography. Knowing that pretty much all of this movie was done practically, all thanks to Tom Cruise, helped the cinematography out a lot by having everything be natural which helps the viewers feel like they're a fly on the wall. The sound design for this movie is another element that helps bring the audience along for the ride. I can only guess that most of the sound design for this movie was filmed and recorded live, but even the non-diegetic sound helped the story out. The final element of this movie that hooks the audience and brings them in for this ride is the acting. All of the actors in this movie are giving it their all in their roles and making these people feel like real people. The standout performances for me were Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, who plays Iceman, Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, and Glen Powell, who plays Hangman. In the end, Top Gun: Maverick takes what made the first one iconic and improves on it for a more modern audience. I just wish they included, \"Danger Zone\".",

This sequel does an excellent job of giving its original fans what we wanted.It has a large number of great callbacks to the original, including an entire romance with a character that was only mentioned in the 86' version. It leans heavily into the aftermath of Goose's passing, so much so that it almost feels like he is still here with us. The action is fantastic, with the best flight scenes that have ever been filmed. Although the plot is not something that writes very far outside the typical lines, it does show character development, explores the human reaction to loss, and contains a cohesive story that ties the old and new movies together believably. The acting from nearly everyone who is over 30 is great, particularly from Cruise and Connelly.The negatives: 1) It would have been better to get a re-make of Danger Zone rather than a new original from Lady Gaga - her song feels out of place. 2) The new pilots' acting, outside of Rooster and Hangman, feels forced and generic; more subtlety would have gone a long way. 3) Jon Hamm seems to play the same character in each project he is in, and this character should have been made more 3-dimensional rather than being so angrily flat. 4) The writing could have found a few more opportunities to inject humor into its scenes, as that was a heavier staple of the original.",

Wings also won Best Effects for\nits spectacular aerial shots which were choreographed using 60 planes and 3,500 extras . Why I mention the movie Wings is that unlike Top Gun Maverick that movie showed the brutality of War and its power to destroy lives as we see only to clearly in every news report today.Top Gun Maverick has no message at all and doesn't attempt any it's all about perceived American Global Superiority, testosterone and super achievement .In fact I found it interesting that not once in the entire movie do we find out who the enemy is just that it's America fighting a rogue State much like StarWars or any Science Fiction movie with the emphasis on fiction.Top Gun Maverick is entertaining and the aerial fighter scenes are certainly spectacular . Tom Cruise now 59 definitely doesn't look his age his and I give him top marks as I'm sure he is the main reason this movie succeeds .A accomplished pilot himself he insisted on only minimal green screen and CGI aerial shots and personally designed a 3 month aviation course for the actors to become ready to handle riding an F-18 aircraft.Miles Teller who just recently impressed me in the series The Offer as Godfather producer Albert S. Ruddy. Plays a major role in Top Gun Maverick as Lt. Bradley 'Rooster' and is very impressive in this role also.He was reported as saying that 3 of the 6 new Top Gun actors threw up every day of filming.The testosterone certainly flows on the beach in the shirtless football scene which Tom Cruise insisted be reshot after the actors had been on a night out on milkshakes and fry's . He didn't think they looked ripped enough so they all were ordered back to the gym then the scene was shot again.Top Gun Maverick is certainly great escapist entertainment spectacularly filmed with a good script and cast . The audience can see where the estimated 170 million USDollars were spent and the film has already made 886 million USDollars so it's a huge box office hit World Wide.I must say though Tom Cruise these days to me seems more like an avatar from a video game however he deserves top marks for his dedication to Top Gun Maverick.",

I hadn't watched the first movie, but this one fills in all the required information you need: Maverick used to fly with Goose, who's dead, and now Goose's son, Rooster, is in Maverick's new class. Meanwhile, another old buddy of Maverick's, Iceman, is very ill (to fit along with actor Val Kilmer's inability to speak due to throat cancer). The movie was entertaining and full of good action and not lacking in stakes and conflict. However, I do feel this movie may have been slightly overhyped, with many people calling it the best movie of 2022. Despite that, it's definitely worth watching!",

In order to get the most out of the movie, I saw the original Top Gun before going to the theater. You don't have to do it that way, as the film makes it very easy to follow for those who did not watch the original.Tom Cruise (Maverick) is a Maverick, not just his call sign, but his flying is very unorthodox yet brilliantly effective. That unorthodox style of flying from the original movie is exactly what the navy needs to succeed in this more modern yet dangerous mission, which is the main climax the movie leads up to. I found that whole premise to be fascinating. Miles Teller (Rooster) got a lot of attention for his beach scene, but he does an excellent job at his portrayal of Rooster, the son of Goose, who died in the original Top Gun in an accident involving Maverick. The dynamic between the two characters is made clear, as well as their conflict with one another being understandable on both sides. Maverick being tasked to prepare the pilots for this mission made for some hilarious and entertaining flight scenes before the climax. The mission itself had me on the edge of my seat. I found the ending to be more \"satisfying\" than \"predictable\" (some reviews say). Overall, I was happy to see it in theaters. I did not plan to ever see this movie, but I am really glad I did._____________________Side Note: This movie doesn't have any obvious \"woke\" elements in its story.

This is without a doubt the best film of the year and is a tour de force for one of Hollywood's all time greats.

The odd white guy, the white jerk, over macho female character and fill in the blank other blank characters, (I thought oh no preachy non relatable movie characters) but Maverick got out the tail spin with believable/likeable characters. Maverick has believable characters, with Pete being the test piolet push the envelope guy with personal demons. Gooses son is a tribute and a crux of the story a younger Mitchel character from the last movie. Hangman is the new Ice character. The gamer which make us understand the new skills of a modern military with the calming ebb and flow of the rest of the characters for the military machine. There is a recruiting part with all the new state of the art air craft, which mixes with a star wars story line. But un like Star Wars there is a few good plot twist with homages from the old Top Gun and a homage to Iceman. I left Maverick actually feeling good, with out having a woke or Hollywood formulated movie hang over. Well directed, written, and original script. 8 stars, best summer movie so far!",

Thinking about it made me wonder if all the gay jokes about navy within other branches have started with the original top gun movie. Back to this one - it's also mawkish at parts in the same way. Also there is too much crying and unnecessary drama by old looking yet too polished characters (actually everything that they show on the ground is too polished).HOWEVER, as I said before all of that doesn't matter the moments the mission in the movie starts. The mission the dog fights, all the shots in the sky are so damn good, totally delivers!I will get this movie on video edit and cut out all the fly material and save it that way to rewatch, and then it's a strong 10 star )))\nSo if you late to theater for the first 30 minutes of top gun I don't miss anything.

I love the fact that it not only had action but it had a great story and then we knew Penny Benjamin was in this one and you got to know more about her and Mavericks relationship. I just love this movie and I hope they keep going with it because I heard that they were talking about it and I hope Tom Cruise does agree to keep going with it cuz they are destroying at the box office and they are the most successful movie by far this year even in the last few years.",

The rest of this cast are truly remarkable and totally believable in this world. Miles Teller goes an extra mile with convincing the audience that he truly is \"Goose's son\" I thought that the story was masterful and the action and flying, although sometimes seems at little inaccurate, THRILLING.

The flight scenes are quite thrilling, with the cinematography and high level of production making you feel the tension and danger of flight in such high speed jets. The actors do a good job generally, although nothing spectacular in my opinion. The plot is certainly lacking with the climax and conflict revolving around personal issues in the characters histories that I did not find appealing. The movie has a normal highly expected happy ending where everyone lives despite the odds. All of that can be excused as the movie is simply fun to watch, with a few laughs and thrills along the way. It is quite refreshing as well to see the bad guys as 'a rogue state' developing atomic capabilities without highlighting them as Muslim terrorists, Russian spies or foreign gangs of some kind. However the movie is lacking in terms of political or social message and has no real depth or substance beyond the entertainment.",

            "content": "This was the most exhilarating theatrical experience I'd ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Top Gun: Maverick outdoes Top Gun in every conceivable way, and is the single best legacy sequel of all time, bar none.The premise revolves around an aging Maverick, who is called yet again to instruct new recruits at Top Gun.Joseph Kosinski does a masterful job of directing this movie. He puts in just enough elements of the original to retain adequate nostalgia, but not too much so as to overpower the potence of the sequel. A lot of legacy sequels like Ghostbusters: Afterlife and The Matrix Resurrections make the deplorable mistake of adding way too much callbacks and references to the previous movies; so much so that the sequel itself feels more like a lazy rehash than a worthy continuation and/or conclusion. The movie corrects many of the original's problems, with a more grounded premise and graver performances. Fighter Weapons School finally feels like an actual military academy rather than a mere high school for adrenaline junkies.Tom Cruise is quite literally the greatest movie star of all time. He's starred in classics since he was in his 20s and is STILL pumping out his best stuff, as proven by this movie alone. I love how his character of Pete Mitchell has expectedly grown more nuanced and complex over the last 30+ years. He appears tortured by events from the first movie, and his dynamic with Bradley Bradshaw (cast and played excellently by Miles Teller) is undoubtedly the film's most riveting aspect.Jennifer Connelly has an astonishing amount of chemistry with Cruise, and I don't think people give their on-screen relationship enough credit. Once again, the childish romance from the original was greatly improved upon, with a moderately approached but genuinely heartfelt new relationship. I love the way Val Kilmer reprised his role as Iceman, and the few short scenes he was in did the actor justice and gave his character a truly beautiful role to play.The filmmakers somehow succeeded in making the new recruits to Top Gun interesting characters by themselves, instead of just cloning the original movie's cast. Monica Barbaro, Lewis Pullman and Jay Ellis all give distinguished performances, and so does Glen Powell (even though he's technically this sequel's version of a young Iceman). Other pedigreed actors like Jon Hamm and Ed Harris, and lesser known ones like Charles Parnell all play their characters in memorable fashion.Maverick is also absolutely hilarious, and I can probably remember about 15 times when the audience around me burst into hysterical laughter (including myself, no doubt). The dialogue is unexpectedly smart, the jokes feel anything but forced, and the scenes of humour are so well set-up that they never feel manufactured or out of place.But of course, what really sets this movie apart from and above other legacy sequels is its brilliant writing. The screenplay packs so much emotional punch and payoff that it's virtually impossible to unpack all of it even in a single spoiler review. The callbacks and moments of nostalgia are never in there for the sake of it, and strictly serve the plot. Every single narrative decision made for this film was perfect, with a believable and realistic story that is unexpectedly mature and thus way more engaging.With all that out of the way, it wouldn't be a proper Top Gun review if you didn't talk about the action. And Jesus Christ does this film have some of the most astoundingly intense and mind-bogglingly entertaining action sequences in film history. Seriously, the final act alone is on par with any of the recent Mission: Impossible movies (also starrimg Cruise), and even Mad Max: Fury Road.Maverick veritably dethrones the original movie's all time greatest aerial fight scenes with even better ones. The cinematography, visual effects, editing and soul-shattering sound design during the training and dogfight sequences is so incredible it can barely be put into words. Some segments of this film were so edge-of-your-seat thrilling that I'm surprised no one (especially me) got a heart attack or at the very least, passed out.The end product is so well presented, it's rather difficult to pinpoint where the CGI ends and Tom Cruise's stuntwork begins (although, knowing him, I'm willing to bet he played his part in some of the stunning aircraft-mounted shots).On top of that, the production of the non-action scenes was done well too, just like in the original. I certainly enjoyed the restrained use of the first films music and score, incorporating some pretty good original songs like \"I Ain't Worried\" by OneRepublic and Lady Gaga's spectacular \"Hold My Hand\".Top Gun: Maverick exceeded all expectations by a light year and a half. It is the type of legacy sequel every classic blockbuster deserves, and the monumental sendoff all legacy sequels aspire to become.And if it isn't also one of the century's best action movies, then I have no idea what is.Edit: So apparently none of the flight sequences used green screen, and the actors went through flight training to film all those insane shots practically. Can I love this movie any more?!",

            "content": "Ok, there are many elements that go into a movie. A great movie can be weak in certain areas if it is exceptional in others. What we, the viewer, look for in a movie is highly personal and subjective. Objectively Top Gun Maverick has the most amazing jet fighter action scenes ever filmed. The combination of incredible cinematography, tight editing and bombastic sound effects make these jet fighter action scenes absolutely visceral and riveting. The scene where Maverick successfully completes the near impossible training run in his F18E was among the best 10 minutes of cinema I have ever seen. I was totally gripped in my cinema seat. For this scene alone I give the movie 10 stars. Whilst I am sure some CGI was used in places (particularly the fictional Mach 10 spy plane in the opening scene), a large majority of what you see is real footage, either in cockpit, from aeriel vantage points, or land vantage points. Tom Cruise is great, again. The rest of the cast is very strong. The story is entirely predictable, but with a clear direction and purpose, and serves to move the movie from one incredible action scene to the next but with meaning. The characters are a little 2D, but have sensible arcs and growth that increase emotional investment. The original movie had great action scenes with iconically cheesy dialogue and beautiful cinematography and great direction. Top Gun Maverick has less cheesy and less memorable dialogue but still very humerous in places, beautiful cinematography throughout, INCREDIBLE action scenes and tight direction. Both movies blend a lot of fantasy with reality, but they are movies, not documentaries, so that's fine by me. Anyway, if you are remotely interested in the idea of a navy jet fighter action movie, watch this movie on IMAX. It will blow you away. Watching this movie was one of the most memorable and enthralling cinema experiences I have ever had. I can't even tell you what the run time was, it seemed like 5 minutes as the movie just flew by (pun intended).",

I've never really been one of the die hard fans of top gun but I thought it was a fun watch with some memorable moments. And I enjoyed this sequel just as much. If you're a top gun fan, you're probably going to love this. Though, I don't think it is as much of it's own movie, it does a good job tributing and celebrating the 1987 Top Gun.I like the direction. Action-wise, this feels like a modernized top gun. While there is more use of CGI, the shots are wider and you get a clearer view of the dogfight scenes. I also found the final mission and the environment pretty cool. I liked most of the characters but some of them are just there for you to forget, and some feel like exact replacements from the original. There were also plenty of jokes and it's a fairly light-hearted and fun movie, which I didn't expect. Tom Cruise is, well tom cruise, and that's enough. The rest of the actors did a good enough job too.I loved the first half. It felt fresh and I loved the direction it was heading. The second half goes pretty much exactly as you would have thought, which was a bit disappointing. Though the second half has some great action scenes and crowd cheering moments, it's also predictable. And the final act has many similarities to the original. Like there are scenarios that felt exactly like certain scenes in top gun. The story in the second half is very similar to the original. That, I thought, could have been better.But in the end I walked out happy. I enjoyed this movie and I can understand the hype. If, even after 35 years, you get a sequel of your favourite movie, it would certainly be a special feeling.",

All the new characters are fun and the story line is so simple but it works great.I wasn't a huge fan of the opening scene where Tom Cruise hits mach 10, but the rest of the movie was super enjoyable. My favorite scene had to be where Maverick proves that their sequence can be done and does it in 2:15 cementing his pilot dominance.The final mission was a great mix of intense and satisfying when you see all the moving parts coming together that we saw during the training montages and scenes. I especially liked the Rooster and Maverick dynamic there at the end of the movie.No politics or unnecessary messages. Just a simple story with awesome shots of F18's and a cool mission.Really my only gripe was the first scene, it wasn't horrible or anything. It just felt a little out of place maybe?9/10.",

            "content": "As any avid cinephile will tell you, a film's original score or theme song has the power to ground that film into a classic. Top Gun from 1986 has this distinction, not just from making that film a classic, but because the theme song went on to be called Top Gun Anthem. It starts with the synthesised but faint chime of a church bell, before the melody escalates into a crescendo of 80s instrumental rock music. As symbolic as it sounds, the church bell here is a dual tone for both grief and glory.Calling Maverick a sequel would only be half-truth. From the moment you hear that synth church bell in the opening sequence, you feel like the last 30 odd years didn't happen. It even begins with a frame-by-frame recreation of the original film's iconic intro on the decks of an aircraft carrier. We see the silhouettes of navy personnel dispatching and receiving warplanes against a low-lit but vivid sky, followed by a familiar text caption explaining the US Navy's weapons school programme. This sequence is more than just the cool beginning of Top Gun: Maverick, this is the start of an instantly familiar feeling that will immerse you into nostalgia for over 80 percent of the film's running time.Making this umbilical connection to such a beloved film in the first few minutes, especially after 35 years, is both risky and rewarding at the same time. Part of that nostalgia also includes flimsy one-liners and corny jokes among characters, but also a half-baked and implausible story. And part of that is an inside joke as to why Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is still Captain, while most of his colleagues are either top brass or have retired. Only Tom Cruise can answer that question with the cocky recklessness but Godlike flying skills of the legendary Maverick. Which is why Maverick has to now train a bunch of cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me navy pilots for a daring mission that is pure suicide. Although the \"enemy\" country is never mentioned, encountering a Mi-24 SuperHind and fifth generation MiGs during the mission tells us the objective is in Ivan's backyard. But sending navy pilots without hardened combat experience in last generation F/A-18 Hornets against the aforementioned enemy, in a mission impossible mission, is like taking a knife to a gun fight. Implausible narrative silliness, but who cares, right?Then comes the remaining 20 percent with fresh content - grief and glory, and a lot of closure. One of the advantages of such a long gap after the first film, is that screenwriters can now fill in the blanks. One is the introduction of \"Rooster\", son of \"Goose\", who Maverick lost to an accident in the first film. Prepare for some emotive tantrums and chip-off-the-shoulder baggage between Maverick and Rooster (Miles Teller). The other is probably the most genuine, bitter-sweet, heart-breaking moment in the entire film and easily the best, and this is when Maverick visits and old friend - Iceman. I won't say anymore. Glory is reserved for the last 30 odd minutes and it's a high octane adrenaline rush for the audience as well as Maverick and his team. Even if it's big bucks CGI, it just feels real. Unlike recent blockbusters with mind-numbing visual effects and eye-popping camera angles (looking at you Marvel movies), Top Gun: Maverick has some of the best white-knuckle air combat displays ever seen in a film, and it all feels real. Tom's cruising charisma does the rest. All you have to do is sit back, buckle up and enjoy your supersonic flight with 100 percent fan service.",

Because as we said, Tom Cruise is the main role in this movie and acts as an avatar. Watching this fascinating movie is like watching 37 episodes of Silicon Valley at once without even getting up from the couch. But are such films really needed? Another issue that must be considered in the Top Gun Maverick movie review is its direction. This movie was directed by Joseph Koshinsky and managed to show the invasion very well. This famous and successful director has also directed the movie Tron: Legacy and has a brilliant record in this field. For this reason, the making of such an attractive film by this director does not seem so strange. Some people think that Tom Cruise might not be able to play this role well; Because his age has increased and naturally he cannot be attractive and clever like when he was young. However, what we observe is the opposite of this. Even though Tom Cruise is approaching 60 years old, he is still as smart, charming and intelligent as the boy he was in the 1980s, and he manages to present himself as a skilled person.",

I'm glad I watched the original first, despite really not enjoying it, because otherwise so much of Maverick's nods would've been completely lost on me, but Maverick stands in its own right as a solid action movie. This is some of the best dogfighting ever caught on camera. The authenticity of every shot is through the roof and goes a long way to really selling the intensity. Top Gun sought to put the audience in the cockpit with the pilots, Maverick actually does while also capturing some breathtaking stuntwork at the same time. They could've built a mock cockpit in a studio in front of a green screen and filmed the actors normally and CGI'd the planes in the sky, but then they'd be missing the real effect of those Gs on the actors faces, they'd be missing the palpability of flight at those speeds, they'd be missing all the little imperfections impossible to recreate. Tom Cruise deserves all the praise for this movie's monumental success, financially, critically, and artistically. He offers that which action movies have been sorely lacking for decades - authenticity. While I'm not quite at the point where I'd put it on the same pedestal as Fallout or Fury Road, it definitely has a strong claim. I give Top Gun: Maverick an edge-of-your-seat 8/10. This is definitely a movie I could see myself rewatching before the end of the year.QyrosMovies.",

            "content": "The original movie was a huge hit in its day, and a sequel had apparently been on the cards for several years, but it was held up by the tragic suicide of original director Tony Scott, and later by the COVID-19 pandemic, so I was hoping this highly anticipated follow-up would be worth the wait, directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy, Oblivion). Basically, over thirty years since the previous events, Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise, also producing) has avoided promotion and continues serving and flying as a U. S. Navy test pilot. Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain (Ed Harris) is threatening to shut down the hypersonic \"Darkstar\" scramjet program to fund other drone programs. Maverick decides to take the Darkstar prototype and reach its Mach 10 speed objective before Cain shows up. Cain arrives just as Maverick takes off, and he watches as he does the objective. But Maverick cannot help himself and decides to push further into high-hypersonic speed, resulting in the destruction of the prototype. Maverick survives the crash and is threatened to be grounded by Cain for his recklessness. But instead, he is sent to NAS (Naval Air Station) North Island, back to Naval Fighter Weapons School, better known as TOPGUN, to be an instructor, under the orders of Maverick's friend and former rival, Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), the commander of the U. S. Pacific Fleet. Maverick is ordered to train a group of elite pilots assembled by Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson (Jon Hamm) and Rear Admiral Solomon \"Warlock\" Bates (Charles Parnell). The pilots will be trained to fly Super Hornet for an urgent mission: to bomb a uranium plant in an unnamed rogue state that is considered a threat to the United States by The Pentagon. The plant is located deep in a mountain pit at the end of a canyon and is defended by numerous air missile defence systems and a base filled with fifth-generation fighters. Maverick plans an attack with two pairs of Super Hornets, which will fly through a canyon and destroy the plant, while also exceeding the Hornet's limits. Maverick is initially rebuffed by the pilots, particularly by the self-confident Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin (Glen Powell) and by Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Whiplash's Miles Teller), the son of Maverick's late best friend of co-pilot Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. As the pilots train for the mission, friction develops between Hangman and Rooster, who resents Hangman's cavalier attitude towards his wingmen, while Hangman criticises Rooster being cautious. As the pilots observe Maverick's skill, they reassess and begin to respect him. Meanwhile, Maverick reunites with former love interest Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who reveals that Rooster's now-dead mother Carole made him promise to keep her son from flying. It turns out that Maverick blocked Rooster's application to the Naval Academy, setting back his career for a few years, hence why he had a disdain for him. Maverick later meets with Iceman, who has throat cancer and communicates by typing on his computer. He reassures Maverick about teaching the pilots and says he needs to let go of any guilt he has for Goose's death. Iceman loses his battle with cancer and passes away days later, with Maverick and the pilots attend his funeral. With Iceman gone, Cyclone removes Maverick as mission trainer. He takes over the training of the mission, setting new parameters with a less risky route to the uranium plant but would mean more chance of being spotted on approach. However, Maverick makes an unauthorised flight of the simulated course with the original parameters he planned, with a demonstration of the targeted bombing, and proves that it can be done. Cyclone is convinced, and reluctantly appoints Maverick as strike leader. Maverick chooses the mission pilots and is paired with Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace (Monica Barbaro) and her WSO (Weapon Systems Officer) Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd (Lewis Pullman, Bill's son), while Rooster is paired with Lieutenant Reuben \"Payback\" Fitch (Jay Ellis) and his WSO Lieutenant Mickey \"Fanboy\" Garcia (Danny Ramirez). Hangman and the remaining pilots are put on standby. The team launches from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt while the cruiser USS Leyte Gulf fires Tomahawk cruise missiles to destroy the air base near the plant. The team reaches the plant and following the planned route and successfully destroy it. But the team are attacked by surface-to-air missiles and a pair of patrolling Su-57 fighters. When Rooster runs into trouble, Maverick sacrifices his jet to protect him and ejects. Maverick is believed to be killed in action, so the remaining aircraft return to the carrier. Against orders, Rooster turns back to rescue Maverick from an Mi-24 helicopter gunship. He is shot down by another surface-to-air missile and ejects nearby. The two reunite and head towards the destroyed airbase hoping to find an aircraft that has survived the bombing. They find and steal an old F-14 Tomcat and head back to the carrier. Maverick and Rooster shoot down two intercepting Su-57s, but a third arrives as they run out of weapons and countermeasures. The third Su-57 is shot down by Hangman arrives from standby, and the planes return to the carrier, with everyone praising them, and Maverick and Rooster reconcile. Sometime after the mission, Maverick and Rooster work together on a P-51 Mustang at a hangar near the test facility where Maverick was previously stationed. Penny arrives with her teenage daughter Amelia (Lyliana Wray), and Maverick takes her for a ride in the aircraft. Rooster walks to a photo board and acknowledges a photo of their mission's success, alongside a photo of his late father and a younger Maverick. Also starring Greg Tarzan Davis as Lieutenant Javy \"Coyote\" Machado, Jean Louisa Kelly as Sarah Kazansky, Iceman's wife, Bashir Salahuddin as Chief Warrant Officer 4 Bernie \"Hondo\" Coleman, Manny Jacinto as Lieutenant Billy \"Fritz\" Avalone, Jake Picking as Lieutenant Brigham \"Harvard\" Lennox, Raymond Lee as Lieutenant Logan \"Yale\" Lee, and Kara Wang as Lieutenant Callie \"Halo\" Bassett. Cruise still looks good and remains likeable as the rebellious pilot turned trainer, Teller is cast well as Goose's grown-up son who wants to go all the way, Connelly is alright as the new girlfriend (Kelly McGillis was apparently not approached to return), the other supporting pilot characters are all cast well, and despite his poor health it is good to see Kilmer back. The original is perhaps a little dated and cheesy at times, the only faults I could find with this follow-up was the romantic element being less interesting and the silly return of the highly gay topless beach volleyball scene. This sequel is much more sophisticated, with a much concrete story, the mid-air dogfights and high-speed flying sequences are highly exciting, with many genuine cockpit shots, and the soundtrack included the return of composer Harold Faltermeyer, joined by Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga, the return of \"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins, and new song \"Hold My Hand\" by Lady Gaga, I think it is better than the original, a thrilling action drama.

            "content": "1986's 'Top Gun' is an iconic, bombastic 1980's film that seemed to inhabit exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Over 35 years later a sequel to that film finally emerges after being tossed around in Hollywood for the better part of ten years. This film has Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell as well as Val Kilmer returning as Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky. There are numerous new additions to the cast including Miles Teller, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly and Jon Hamm among others. Joseph Kosinski directs and while he hasn't had a plethora of directorial experience he did work with Cruise before on the film 'Oblivion' and as history has shown us Cruise tends to enjoy working with the same collaborators. Originally scheduled to be released in July of 2019 the 'Top Gun' sequel become one of the longest delayed films primarily due to Covid-19, but there were also production challenges. The film finally opened in May 2022 to widespread acclaim from both fans as well as critics.The action in this film swirls inexorably around Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell. While his contemporaries are long gone or Admirals by now he has remained a Captain in order to keep himself a pilot which is all he really wants to do. At the film's outset he is out in the Mojave desert working as a test pilot on project \"Darkstar\" which is designed to take manned flight to mach 10. An admiral arrives played by Ed Harris to shut the project down, but instead of being forced out of the Navy Maverick is ordered back to Top Gun school in Miramar, CA to be a special instructor. The Navy has assembled a best of the best of recent Top Gun classes for a specialized combat mission, and thanks to the events of the first film, Maverick is one of the only pilots to engage the enemy and therefore is deemed an appropriate person to train the mission. While most of the Navy seems to hate Maverick Iceman maintains an affinity for him and has been able to ensure he stays gainfully employed by the Navy all these years as he has attained the rank of Admiral and serves as Commander of the US Pacific Fleet thereby in a perfect position to be a guardian angel for Maverick. Among the crop recruits is Lt. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw, played by Miles Teller, who is Goose's son who tragically died in the first movie. He bears a grudge against Maverick not only for the death of his father, but Maverick blocked Bradshaw's ability to enter the Naval Academy delaying his career. We get more than a few sequences learning this new crop of pilots, and as always there is an overly jerky one called Hangman played by Glen Powell. The mission they are set to fly seems impossible until in a last ditch brash move Maverick flies the course and in the process becomes the team leader of the mission as if no one saw that coming. The last portion of the film is the mission itself which could have gone a few ways, but in the end 'Top Gun: Maverick' takes about the most basic and obvious path they can with Maverick saving the day as well as Rooster, and everyone lives to tell the tale and even the royal pain in the ass 'Hangman' has a redemptive moment before they all live happily ever after. Maverick and Rooster make amends and bond, while Mav also has a love interest that solidifies over the course of the story.This film is quite good. First and foremost of note are the exceptional plane sequences that look amazing on a premium movie screen. Those sequences alone are worth the price of admission. This film has had universal praise heaped upon it, but the story itself is not without its flaws or at least some questionable plot decisions. I loved seeing Kilmer back as an Admiral and it made sense that he could have been a guiding and sheltering benefactor for Maverick over the years. It was not difficult to see that character's death coming in the story yet it still resonated. What surprised me is that it was the only character death in the story. I felt the whole mission lost a little something by not having at least one of planes and its crew go down. The film enters a bit more of the action hero genre at that point rather than a more rational, realistic narrative. I was fine with most of the nostalgic throwbacks they tossed in the film, however, one I couldn't get behind, and it is small and perhaps petty I admit, but having Goose's son play 'Great Balls of Fire' in the bar was too far. It was enough he was playing the piano and had the glasses, but with no explanation it is incredibly farfetched to think he would be playing that exact song, and it just bothered me. Also when we are introduced to Maverick we see his little shrine to his lost partner which makes sense, but there is nothing else? You are telling me in an almost 40 year career he hasn't had anything else meriting remembrance? It is like the film picks up all that time later, but the character has just treaded water for 35 years which is simply not plausible, but it is done that way because it makes it convenient and easy to tell. Compounding on this is the whole love interest angle which is my biggest problem and the movie's biggest flaw. At the end of the first film it seemed like 'Maverick' and 'Charlie' were going to be a happily ever after couple. All that time has passed and she is gone as Maverick returns to Miramar and finds off again on again love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, who I believe is supposed to be the admiral's daughter from the story in the first film. I understand the want for nostalgia but this story element is unnecessary and is just nostalgic pandering. It didn't really serve the characters and was only done for a rapt audience to go, \"Ahhhhh, I see what you did there.\" Then you combine that with the very public fact that Kelly McGillis was not asked to come back to the production and going a step further they don't even leverage one line of dialogue to explain why she isn't around? She could be dead. She could be in Washington. Maybe things just didn't work out, but it seems like so blatant an omission because, as we have seen, this is a character that appears to be stuck in the 1980's. The easiest answer would have been just don't give Maverick a love interest. The love interest is basically just superfluous to the story and doesn't really do anything except eat up run time, and take away from what we really want which is the pilots and the planes. I thought the discussion of drones vs. Human aviators was going to play a larger role here, and unless I missed it I don't recall them ever addressing why this super important mission could not have been accomplished by drones. I thought that discussion would have been more prevalent throughout the film and outside of the initial scenes when Darkstar was shutdown it wasn't addressed at all. Finally I found it very bizarre to make the major static between Maverick and Rooster this Naval Academy thing, if you even believe renegade Captain Mitchell has that power rather the more glaring, easy and sensible conflict that is the death of Bradshaw's father, but that actually is somewhat secondary to a more cumbersome way to get essentially the same conflict.I know in reading that it sounds like a lot of negative and a lot of bashing, but despite a few glaring flaws in the story I actually had a great time with this movie. Everything looks and feels like 'Top Gun' so they were doing a very good, if obvious, job of channeling the original film. I did love the dynamic of Maverick so many years down the road now the wise veteran teaching essentially varying versions of himself. Hangman seems to be a loose version of Iceman although clearly just written with a much more antagonistic slant. Cruise continues to defy age and look like he belongs in these roles, and he certainly excels at reprising one of the roles that has defined his professional career. Besides Cruise and his star power the fabulous flight sequences are what drive the film. The writer and director realize this and jam the film with about as much aerial maneuvering as they can get, and it is a hefty amount, and all of the sequences are great to watch from the Darkstar intro to the training maneuvers to actual mission sequence and all that entails. While the film does have its flaws, which more people might admit after the new car smell wears off, and the film does enter the action hero genre by the end, it is an intensely exhilarating thrill ride with technical camera work that makes the film amazing all on its own. I am torn in the final evaluation as the technical merit of the film deserves an A whereas the story lands in the C to C- range.Eric's Grade: B.",

            "content": "This movie has been met with near universal acclaim, and while enjoyable, I'm failing to see what makes this so special, much less better than the original.Firstly (and this is more of a personal preference towards me being able to enjoy a film), plausibility. Something grounded in its fiction I find to be much more engrossing, relatable to the characters, plot, and overall more gratifying to the telling of its narrative than something that takes plot extravagances and liberties that, while fun in the spectacle and humorings they afford, renders the plot underpinning it so absurd and contrived that my suspension of disbelief falters.The ending of this movie, for one example, was beyond stupid and implausible to the point of utter laughability.....hijacking an old F-14 with Goose's son from an enemy base and taking out two modern fighters on the way back to the carrier? Unlike the original, the plot was so contrived and artificial feeling I was left rolling my eyes the majority of the time, feeling the literal hands of the script writers intruding upon a narrative (one that should've been flowing naturally) to work to satiate that 30+ years of nostalgic buildup we've had. Which the film does, again, and again, and again. From the opening crawl and Kenny Loggins, to the bar scene and \"Great Balls of Fire\" (played by Goose's son, Rooster, no less), to hard deck scoldings, to homo-eroticism at the beach, to racing the plane on the bike, to even having Rooster saying \"Talk to me, Dad!\" before finding his courage to scream in and save the day. All the way to, yup, Maverick in a Tomcat again.It was as if the filmmakers had a nostalgic bucket list to check off before even having a general narrative arc in mind, and this \"new\" plot was beholden to the past at all costs. This is what creative bankruptcy looks like, but apparently this is what audiences want, as people LOVE it and it's getting rave reviews everywhere I'm looking.I for one crave some originality in my films.",

Couple of months back it was Daniel Craig as James Bond who appeared old and tired and no surprises that he was replaced by his bosses with a younger agent 007. Now we have Captain Pete Mitchell ( Tom Cruise) of \"Top Gun\" fame who is back after 36 years , older and wiser with a new call sign \"Maverick\". He still has the enthusiasm to fly a fighter plane to its limits at a speed of Mach 10 and beyond. He also employs unorthodox methods to meet stringent task requirements. So naturally he is asked to train a group of young pilots for a dangerous mission. He motivates them to give their best for the mission. The movie is definitely a thrilling IMAX big screen experience with scenes of Navy aircraft taking off from an aircraft carrier and edge of the seat, nail biting scenes of aerial combat. It has all the ingredients to excite audiences of all types. Needless to add that fighter pilots ,young and old will especially identify with the story and presentation of the film.All credit must go not only to the director Joseph Kosinski for his admirable work but also to the cinematographer, editor, music composer and VFX/SFX creator for their splendid contribution in the making of this movie. The super thrilling climax of the combat mission has been filmed superbly. How a pull of 10 times the gravity physiologically effects the fighter pilot has been shown realistically. There are a number of nice quotes/one liners and interesting conversations to keep the audience engrossed. Also there is fine balance of leadership and team spirit shown. The bonhomie among the pilots is picturised well. Tom Cruise is on familiar ground and makes the best of this much loved character.",

The film should be 15-20 mins longer.The first part, the casting, could have been a lot better. The entire team, with the exception of Miles Teller, was not up to the mark. They should have gone for a lot better cast. Connelly was definitely awesome and could have used a few mins more of screen time, but Jon Hamm was badly used.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate CGI and the worlds that it opens, but the raw energy of seeing real jets in action and Tom Cruise in the cockpit adds dimension that takes the film away from what might just be an elaborate computer game. I have no doubt CGI was incorporated, but I could not see where it was added, other than they didn't blow up the aircraftWhilst it is great that everyone has different views, I do not understand some people giving this film 1 or 2 stars. If that's how they felt after watching the film, surely they should have read the synopsis before they went. I can only think these people don't like action movies at all and should have saved their money in the first place, rather than bleating that they were ripped offThankfully the vast majority of people enjoyed themselves and this movie will help save the cinema and get people back into seats.

We know nothing at all about any of the characters- even Maverick. The two African American characters exist merely to stand there and nod grimly, or smile, or hold a football. All of the students except two have no lines at all; at the end when we go through the role call, I was thinking, \"I don't know these people at all.\"\nThe one hotshot student had a few obvious lines that were never challenged, and there was a huge opportunity to have some drama between he and maverick, but that simply... passed. The dialog was silly and predictable.With a better script and a little more character development, this might have been a great movie. Think about the group of soldiers from the movie \"Aliens\" ... through a few lines of simple dialog we got to know and care about those people. Any good movie about a military team - even a comic book - establishes the characters and camaraderie better than this movie.I will forgive the \"one in a million shot to destroy the Death Star\" parallel because those sequences were so brilliantly shot, and because once again- that's what the people (including me) wanted to see.6.8 rounds to 7 outta 10.

Top Gun: Maverick, on the other hand, is surgical. Everything that can be problematic is removed, while the action is focused on the flying.Can we bring back Kelly McGillis? No. She is 9 years older than Cruise, which makes her 65. So we'll go with Connelly, who still looks stunning at 51. Would it be weird to show Maverick wooing a woman the way he did 36 years ago, following her into bathrooms and what not? Of course. Let us say they were already a thing from before, just estranged. Could people get their panties in a twist because women are allowed to be pilots now? Sure, so let's add a female pilot that does absolutely nothing the entire film except participate. Same with some black folk. Make one an admiral and the other a pilot and give them two minutes of screen time. Can we show dogfight scenes like in the first movie, where everyone who knows anything about flying would laugh out loud? No. Let's montage everything from short sequences showing Maverick is the best of them all. Should we name the enemy country who went \"rogue\" like they detached their territory from the Earth and are trying to fly away? No. Let's not call it Iran in any way. And when we show a coordinate on a screen, let it make it the most neutral place in the world! Not Switzerland, but the pole of inaccessibility.So instead of characterization, setup or any portrayal of an actual human being, it's a film made of significant cutouts who suggest what the story is, without an actual one. The plot is super silly, also, basically one of those \"so crazy it might just work\" ideas combined with the \"old man who can do it better than the young'uns\" concept and sprinkled with the Star Wars attack against the Death Star. But it works. It is entertaining, lacking any controversy, depth or moral. After feeling good for a second, you will forget the film ever existed.And just so we can call it a sequel to a completely different film, let's call back Cruise and Kilmer (for a few minutes, too), use the same music, bring in the son of Goose (who is somehow a Rooster?) and use some of the same lines in Top Gun, so we can pump up the nostalgia. But it's not a sequel, only a color neutral reimagining of a similar concept, lacking the impact that the film had. And released now, when Iran is not as much an enemy as Russia and China are, it shows how much the world has changed in three years.Bottom line: It is worth watching both Top Gun films back to back just in order to feel how much things have changed (and how much they stayed the same). It's a well produced and executed film, but it has no real soul. Entertaining, but without impact. I doubt young people will climb over each other to join the Navy after this film.",

And I don't mean a romantic type of love, but a love that my brothers and sisters demonstrate on a daily basis, first off, for each other and for their country, no matter what its present condition. Although I never flew, I was part of the flight deck ground support on various flat tops. This film is a tribute to ALL of us; and I did feel that--Love. I could be wrong, but based on Lincoln bobble head and Hangman's \"Give 'Em Hell\", I'm sure this was shot on two different carriers--Abraham Lincoln and the Harry S. Truman (I had not researched this information prior). This film unified U. S. back in 1986 and I hope it unifies U. S., again today. This film has it ALL.",

The flight scenes are exciting to watch but basically nonsensical if you know anything about physics. The film is loaded with nostalgia from the first film, except it was mean how they totally disregarded Kelly Macgillis' character. It was nice that Val Kilmer got to briefly reprise his role while he is still living with the real world effects of having survived throat cancer. They also made sure to completely depoliticize the movie by having a somewhat diverse cast ( but not too diverse) along with a token woman pilot, but more obviously the \"enemy\" is completely nameless, faceless with no flag and no indication of what country they are. Of course they need to satisfy international audiences, and most people around the world view the US as the evil empire these days, so it is what is.The biggest flaw though is that we are introduced to all these young hot-shot pilots who are supposed to be the best, but they are only shown failing Until the end, all to make a maverick into an inhuman superhero version of a pilot.Basically this film was made as an excuse for Tom Cruise to indulge his own ego, and fly some really cool planes so defense contractors can show us how cool these toys are and the brainless audience will continue to blindly accept throwing billions and billions at these war profiteers.",

Maverick breaks off more than it should be able to chew but does it anyway. There are Easter eggs for the diehard fans but you don't lose a lot if you miss em. The rest of us mere mortals will just enjoy a continuation of a childhood favorite or getting to enjoy what our parent did when they were young. The cast is great, the action is intense, and you feel like your in the dog fight or in the plane at all times. In a world of CGI being all the rage, Tom Cruise wanted to make this as realistic as possible. And he did so. Though at times it feels like a redo of the original Top Gun it doesn't actually end up being that. Every character's actions has consequences. Though in a small role the moments we get Val Kilmer on screen with Tom are beautiful. All in all you can't find a better sequel to a movie. I'm not one to tell you that you MUST see a movie in theaters but this would be it. A long movie but it's not like The Bat Man or the new Matrix movie where you could have chopped out 20 minutes and made a better movie.

I genuinely think that this film is easily the best of the year and might actually be the best and most exciting blockbuster of the decade and I say that with ZERO exaggeration.From the films intro that seems to perfectly remake the old one to a modern version, dazzling flying sequences that will leave you daw dropped for the entire scene. Moments of intense action that you can't possibly take your eyes off, cinematography that looks amazing right down to the way that technical aircraft systems have been limited and simplified to provide the audience with not to much information to not be boring but rather a solid idea of what the real thing is like.The writing was well done, the cast was absolutely phenomenal, and the film's ability to capture this F/A-18 Super Hornets (as well as other aircraft) on these IMAX quality cameras as they dance across the sky was absolutely phenomenal as they all train in numerous air combat manoeuvring scenarios specific to a new kind of mission they must prepare to take on despite nothing like it ever being undertaken by any other group of fighter pilots.Despite the fact this film is an absolute thrill ride, their were moments where the mood would change to a more emotional way and this made for excellent contrast in the film. When you see everything in this film, you are going to want to see it in the biggest screen that is available to you. IMAX if have that option.The way this film was put together was absolutely without a doubt just breathtaking. I am forever grateful for the cast and crew and everyone involved as well as the US Naval Fighter Weapons School/TOPGUN who had brought the same joy from the original film and reenergised it for the modern generation. This is absolutely a film for anyone who wants to have an amazing time and if anyone is reading this review and hasn't seen it, GET OFF UP AND GO SEE IT NOW!Everyone, I've never praised a single movie anymore in my entire life as I could talk about this one forever and believe me I will be. I really do think that even for those people who don't find themselves interested in aviation and combat sequences (the majority of the audience) will absolutely love this film and I can't wait for everyone to have an amazing time in the theatre as they gain a greater appreciation for those driven in life by aviation just like me.Please don't waste your time, go see this film now because your going to want to see it more then once without a doubt, and strap in for the most amazing film experience you can possibly find!",

            "review_title": "50% Montages, 40% close-ups, 10% action",
            "content": "This movie is a very average movie at best and I'm not sure what people are hyped about. I'll give a breakdown of the main elements of the movie and what I thought about them.Screenplay: Incredibly standard. If you've ever done screen-writing or know anything about screenwriting, this movie follows the very generic basic outline of what a screenplay should be. It doesn't take any twists or turns and does exactly what you expect it to do. There's no \"wow, I didn't expect this to happen\" or any real interesting narrative choices in the movie. Everything that happens in the movie happens almost exactly minute per minute the way a generic screenplay outline is constructed and in the most obvious ways that one would expect it to happen. To make matters worse, the vast majority of the movie is told through montages and I felt like every couple of minutes there was another montage. The movie seems to be afraid to actually have characters interact in real time and decides to rely on montages to move things forward.Characters/Dialogue: There are a few good moments here and there, but everyone is a cliche cut-out of a character with no real interesting characteristics or personality traits. The vast majority of this movie's dialogue is predictable and on the nose to the point where it just feels like everyone talks in exposition: \"Hi, I'm the character that wants to shut-down the mission\" \"Hello there, I'm the character that is nerdy.\" \"Howdy, I'm the character who doesn't want to talk to you.\" There's no subtlety in the dialogue nor intrigue in what is said. Good dialogue should make us curious and invested in the characters and the relationships between the characters, not inform us as to what role they fill in the screenplay. Going back to the montage issue, the movie really seems afraid to actually spend time on characters doing \"character things\" and only ones to rush by on the bare minimum of what is required to make a character.Cinematography: The beginning of the movie has some neat shots with an experimental plane taking off and there are some cool moments here and there when the planes are flying, but the dialogue scenes look like they were all shot in a weekend. EVERYTHING is told in over the shoulder shots or simple Shot/reverse shots. Why can't there be any scenes of all of the characters interacting? Why can't there be any wide shots of characters talking to each other that slowly leads to an increase in tension as the shots get closer? Why does this look so cheaply shot? Everything that involves characters talking to each other is shot with the least amount of artistic intrigue possible with no level of creativity or personality.Editing/Sound design: This is where the movie really works. The editing in the flying scenes is very good and impactful. While I think the movie does rely a little bit too much on lots of quick editing to make things feel more exciting, I think that might just be due to a lack of footage of wide-shots of planes flying, so everything had to be reduced to close-ups of planes or interior shots only. That being said, I still think the editors did a great job on this film. The sound design is also top-notch and should be applauded for really evoking the power behind a jet engine.All in all, I'm a little confused by the amount of praise this movie is getting. It's not offensively bad, but it's also not a great film by any means due to shortcomings in the vast majority of the core tenets of filmmaking. Maybe I'm just a nitpicky jerk, but it feels like audience standards have gone downhill since COVID started and now any movie that is functionally competent is seen as a masterpiece in filmmaking.",

There are loads of references and parallels to the 1986 film, which I'm sure fans will love. The cinematography was amazing and the actors actually were flying the planes to give them an authentic feeling. Great acting from the new addition to the film such as Monica Barbaro as \"Pheonix\" (the first female pilot) and Miles Teller as Bradley Bradshaw.But the real star is of course Tom Cruise, for not only playing the character as the rebellious and arrogant person that we all know and love, but also shown tenderness and vulnerability as he must face the ghosts of his past.I forgot to say the soundtrack is brilliant, such as Lady Gaga's song for the movie, \"Hold my Hand\".A solid 9/10.",

For context, my dad is not a frequent moviegoer like myself, but as a fan of the original, he was highly anticipating this movie, which did not disappoint. Personally, I thought the first film was a fine action movie, but as a younger viewer, I lacked the emotional attachment and nostalgia that the previous generation has for it. To the few people that read this, I will ABSOLUTELY have that nostalgia for this movie and plan on showing this to my children in the future. Maybe we'll even see Top Gun 3 in 2058!In my humble opinion, this movie actually improved many aspects of the original (such as the storyline, action, humor and romance/love interest element), which is why I argue that this movie surpassed its predecessor in quality. While viewing this movie, if you find yourself wondering if you feel the same way, the climax (a visually stunning culmination of the two hours that just flew by) will definitely convince you. The phrase \"on the edge of my seat\" is flaunted about quite often, but this was one of the few movies to literally keep me on the edge of my seat. Easily one of the best 3rd act action sequences I've seen in recent years coupled with a nice rapport between Tom Cruise and Miles Teller (who channels his \"Whiplash\" acting here). The latter portrays Rooster, the son of Goose from the first Top Gun. Kudos to the makeup department for creating an impressive Goose look-alike.Speaking of legacy characters, it's well-known that Val Kilmer appears in the movie (for crying out loud, his name is in the opening credits!) Without spoiling anything, I felt that both the character and actor were done justice by the story. It was so satisfying to see him return (albeit briefly) to the role that arguably propelled his career. Last but far from least is the titular Maverick. Tom Cruise was in top form here, even at nearly 60 years old, delivering a great performance, this time as instructor of Top Gun (not a student) and a distant yet caring father figure to Rooster. The class which Pete taught contained a variety of welcome additions to the cast. I also quite enjoyed the aspect of Pete's romance with old flame, Penny Benjamin (the admiral's daughter referenced in the first movie).Despite my fear of a 35 year-old sequel, Top Gun: Maverick met and exceeded my expectations. Everyone, do yourself a favor and check this one out. Even though I loved The Batman, I have declared a new winner for best movie of 2022. There's a reason this movie got a five-minute standing ovation at the premiere and has a near perfect score on rotten tomatoes, where I will soon release a copy of this review.",

I completely agree.After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Paramount Pictures has already earned a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, thrilling fans and critics alike with this high-octane action flick. That's quite a feat, even wilder than a jet racing through the skies! This is the summer blockbuster we wanted...and needed it to be!Do you feel the need for speed? I do!THINGS I LIKED:\nTom Cruise. Hello, Maverick! Welcome back! This classic character and classy actor have got what it takes to excite fans who have waited a VERY long time for this sequel! (36 years to be exact) Tom Cruise is 60 years old and looks fantastic. We see him riding his motorcycle next to the airstrip as he did in the first movie, and you almost can't tell if you're watching a clip from the first movie or if this is new footage...he looks THAT great. One thing I love about him is that he NEVER phones it in. He always gives more than 100% in his films and his growing skillset is super impressive. He's a true movie STAR.The new cast members also include Miles Teller, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Jay Ellis, Monica Barbaro, Charles Parnell, and Lewis Pullman.One question I have is when is Jennifer Connelly going to start aging? She looks amazing.I'm so happy to see returning cast members Ed Harris and Val Kilmer. The scene with Val Kilmer was especially touching.Try to watch this on the biggest screen you possibly can. The aerial acrobatics are absolutely breathtaking.I'm super impressed with director Joseph Kosinski for many reasons, but especially because this is only his 4th feature film ever! He's on the map!This film has substance and style, heart and heat, flight and grounding.There are a lot of respectful nods to the past that fans will love, including pictures on walls and video clips from the first movie.Lots of humor and Tom Cruise awesomeness.Tasty tension.The musical score is perfect.If you were to create your own call sign, what would you pick?There were rumors that the studio was going to remove the Taiwanese flag on Maverick's classic jacket for fear of losing the Chinese market. I was amazed and surprised to see that it's actually on his jacket in the final movie's release!It was completely refreshing to watch a movie come out of Hollywood that doesn't put America down or have a political stance of apologizing for being America, you know? It's not identified in the film which country the fighter pilots are going up against, which I thought was wise.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nIt's pretty predictable, but still doggone fun.It would have been nice to see Meg Ryan make a cameo appearance.I watched an interview with Kelly McGillis, saying she feels old and fat, not wanting fans to see her like that.There's lots of military jargon, but you can absolutely still enjoy watching this.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nSome profanity\nDangerous behavior\nPre-marital relations (we see unmarried people in bed together)THEMES:\nTenacity\nBrotherhood\nPast, present, future\nRespect\nObedience\nProtecting others\nSacrificeYou can see the full review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

The flying is awesome, the characters are awesome, the music is awesome, and the action is awesome. Tom Cruise's dedication to making realistic action films with little to no visual effects has paid off incredibly well here. The flying scenes were filmed practically but they look amazing. Some of if not the best shot sequences of the year so far. I absolutely adore how they look and it's amazing that the actors were able to act in those conditions. They all do a great job acting. Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell are all standouts here and their respective characters and journeys were really well done and even compelling at points. Val Kilmer did a great job as well under his own personal circumstances. The film handles Kilmer's medical condition and character incredibly respectfully. It's a great handling of his character. The action here is awesome. It's incredibly well thought out and intense. You could know or predict the outcome of a scene and you could still feel your heart beating out of your chest just because of how well done the action is. It's genuinely some of the best action in a blockbuster that I've seen in a long time. The final action scene itself is probably my favorite action scene of the year. It's absolutely amazing and so much better than the final fight in the original film because it's actually set up. The music here from the original Top Gun composer, Lady Gaga, and Hans Zimmer is great! The soundtrack itself isn't near as good as the original 86 film but it's still great here. I can't wait to see how Cruise breaks the mold with action again in the future. This is a must see from me for everyone. This film deserves to break $1 Billion at the box office so go see it now!",

Maverick did almost everything right (a bit of exposition could have been cut), it paid respect to the source material, even paying respect to the character of Maverick himself. The supporting cast were all excellent and likeable. The pilots were selected because they are the best of the best period. There was no attempt to awkwardly and artificially insert a message or tick boxes, they had earned their place and were believable and likeable as a result.Then comes the plane combat...wow. It is visceral, the practical filming shows just how intense and brutal pushing yourself to the limit is. Seeing the actors genuinely trying to remain conscious during high g turns is something that could only be achieved with them in the air experiencing it.This is how a sequel should be made. If only Spielberg and Lucas would step aside and let a good director such as Joseph Kosinski give Indiana Jones fans the sequel they deserve, not the sequel that is about to be forced on them by directors who no longer know how to make a good movie.",

Never thought I'd give him credit, as I didn't like him as an actor in earlier days; but since Edge of Tomorrow my respect for him grows, due to him being an actor that just delivers regardless of the material he's supposed to work with.The visuals of the dogfights are - expectedly - looking great.And that's it. The story is an absolute bore - just as an example, in the first minutes my girlfriend predicted everything happening (e.g. In the hangar \"now he will surely ride on his bike). It delivers all the cheesy tropes of its predecessor and at times feels like it's been a remake and not a sequel.The chemistry of the actors - all the drama is just filler material between the dogfights, and it exactly feels that way.The realism of the main plot is completely absent. From the overall scenario over mission details, to the looks of the SAM batteries which look like how a kid would draw them (on mountain ridges without any nearby radar systems), it's just bad.I won't criticize it as a negative that at times it feels like a promotional movie for the Navy, only because it's exactly following the footsteps of the original flick here.It's sad considering how much budget and hype went into this movie, which, as others put it perfectly, doesn't provide anything memorable a few days after watching it. It's just a complete recycle of the concept of the first movie, with decent visuals and an OK pacing, but the rest is completely unmemorable. Probably the fun is also ruined through the movie taking itself somewhat serious, in contrast to blockbusters like Pacific Rim that deliver exactly the ridiculousness that you would expect from their setup, and are perfect popcorn cinema, with visual grandeur on top.Top Gun Maverick is a bloodless rip-off, which just exists because of it's IMAX visuals, its established name, and the studio's need for moneyprinting. In the end, a real IMAX documentary about fighter pilots, with some Hans Zimmer background music, would have had the same or even better entertainment value.",

Have you ever walked into someone house and noticed how everything is pointed at their television? Make the TV Tom Cruise and everything in the house the \"supporting cast\", and there you have this production. It's unemotionally sad. I don't expect quality from a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and God knows I've never heard of this director, but this was far below the nadir of my expectations. A little reminder, 'Top Gun' was a blockbuster back in its day, but it was never brilliant, edgy, nor even memorable as a good movie. It was a guilty pleasure for the revved up 1980's crowd of excess to feel proud about during the 4th of July. Needless to say, it was a huge action film for anyone chanting \"America\" at fireworks. The point of its longevity belongs to the gay subtext Quintin Tarantino famously describes. The bashing of how-bad-a-film it was is legendary and continues on several social media sites. Today's tech-savvy sophisticated audience will never believe (reading the 10 star reviews) that this is the \"greatest movie ever made\". The plot was absolute garbage. It's a script that is pieced together from catchphrases, old panning shots of military aircraft, recycled aerial footage from 'The Transformers', and most notably the 'Star Wars' trench run. Seriously, they took apart the original 'Top Gun' (sans the homoerotic subtext) and pretended it was something fresh for today's audience. We have Pete Mitchell as the oldest test pilot in history still going by the callsign Maverick after 30+ years. The unnamed enemy jets introduced in the last frames because real writers would put production over budget. It's just a gross mischaracterization of entertainment. Where exactly were the military advisers to point out the obvious flaws? In my opinion; this is a film with a lot of cash thrown at it to feed the vanity of someone who can't get enough of themselves. I need not play Devil's Advocate here and point out this film was made to ego-stroke a bad actor who wishes he could be Robert Redford.",

I went on to do science A-levels, engineering at uni, was sponsored by British Aerospace and began work on anti-g suits, helmets and g-related arm pain for the EAP (development aircraft for the Eurofighter) My friend and I once got chatted up by some guys in Greece who claimed they flew Tornados but when I asked them IDS or ADV they ran away!I also met my now husband at BAE so to say the first film influenced me is putting it mildly. To now be able to tail off this with the current film is a privilege and I loved every second of it. The flight scenes are amazing, the emotional heft is well balanced and whilst the plot is tenuous, it doesn't detract. There is great representation and whether you love fast jets or not, you should go see it!",

I have never been fascinated by planes and jets, so watching a movie that existed simply as a way of showing off how cool jets were wasn't enough to do it for me. And that was Top Gun's biggest flaw. The story existed only to tie in the cool jet moments together and served no greater purpose. However, in its sequel almost 30 years later, all its flaws have been rectified.Top Gun Maverick is so much more approachable a film than the original Top Gun simply because there was a story with actual stakes despite the jets and the aviation jargon, that feels universally relatable. We feel the clock ticking and we feel the pressure mounting. And while the jets are still integral to the movie, they no longer feel like an excuse to make a Top Gun movie, but merely tools through which a great story is told. And that's what makes Top Gun Maverick a more enjoyable movie experience.This movie also benefits from being a sequel in that it carries a lot of history and built up conflict that we can immediately recognize, that over the course of the movie are resolved on screen, and resolved well. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and I think its approachable enough that anyone could go into this move and have a great time!",

Cruise cares deeply for his characters, scripts, screen play and fan experience\n2. He places these standards above profit goals, people pleasing or brown-nosing anybody in Hollywood. His projects command respect and lack preferential treatment\n3. If he gives preferential treatment to anybody on his projects, he does it tactfully and under the aforementioned standards. Yes it's possible to draw these conclusions from one film and YES, it's possible to create a diverse, inclusive, nostalgic and moving film that is still exceptionally executed to deliver an effective action movie experience that pays off the promises it makes at the start of the film whilst also rewarding the audience with ample, organic fan-service, Easter eggs, winks and nods, without ever becoming repetitive, predictable or on the nose in the lessons or messages the script brings to the table.Remember Red Dawn? Classic. Exceptional? No. Neither was OG Top Gun.Remember red dawns sequel? Me neither.Remember the Michael Douglas' Wall Street starring Shia Lebooferton? Nah. Creed? The Karate Kid(2011)? The Hobbit? Yeah let's not.They are what happens when you don't put the story first, cast according to social movements and allow a studio to meddle and check their boxes.I don't give away anything in my reviews. So don't expect plot points in this one. What I can say is that I only leave reviews when a film is either exceptional, exceptionally terrible, or so mediocre it catches me off guard.

Relationships didn't start with swiping right on the screen, and teenagers left hand written notes, not Facebook messages, for those they had a crush on. The world was a very different place without the suffocating abundance of technology.So, what have we got in Top Gun: Maverick? We got drama, we got rivalry, we got romance, we got some funny moments, but above all, we got character. I couldn't help but notice the similarity with the recent Bond movies, where an aging Bond is considered obsolete and to be replaced by technology. In one scene, Tom Cruise's superior tells him Tom wasn't his first choice for the given mission, and he couldn't fathom what Tom might have left to give. Again, I was reminded of a scene from the Dark Knight Rises, when Selina (Catwoman) begs Batman to come with her. She says, you don't owe them (the people of Gotham) anything, you've given them everything. To which, Batman says, not everything, not yet.Tom Cruise was 24 in 1986, and in Top Gun: Maverick, he shows how much he appreciates what we no longer have in the midst of all the things we have. He takes us on a journey on which the things that make us human are on full display. The cinematography is outstanding, the story not outlandish, and although there are a few moments where a willing suspension of disbelief is required, those are precisely what makes the movie stand out from the daily grinds of life. It's about flying, and for a change without a cape, but it's not the plane, it's the pilot.Go watch it; it'll take your breath away.",

It is simply put an outstandingly excellent experience that needs to be seen the first time in the cinema.For those 1 star reviews criticising the perceived pro USA stance and the like try and put that to one side. It is hardly the most bloodthirsty flag waving jingoistic film ever made. I have seen it twice now and have seen the original Top Gun several times. The performances and emotions displayed by Tom Cruise especially are subtle but importantly what I would expect a man to act like after several decades in the military. His performance underlined the emotions and losses that occur over time to those that serve. Still confident and determined but appreciative of the \"dying of the light\" that comes with age.Even the hot shot younger pilots in this are not obnoxious and the direction I felt was excellent reflecting the carefree youthfulness whilst also considered in the possibility of such a fraught mission being their last.I will own this on DVD when it gets there. Watch it, enjoy it and be glad it was delayed on its release as it was worth the wait.",

Boy, was it wrong. It is better than the original.The storyline is straightforward, bringing Maverick back to train the young Guns for a difficult or impossible mission. You have the typical competition among the team and so on.The flying scenes are incredibly well done, the IMAX clarify, the sound, the cut on/off the aircraft carrier, low flying over the desert, ocean, and mountain terrain are superbly done.What make this Top Gun better than the original is the human element of it. The Ice Man (Val Kilmer) scene is sad and emotional. I teared up watching it. And the relationship with Rooster (Goose's son) is a big part of the story. Lastly, I find his relationship with Penny is loving and genuine. It is funny to see Maverick doesn't know how to sail as a Navy man. It makes Maverick a human. Plus the fact Penny has a teenage daughter give us a view what Maverick life will be like after retirement.All in all, a great movies in my book. The fighter jet and boy-boy scenes are to be expected. But seeing Val Kilmer plays Ice Man one more time is priceless life. And see Maverick's life to be give me a lot of peace and closure of a beautiful ending of this beautiful story.",

But the story is also better. I couldn't get into the Maverick vs Iceman stuff or the love story of the original. But the redemption story here works so much better.There's a great cast and the movie plays on your expectations while there are also touching and funny moments reflecting the original. I thought the original felt half done, but this one piles on the action and is edge of your seat stuff. Even if you weren't a fan the 80's nostalgia here should win you over.Cruise gives the audience what they want and delivers something you can't really get anywhere else these days of too much CGI.

Knowing that all fighter pilot cast had a real experiences to flew in the real fighter jets are wonderful. This movie has its own style and values when no other movie can give those kind of experiences for the cast and crews.It's just I still wonder about who are the enemies in this movie. Is there any kind of separatist or terrorist who owns a F-18 Jets, SAM Sites and Bunkers just like in this movie? It would be really threatening if they have kind of these facilities. If US Naval pilots really infiltrated the enemy's territory and blow up their missile facilities, I believe it will caused more problems to the US as a country and it can be a national issue, not to mentioned to plan and carry out the mission will required an executive decision, from POTUS, which in this movie were no dialog or lines that mentioned about this mission was approved by the president.",

This movie is everything I remember movies were in my childhood/adolescence: the actors were heroes, the action felt real, the effects were not CGI overload, and music was just right. Top Gun Maverick delivers in every aspect, actors are awesome all of them filled in their parts so well, the excitement is there, magnificent stunning flight sequences, flawless directing, fun, camaraderie, jokes, breathtaking visuals. I absolutely loved this movie, it's up there with the best of the best in action genre. I'm not sure they can ever top it with another Top Gun but I think they shouldn't even try. Just leave it as intended an homage to the directing of the past, where action and fun were more important than compromising with political correctness police. This movie is raw, as in didn't feel like they tried to social engineer the audience, you get what you see. It's entertainment at its best.

The plus points here are the aerial sequences, which are stunningly well done, a coherent plot and a good cast, including Tom Cruise as good as before, and its also a film that doesn't take itself too seriously.

If you still doubt what I see, just watch it.

Maverick has one last mission, his relationship with Goose's son is complex, and his romance has baggage. None of this is inventive, but it's enough to fuel the climax. However, Top Gun: Maverick changes paths and loses steam. A dramatic peak is nicely set up, yet the film backtracks on that, introducing a new layer to the mission. This second climax is action-packed, but also fatiguing and muddied. Had Top Gun: Maverick kept its bittersweet climax, it would've been more meaningful. Instead, its emotional mediocrity feels like a missed opportunity.Meanwhile, Top Gun: Maverick has solid filmmaking. First, visuals are polished (utilizing focus, lighting, and mounts), acting meets the material, and the tone is clear. The soundtrack balances nostalgia, and the production is authentic. Plus, the editing employs montages, dissolves, and energetic action. Next, the sound design mirrors emotions, using symbolic echoes, silence, and J-cuts. Finally, the effects are the star of Top Gun: Maverick because its stunts are impossibly real. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick advances its drama and thrills, but still lacks a core message. Unfortunately, without a conscious theme, it feels like war glorification.Writing: 5/10\nDirection: 6/10\nCinematography: 7/10\nActing: 7/10\nEditing: 8/10\nSound: 9/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 8/10\nProduction Design: 8/10\nCasting: 8/10\nEffects: 10/10Overall Score: 7.6/10.",

            "content": "I was really apprehensive about this movie. I mean how do you too what was an entertaining movie back in '86? The story was straightforward and honest about what it was.After watching this movie, the first thing I liked about was pacing. The movie was very careful linking the first movie and the references contained therein. The second thing are storylines were intertwined very well without becoming convoluted and just ridiculous. I thought the cinematography was very good and allowing the audience feel like they were in the cockpit with Tom and the view was outstanding. Another thing I especially enjoyed was the main plot of the movie. You could consider the movie formulaic but it worked here. The esthetics of the movie were spot on and easy on the eyes\nNow the content of the movie was a tearjerker and pulled at my heart strings. The movie was a continuation of the first one but was darker on a lot of levels. First Mitchell was an old man. He obviously still maintained his rebellious streak that cost him his job at Top Gun thus directly affected his relationship with Charlie from the first movie. He knew he was coming to end of the road and faced the realization time catches everyone including Capt Pete Mitchell. The movie was deliberate in providing clues of Mitchell's old age. The calendar with his appointment in telemetry a day before flying his experimental plane.Another good thing was Mitchell's conflict with getting away with stuff because Iceman had his back. Iceman was promoted and looked after Mitchell like an older brother who understood him and his need for speed. Another point to add another layer of depth to Mitchell's character was the realization that he was no teacher. He decided at one point in the movie to give a graduate level training and those \"top of their classes\" weren't as good.I looked at the movie as though it was me. Not because of the stunts Pete has pulled at work but I, just as Maverick did, know things are changing and they will pass us by. The thing we can do is to pass on what we know and guide those younger than us. I really loved the movie but on another level it was a reminder that our movie \"heroes\" get old and we get old. It forces us to realize our own morality.",

The young flyers would all know who maverick was.The flying scenes were good and having val killer in the film despite his I'll health in reality. But the main story was a bit odd. Who was the enemy. How did they not notice a aircraft carrier off the coast. Or four fighter planes racing towards their target. And the helicopter shooting at maverick why? They would want to capture him and interrogate him. Ludicrous. I give this 6 for the flying scenes. I enjoyed it a bit.but don't want to see it again.",

As one of those who stood in line to watch Top Gun when it came out back in 1986, the stakes were clearly high. So many sequels are made that do not quite capture the magic of the first one so, although I was excited to see this trailer, I will admit I did brace myself for disappointment. I have never been more pleased to stand corrected. Easter eggs all over the place. Appropriate homage made to the original, with improvements to really showcase actual flying. I can only begin to imagine the amount of preparation and creative out of the box thinking it took to accomplish this. Watching this with knowlege that there was limited CGI kept me awestruck, engaged, and impressed the entire time. Story line was great - some things predictable but in a good way as it was the only smart way to move the story forward appropriately to make sense. I highly suggest watching the first Top Gun again closely before seeing this to refamiliarize or familiarize yourself with details and story line, give yourself the chance to catch on to those easter eggs, and allow yourselves to join us in what we have known for over 30 years - Top Gun is iconic for a reason and this sequel story needed to be told. All of this together made for a wonderful movie experience - I saw and appreciated all of it. Was it worth the wait? Goodness, Gracious Great Balls of Fire, Hell Yes.",

His down to earth attitude with a smart personality is always a winning point.For those who haven't watched 1986's masterpiece and original Top Gun, I strongly advise you to watch it, because it has emotional and eventual connection with this sequel. Val Kilmer's short yet impactful role of Admiral Iceman, now a sufferer of throat cancer, shares emotional bonding with Pete in a part. Role of young pilot trainees and graduates played by Miles Teller, Glenn Powell and Monica Barbaro are outstanding and performed exceptionally brilliant.Last but not the least, Jennifer Connelly deserves a strong applaud for her performance as Pete's new love interest Penelope and a single mother. Her presence alongside Tom adds a slight comfort and helps in moving the story forward.Overall, this one is a highly recommendable sequel and more powerful than the original.",

Prepare a cool air force mission, add a bit of nostalgia, some teaspoons of dalliance, bromance, inheritance, and sprinkle the whole thing with naked Tom Cruise - there you have it, Top Gun: Maverick.The action scenes are sublime, whether stunts, cinematography, or pacing, all flawless. With spot-on camera work, every turn and climb of the planes tightly steers the audience's heart. On top of that, Tom Cruise utilizes his Mission-Impossible-ish valor to further increase the intensity, making every gunshot more soul-stirring, and every cheer more convincing. Also used in the prequel, the golden color layout provides reminiscence and warmth, which contrasts directly with the white snow of the final battle. Just for the bombards and dogfight, the movie is at its summit.However, despite the hot-bloodedness, there are a few confusing aspects. Penny was never introduced in the prequel, nor is she relevant to the Top Gun community before Pete's arrival, making her existence serve nothing but a scripted, unnecessary relationship. Furthermore, the last part when the protagonists steal enemy aircraft is just too dramatic to be real.Other than these minor issues, the film is spotless. Distinct two-line narrative, solid storyline, and perfect display of air fights that excel the prequel. Definitely an ideal sequel.",

All uniforms are ridiculously tight, no uniform fits like a glove on people of different body shapes. The flying parts are okay but lack originality. Nothing but car chases with airplanes.

The last 36 min is ok action though, and you get an idea how the technologies have advanced. It is hard to see how audiences rate this as a superior movie to original.

Despite his recklessness, those same superiors decide he's the best man to train a group of best-of-the-best fighter pilots who've graduated from the legendary 'Top Gun' Academy, in a mission to take out a uranium plant in an Iranian oilfield . Along the way, Mitchell reunites with faces from his past, including ailing former rival Admiral Tom 'Iceman' Kazinsky (Val Kilmer) and former love Penny (Jennifer Connolly), while clashing with Lt. Bradshaw (Miles Teller), upon whom he honours the memory of a fallen comrade.Even before the time of COVID and the current cost of living crisis, before cinema chains had to recoup their losses in a big way, the industry never broke out of the recessionary mindset and were only willing to take a chance on 'sure things.' And so sequels to long dormant franchises remained the order of the day. All the same, the producers of Top Gun: Maverick were still taking a massive gamble, getting behind a sequel to a thirty six year old film that has more miles on its clock than most of the modern cinema demographic. However ingrained it may remain in the pop culture sphere, if a guy my age approaching forty has never actually seen the original, a younger generation would be even less likely to have had it cross their radar. Nevertheless, the film has still broken box office records, emerging as the highest grossing film of the year so far, owing in no small part to a massive publicity campaign on TV and in the media. And you can't argue with success.It certainly hits every mark on authenticity, with lead star Cruise reportedly insisting (and paying for) all of the younger cast members to train with real life US fighter pilots to ensure a degree of accuracy on screen, which pays off. It recreates a sense of 80's style as well, that original director Tony Scott magnified from all of his films (this is meant as a tribute to him), especially the sense of glorified machismo from that time. The big problem, especially for a film stretching over the two hour mark, is that it's largely been designed to cater to fans of the original, from the soundtrack (minus, oddly, Berlin's Take My Breath Away) to the nods to the original, which, not having seen it, were lost on me.It's all technically very impressive, and well made, but it required me to connect with a sense of nostalgia that I didn't have, and what remained really wasn't strong enough to carry it for me. ***",

The people behind the movie, Jerry Bruckheimer, Joseph Kosinski, Tom Cruise et al have made this a labour of their love. Every scene, every shot and every interaction is masterfully woven with intricate care and detailed planning. The action sequences are top of their class, surpassing that of the original by a country mile.

The action scenes made it epic and they were so realistic. It was like I was there. Honestly couldn't tell it was green screen or CGI or whatnot.To see Tom Cruise on the big screen is always a pleasure. He's mostly known for doing his own stunts, but we mustn't forget what a great actor he is. That counts for the whole cast, everyone was amazing. Even the smaller characters had great acting.The characters, amazingly written. You want to root for these characters. At the same time, they all have some type of pain. Some element in their personality or past that doesn't make any of the characters one-dimensional. Makes them interesting. They grow, evolve, change.The story is good and easy to understand. There is a mission. Mav has to train the best pilots to prepare them for the mission. They go on the mission. Quite easy, but everything that happens in between is integral to the succes or failure of that mission.The callbacks, the oneliners, the flashbacks, the action,... I can go on but it all just works.Yes, there are some 'negative' elements but don't worry, it's not a lot. As I said the movie is original, but some clich\u00e9's still sneak through. Some plotpoints happen to make the story fit and in some degree, the story is quite predictable. But that's the HollyWood formula right? It's worked for them over the years and it works for them now.Amazing film and a great experience altogether. Go see it!",

            "content": "It is a great action movie -no doubt- but a masterpiece it is not, sorry. It's a mix and I gave it solid 7, so bear with me.First, things I didn't like: this movie is incredibly predictable. I knew step by step what is gonna happen next, I knew Hangman will save the day in the end because he was basically the younger version of Maverick and they did exactly the same thing at the end as they did in the original movie. We had Rooster vs Hangman just like we had Mav vs Iceman in the first one. We had obvious sentimental callbacks to the relationship between Mav and Goose, and of course that - and Goose's death - translated into the relationship between Mav and Rooster. If you have half of a brain you knew they are gonna clear the air and bond with each other in the end. They were never going to die and anyone who knows typical big-hero American movies, knew it, so there was no surprise. People who claim there were in shock and didn't expect this finale, hm, lets put it lightly - are not very bright.Also, for me, it was pretty lame that we didn't even find out who was the enemy. If you are making a movie like that when the mission is the center of the action, how could you not explain who is the powerful enemy? It's like making a war movie and not saying who the other side is. Ridiculous and lazy. So again, genre-wise, it was a great action movie. But nothing more. Do you know what a masterpiece is? Godfather. Or Thin Red line by Malick.However, despite all of the bad, there is also a lot of good in Top Gun 2. The cast is def talented and very, very charming. Miles Teller is a perfect choice as Goose's son and his talent is on full display, same as the talents of the rest of the young crew. Glen Powell is probably the most charming of them all, he has great charisma and million dollar smile. I have to say I enjoy his Hangman the most. The evolution of his character was obvious and not subtle at all but Glenn is such a scene-stealer that you just can't help to enjoy and like him.Top Gun: Maverick is simply very entertaining and we need that and not just movies that make you want to kill yourself. It's a big popcorn, classic Americana movie very well made, just like Ford vs Ferrari was in 2019. Both have a lot of similarities - both are classic Americana, heroes , dad-son movies, each celebrates technological and engineering breakthrough worlds that have not only allowed the human race to achieve amazing things and push boundaries, but to live a more comfortable life as well. One focuses on the aviation industry, the other on the cars industry. Both have no CGI but real, practical effects and were filmed as real as possible with help of the insiders.So, all in all, Top Gun Maverick is nothing new, and the plot could have been better - less predictable but if you want to relax, live a real big cinema experience, have fun and watch a movie that makes you feel good, like comfort food, it's for you. It's def the action movie of 2022.",

            "content": "I went to the theater with high hopes. I love planes and military hardware in general and thought I'd at least get a rousing patriotic charge from this movie. But in fact patriotism is pretty far from its mind.Instead, we're offered the thinnest of cardboard characters involved in various strained relations with one another, and we're presumably supposed to care about them. But not a single character felt real.There's the guy who's always smirking and bragging about being \"the best.\" (The actor, Glen Powell, told an interviewer that he'd realized, with understandable uneasiness, that he was playing \"the biggest dick on the planet\"; but in fact his entire character consists of no more than his pasted-on, clich\u00e9d smirk. He's like some boastful rival in a children's book, and you know he's going to be taken down a peg.) There's the Miles Teller character, who holds a manufactured grudge against Cruise. There's a nerdy guy -- with glasses, no less! -- on a fighter pilot! -- and a handful of obligatory minorities, and a woman pilot who's given a couple of mild wisecracks. (Note: We're told that all these people are \"the best of the best.\") There's Jennifer Connelly, who's conveniently available but who doesn't want to be \"hurt\" again. (The love scenes were SO treacly and boring that I felt like a little kid, tempted to duck out to the candy counter.) Throughout the film, various stiff-necked officers berate Cruise for being such a rebel, for not following the rules, blah blah blah. These contrived conflicts were so fakey and formulaic that I found myself, at times, looking away from the screen in embarrassment at the things actors like Jon Hamm were forced to say. In truth, all the assorted subplots are silly and predictable, and you know they'll be resolved by the end.Outside of the flying scenes, the film moves with surprising lethargy, in a sticky, sentimental, weirdly reverent way -- reverent, that is, toward the earlier \"Top Gun\" -- with huge screen-filling close-ups of Cruise and the other cast members, all of them speaking very slowly, with lengthy silences between their sentences. You have to wait an awfully long time for the big-deal bombing mission. When it finally comes, it just seems like comic-book stuff, with a lot constipated grunting and heavy breathing on the sound track in an effort to generate suspense. As I watched, I kept comparing the movie with \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"The Right Stuff,\" both infinitely better.One final complaint that will resonate with no one but the most pedantic of English majors: There's a missing comma in the opening text on the screen. (It belongs after \"1969.\") This is an increasingly common mistake, especially here on the net, but it's annoying that a Hollywood blockbuster wouldn't even find room, in its gigantic budget, for a decent copy editor.",

That all of the actors were willing to put themselves in the cockpit of fighter jets pulling many Gs and not rely on stunts really gets to the heart of why this sequel feels so much more special than you'd expect. Honestly nothing about this movie disappointed me and the honorable way they worked in Val Kilmer unexpectedly moved me on many levels. Kudos. See the movie.

In the middle of fresh and young faces, Cruise almost does not waste his time telling the young kids he's still the boss around here. Though I have to say that by coating it with the vibe of his Mission Impossible series, I'm afraid his action flicks for years to come would bring nothing new to the table. Still, I hope for Dead Reckoning Part One and Part Two, he'd deliver something special as a love letter to long-time fans the way this movie does, or the way Infinity War and Endgame did for MCU fans.8.5/10.",

Cruise returns as Maverick, but the film also stars Miles Teller who plays Rooster, the son of Goose, Maverick's former wingman. The basic story is that Maverick is reluctantly hired to teach a bunch of cocky young pilots how to complete a very difficult mission while he also repairs his relationship with Rooster.I don't have much nostalgia or love for the first Top Gun mainly because I didn't see it until several years ago. I think it's a fine movie that does what it sets out to do. It's extremely cheesy, but a fun time nonetheless. When Top Gun: Maverick was announced many people were very excited. I wasn't. In a world were many unecessary prequels/sequels are being made, this just felt like another addition to that collection. I was wrong. This movie has no reason to be as good as it is. It improves upon the first film in literally every aspect. The acting and writing is ten times better while still keeping a smidge of that original cheese factor. The cinematography and directing are really what makes this film shine though. The shots of the interior and exterior of the jets as they are moving at reall high speeds are unlike anything I have ever seen before. You really get a sense for how fast and dangerous they really are. The decision to use real jets instead of miniatures or CGI made everything feel authentic and it added several more layers of intensity to every flying scenes. If I absolutely had to find some things I didn't like about it, I would say that I could have done without the romance altogether. It felt a bit too forced for me, but the resolution of it was worth it. Also the last act or so of the movie felt a bit out of place compared to the rest of the film, although I found it very enjoyable.Top Gun: Maverick surprised on all levels. It's one of the first new movies I've seen in a long time that I can easily say deserves a 10/10.",

From that frame of mind, I can say that Top Gun Maverick is a great sequel. Understandably, it leans on nostalgia, retreads, and while some pieces felt forced, most of it was appropriately in the background and enjoyable. Tom Cruise is unquestionably one of the last true movie stars, or at least the only true movie running stars (how he worked that into a movie about fighter planes is beyond me). The cinematography was jaw dropping, even more so when it's clear this isn't a green screen heavy movie. More so than the original, there's definitely a visceral sense that the audience is in the cockpit with the pilots. Overall, Top Gun Maverick is why we have movie theaters.A shout out to Miles Teller. I remember stumbling into some of his early work ... teenager type roles. I'm not sure whether it's because he was cast in a string of very similar roles or he was just playing himself, but I remember being very unimpressed. It was all roles where he was always a cocky jibber jabber character. It's the same negative reaction I have watching Vince Vaughn ... an instinctive desire to cringe and change the channel. But color me impressed in his execution here. Maybe it's because the nature of his character here requires him to anchor his performance on an existing character (Goose) or maybe it's just age and maturity. But this is the first time I've thought: this actor has range. I'm not qualified to speak to his acting skills so all I can say is I believed in his character and I no longer feel the urge to punch him in the face. I mean that in the nicest way possible.",

Leaving me saying to myself \"this is a copy of this and that scene\" time and time again. It's just waaay to obvious, lile following a recipe.3) The whole mission felt purposely designed to make and release a videogame, and felt very unrealistic.4) The \"beige\" caracters never really take shape like the original and you don't really care about them.5) The writing is very basic, even for such a movie.If I compare this to Star Wars, none of the subsequent movies could reproduce the wonder inspired by the 1st one, but at least, they had different plot that took you somwhere else, and the brought interesting new caracters. TopGun Maverick does not do that, unfortunately.",

Normally, going to a movie that has lots of airplanes you'd think that you'll leave the cinema extremely dissy, but this is nowhere near that feeling. Instead, you will feel the tension, a magnet will draw you to the edge of your seat. Not only this, but lots of emotions: joy, sadness, excitement, frightened, surprise, anxiety, trust, and many more.The power of teamwork, friendship, and reconciling with others are some of the fundamental messages that makes this movie spectacular. Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Jennifer Connelly give their hearts in this film. They understand the past movie and try to live up the same scenery, environment, and vibe that was given to this franchise 36 years ago, especially director Joseph Kosinski.If you dive deeper into the sweat and hard work that was put into the movie, you'll be amazed. Tom Cruise literally had everyone (including the director) re-shoot a scene because he found it could be better. This process consisted of everyone going to the gym to achieve its full potential. Plus, as many may known, he would only participate if the aircraft shots were made with REAL aircrafts.Said all this, I'm glad this movie took its time instead of rushing it due to matters of COVID. It deserves a 10/10. A movie that will give you adrenaline, tension, and an inevitable smile. Worth your time and money.",

The script simply builds on the events of the first movie. No preachy dialogue, unnecessarily vulgar language, gratuitous nudity or ridiculous plot twists either. Just great storytelling from start to finish. The writers really poured their hearts and souls into this and they ended up producing a superb movie. This movie is a work of art and a nod to a time when movies didn't solely rely on excessive CGI and explosions to tell a story. Sadly, that's what's lacking in the majority of modern day movies. In plain language, this is why people go to the movies and this is what entertainment is all about. Top Gun: Maverick captures what Hollywood once was, and what it still should be.",

And there always will be. Clich\u00e9 brand marked as they are forever. And for all those eternal sceptical now comes Top Gun: Maverick by Joseph Kosinski, Tom Cruise & Jerry Bruckheimer.This overwhelming, touching, supremely well directed CGI free IMAX experience proves once again that a movie is once and for all a very intimate odyssey into people's mind & soul, sequel or not.As a matter of fact, when it has a true and unique director's vision (Joseph Kosinski did Tron Legacy, Oblivion, Only the Brave... need I say more?!!) in his core, his elevation (as the actor's in their cockpits flying for real!) over mass-production and his impact on true movie lover's minds may be a gift nobody can honestly refuse nowadays.In this sad, over Marvelised and CGI overloaded world, movies like Top Gun: Maverick are this fresh refill of clean air we all are so deeply in need of.The general idea why this movie has been made? Just for money? Then take two minutes to think about the beautifully integrated Iceman/Val Kilmer character and this last movie shot after 2 hours and 11minutes of captivating beauty, power and delight: An airplane crossing the sky, free as possible from the ground' basic rules of gravitation. Pure magic in the same sense than this other vibrant homage to pilots and sky adventurers: Hayao Miyazaki's The Wind Rises. Tears in my eyes. Love in my heart.Thank you Tom, Joseph, Tony & Jerry!",

The story and action were truly amazing.However, Top Gun: Maverick was the sequal we never knew we needed. It fullfills the story to a tee, and is the perfect ending to a legendary story. I can honestly, wholeheartedly say this is the best movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot. The story, the action mixed with nostalgy and reminiscence is balanced perfectly, and is a true masterpiece. After I saw the movie the first time, I immidietly googled it, and learning the efforts and love Cruise put into the movie just made me love it, if possible, even more.I'm shocked and honored to have witnessed this tribute and love letter to the original Top Gun, and am moved to say, this movie is the absolute best I have ever, or will ever, see.",

The story is moving and well planned. The execution is perfect.I cannot recall another movie that made an audience, in the very large and packed theater, reacts in the ways this one does. There were people laughing, clapping, cheering and at the end, many stood and clapped.Everyone outside in the lobby was raving about what they had just seen, and I felt it too.It was like many of us had been teleported back to a normal pace in our collective childhoods that we might have forgotten. Seeing our heroes of the first film, back on screen, doing what made us love the original, and doing it bigger than before. I was 8 years old again, suddenly. I felt like I did when I was sitting in that musky old theater with my dad on a Saturday afternoon in rural S Carolina, back in the late 80s and that is what is really special about this movie.Then there is the scene with Val Kilmer, which just stops the show. In a good way.. his presence on the screen with Cruise, just captures you and lends weight to all that is said.This may or may not be the best thing I see all year, but either way, it's one of the best theatrical experiences that I have ever had.If you are considering going to see it, do it now.

You're still the alpha male, although you see no need to advertise it.Step 3 - Throw in the tried and tested, universal gender equalizer, hormone harmonizer, common denominator theme out there.

Luckily I was proven wrong, this movie is fantasticWhile the movie did bring up a connection to a new character who happened to be a son of a character who was tragically killed during the first movie and I presume was a friend of Tom Cruise's character, Marverick who felt guilty for what happened. Luckily for me, I didn't need to stop and go back to watch the first movie to fully understand before going back to this one. It went straight to the point and very easy to followThe plot was fantastic and engaging with Maverick nearing the end of his career who is recruited to lead a new team of pilots for a mission, training them up, getting them to work as a team and eventually helps them carry out the mission. His superiors don't like him especially the character Jon Hamm played, always at odds with Maverick. Along the way Maverick meets an old flame who obviously had history in the first movie, Penny. It was kinda obvious even to me they would hook up againThis movie is perfect for people like myself who have never seen the first Top Gun movie whether they are asked to for their friends and family without getting confused during the course of this particular movie and even make new fans of the Top Gun movies in the process. I loved the themes they played with from Maverick passing the torch so to speak to his students, him getting over his guilt and grief of the death of his friend by letting go of the past, redemption and trustAbsolutely fantastic and despite Tom being in a whacky religious cult is a damn good actor.

Any viewer sees the pilot characters, who OWN the skies at that time with the most modern and indisputably superior aircrafts in the world.What do we see in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" of 2022 apart from the undisputable cinematographic superiority shown to us? First of all, the total change of core tonality of the film.... Now the characters are literally scared to death of old(!) Russian anti-aircraft systems and SUKHOI warplanes... Now it's not some \"Top Gun\" school flights, including \"teaching\" MIGs how to fly, but some reality check...That is why, all that bravado and the \"finger-giving festival\" had gone now... Nothing to say about the real development of the combat-approved (not only test) planes in the USAF...And I'm sorry to \"bust someone's bubble\" or whether someone likes it or not....The Russians definetely didn't waste their time... since their defeat: the USSR collapse and the US victory in the Cold War, declared at the US Congress on January 28,1992 by G. H. W. Bush himself. (Make your own fact-check, if needed)And BTW, those Russian \"4++\" and 5th generation planes are not some test-ones at present. They are the mass-regular-weapons of the Russian Air Force, whose pilots are not just Hollywood dummies still playing giveaway games so pleasing for the audience... Though, I am sure, every real pilot in the world enjoyed the cinematography of the movie as well as everyone else....So, the Maverick movie is not only the perfect cinematic experience for \"Top Gun\" fans, but also, as already mentioned, a \"reality check\" for everyone who is able to think and can add \"2 plus 2\"... Impeccable unchanged winning on screen is one (very pleasant) thing. Winning in battle including the real-plane-technology-development is totally different one. Because, the deceived in 1991 (with false peace&liberal propaganda) people of the \"defeated\" USSR have learned their bitter lesson well, I guess...(\"You have no idea of what I'm talking about, I'm sure...\" - as Lester Burnham said in the end of \"American Beauty\" movie (1999) - \"But don't worry... you will... someday...\" This quote is none even hint of a threat to anyone; it's just a sincere wish to let a reader grasp someday the point of that Deception since Mr. Gorbachev has \"ended the Cold War\", sacrificing his country for \"World Peace\" and \"New thinking\" brotherhood era...)And again, the acting job of the pilot-team in the movie is the \"cutting edge\" of the Hollywood industry.

Can Maverick pull off the mission and bring his people back safely? Can he overcome the ill feelings of Rooster, who resents him for delaying Rooster's pilot training and failing to save his father?The movie does a great job of evoking the aesthetic of the original. In the opening moments, it hits you with the music from the first movie and sunset-tinted footage of jets taking flight and you immediately feel like you're back in the '80s. The nostalgia is never that high again, but it occasionally throws back, like with the beach football game evoking the beach volleyball game of yore.There is a repetition of the formula, \"Maverick needs to breaks the rules to meet his goals and does so and gets away with it because he's a stud.\" This is done with the demonstration of the stealth fighter's top speed in the beginning, the violation of the minimum flying altitude during the first fly with Rooster, and the proof that the simulated mission could be completed within the ambitious time limit.Major Star Wars vibes from this one, given the similarity between the mission - traversing at high speed a narrow corridor flanked by anti-aircraft guns while under threat of intercept in order to strike a small target with guided missiles - and the trench run against the Death Star.",

The story with Rooster is nice, but totally predictable. It took me a while to sympathize with him at all because the source of their friction wasn't fully revealed until well into the story.

            "content": "Always thought the original TOP GUN (1986) was a wonderful coming of age story about a young fighter pilot securing his manhood by conquering his past so that he can soar off through the Danger Zone into the future! Director Tony Scott skillfully shoe-horned you into the cockpit with the cocky hot dog aviator Pete Mitchell so that you could get a tense grip on his misgivings and feel his need for speed. There was a great camaraderie between the students in the TOP GUN class and later in scenes at the bar or on the beach. The antics of Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky as played by Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw come particularly to mind as memorable. Kelly McGillis as astrophysicist Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood is also easy enough on the eyes so that you don't lose that 'lovin' feelin'.Flash-forward then thirty-six years to now. Captain Pete Mitchell is still his authority defying self even though he has been maneuvered into instructing and prepping a group of TOP GUN graduates for what appears to be an impossible mission. Yeah, I know, I get the reference, too. The influence of Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky, now an Admiral in charge of the U. S. Pacific Fleet, swoops in to save Maverick's bacon on more than one occasion when he's in conflict with his superiors over flight strategy and aerial tactics. But the mere fact that Mitchell can walk his talk, or should I say fly past their reasonably assessed objections, proves to be a winning point in more than a couple of suspenseful encounters.This film also makes important points about instructing and teaching as its principal actors soar beyond the horizon. Sometimes the best instructors and teachers do not teach so much what they KNOW as what they ARE. The mission on paper that Maverick prepares his TOP GUN graduates for appears logically undoable. The look of consternation on their faces all say the same thing, such as '-so why are we even talking about this?!'. But Maverick is able to demonstrate through his exceptional flying ability during an unauthorized test run that what they thought was impossible and undoable, is in fact barely possible and doable. All that is left for the TOP GUN graduates is to duplicate his energy frequency as team leader. This is something that both Einstein and Jomo Kenyatta have spoken about albeit from different cultural perspectives, but I am sure would heartily approve. Jaime Escalante's assertion that students will perform up to the level of the teacher's expectation also comes to mind. But there is no doubt that Maverick's expectations of his crew of pilots perhaps raises the bar to places no man or woman has gone before in a cockpit.While the technical wizardry is dazzling and more than confirms the notion that Cinema has more to do with its ancient ancestor The Circus than The Theater, this film also scores a few points in the human dimension with its characters. Maverick's rekindling of his romance with Jennifer Connelly as Penny Benjamin and his poignant reunion with Val Kilmer as now Admiral Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky are particularly elegiac. But his scrambling on the run in and out of harms way with pilot Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw as played by Miles Teller, resentful son of the late Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw in a kind of hastily improvised surrogate father and son relationship keeps the narrative justly going at breakneck speed. This mixture of an enlarged human interaction between the characters with state of the art visual and aerial effects and stunts is what makes this sequel an improvement on the original.Where I would qualify my praise for this film has to do with the confrontation of this team of aces with a nearly faceless enemy whom we never get to see grappling with the effects and aftermath of its high-tech victimization. This is something that I groused about regarding PULP FICTION (1994) and THE WOLF OF Wall Street (2013), and is even an issue that can be raised obliquely about THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (1962). But many would simply regard this as nitpicking, as these three films certainly have won the love of its audiences around the world. Pete Mitchell, AKA Maverick, an engaging boy-man one notch above a comic book hero as the poster airily suggests, may one day have a Yeager-like catch with his son or not. But Tom Cruise showed the guts to play this character at warp speed, warts and all, and who knows that one day he might take Penny up in his mustang only to barely hear her declare that she's pregnant with his child!Stranger things have been known to happen in the Danger Zone as I am sure you have witnessed.",

It's a movie that worships the hero and gives the happy ending he deserves going off to sunset with the girl beating the villains in a exciting spectacular fashion which shows you don't need to kill the hero or do something different to please audience. I'm looking at you No Time to Die which messed up badly trying to make Bond something he's not and ended up been worst divisive Bond movie in recent times.So let this be a good note to filmmakers that you can worship the hero and have a happy ending while giving a great movie as well. Top Gun Maverick is a movie that must be seen in theater for sure.",

It worked and it's a classic.It looks like they really intended to do more in this one but ended up just going through the motions.The action was great, flying sequences are out of this world, however the acting was twice as bad as the original (and that's saying something) the story was odd and fragmented and then poorly executed.A lot of it was reminiscent of the cheap top gun knock offs from years gone past.You will enjoy it but don't expect that old feeling.",

The addition of his personally owned P51D Mustang fighter was a nice touch too.The only minor let down, very minor, I would have liked to see a bit more of Val Kilmer (aka Ice Man) in this sequel.The cinematography and scenes shot in the cockpits of the aircraft are absolutely sensational. You can definitely tell it is real life scenery and not CGI or green screen. If you liked the first film in this franchise, then you will definitely love this latest addition.

            "review_title": "Extremely overliked",
            "content": "Spoiler warning provided when there are, rest is freeI decided to watch this movie after seeing its high ratings. I hadn't watched the original, but I had seen people say you don't need to see the original before seeing this movie, so decided to roll with it. Turns out not only do you need to watch the original to get any enjoyment out of this movie, but you need to watch it 30 years in the past too. I was thoroughly disappointed.The movie is about jet fighters. It's supposed to be a \"turn off your brain and enjoy\" kind of movie. I'd imagine whoever wrote it would know this too, but the pull of mediocre drama and soulless romance must've overcome their rational thinking as the movie is full of that stuff. Save for the initial action scene that exists for the sole purpose of preventing the audience from walking out {1}, the first quarter of the movie is pretty much entirely human drama. So instead of watching jet stunts, you get to watch Tom Cruise being disliked by everybody around him for no reason other than to make them like him at the end.Spoilers in the following paragraph.Higher ranking officers disliking Tom Cruise has no effect on the story whatsoever. Actually, NOTHING in the movie has any effect on anything. Characterless pilots go on a demonstrably possible mission to destroy the non-operational uranium processing plant of an unnamed country, and nothing surprising happens until they're done. Maverick even predicts the patrol planes. That's it. No tension. No backup plan (even though he's totally not going on the mission, it's not like Tom Cruise is going to fail right?). Just a single off screen death that gets overwritten in 3 scenes but none within the main cast, not even a lasting injury. Maverick and the mustache dude apparently have a resentful history that the movie could make its emotional and dramatic focal point, but it just has to also have infighting within the pilots, and also a conflict between maverick and the commanders, and what movie is complete without a rushed romantic subplot? Instead of having a single fleshed out conflict and main duo/trio, the movie takes its sweet time making caricatures of amazing and totally interesting characters such as the guy that can't fail, the jerk, the love interest, the girl, the black guy, the Bob (get it? His name is also his callsign\ud83e\udd23), jerk commanders #1 and #2... Anyways, even after the first arc of boredom the story still failed to match my heavily readjusted expectations.But that's all irrelevant because as I said, this is a braindead type movie. So long as it has good action scenes and the speakers are loud enough to wake you up when they begin, it's a good movie. Thankfully the action scenes and sound design have a special something that makes seeing them in theater indistinguishable from seeing them on TV, so if you haven't seen the movie you can just watch compilations on social media without sacrificing anything.In case it isn't obvious, I'm not very impressed by the action. It is admirable for the actors (or just Tom Cruise?) to learn how to pilot jets, but that adds nothing to what you see on the screen. In the age of cgi sci-fi movies, real life jets doing almost real life stunts didn't do it for me. Not only is there no oomph factor, but the action that exists isn't captivating neither. I would pass out if I were in a real fighter jet. All the movie needed to do was to convey that to me. In fact, I think that was the number one thing this movie was supposed to do. But that doesn't happen when the camera is always pointed at pilots and the pilots aren't showing much emotion. I get that they're concentrating and all but this is a movie. It needs to do something to give the feelings of speed and excessive g-force. Numbers on screens don't count.Well-made action wouldn't be enough to save the movie, but at least it'd live up to its premise. To be a good movie that deserves its current 8.6 (!!) rating on IMDB (and 96%-99% RT scores!!!) it'd need to have some resemblance of tension, and to have tension it'd need to have an actual story with actual characters. It's astonishing how safe this movie plays with its \"story\". It goes in a straight line as long as it can and only diverts when...well never. And it's even more mindblowing that there are people that like this. It's like the fighter jet footage and Tom Cruise fan club ran out of things to watch and this movie was a saving grace for them.The bright side to all this is that I saw the movie on discount day and got to keep 25 cents in my pocket. Which seems to be more than the story budget this movie had. At least it has real jets tho 2/10{1}: Spoiler: The fact that nobody talks about the supersonic prototype plane for the rest of the movie makes me seriously think that scene was an afterthought. If you show a gun in a movie, it has to go off. If you show a prototype plane in the beginning of a movie, it has to do something by the end (besides blowing up in an extremely zoomed out shot). Unless you already wrote the entire plot that is.",

But here he brought the hig guns with his reputation. However Tom Cruise Mapother carries the whole thing on screen. He is magnanimous, debonair and with him at 59 at the time this was filmed takes the lead and the story to another level. This project was a worthwhile wait. I loved the action sequences, the acting, the music, cameo roles by Ed Harris and Val Kilmer made contributions to the overall character arcs for MAVERICK to get back into Top Gun as an instructor, rekindle his love for Penny, remedy the past and again lead the charge into a heroic display with an aerial dogfight that outdoes the first Top Gun film. The 5th Generation fighter jets swung the advantage towards the mysterious terror state developing a nuclear program. Our heroes lucky escape again just goes to show that the USN is very resilient.

            "content": "Love or hate Tom Cruise, you must admire his efforts to heighten the authenticity of Paramount Pictures' long-awaited sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" co-starring Val Kilmer, Ed Harris, and Miles Teller. Cruise stands front and center for making \"Maverick\" not only entertaining but also as realistic as possible. For example, when the pilots are in the cockpit, the actors and the actresses are actually airborne! They're riding in the rear seat, typically occupied by the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), while an actual Naval aviator flies the supersonic Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet. The cast weather genuine G-forces. Ultimately, whether or not you enjoy \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" the movie serves as both a triumphant Naval recruiting endeavor as well as an example that touts the Navy's combat capability. Primarily a mission-oriented actioneer with minimal comic relief, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" depicts intrepid Navy aviators dispatched to obliterate a target which poses a threat to world security. Incidentally, Paramount Pictures never reveal the identity of the \"rogue\" adversary whose uranium enrichment plant is the target. Nevertheless, the signs are unmistakable that the enemy is Iranian since they're the only country which still flies F-14 fighters. Pay close attention to the hopelessly, far-fetched \"Maverick\" finale if you've any doubts.In his informative SLATE. COM article, \"A Quite Serious Military Analysis of Top Gun: Maverick's Tactics,\" aviation expert Fred Kaplan ridicules \"the whole thing\" as \"crazy.\" According to Kaplan, \"F/A-18s don't have the range to pull off this stunt, especially at fuel-draining high speeds. But more than that, it would have been much easier simply to send a couple of B-2 bombers at very high altitude-beyond the reach of the enemy's surface-to-air missiles-and fire a handful of GPS-guided smart bombs. Or if there was a chance the SAMs could shoot down a B-2, their radars could be blinded or tricked in a cyberattack.\" Alas, armchair aviators need not feel cheated. Nobody should confuse Hollywood heroics with real-life heroism. Basically, Kaplan's sensible scenario wouldn't have drummed up much drama. Audiences want to ride the edge of their seats while the heroes risk their necks. This is where the Gee-Whiz forces of adventurous storytelling come into focus! Cruise, Kosinski, and Oscar-winning lenser Claudio Miranda of \"Life of Pi\" (2012) deserve kudos for hurling us headlong into the skies for a tumultuous rollercoaster ride of a lifetime! The only thing more sizzling than real life is spectacular storytelling, and \"Maverick\" keeps its audiences clinging to a wing and a prayer throughout its' brisk 131-minutes of PG-13 rated havoc!Insubordinate Navy Captain Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is the only aviator qualified to train the best pilots for the rigors they'll encounter on this critical mission. Admiral Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky (Val Kilmer of \"True Romance\") runs interference for Mitchell. Were it not for 'Iceman,' Mitchell would not have been ordered back to Top Gun. One of Mitchell's contentious superiors, Rear Admiral Chester 'Hammer' Cain (Ed Harris of \"Appaloosa\") roasts him not only for his aerial antics but also for his failure to wrangle a promotion. Irritably, Cain complains, \"Thirty-plus years of service! Combat medals! Citations! Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years! Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die! You should be at least a two-star Admiral by now, yet here you are. Captain.\" When he arrives at Top Gun, Mitchell thinks he'll be leading the mission, too. Admiral Beau 'Cyclone' Simpson (Jon Hamm of \"The Town\") crushes any such hopes. Simpson makes it clear to Mitchell that the latter is the last man he would have chosen for this assignment.Naturally, \"Top Gun Maverick\" bristles with callbacks to its predecessor. Kilmer and Cruise are the only original cast members to reprise their roles. The opening aircraft carrier scene with crews hustling to launch jets ranks as a nostalgic homage to Tony Scott's unforgettable \"Top Gun.\" \"TRON: Legacy\" director Joseph Kosinski designed this opening scene to recapture the essence of the first film. One aviator struggling desperately to make the cut for the mission is Lieutenant Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller of \"Only the Brave\"), the son of Mitchell's former Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), Lieutenant, J. G. Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. \"Rooster\" bears a grudge against Mitchell. Pete refused to recommend him for the Naval Academy, torpedoing Bradley's plans to become an aviator. Nevertheless, Pete had a legitimate reason. Meantime, Kosinski recycles flashbacks of Goose (Anthony Edwards of \"Zodiac\") and his wife Carol (Meg Ryan of \"The Women\") cavorting with Mitchell. Furthermore, the sequel draws on dialogue exchanges about an original \"Top Gun\" character that we finally meet in the flesh, Admiral Benjamin's daughter Penny (Jennifer Connelly of \"Blood Diamond\") and her relationship with Pete.Not surprisingly, the attack on the uranium plant in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" generates heart-thumping suspense. The pilots must wing their way along a meandering trench, like the one in the Clint Eastwood warplane epic \"Firefox\" (1982), to avoid surface-to-air missiles. Afterward, they must soar over the crest of a towering mountain range, plunge precipitously toward a barren arena of flatlands that conceal their underground target, drop their ordnance, and then throttle up for a vertical, spine-tingling ascension over an even higher mountain! Clearing this craggy gauntlet, they wind up exposing themselves to both missiles and enemy aircraft. Mind you, Mitchell has barely three weeks to train them. Our heroes must complete the flight through that treacherous trench in 2 minutes flat! Anybody who craves aerial combat epics will spot the resemblance between \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and \"633 Squadron\" (1963) with its suicidal bombing run where a squadron of plywood Mosquito fighter bombers assailed a heavily defended Nazi factory. Happily, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" emerges as a charismatic escapade about gallant aviators, not a tragic World War II epic about heroic pilots who sacrificed their lives to pull off an impossible mission.",

One of those rare occasions where people clap, families aren't arguing but talking about their favorite parts, and everyone walks out of the theater with a smile on their face. A push to bring more of our American woes and political issues on screen has been dreadful and films like this that allow us to escape from reality for just a couple of hours make it all worth it.

The writing also adds real substance to the character Pete Mitchell-Maverick. No spoilers here because it is a film that has to be experienced. And with Jerry Bruckheimer you will feel it! Tom Cruise shows why he is one of the worlds most bankable actors. You add the likes of Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris and along with Val Kilmers touching role and you have the makings of something rather special and terrific. And let us not forget the rest of the actors and actresses in this movie. Their roles and performances are nothing less than superb! The decision to have these actors actually go through some of the training pays off. There should be many more of these rare breeds of film where the actors do such a top notch job.I grew watching Tom Cruise movies as well as Jennifer Connelly. I also can tell you that Jerry Bruckheimer is a huge selling point for me. Jerry Bruckheimer rarely let's you down and when you watch his films you actually feel it as well. Tony Scott was great but Jerry Bruckheimer like Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly as well as Ed Harris are all at the top of their perspective crafts.Tom Cruise being an accomplished pilot helps his role here and it runs off on the others around him. Ed Harris is one of my favorites. I place him up alongside of actors like Sir Anthony Edward's. Btw Jennifer Connelly is the perfect actress to take the place next to Tom Cruise. Talk about her timeless beauty as well as her acting capabilities which makes her a Top Gun in her own respects. Yes I know she is married...Dang it! Haha!Val Kilmer, make no mistake this is and will be considered one of his most iconic performances.I have gone back a few times and watched it again. It is extremely rare to watch the same film multiple times and still come away with both something newly discovered and yet feeling like it was your first experience .I did see the first Top Gun when it came out. And although it was good.. It also wasn't great. It kinda stuck with me as another one of so many action movies of its time. Just enough to keep you from falling asleep and you walked away with some conversational pieces. In my opinion the original Top Gun was well kinda like Days of Thunder. Great action and a ever so unnecessary love story thrown in. Maverick on the other hand blended its story lines beautifully .All I can say without spoilers is if you haven't seen it you should. If you are expecting just another Top Gun then you will be beyond surprised. This movie as far as I am concerned brought in the right target audience. A more rounded and mature audience. May I say we are great judges of character. Age does that , we have the experience. And some might say a far superior intellect! Haha! Just kidding kiddos.Also I gave this a perfect 10. Reason why? It far exceeded my expectations. And I really couldn't find fault . At least not as a action movie or even as a yucky love story. Military aviators can tell you personally have a bit of fun and laughs at the same time. And yet it didn't disappoint.Go watch , and have a blast! Last bit of advise. Go to a theater that has one kick @$$ sound system . \ud83d\ude0e",

The valley mission, straight out of an Ace Combat game, is portrayed in all its dangerous glory with high G-forces, practical effects, sunlit cinematography and thrilling training sequences that show just how much is at stake. As a cinematic experience, these action-packed flight sequences make the audience feel like they're right there in the cockpit and that anything could happen.However, this isn't an Ace Combat movie, it's a Top Gun movie, so how does it compare with the original? It blows its predecessor right out of the water with a more compelling character arc that continues right from the original story but adds so much more. The legacy of Goose's death is something that weighs heavily on Maverick as he has to tutor his son Rooster. The whole film is about Maverick coming to grips with how to protect and encourage Rooster, all while doing his duty to the overall mission. Compared to the thin machismo of the first Top Gun movie, Maverick is a more compelling and original experience.",

OK... so how the hell did enemy radars which guided the AA missiles were working if the area is flooded with jamming signals? Or how did E-2 Hawkeye had not only no problem performing overwatch, but also had tactical map working via GPS with all SAM sites locations being displayed without any issues? As far as movie goes, there was so jamming of any sort in the area where they were attacking.What was much better was the level of interactions between the characters, and the amount of respect being paid to the first Top Gun. This part I enjoyed completely.In the end, I did enjoy the movie, but it could be so much better if they go through with most of the movie being somewhat realistic, because realism can be even more dramatic, and emotional that made up stories. Just look at the case of Air Force Major E. T. Tullia who was flying F-16 during Desert Storm, and successfully defended from 6 Iraqi SAM missiles in relatively rapid succession, while his automatic countermeasure system wasn't working. If real life can create amazing stories, why can't you?",

Characters are all pathetic 'Jocks' who swill beer and and are loud and obnoxious, and indulge in endless 'bonding', and we are supposed to 'feel' for these imbeciles. We watch them bonding in the bar, we watch them bonding on the beach, we watch them bonding in training.....Yawn. When the characters lean forward in their chairs then that is when we know that we are supposed to feel tension, the problem is that we don't feel anything but boredom. There is one laugh out loud moment when an enemy plane comes alongside and the Americans are pretending to be friends, but Tom Cruise has 'Maverick' written in large English letters on his helmet, presumable the enemy think this is their own language. It you want to spend two hours hearing people telling each other that \"You can do it\", then waste your time watching this movie.

None of those elements exist here. The movie ticks all the conventional boxes but leaves the objective viewer strangely unsatisfied. Are audiences numbed to Hollywood action saga cliches? Perhaps. But I think the problem lies in the lack of daring and imagination that one finds in contemporary film making. The film was a box office success, undoubtedly, and for the stakeholders, that is all that matters. But if a few extra risks had been taken, and the script given a daring and risky turn or two, this could have been a true masterpiece. Alas. Not to be. This film will be forgotten soon enough.",

            "content": "I will right up front in saying, i never saw the first movie. To be perfectly honest, i was in my twenties at the time, and i was not a huge fan of Cruise.But i digress. Fast forward to 2022, and on a hunch, i decided - after watching a composite trailer/interview with Cruise and the film-makers, that the movie seemed compelling enough to watch.Honestly, i have to say, i think NOT having seen the original added an edge of complexity mixed with being the only one in the theater who didn't know the back story. Consequently, i was on a steep learning curve about the background characters.Overall Conclusions:(1) Top Gun - Maverick is clearly an epic enough story, in and of itself, to a point where you needn't have seen the original movie to appreciate and \"get\" the storyline and whole drive of the sequel.(2) If you're going to try replicating real-life, jet fighter combat ...heck! Any combat, Top Gun Maverick has well and truly set the new benchmark by which all other future movies of this ilk will struggle to match.(3) If i had to hazard a guess (seeing as i'm in the absolute minority of one - having not seen the first movie), this sequel not only crushes the original for storyline and atmosphere, but also has clearly got to be light years ahead of and improving upon air combat replication and special effects.(4) The believability factor for TG Maverick is huge, and really cannot be understated. It's quite frankly breathtaking and genuinely awe inspiring what the director, cinematographers and live action production crew have accomplished in this instant movie classic.Lastly, the nod for story telling and screenplay adaptation is masterfully constructed - as it doesn't follow the expected and dross cliches of similar action movies based on a military theme (and its predecessor is in that number). The significance in saying that, lies in the believability and original nature of the main character interactions throughout.All told, any movie worth watching once, must surely be worth watching again (and even again). Top Gun Maverick is that great a yarn.",

The romance between Maverick and Penny was rather unnecessary to say the least. We know barely anything about their past together, and it kinda just makes no sense.

There might have been some cringy scenes but most of the time I had a huge smile on my face.

It follows the same beats as the original so you won't have any big surprises (this sounds bad, but trust me, you want the original Top Gun feeling. New-comer or old-timer).

Wanting to see the sequel to the original Top Gun amidst its many delays, I was one of them. May seemed like the perfect month to get my Mach 10 on.More stunt-packed than the first Top Gun and probably more tech-savvy, \"Maverick\" at times readily lets you know it's a follow-up with fan-made propensities and fan service directed at Tom Cruise's legendary persona (Lt. Pete Mitchell). At the same timetable, Top Gun: Maverick also announces that it's cinematic spectacle and not much else. See it on the biggest screen possible but be forewarned, you won't be quoting any of its lines any time soon.Tom Cruise stars in \"Maverick\" (duh). As Lt. Mitchell, Cruise acts and talks differently than he did in '86. I don't know if it's old age or wisdom but Mitchell is now the consummate professional. Back then he didn't say much. He just acted cocky and kicked butt in the air. I mean in Top Gun: Maverick I thought he said he wasn't fit to be an instructor. Could've fooled me.\"Maverick\" flies by even at a running time of 137 minutes (no pun intended). And director Joseph Kosinski can stage action while providing a stellar attention to detail (love those gadget zoom and POV shots). But if you're looking for nostalgia and dramatic heft a la Tony Scott's sun-soaked vision, don't look here. What's worse, you don't know who the enemies are that the pilots are fighting in \"Maverick\". The aerial, high-flying stuff is just for show and for well, \"whoa\".Top Gun: Maverick is its own movie but it shouldn't force you to forget what transpired effectively 36 years ago. The original Top Gun was (and is) a pop culture artifact, a time capsule put forth, and nearly the first of its kind. \"Maverick\" lacks Top Gun's revered characters, its devil-may-care banter, and its two iconic endings. The late \"Mother\" Goose would abide.",

            "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess to backtracking on a statement I made on social media when this film was first released. At that time, I had said I wouldn't see this movie because I believed it to be little more than a veiled recruiting vehicle for the US military and that it was something I couldn't support. However, awards season accolades for this offering backed me into a corner, essentially forcing me into having to see it to remain informed and credible about the unfolding of these events, so I reluctantly relented. Unfortunately, after having watched it, my initial assessment was borne out. This overblown, testosterone-dripping, clich\u00e9d, corny, predictable 2+-hour ad for the US Navy lived up to all of my expectations. This tale of an aging fighter ace-turned-test pilot (Tom Cruise) who's tapped to train a team of young flyers for a virtually impossible bombing run to take out a plutonium enrichment plant in Iran (no enemy stereotyping here, ahem) follows a formulaic script with trite dialogue and plenty of sly macho winks and nods. To its credit, the film features superb aerial camera work and editing, making for a number of visually thrilling dogfight sequences (a major \"cool, dude\" aspect of the picture's underlying military marketing intentions), and it manages to slip in a few \"sensitive male\" story threads to show that modern-day enlisted men can be at least superficially politically correct (a changing-of-the-times narrative adjustment from the film's original). But, even with these admirable attributes, I genuinely fail to understand how so many critics and viewers don't see what's really going on here. To say that director Joseph Kosinski's latest is truly worthy of the honors it has received thus far - such as a Golden Globe nomination for best dramatic film and the National Board of Review's award for the year's best picture - is clearly an overreach, especially in terms of what it's really all about to begin with. In my view, it's yet another example of the decline of the American movie industry and how willing audiences are to settle for it.",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick. Thoughts...More than an ode to (military) aviation, it is an ode to cinema. To classic nineties & noughties movies that us Millennials & younger Gen-Xs grew up on.Makes sense, because it was made by that generation's action god Jerry Bruckheimer.(On the topic of Bruckheimer: The use of The Who's \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" in the first dogfight training scene was an exquisite tribute to another one of his wildly popular shows CSI: Miami.)Being crafted using classic nineties/noughties action formulae, Top Gun had its fair.Share of cringe. But what makes it stand out as an exceptional piece is that Cruise & Bruckheimer used the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of world cinema.Look at the filmography of the film's producers and you'll see what I mean...Editing: Kingsman\nProduction Design: Zero Dark Thirty\nArt Direction: Grand Budapest Hotel\nCasting (immense cast): Saving Private RyanAnd the primary feature of the film...Cinematography: Benjamin Button & Life of Pi.It's writing let it down. Dialogue was weak and kitsch, with a painfully thin plot. But that's expected for Bruckheimer (never my favourite movie producer).If decent effort had been invested into the screenplay, this could have been a masterpiece. Instead, it was outstanding.A cinematic marvel. Right up there with some of the best cinematography to grace the big screen (think Revenant, Tree of Life, Avatar, Blade Runner, 2001, Psycho etc.)It's unfortunate that such a marvel couldn't be served a better script.But what do Bruckheimer & Cruise care?They don't. It's done its job. It is one of the most successful films of all time, and deservedly so.But for those who appreciate a little more than just eyegasmic experiences and seek provocative inspiration, it let itself down. And for that reason, there is not a chance.It will be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.Cinematography? Highly likely. Along with all of the other disciplines I listed above. Heck, even Cruise MIGHT get a nomination for his intense military training for the film.When it comes to acting, the overall cast was, as mentioned, immense. Besides John Hamm (or perhaps his character?) letting the whole team down, the acting was extremely solid, with Jennifer Connelly absolutely stealing the show.This was a movie that I would gladly see again in the cinema.In a world overrun by miniature screens, Top Gun: Maverick reminds us that the big screen remains an important part of our cultural heritage.",

But the scenes were nicely done. Sorry ladies, no shirtless volley ball scene though.Top Gun Maverick has turned up the action and FX several notches higher compared to the 80s original. While the original was highly entertaining and a huge box office hit, it was somewhat regarded as a popcorn movie. Top Gun Maverick however, has great action sequences, better dialogue, and a much improved storyline. The corniness of the original has gone.Special effects are first rate. Using excellent CGI renderings for enemy planes, rather than simply using US fighter planes painted with adversary markings and camo schema. Seeing the Russian made Sukhoi SU-57 Felon - a 5th Gen fighter plane - used as the enemy plane made it more engaging to watch. Just don't be too critical on how inaccurate some of the operations were carried out in the movie compared to how the US Navy would really conduct them in the real-world.VERDICT: Top Gun fan or not, Top Gun Maverick is a \"must watch\".",

I like the drama between Maverick and Rooster, showing the two never let go of the past but eventually accept what has happened had happened. The scene between maverick and Iceman was great and sad to see. The scenes in the F-18's are above satisfying to watch and I loved the enemy dogfight sequence where the SU57 misses the missile and surprises Maverick, showing the enemy is more than a challenge to compete against where Maverick risks to even the odds. The ending of this film is one of the most unique conclusions to any film I will ever see in my lifetime. To all the crew and cast of the film well done to what you've accomplished, bringing an amazing sequel packed with action, drama and nostalgia along with a gripping story that demands for attention.",

His call sign: Maverick. \"\nTop Gun Maverick is an outstanding sequel to the legendary original. Tom cruise goes overboard with his gravity defying skills and overachieves in the book of overachievers. He makes you fall in love with Pete Mitchell aka Maverick all over again with his ridiculous exploits and breath-taking flying manoeuvres and makes you wonder how can somebody pull this off even at his age. There is very strong emotional pull resonating throughout which tears into layers of Maverick-Goose relationship. Combine this with mesmerising aerial sequences and a legendary final act - what you are left with is an inexplicable feeling of awe, admiration and respect. As if a flight simulation is luring you into a world of dogfights with those mesmerizing F-18 machines.It almost took 36 years for the sequel of Top gun to come out and no wonder it has arrived in all its magnanimous glory and grandeur. The sequel soars high and is a perfect summer blockbuster. It not only recreates what the original stood for but also breaks barriers and reaches new heights in the arena of filmmaking especially on the stout and able shoulders of Tom cruise.Go for it.

Yep, some 36 years after the original 80s blockbuster, Top Gun gets a sequel, and \"it's good, it's very good\"!...An absurdly ageless Tom Cruise (60?!) re-appears from his cryogenic chamber (no doubt sponsored by the Church of Scientology) as Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, this time heading back to Top Gun in order to train up a new batch of annoying, jingoistic ego-maniac fighter pilots for a mission impossible (doh) against the world's common -unnamed- enemy... and so we take flight once again to destroy some dastardly world destroying hidden nukes (with many updated nods to the original film, including music).Typically, the Cruiser lights up the screen throughout, aptly co-piloted by an on-point supporting cast headed by lovely Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Val Kilmer and stand-out Miles Teller as his old buddy Goose's disgruntled son (you have to suspend the reality that he would be in his 40s now though!).The real star of the show however are the spectacular non-cgi plane sequences, and there are plenty of them! It's a real rocket ride of adrenaline as the 2 hour runtime literally flys by and the need for mindless, nostalgic blockbuster popcorn munchers proudly rises like a Super Hornet in overdrive.Much like the first flick it's big, cheesy, over the top, full of improbabilities... and one helluva 'mach ten' fun ride. A refreshing and much needed change from the overplayed Marvel-verse et al, Top Gun Maverick is one summer blockbuster (and by far the biggest earner of the year) that has and will thrill film fans old and new...So strap yourselves in, disengage brain and enjoy your long awaited flight back into the Danger Zone, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Let's give it up for Tom Cruise. No matter what one thinks of his politics, social life, or general Tom Cruiseacity, the man's career is undeniably one of the most successful in the history of Hollywood. Cruise has helmed some of the profitable films in existence, starting his career with Top Gun and journeying through the Mission: Impossible franchise.His career comes full circle with Top Gun: Maverick, a follow up to the original film which provides exactly what one would expect from a sequel to Top Gun: some fairly mundane melodrama, a new cast of useful idiots, and a stellar gallery aerial combat, sans CGI or digital wizardry. Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski set out to make a blockbuster reminiscent of yesteryear, and their passion is evident with every flight.The film follows Maverick as he's called back into Top Gun to train a new class of recruits for a top-secret and extremely dangerous mission. He must grapple with inflated egos, resistant superiors, and past demons in order to give his new students an opportunity to accomplish their mission and live to see another day. The film is wisely vague about what the actual mission is, focusing instead on the students' journey and learning curves.The film's charm and novelty begins and ends with its aerial scenes. Though they're fewer and farther between than they should be, there are enough to keep the momentum moving and string the extremely thin plot along. They're also completely breathtaking, using real aircraft from the U. S. government and showcasing the latest military technology the States has to offer.The sequences are filmed with clarity and intensity, perfectly kinetic yet easily followable. Cruise performed his own stunts, and the realism is left on the screen, as is the budget. Everything is as big, fast, and loud as an audience could possibly hope for - don't be surprised if recruitment rates spike.Of course, there's a deeply unsettling and stomach-churning truth to these scenes, the film, and the U. S. military as a whole; this technology exists almost exclusively because of the budget allocated to the Pentagon, a budget which is more than $500 billion dollars larger than China's, the next closest. The U. S. military received $801 billion in 2021, compared to just $293 billion by China and $76.6 billion by India, the third largest spender. The U. S. also accounted for thirty-eight percent of the world's military spending, which amounted to $2.2 trillion.These are absolutely staggering numbers, and twice as depressing, as general costs of living in the United States has accelerated at alarming rates. Millions of Americans struggle to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare while the military industrial complex bleeds Congress' purse dry. The taxes meant to improve the conditions of life for all flow directly to the top, accumulating in the hands of a corrupt, insatiable few. Top Gun: Maverick doesn't exactly glorify the military, but it consistently shows off the unbridled military fetishism of the United States, which leaves one with a hollowed out feeling in the mind and stomach. What a waste it all is.Casting aside the reality of a country on the verge of eating itself from the inside, Top Gun: Maverick is an alright film. This follow-up is as simplistic and superficial as the original, but wisely casts aside that film's overwrought mood and frantic filming style, though it can't match its full-bodied, stellar soundtrack. One subtle yet nagging problem with the film is the greater sense of its world, which is unconvincing. When Jon Hamm stares out the window on a stormy night, you can hardly hear the rain.1984's Top Gun feels locked into its era, incredibly cheesy and desperately eager to please the gaggles of teenagers who flocked into the theaters. This film feels similar but in a different way; it aims to please that same gaggle of kids, but understands they've aged and, perhaps, matured. It's not as hot-headed or rebellious as the original but stays true to Maverick's freewheeling and arrogant characterization.Although the film is all but guaranteed to win over crowds and produce at the box office, it probably won't satisfy those looking for a more challenging or complex study. The script is lean and focuses heavily on the story of the original film, taking no risks in terms of new characters or ideas. Like any belated sequel, there's an assumption that, although forty years have passed, characters have made little to no progress in terms of dealing with past mistakes.The conflicts and complications which haunted Maverick still haunt him here, a dour reminder that the man exists solely in the context of Top Gun as a franchise, and not as a living, breathing character with his own interests and life story. And here he is called back, to once again take up the mantle for continued corporate profits.Like every character in cinema today, Maverick is not simply allowed to be his own man - he must be, first and foremost, the ideal Company Man. Like the ties to the U. S. government, this line of thought is not in the foreground, but it does exist, and it is depressing, in a nihilistic, existential way.Top Gun: Maverick is a throwback to the films of old, in all of the best and worst ways possible. It's likeable and makes some ostensible stabs at emotion but is wildly conventional in every element except the flights, which I guess are the real point of the film anyway. There's no denying the artistry and craft on display when the jets are in motion, but the film's story is forgettable and the reality of its production, its explicit ties to the government, are best left forgotten. The film has already done tremendous business in its opening week and will have impressive legs. If, by some miracle, Top: Gun Maverick is the film which harkens in a new era of practical effects, than perhaps audiences won't have to wait another forty years for the completion of the trilogy.",

I myself do not love movies with overly romantic scenes, but the romance depicted here is more nostalgic and at the threshold of being full of heart, almost seeming to be like a true life story.The stunts, visual effects, acting, extremely pulchritudinous.Arguably, this is probably the best movie of 2022 so far, and the best movie so far in a while, when you consider every aspect of a movie in whole.",

I loved every second of it, but that's the problem. It was just a second. I felt that moment especially should've been more monumental. Maverick sacrifices himself for his former copilot's son. Continuing on, I just felt the choice on some aspects of lighting were just off, the use of split lighting was overused and even misused. Instead of dramatic it just felt less personal. Moments where actors are crying, I can barely see them. At the end of the day I would absolutely watch it again, but I do question how some of the shots were taken. Incredible action scenes though.",

More like a reboot than a sequel:\nMaverick is still defying orders and getting away with itThere is still a bar with piano playing, singing and a pretty lady \"will they won't they\" love interest\"Students\" once again don't realise they're dealing with their teacher until the next day's slight embarrassmentHangman is Iceman 2.0.Topless beach handball is now topless beach rugbySomeone almost doesn't make it during an exercise and again Maverick gets them back on track and to base.I liked this film enough, especially the second half of it, but think the first installment had more charm.Top Gun Maverick is not a 10/10 or masterpiece but a good 7/10 worth your time.",

But that doesn't really matter, beacuse Top Gun is doing everything else amazing. It's got a great soundtrack and soundmix, the fighting and the flying sequences is just on a whole other level, you can really feel that this is the real deal. And it has a lot of good drama/emotionell moments, especially between Maverick and Rooster (Goose's son) it was also nice to see that Val Kilmer cameo it was a very heartfelt moment that brought a tear to my eyeTop Gun: Maverick might not be the movie of the year, but it's definitely the blockbuster of the year.",

Yes, compared to the original film, it's as contrived as Luke Skywalkers attack on the Death Star, but part of the contrivance is to provide some wonderful flying shots. Tom Cruise has gone all out on providing aerial action, and there's plenty of reports regarding the boot camp training he put the other actors through to give the viewer the sensation of being there. And it helps that Sony developed Imax compatible cameras small enough they could fit six in a cockpit. Watching on a big screen, with a full Dolby Atmos setup - another suitably stirring soundtrack from Hans Zimmer - is a joy.I think the only disappointment was how much the peril was telegraphed.

Tom Cruise is back as Maverick with Jerry Bruckheimer as producer along with Cruise and Joseph Kosinski taking over as director from the late Tony Scott. This time we see Maverick returning to Top Gun this time as an instructor for a new group of recruits which includes the son of Maverick's deceased friend.The flight sequences in this movie are enjoyable, in fact more than they are in the first movie. I really liked the interactivity between Maverick and Goose's son Rooster and the reasonings behind it. The friction between Maverick and the Top Gun instructors also added to the movie. It was also nice to see Val Kilmer as Iceman and the scene where they reunite was heartwarming.The movie does however have its downsides. The storyline is a fairly simple one. And I didn't find it as thrilling or as impactful as it is made out to be.Overall it is a worthy sequel that is enjoyable and actually better than the first one although if I'm being honest, I don't think it is as great as it is made out to be.",

It's almost a shot for shot, scene by scene remake, which just makes me want to go back and watch the original, since a copy is never as good as the original. I also didn't feel attached to the characters or like I knew them well. But the strength of this film is the cinematography which was better than I expected, especially the in-flight sequences. So, I rate this one a 7/10, on par with the recent \"Jurassic World Dominion.\"",

            "content": "It doesn't happen very often that the sequel to a beloved and iconic film is better. I'd say that Top Gun: Maverick is arguably better than its predecessor for many reasons.Firstly I'd add that my opinion of the 1986 original isn't the same as most people. I didn't grow up with the film it was made 9 years before I was born, I didn't actually see it until I was in my twenties. I liked \"Top Gun\" although I had my issues with certain story elements. Basically I don't have the attachment to the characters or film that someone who was alive when it came out and loved it !For \"Top Gun: Maverick\" I was hoping for more up to date action and aircraft used, more modern story and less of the cheesy romantic elements. That for me, bogged down the original! For the most part I'd say yes that this film lived up to the hopes and expectations I wanted from it, however I do still have issues with it!Tom Cruise and Joseph Kosinski have teamed up yet again and delivered an incredible rollercoaster of a film. Cruise has dominated the blockbuster genre his entire career, arguably starting with \"Top Gun\". At last the technology has caught up to the story that is being told. The original had its hands tied with what action it could shoot for its time.........this film blows not just that film but majority of action films out of the water! Heart-pounding, realistic, slick and jaw dropping from start to finish. Every action scene must have taken months and months of planning for to be executed in this precisely! Hats off the Cruise and Kosinski for breaking barriers technologically to shoot parts of this film.The story is more modern and up date! Hints at what the future holds, that manned aircraft will be a thing of the past soon. (There is a video I saw that explained how the film and Lockheed-Martin teamed up to create that futuristic aircraft at the start of the film, super cool 100% check that out). Gone are the F-14 Tomcats of the original film, with the F-18 (pretty sure its the Super Hornet) taking centre stage! (Although itself being replaced by the F-35 these days). Facing off against the new Su-57, which was awesome to see! The mission is simple but effective and give us the chance to get behind a new, young team to take on this task....that seems almost \"mission impossible\"...haha get it ....its sad I find that amusing!The cast for the most part are great, really bounce off each other and gel really well. Every single character gets a little moment to shine, however some more than others. One of the biggest highlights for me was the cameo of Val Kilmer as Iceman. It as handled incredibly well considering the health issues Kilmer has suffered in his life. Once again showing us a new technology to get around an issue, giving Kilmer his voice back......gave me goosebumps!Cruise, Directing, action, majority of the story and most of the characters worked for me!I have a few negatives, firstly Miles Teller! I dislike this guy more and more every time I see him on screen. Now finding out that he isn't the most likeable person to work with in the world either isn't a surprise. His performance for me doesn't work, feels forced and wooden at times.....Secondly Jennifer Connelly. I love Jennifer as an actress, always brilliant in everything she does and she is good in her role in this film. However for me, the character or relationship with Maverick is not needed and doesn't really achieve anything for the story! I think it was just put into the film to nod back to the original film that had a love story thread! It easily could have been taken out of this film and not been missed!Lastly the ending! Maybe I'm a sour person haha but I was really hoping for a sad ending. I think the story was hinting at it throughout but never payed it off. Maverick dying to me would have done the character justice in the circumstances of this film. Handing the torch over to a new generation of pilots! It would have been bold and worked well.........sadly they went for the easy option ! Although even I'll admit that seeing the F-14 Tomcat at the end was a cool !75% out of 100 ! I would watch this over the original if I was given the chance, not saying the original is bad but this has more going for it in a modern context!",

            "content": "I got my hopes up a bit too high when I saw it had an 8.6 on IMDB. I'd put it at more of an 8.2, which is still a really good rating. Overall, this paid homage to the first film and expanded on its themes in a more mature manner.Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick goes from an ambitious, self-absorbed, flirtatious (well, he's still all of that)... but the point is he had more of a character arc than the first film. He wants to make peace with Goose's son Rooster (who acts towards Maverick with hostility) and he needs to forgive himself and move on. He's torn between Penny Benjamin, who rekindles his motivation, and Adm. Simpson, who justifies an end to his career. Miles Teller's Goose must forgive his father's friend's decision to delay his training and is influenced by Phoenix and Hangman (reminiscent of Ice from the original). It's an adequate arc for both characters (but mainly Maverick) to ground the aerial sequences. I was surprised how many non-aerial scenes I enjoyed. The bar scene, the Iceman reunion, and Pete's visit with Penny all added emotional weight compared to the lackluster story of the original. From a plot perspective, the story and pacing Maverick isn't dramatically different from the original: starting with a semi-perilous aerial scene, transitioning into numerous training scenes with a romantic side plot, and concluding with a combat scene. It's just the filmmaking for Maverick was more successful in just about every way. The Hans Zimmer score immersed me and inspired me in a way I haven't felt since watching Interstellar. It wasn't all electric guitar and rock music. The authenticity of the cinematography and VFX is undeniable. There are interior shots, exterior shots, extreme close-ups and pan-outs. The original didn't lack these qualities; but, due to the dialogue and the capabilities of modern technology, the action scenes were much easier to follow. The final half hour of the film really ramped up the VFX and suspense to a Mission Impossible level; and, I can't help but admit how fun it was to watch those scenes in the theatre. The ending was certainly feel-good (if not a bit cheesy) with Maverick and Goose coming home alive, reconciling with one another, and Maverick going off with Penny. The message of letting go of the past is nothing new in cinema; but, it was the center of a strong story aimed at completing Pete Mitchell's character arc from the first film in a satisfying manner. Complex characters, a cohesive story, and some of the most immersive and suspenseful action scenes in recent times prove that Maverick soars above the original.",

Although, the top marks being given to it by IMDB reviewers and professional reviewers is a bit over the top.The stand-out part of this film is the aerial cinematography. It really does look fantastic. I saw it at home but I think I would have been blown away by it if I had gone to the pictures to see it. The action scenes really are exciting to watch. All this nice action cannot cover up the problems elsewhere. Also, it was lovely to see Val Kilmer.The plot is basic. There's nothing fresh or original about the plot. The love story sub-plot between Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connolly is totally unnecessary. It seems pretty obvious this role was written for Kelly McGillis but she must have refused to return for this film. In that context, it would have made more sense. It should really have been cut from the film.Ejecting from a jet at Mach 10 and not dying? Nonsense!The Top Gun pilots are all as dull as dishwater. Not the larger than life characters we had in the original. The 80's cheesiness is missing. There's very little character work beyond Miles Teller and Tom Cruise's interactions.To sum up, it's a good film that is worth a watch, with beautiful action in the sky but that's all. It's no masterpiece.",

And that music adds very much to this movie. It all breathes 'eighties' again. Which, according to my own opinion' was the era when the most rocking films were made. Somehow films nowadays lack something, even though picture and sound get better and better.But on the other hand... I could not help but get a flashback to Iron Eagle. The story actually is very thin. The recruits weren't ready when Ice died. And suddenly, within a week, they go on a successful mission. They couldn't hit the practicebox laser guided, but on the mission Rooster, hits the target just by hand. I mean, thrilling action, but it's lacks every sense of logic.Also, the relationship with Penny, just seems added because there 'has to be some love in it' It does not add anything to the story, just like their sailing trip and the jumping out of the house.(To be honest, she \u00eds important at one moment, but I won't spoil everything ;-) )Especially of zero importance are the scenes when the missions done. Suddenly Rooster and Mitchell are working in a hangar filled with bikes and a P51 which is his. Where did this come from? What happens then are just poster moments.So this movie leans on action, beautiful fighting scenes and the fame of it's predecessor. Yet it was entertaining. I would give it 6 starts, but since I freaking LOVE that guitartheme, I add one extra star for the music. So 7 stars. Brilliant movie? Hell no, but entertaining? Absolutely, preferably on a big screen and loud speakers of at least decent quality.",

It is honest, exciting and compelling from start to finish and unites contemporary filmmaking with the type of films many of 'us' enjoyed during our early child- and/or adulthood.So, despite of all of his shortcomings, I can only conclude that Tom Cruise is just quite simply the KING of blockbuster cinema.9 out of 10.",

The odds of having a sequel to something and it being even halfway decent is on the brink of impossible when you consider the track record of sequels. Ladies and gentlemen, Top Gun: Maverick is to Top Gun as Terminator 2 was to The Terminator...What Cobra Kai was to the Karate Kid. There is a reason Tom Cruise received a 6 minute standing ovation at the Cannes film festival.What this movie has shown is no matter how much time has passed since a previous film, greatness can always be achieved if the right talent is behind it and the passion is there. Joseph Kosinski, the writers, supporting cast, and of course Tom Cruise hit this out of the park! It was beautifully filmed, well paced, and had some breathtaking action sequences all throughout. The same magic that made audiences obsessed with fighter jets and the Navy/Air Force from the first film was achieved here but in an even greater scale if you can believe it.The film made me appreciate even more the limited scope of time when I saw elements of my childhood on the big screen and it gave so much brilliance and justice. This is one of Tom Cruise's greatest achievements in which he declares I AM STILL ONE OF THE GIANTS. This film at times brought tears to my eyes. It will be the \"!\" to bring people back post pandemic to where movies really matter, the big screen!! Thank you so much to everyone involved and the work that went into this. This film is a masterpiece and boy does it ever pay homage to the original. Many think it's better than the original.

            "content": "After 36 years, we are finally able to watch the sequel to the 1986 Top Gun. I was a little baffled when they announced they were making a Top Gun sequel as I wasn't fond of this idea of making sequels to really old movies for the sake of banking on nostalgia. The first film was pretty great and I just didn't feel like the sequel could be as good as the first one. So is Top Gun: Maverick a cash grab or a worthy sequel?Firstly, the flying scenes are breathtaking! All of these sequences make you feel like you're in the cockpit and air with them. This is because they did it practically by actually having the actors be in these jets for real. The director fitted cameras into these cockpits and attached them to the side of these jets. This allows for some downright amazing shots and makes the scenes feel more believable. The action scenes are just intense and exhilarating with it having me on the edge of my seat. This is especially noticeable in the final act which is one of the best I've seen in recent memory. Additionally, the music score by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga, Hans Zimmer, & Lorne Balfe is very good. I love how they incorporated those 80s tracks into the film while giving more modern and fitting music as well. Furthermore, their music score during the intense action scenes are well done and helps to make the scenes tenser.Tom Cruise is still great as Maverick even after almost 30 years. He still embodies the character perfectly and does feel like a natural evolution of his character from the first film. I genuinely believe that this is what Maverick would be like in 30 years. Miles Teller is also great as Rooster, Goose's son, and he has great synergy with Tom Cruise in their scenes together. Jennifer Connelly plays the new love interest for Maverick, Penny, and she is also great in her role thanks to her great chemistry with Tom. Glen Powell plays the rival to Miles and he is very good at being this overly cocky, hateable guy. Likewise, Jon Hamm plays the commander that is antagonistic to Maverick and he also does a good job at being hateable as well. Val Kilmer is one of the few actors from the original to return and I was interested to see how they would handle his throat cancer situation in real life. Thankfully, this film handles it respectfully and probably results in one of the most emotional scenes in the film. The rest of the supporting cast, including those who play the recruits, all do a good job as well.Moreover, the story itself is also surprisingly enjoyable. The first Top Gun was a cheesy action flick but this one is a very down to earth, character-driven story. Maverick is a lot wiser now thanks to the character arc he got from the first film when he was a student. However, now he has to be the teacher and this is a great antithesis to the story in the first film. The conflict he has now is having to train these recruits to do a suicide mission. He is struggling with the idea of sending other people to their death. It gets worse when one of these recruits is the son of his once best friend. The conflict between Maverick and Rooster is the emotional core of this film. This family dynamic is the most engaging aspect of this film and where the heart of the story lies. Seeing Maverick still trying to cope with the death of Goose and having to deal with the fact that his son could also now die is just captivating stuff.Nevertheless, I do have some minor nitpicks with the film. I do find the dynamic of the recruits never does quite match the dynamic of the recruits from the first film. I never felt as strong of an attachment to the recruits and this is probably due to the film focusing on the teacher Maverick. There is also a romantic subplot with Maverick and Penny that just feels very superfluous. It never felt like the romance part was even connected to anything in the main plot. Heck, you could take this romance subplot and Penny out of the film and the main story is still the same. It just felt like the romance plot just took away screen time from the interesting stuff. I am also a little annoyed that there is no dialogue or line to explain why Maverick isn't with Charlie from the first film anymore. Especially, considering how relevant that character was in the first film.Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is better than the first movie in almost every aspect. It has more amazing action sequences and a more interesting character-driven story. In a world where CGI seems to always be the go-to solution, we then get a rare movie like this where the majority is practical and it is all the better for it. This is not only a worthy sequel but also an amazing accomplishment in movies.",

            "content": "The movie is a worthy sequel to the 1986 original, it pushes all the right emotional buttons and occasionally brought a lump to my throat. I like the film and would see it again.But while the flying scenes are thrilling, you could not help get the feeling that something is being rushed or missed here.The following, which appears elsewhere but is likely to be poorly shared, explains it all:\"While very entertaining to watch, there were several issues with the way the mission was planned and executed that\nwould likely have played out very differently in real life.In the film, Maverick assesses the operational problem based on a quick survey of some photos and determines the method for destroying the target almost instantly. In real life, an entire cell of joint planners would analyze the problem for days if not weeks and come up with multiple courses of action that could achieve the goal, and the decider for a target such as this would probably be the President (since the enemy is very clearly supposed to be Iran).Maverick airily assumes away the stealth capability of the F-35 (as well as Air Force assets such as the B-2), and immediately assesses the job can only be done by F/A-18s for reasons unexplained. There is no discussion of using electronic warfare aircraft and/or cyber attack to shut down or at least hinder the enemy's integrated air defense system.The Navy uses cruise missiles to strike an enemy airfield to keep additional enemy fighters from taking off but does not seem to consider striking the enemy surface-to-air missile systems, radars, and command-and-control nodes by the same method. There is no combat air patrol (CAP) of F-35s to engage enemy fighters and protect the strike aircraft on egress from the target (even if we agree with the basic assumption that F/A-18s were necessary for the strike, F-35s, not more F/A-18s would be the clear choice for the CAP).There is no reason why the strike aircraft would be loaded exclusively with flare countermeasures instead of chaff when the threat was clearly understood to be radar-guided weapons.Finally, the strike aircraft were loaded out with laser-guided bombs requiring a diving delivery, high-G pulloff, and spotting of the target with a laser from the wingman; GPS-guided munitions could have hit the target with a higher probability of success and lower-risk level delivery over the target.All of the above issues added more drama and action onscreen but also severely eroded the military realism.\"",

Who knows exactly how we would feel if it was simply a stand alone film but I think most could enjoy it just as much. It might even be the extremely rare(if not only) occasion where the sequel is better than the original.I still think it is overrated by word-of-mouth but for once you have a film that knows what the appeal is and just gives you that.

The hillside or mountains in the background doesn't really portray how fast or how dangerously low the plane is flying so it's a dismal failure with all the cameras in the cockpit.

No, he is not a loser, he is just a nice little bright soldier who stood his ground and did not want to assume bigger responsibilities, let alone become a politician.While the loser approach might have been interesting it is certainly not what people would have welcomed, whereas pure nostalgia of teenage years, with barely a couple of bad memories to put to bed, that is the easy way. As a result Capt. \"Maverick\" Mitchell is just a veteran teen who happens to still be nice and candid about everything well passed 50y.Bottom line: a sugary nostalgia designed for those with a sweet tooth; otherwise it is a boring actioneer replete with heavy references taking our breaths away for a very long exposition.",

Instead, what I saw was virtually a line-by-line, scene-by-scene remake of the original.Obviously the actors have changed, but the story has not. It's literally a remake, right down to the wardrobe and locations.If you never saw the original Top Gun, this will be a really decent movie to see.

And honestly, if Top Gun: Maverick was the original 1984 movie, I would totally understand the praise. Top Gun Maverick is a great film, and is one of the most tense in a while. While modern films use tons of CGI, the practical effects in this movie serve in it's favor, making it one of the most memorable theater experiences in a while. And it's not just that either.The characters in this film were also very enjoyable. The arc Maverick and Rooster went on, while a little rushed, was fleshed out enough to make it satisfying. Val Kilmer also did a great job in this movie. And the side characters, while forgettable, had their own charm to them.The story can also get a little predictable, but is still engaging from beginning to end, and had a solid amount of depth. One more thing I want to say is that the editing in it was also superb.Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is a great summer blockbuster with thrills, heart, and charm. One of the few films nowadays that you must see in a theater.",

Definitely not but close, I give it a 88/100, while the original got a 95.No wonder all people these days love this softened remake more than the old one. It fits perfect to the IG/Toktok 2022 generation where everything has to be beautiful and so is the movie .. romantic, beautiful, gorgeous everything is good looking, no good guy dies in battle, it can't be a better fit in modern times .. cheesy predictable, amazing popcorn cinema .. well done .. they delivered imho a gorgeous softcore version of togun. I still prefer Lenny to Lady Gaga, and a GPZ900R to a H2.Still this movie is great entertainment and yes Everything Everywhere All At Once is nearly in every way better just not as gorgeous and good looking, well the IG generation gets what they deserve :) ..",

It is only then you'd find out something is very wrong. I have only so often wondered what happened to his career and why it tanked in the second decade, but was never too curious to actually find out. And it is a week after watching Maverick, I got to watch Kilmer's own documentary on his life - Val. And that's a sad story to watch, mind you. And it is only then you'd find out there's more wrong in Cruise's 1000 carat smile that seem to not have aged a day since 1986, sitting right next to Kilmer, who looks barely alive. That comparison is grotesque in many ways.Now, I don't pity him by any means, nor am I patronizing one of the greatest actors. But in the light of said documentary, it feels like the movie does so. So I'm confused here. Movie's entertainment value is okay, it's a nice watch. And that paycheck will probably help Kilmer tie a couple of loose ends.

The original Top Gun is iconic for a lot of people born between 1970 and 1990, maybe even beyond!Honestly, I have never met a person that has watched the original and didn't like it.With Tony Scott's passing this sequel seemed like it would never get done, but step in Joseph Kosinski who had a relationship already with Cruise, who didn't want to do the movie. I could definitely see why Cruise signed up for this.Yes, the movie isn't perfect. Yes, the plot is a bit thin and there isn't a lot of (if any) character or plot twists, but the executions was something else.Cruise steps into the Maverick skin like he's never left it. Absolutely perfect here.The new roster of pilots aren't groundbreaking but some strong performances there and overall group chemistry pull it through.Lots of practical effects and real flight shots of the actors actually flying in jets (not piloting, naturally).A third act that was straight out of a Bond movie also spiced things up a bit.I really do hope they go on and make more movies like this one in terms of the production and using CGI only when absolutely necessary.Don't get me wrong, I am not advocating they continue reviving old franchises for sequel/prequels, but more make original movies set in these times and use more real props and locations.Over the last 20 years CGI has become so so overly-used that some movies border on computer games, and as much as people don't want to admit it, it still doesn't look close to real!Big thumbs up for the crew involved in Top Gun: Maverick and go see it in the cinema, you won't be be disappointed.",

We can only do this with manned airplanes, and Maverick has to train the pilots.SPOILERS:If you think about it later:It was really fortuitous that Cruise and Teller crashed within a hundred feet of each other.It was even more fortuitous that they crashed within a short distance of the enemy air base. Like less than a mile over easy ground.Our carrier seemed to be sailing by itself, without the usual carrier group.And the admiral in charge of mission operations did not seem to have air cover; rather, he had planes all over the flight deck, pretty much like Yamamoto in losing at Midway.

I was very pleasantly surprised. This is better than the original and one of Tom Cruise's best films. The character development really reaches back to the original film and carries through beautifully through the end of this one. Cruise's character is much more flawed here - still an amazingly good pilot but not good at much else. He never moved up the ranks and is still a Captain. He never got married or had kids. He does have a nice bike but, hey he's had a job all these years so it's no surprise he could afford a nice bike especially since he doesn't even seem to own a house or much of a wardrobe.The plot here is really great and the special effects actually work in the service of the plot, not the other way around. Of course the events lack credibility and the characters have plot armor but that's minimal criticism for a pretty standard Hollywood film. If Hollywood made more films like this they would be in a much better place. Please pay attention to why this film was so successful, Hollywood! Make good stories about credible, relatable characters that have flaws like real people. Don't shoehorn contemporary political messages/ideas into every story -virtually no-one wants that!Thank you, Tom Cruise for staying true to the purpose of entertainment and telling a great story here.",

I left the theater feeling just a little bit cooler than I felt before, just for an instant, as if I were part of something bigger.Granted, I did not enjoy the original \"Top Gun\". But this sequel surpassed my expectations-of sequels in general, but especially as the sequel to a movie that I do not particularly enjoy.I especially liked how Maverick took the audience with the pilots into training to teach us something while toning down the \"broness\" of the original that I found so unappealing. Maverick is funny while retaining some emotional depth and gravitas gained from its source material. And the stakes in Maverick are still high. In this case it is not so much the anonymous enemy that keeps tensions high, but the fight against physical limits, the natural constraints that we battle against to reach our target. These are the qualities that make Top Gun Maverick a truly captivating movie to watch.Definitely would recommend.",

So many of the scenes were lifted right out of the first one and so little was added that I didnt feel like I was watching a Sequel so much as a remake. Tom's still out racing jets on his motorcycle, being a rebel, and daring to do what no one else can. But ultimately they take zero chances with this version of Top Gun preferring to stick to script and for that it's hard for me to rate it any higher.I do like to think Penny is \"Penny the admiral's daughter\" from the first Top Gun. Maybe that's a nod to the nostalgia I felt for seeing the Top Gun story being dusted off after so many years. If you are going to dismiss McGillis' character with zero fanfare then I would hope her replacement was waiting in the shadows so she has some connection to original.Ultimately a feel good movie that looks even better than the first, comes close to capturing the same magic, but like most imitations just isn't as good.",

It's like ripping out the cliff notes of a good book and only reading them, but moreso it's like the mission Tom Cruise led his pilots on: the mission was to vertically clear the mountain on the way out at the End of the mission in order to succeed, but for the movie during that ending, the aircrafts never quite cleared the peak to be truly great. It did reach the good range though, and for movies today, maybe that's the best they can do since it seems it's all been done before.6/10.",

The dialogue is utter drivel.If I was to watch this again, I'd fast forward to the last 30 mins for the action.The romance element is totally unnecessary. The dialogue is vomit inducing & the acting is so amateurish & embarrassing.I'm a huge fan of Tom but when you compare the scripts from his MI franchise to this, you'll know what I mean.If you're a fan of the first, you'll enjoy this but too \"naff\" for me but the flying is worth watching. I'm more interested in watching the making of it.My 5 score is all for the pilots & action & the minus 5 is for the none action scenes. I would've walked out but I wanted to see the stunts.5/10.",

            "content": "Top Gun Maverick is a nice binocular: sink into your cinema seat with a Grolsch Blond. There are some nice references to the original Top Gun: Penny, the son of Goose, an Iceman who is now critically ill, sports on the beach and an old, discarded F-14. Furthermore, the action images of the F-18 are great, there seems to be little to no CGI used. For the rest it is a stereotypical American white tough man film: fast motorcycles, leather jackets, sunglasses, the yearning bachelor with daughter, whose father is as yet unknown. On the beach we see almost only bare muscular (white) male bodies. One of the few black men, a wimpy assistant, has to keep his t-shirt on, probably because of his tummy. The storyline is wafer-thin: a potential uranium deposit somewhere has to be defused. It is not known exactly where and who the conscious enemy actually is. This was probably done deliberately, so as not to disrupt any international political relations. Of course, the mischievous Maverick is the hero: he gets the job done and briefly shows how it's done. Tensions between him and Goose's son are topped off when Maverick is rescued by him by shooting down a number of aircraft belonging to the unknown enemy. Top Gun Maverick is the time-honored story of the Real American Hero, and the recent war in Ukraine may have provided the need for it. In 1986 we still had the cold war to fall back on, today we have a different setting on the battlefield.",

The time between films offered a fantastic opportunity to introduce character development and create something refreshing, but this opportunity was wasted to dogmatically follow familiarity at all costs. Whether its the music, the scenes, the characters, or the plot, Top Gun: Maverick tries to ensure that no deviation be taken from the original film. We're left with an identikit, unoriginal, and soulless piece of film.Watching both Top Guns is like eating a starter and a main and being disappointed when you find out they're the same dish.",

This seemed like a good intro on its own, but I'll probably have to go back and see what I missed.I went for IMAX, a few seats up from the front and it felt like you were right in the movie. Really awesome action, plot, dialogue, cinematography, sound effects, action scenes, the flight scenes, combat and dog fighting were amazing. I will go back for a rewatch I think. I had been waiting for this movie for ages but it kept getting delayed due to Covid. However it looks like they've used this time well to polish it up into the masterpiece it is.I am sure they used F/A-18s because none of the US's 5th gen fighters (F-22 or F-35) can take front and back seat pilots. Without the back seats there would be no film because the actors weren't allowed to pilot the real planes. However for someone with knowledge of fighter aircraft it seemed like it was shoehorned into the movie. Also the old F-14 was shoehorned as a throwback to the old Top Gun movies, but it was unrealistic because how did the Russians get a hold of one in the first place, also it would not reasonably have taken out so many 5th gen Su-57s. So some unbelievable aspects there. I think if there is another Top Gun sequel, maybe they can train real Airforce or Navy F-22 or F-35 fighter pilots to be actors, rather than actors to be Top Gun pilots. Food for thought. However Cruise can fly a plane for real and I want him in the sequel so he needs to be trained to fly these 5th gen fighters as well.",

Top Gun Maverick falls flat in the middle. While Jennifer Connelly is easy on the eyes her and Cruise have no chemistry. The rest of the cast is forgettable as well. Besides the fight scenes there's nothing original. If a sequel was going to be made it needed to be done 5 years after not 30 years later.

And finally the film hit the theaters on 27th June 2022. It was almost 35 years after the first film Top Gun released in 1986 which was my all time fav film and must have seen over a dozen times. The film had great actors' ensemble Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Tom Skeritt, Tim Robbins and a special apperance of Meg Ryan. All wonderful starcast. To add a more spice to the fast paced movie, it had a wonderful soundtrack and music composed by Harold Faltermayer and songs by famous singers and rock bands like Kenny Loggins, Teena Marie, Cheap Trick, Miami Sound Machine, Berlin (You take my breath away) and of course the great Top Gun Anthem composed by Harold Faltermayer.With all this aspects, yesterday we went to see Top Gun Maverick, with so many questions in mind. Does the new film have all same starcast ? Except Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer. Was there any replacement of stars ? What about the soundtrack and music of the film ? How about the dog fight scenes in the films ? The excitement of watching the film was at its peak. Goosebumps all over during watching film. The film also gave a nostalgic feeling in the the opening credits and opening scene with same Top Gun anthem played as in the first film, Meg Ryan appears for some time in a flashback scene. There is a good and refreshing entry of Jennifer Connely and Miles Teller as the \"Rooster\". Tom Cruise the \"Maverick\" is fantastic as ever. Val Kilmer as the \"Ice\" gave brilliant and a small appearance. The dialogs between Maverick and Ice makes you emotional. There are fast paced and beautifully shot flight scenes of F-18 jet planes, partcularly the jets flying in the canyons and the dog fights and the ariel combats. The soundtrack of film is spendid and best part is that the original Top Gun Anthem is retained in the film. Hans Zimmer joins with Harold Faltermayer to compose the music, songs and the background scores of the film. All and all a wonderful experience to watch the film in the theater. For all those Top Gun fans out there, will find 3 types of Goosebumps, pre-movie, during the film and post-movie. A must watch film for all !!!!",

            "content": "This is the kind of cockpit footage you can get in real training and the theatre of war shown in many documentaries. Top Gun Maverick like Mission Impossible is strictly a money making venture; it has little entertainment or informational value and bears little resemblance to actual military activities.Fact: non-military personnel are NOT permitted to fly military assets. Tom Cruise was NOT sitting in the cockpit flying these aircraft as it appears in the movie! He sat in the back mugging the camera. You're better off watching the TV series Seal Team which at least includes some actual Seal members and a well informed and accurately written script.So, it's a Tom Cruise vehicle, people, little more. Set aside your TC idol worship and this is at best a movie about an unreal military operation with zero chances of success, until of course, the hero of the day comes out of retirement (unbelievably) and sucks up camera time. Kelly McGillis avoided this stinker, but Jennifer Connelly took the big money. Even the cameo from Val Kilner is dubbed as he is unable to speak. Did you wonder why Cruise, sitting thoughtfully speaking to the camera introduces the movie? Why is he out of character? This never happens at the beginning of a movie, right? He knew this was not a great movie and wanted, disengenuously, to thank you for donating to his production company and ingratiates himself to win you over. Did you think he really gives a s*** about your loyalty to sit through his movie? There are fine films out there that sometimes go wanting, that tell great stories and can be truly entertaining without insulting history, science, facts, or you, and it is a shame that their production companies cannot afford multi-million dollar advertising campaigns to promote quality film-making... and that truly is a shame. You as a viewer have to seek out hidden gems (and there are plenty) and support them. And every time you pay to see mega dollars being spent on TC closeups and totally unrealistic action scenes, you contribute to the making of further productions of this kind of chest-beating, Ra Ra, bomb-the-bad-guy-in-some-rogue-state mentality.Don't spend your post COVID money on this nonsense. And remember the ratings for this movie come from two main sources: young minds who are yet unable to see how transparent this movie is, and two, millions of dollars spent on promotion saturating TV, and print media extolling the virtues of the next fantastic TC movie (read: hundreds of millions spent, must be good, need to recoup investment).",

It is a clear 'remake' of the original with a storyline that has countless references, direct and subtle.For Cruise to STILL be in the NAVY after being denied promotion or having rank reduced is simple not going to happen. Then to simply hop into an f-14 that is fueled, armed and ready to go is absurd to anyone who know flight operations. Then to have a Tomcat beat an F-35, or equivalent is equally absurd. (I wonder if the use of the F-14 was a jab at Iran, since they are the only ones who even use F-14s anymore.)The flying scenes are truly incredible and if you go for that alone, you won't be disappointed. (But spare me the Tom Cruise statement at the beginning of the movie that the F-18s and the 'Gs' ae real. The actors obviously didn't experience the high G's based on the skin on their faces not moving.)So the bottom line for me is the story is terrible, but the flying saves the film.

Kinda cliche, actually: Cruise fighting against the end of his career; the manned fighter pilot program being phased out by drones; and a love interest who has zero depth.And, for all the talk of the amazing aerial footage, my favorite shot was the straightforward take-off sequence of Cruise's plane launching from the carrier ship. That was probably one of the least technical shots to film, but it looked (and probably was) totally real.Oh well, get your popcorn and strap in for an assault on your senses, complete with flashbacks and long looks at old photographs of Goose and Iceman...***SOMEWHAT RECOMMENDED***p.s.

So I watched this movie.This movie has a well done characters development, that has their own past, story and individuality. Each one has different mind construction and meanings. It just... the characters are unique.The action sequences are amazing, I don't even know how was the production for the action sequences, but, it makes difference in the narrative. Mostly for Maverick (Tom Cruise), that is the MC (obviously). Because it's him that determinate what will happen(mostly). It not just him, the other characters too, but a lot of time, Maverick chance the direction of the story.What I like the most was the cinematography, which is really subjective, focusing their emotions. This film don't make it really explicit what they mean, we know just for seeing their faces, expressions, movements and all.The direction was really good too for framed the sequences so well done. It was just like that this movie had a lot of wallpapers inside! But not only beautiful, but told a story.But this movie has some problems. Which are that the Maverick, for me, is perfect (in general), don't have many flaws, he just could make some impossible things without fail. I say that cause it makes more believable and reliable. Like \"The Batman\" (2022), which can fail a lot of times and even lose the battle. Top Gun Maverick don't have those flaws, Maverick just do the tricks easily, just for fanservirce (in my opinion). The flaws don't make it bad, it just exists.Lastly, Top Gun Maverick is a good watch, solid. One of the best movies of the year!!!!!",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is just a fun movie, taking great lengths to ensure a truly cinematic experience, Tom Cruise's attention to detail and passion can be felt throughout. I'd never seen a Topgun movie before, but this just made me a fan. Maverick abandons the idea of capturing the feeling of a time period like how its predecessor did. OG Top gun is filled to the brim with 80's energy, while Maverick feels more timeless, harkening back to the past instead of living within it, and of course, it does, it's a sequel, that's what it's supposed to do.But without the focus on capturing any sort of period, Maverick has a lot more runtime to focus on other areas, and oh, does it use that time well. All Top Gun: Maverick centers around one mission, and builds up the tension and its characters to give the death-defying flying much more impact. This way of centering everything around a singular goal works well for Maverick, it gives everything a definitive reason for happening and gets the audience invested.(Something I feel the original lacked.). The plot is not perfect though, I feel that some characters were just forgotten about and their stories didn't end up going anywhere. However, the biggest flaw has to be the lackluster side-story.The relationship between Maverick and Penny is a low part, while it's not inherently bad, it just lacks when compared to whats around it. I enjoyed what it did for Maverick's character, and how it gave the tone and pacing a break so that the audience wasn't overwhelmed with action and high stakes. But some of the scenes just feel like they could have just been cut from the movie without changing much, these scenes don't move any plot points forward or connect back to the theme in any meaningful way. So that just leaves these moments empty and lacking compared to the rest of the film.Top Gun: Maverick has an air of quality and dedication to it. More So than anything it wants to celebrate the legacy of its predecessor, it doesn't get caught up in trying to replicate it, honor its fans of it with fake CGI recreation of past characters, or put too much emphasis on past ideas the original already explored. This is Top Gun put on another level, walking out of the theater I'm sure the emotions I felt were nearly identical to that of the audience of the OG back in the 80s. While I won't say Maverick feels \"21st century\" in the same way the original feels \"80's\", It has all the other things audiences love, now with the volume cranked up. Flying scenes are more energetic and dynamic, the plot tells an interesting story that is now better paced and written, and characters are more fleshed out without losing inherent appeal and instant likability. Most of the cast wasn't explored very much, but I still consider Maverick to have a superb cast, both because of the actors' top-notch performances, and the dialogue, which sets the tone and shows the characters' personalities perfectly.I loved how Top Gun: Maverick made callbacks and handled the source material in its plot, instead of overt and cheesy callbacks that feel out of place, Maverick instead slips in little continuities with the original that only fans will notice. In particular, I have to commend the writers for plotting around Val Kilmer's (Iceman) condition respectfully and realistically.Any complaints I can make amount more to missed potential than actual flaws which hamper the experience, Top Gun: Maverick is a movie that plays on its strengths and downplays its weaknesses to create a film that, while nowhere near perfect, will stick with audiences for years to come and change the perceived level of quality movies should have.",

Major props to Tom Cruise for still being such an impressive leading man. This movie makes you stop and admire what an awesome career he has had and how he's still going strong after decades of performing.The goal of the creators was to tell a compelling and impactful story, and they succeeded. It is very respectful of the original while still feeling very modern. It has just the right amount of references and throwbacks to the first film, and every one of these references mean something to this story. On top of all this, the music is beautiful and amps up the appropriate emotions throughout. As soon as I saw Hans Zimmer's name pop up in the opening credits, I knew the score would be wonderful.

So Maverick has huge shoes to fill and the shoes got filled alright!First, this movie breathes nostalgia especially regarding the brotherly relationship Maverick had with Goose. After all those years, Maverick hasn't still completely moved on from the tragic death of his best friend. It still haunts him to the high point especially now that Goose's son, Rooster, is following his dad steps and became one of the top pilots in the navy. The story between Maverick and Rooster is so rocky it breaks your heart as Rooster believes Maverick is preventing him from achieving his true potential while all Maverick wants is to protect him and be the father Rooster lost too early.Then you have the come-back of Iceman who has moved up to the ranks and became the commander of the US Pacific Fleet as a full fledged admiral. He has become Maverick best friend and has been using his position to protect him and keep him in the navy as he believes that the Navy needs Maverick. Watching Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise interacting with each other so sweetly and still joking around about who is the best pilot can't stop bring you a smile. It also breaks your heart when Iceman finally passes away as you cry along with Tom Cruise as he buries his wingman.Finally there is the F-14. The cherry of the top as we see Maverick and Rooster in one last epic dogfight taking on 2 Su-57 in this mighty aircraft. That scene alone is a blast, keeps you out of breath every second as it's so intense and breathtaking. The F-14 is still as gracious as it can be and that plane still can fly.Of course the F-18 is also as majestic. What a beautiful plane that is. I'm glad they picked that plane instead of the F-35 which is not as gracious on camera. I believe it would have taken a lot of magic off the movie if it was the F-35 on screen instead of the F-18.Finally I have to give one last special mention to Lady Gaga for her amazing song. I love it so much and it gives such a powerful ending to the movie with the P-51 flying around in the sunset. Such a raw talent she is.",

He's a \"Navy Aviator.\" Nothing more, nothing less. The movie starts off with him reaching Mach 10 in an X series aircraft despite Admiral Caine's orders to cancel the mission due to the shutdown of Mavericks program in favor of unmanned aircraft. The Navy continuously reminds Maverick that it sees him as nothing more than a relic of the past and not part of its intended future. But due to his \"Guardian Angel\" Ice Man, he's sent back to Top Gun to teach the modern elite navy aviators how to accomplish and survive a seemingly impossible Mission. In the the process of all this, he's faced with two other challenges, restoring a relationship with one of his former love interests Penny, and reconnecting with Rooster, the son of Mavericks best friend Goose. With the death of Ice, the Navy aimed to bury Maverick for good, until he proved to the Navy he was the only one who did a successful test run of the mission. Reluctantly, Cyclone makes Maverick the team leader. Maverick chooses Rooster as his wingman. After successfully bombing the target, the pilots are attacked by SAM missiles. After Rooster runs out of countermeasures, Maverick moves to protect him and gets shot down in the process. Maverick safely ejects. Rooster goes back for Maverick, and shoots down the Gunship trying to kill Maverick. After Rooster gets shot down by another SAM, Maverick regroups with him and the two Men go to the enemy Airfield that was previously bombed by allied Tomahawk Missiles. In perhaps my favorite part of the movie, Maverick and Goose(excuse me...Rooster) escape in a enemy owned F-14 Tomcat. They go toe to toe with two SU-57 fighters, and downed both of them after a hard fought and incredibly awesome dogfight. But a third one gets behind them and nearly kills them. But another one of Mav's students \"Hangman\" intercepts the tailing SU-57 and saves them. Mav reconnects with Rooster in the end and restores his relationship with Penny, and the movie ends with Maverick Flying his P-51 Mustang in the sunset. It's a beautiful story that concludes the legendary duo franchise in a unexpected big way. The Cinematography and VFX were good. But the big winner for the creative elements for me was the music by non other than Lorn Balfe, one of Hans Zimmers prot\u00e9g\u00e9's. This film was a delight to see and a smashing good time at the movies. I intend to edit this review in a years time with a 10/10 rating. Just until I figured out that my few and unimportant negative concerns that I will not disclose were just misunderstandings.",

It follows up all the \"patriotic hero\" which we are all used to, such as countless other movies from the 90's - same old narrative: the impossible quest, the renowned hero who doesn't follow the rules, the general who doesn't like him (at the beginning), the one who is always supportive and, of course, the beautiful lady who has always been enchanted by him and, at the end, stays with him (which is obvious, from the beginning, reason why I do not consider it a spoiler).Although, I still recommend it, 'cause, as I said, it does bring that sense of nostalgia and does do the job when it concerns to entertainment.But... be advised: do not expect to be shocked, amazed or fascinated. It does deliver entertainment, but that's all, in my humble opinion.",

            "review_title": "A Good Sequel to an Outstanding Action Film",
            "content": "This film essentially begins with Navy aviator \"Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell\" (Tom Cruise) now working as a test pilot on a project designed to evaluate the capability of a protype jet designed to travel at Mach 9. Problems occur, however, when a senior Navy officer named \"Rear Admiral Chester 'Hammer' Cain\" (Ed Harris) lets it be known that, unless the prototype aircraft can reach a speed of Mach 10, he plans on cancelling everything in favor of drones. Not only that, but it is also learned that he will be arriving at the test site very soon to make the announcement in person. To that effect, rather than allowing the project to be terminated, Maverick makes boards the protype with the stated intention of flying it at Mach 10-regardless of whether the airplane can handle the stress or not. Sure enough, he achieves his goal but, as is often the case, he recklessly tries to gather even more speed-which results in total engine failure and him having to eject in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Infuriated by all of this, Rear Admiral Cain considers ending Captain Mitchell's career but is prevented from doing so when orders come through transferring Maverick to the Top Gun school for a special assignment. When he gets there, however, he is disappointed to learn that, rather than being designated to fly on this top-secret assignment, he has been detailed to train several younger pilots instead. Not only that, but one of the pilots by the name of \"Lieutenant Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw\" (Miles Teller) has been nursing a personal grudge against Maverick for some time and, in the course of the training, it spills over for all to see. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good sequel due in large part to the excellent action scenes and a solid performance by Tom Cruise in the lead role. Admittedly, I would have preferred a bit more personal chemistry between Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly (as \"Penny Benjamin\") who has proven herself quite capable of handling a role in that regard. Likewise, the ending could have used a bit more realism as well. Be that as it may, while I don't consider this film to be quite as good as its predecessor, it was still entertaining in its own right, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

Those who don't, me included, may think this is either a decently entertaining popcorn flick or a dumb piece of cinematic fast food. Or maybe it can be both those things at the same time.And let's call this what it really is. It's not a sequel -- it's a reboot. It nearly recreates the original movie scene by scene (we even have to have a character with a mustache!) when it's not ripping off the \"Star Wars\" Death Star trench run wholesale.Tom Cruise never ages, and that seems creepy to me. It's refreshing for once to see Jennifer Connelly in a sexy role, and boy does she try hard to be sexy. She practically licks Tom Cruise's face every time they have a scene together. You can tell this movie really wishes that nothing since around the year 2000 had happened and that the world still wants nothing but movies about macho white guys saving people. But it also understands that it has to at least pretend to be progressive, so hey look, there's a woman pilot! There's a black guy! How far we've come!Grade: B+",

He couldn't pick him up, he was flying at the speed of sound!!When Rooster was shot down and somehow landed 3 meters away from Maverick, how were they able to just walk onto a military base which was on high alert. (Stupid)What are the odds they would find an old F14 which was fully operational? (A billion to one)Not only that, how did this ancient fighter plane defeat two next gen fighters with ease! (Ridiculous)They even said, barely anyone will survive this operation, yet they all made it, easily.What country were they even fighting?FYI, Nato also has uranium plants doing the same thing but nobody attacks us!Wait, wait a minute, are we the bad guys?However, the pilot and fighter plane scenes were incredible.If you have the IQ of a carrot this film could be enjoyable.If you are going to watch this OK movie, disengage brain first.",

I always hoped for a sequel, especially after my own time serving our country.Top Gun: Maverick not only didn't disappoint, but it greatly surpassed my expectations. I loved the ode to the original while creating and advancing a new story line. I loved how Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is just a more grown up version of his 24 yo self. I loved how they brought in Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky and paid tribute to Val Kilmer's real life struggles. I loved how they made Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw look so much like his \"old man.\" I loved how they brought in \"and one rear admiral's daughter\"...Penny Benjamin and made the love story sweet and not gaudy. I loved the music...especially that first intro that mirrors the original. Finally, I loved how real all the flying scenes were. Holy cow! My head moved along with the jets and I felt immersed. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I loved...I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen for your first viewing.

            "content": "This was the best movie I have seen in decades!! The way they marry the past and the present was perfect. I just didn't know if they would be able to but they did! This movie has alot of heart. It tells the human side of things. The feelings the friendships the love. Pete mitchell is legend but he gets treated so badly by his commanders for what seems to be no reason. So we see the humble side of him. He gets to show the newbies how its done. He has dedicated his life to being a fighter pilot,an aviator for the navy. It's what he does so when he addresses them he says forgot about what you think you know. Tommorow I wanna see what you got then after that you can decide if you want to learn from me. Bam! So good. The scene where Gooses kid is at the piano really got me. It was so powerful cause that is the way we remember him and here is his son playing on that same piano. God, I cried so many times in this movie but that's a good thing. It means they brought out the real emotion and that is hard to do. I was emotional through the whole thing. That's why i said it has heart it tells the story and gets to the real emotions. I like the way they start the whole thing off with him on his motorcycle looking at the planes and riding. He did that in the first one if you remember. One of my favorite scenes. It's saying here I am same guy just many years later. There is alot being conveyed there.i wonder if people got that. He is saying I'm still a young man in my mind and I'm happy and right where I'm supposed to be. I remember a line from the first one that Tom Skerrit said when they were supposed to be mad at him for breaking the rules. He said If you were in a real dogfight who would you want up there with you? That is what Maverick is all about. Bending the rules ,pushing the barrier,pushing the envelope all to get the job done. Doesn't matter if it's never been done before or if someone approves or disapproves of it. Like he said you think up there your dead. He gets the job done. I do the same in my own job and he might have had something to do with that. I'm 51 so I was fifteen in 86. I had been a part of concert choir in school and we had rehearsed a song for six months to get it exactly right. It was in 85 in Plano,TX The song? You've Lost that loving feeling.yes that song. So I came out of my seat in 86 when they started to sing that.lol. I was like NO WAY! I could go on and on about how wonderful this movie is but I think I said the important stuff.",

But it has emotional and meaningfull parts throughout the whole movie which really keeps you invested continously, even besides the amazing action scenes. Also important is that they did not overcomplicate the \"mission\" in the movie. The mission is explained early on, and is deepened and elaborated on as the team gets closer to the end. So you really follow the characters in their journey. My only mark is that sometimes in the action sequences they tend to put the characters in the most impossible situations. If you think that they managed to just squeeze themselves out of a tight spot, there comes an even bigger threat. This filt a bit too much once in the film for me, but it was over quite fast again, so no big issue. But overall: a must watch!",

Captain tom doesnt look a year older, neither do i ...thats in my head...allthough the magnificent air rides and combat scenes at mucho macho bringing ahead the same nauseaus gutfeeling that i have at the funfair ''merry go around'', there are some deadzones that took parts of the show near the ledge of boredome, its okay with flashbacks but when goose is gone he is gone, and the romantics between jen and tom do feel daft, cause the lady aint the same as it used to be, and is tom the father of jens daughter...?Casting the roles bears signs of dignitary spacialmade contracts , among them are ed harris, my gawd there are 1000's out there that couldve done that caracter, so why him. Kilmer is another story, he's living on the latter days of his life, and had a main role in the original top gun movie, and therefore an honour to see again, i can recommend the biopic documentary about vals fight against the cancer, that is a superb piece of muggblood disfortune history when epiglotal cancer hits hard.Also some of the newbies couldve had other actors, but elaborating that makes this review far to long.So a riveting airshow, accompanied by goosebumpraising original score by zimmer and faltermaier made me bounce back to the glorious 80's, taking the big dive into the abyss when the end credits and aula lights came on and observing that i couldve been greatgranddad to 95% of the audience, my gawd what a backstroke that was. But my better half eased a bit of that feeling afterwards, i just wish i had those talents of mr krus.A must see in the theater movie it is, dont wait for the net-release is the grumpy old mans advice.",

Didn't get a chance to watch on the big screen however, for the love of Grumman F14, bought the VHS cassette and kept as collectible while my family didn't even had the color TV, what more the VHS player. This is how nostalgic the TopGun franchise to me for the past 35 years. Because of TopGun, i visited San Diego Kansas City Barbecue, bought a couple of T-shirts and baseball cap. I got the same Rayban aviator and navy jacket worn by Pete Mitchell. I got Kawasaki GPZ superbike but too bad i do not have Maverick's look. 3 weeks ago I got myself a ticket for today 1st show on local Imax cinema. I wetted my eyes through out the movie. There are too many sensible memories brought back from the original Topgun. It is a good thing that the movie trailers keep some of the hidden gems.. not exposing too much. If you know what i mean as most of us the TopGun fans were stressing our thoughts whether if \"he\" is coming back??? The air shooting with the intense facial expression simply astonishing! Tom Cruise and his team ultimately nail it. The old and new soundtracks and scores matched perfectly in this movie. The assortment of the story blended very nicely and i just could not find any flaw from the entire 120min movie runs. All the lead aviator younglings reflected just how exactly the US Airforce really mean business. This is my first time I rated a flat 10 for movie review.",

Revealing the pilots' call signs was the laziest exposition I've ever seen in a movie. \"Here comes A and B and C!!\" and then we never hear about them again. In the first movie, you learn their names from their helmets and from the training sequences. Who is the enemy? Ffs just say it was North Korea. \"Fifth generation fighter\" is used half a dozen times. You don't even have a name for the enemy jet? The pilots are joking around way too much in the cockpits. It felt like an Avengers movie with the heavy-handed jokes. The two main characters eject in enemy territory and just waltz right onto the enemy flight line and steal a plane. Ridiculous. This was just an excuse for Tom Cruise to fly in a jet one more time before he gets too old. It gets 2 stars cuz the action sequences were mildly exciting. This movie has no heart. No soul.",

I saw this follow up more out of a lack of something better to do, rather than any real desire - but I was pleasantly surprised about how much I enjoyed it.After years as a test pilot, Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) returns to the 'Top Gun' aviation school to teach a group of the Navy's best pilots. Rather than just general improvement though, Mitchell is tasked with getting them ready for a specific mission, to destroy an underground nuclear bunker belonging to a hostile force. The decision of which pilots to send on this dangerous mission is made more difficult when Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller) the son of his late co-pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards), is one of the class.Whilst I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is one of my favourite films, I don't think it's even the best film I've seen this week, I would say that Maverick redresses my two problems with the original film. There's an actual story to this one, rather than just a bunch of unconnected scenes. The film builds to an actual mission, which we get to see, rather than just a completely random encounter. The paying off of the relationship between Maverick and Bradley is alright and the interactions with Jennifer Connelly's character and the returning Val Kilmer are nicely done.The dogfighting scenes are much improved too. Real footage of the actors in planes is integrated with the exterior shots but everything is a lot more dynamic and easier to follow than with the previous film. The film in general really looks wonderful but those scenes in the air are really first rate.It's not much more than a better version of the original but it's certainly an entertaining time.",

Mostly done practical and not with an overdosis of CGI, this was hugely impressive.I felt a missed opportunity was having a little bit more character development outside Tom Cruise.From the 12-people Top Gun team most of them felt like props with a face and strangely enough more screen-time (usually the opposite problem applies) would have allowed them to flourish a bit more with a backstory. Perhaps the group could have been made smaller to begin with. It felt a bit 'lonely' at the end even with the end being a positive outcome.I also thought it was strange the enemy had no face. Which country where they flying in? Canada, Mexico? They probably were under contract with the US Navy as a huge sponsor, avoiding to paint a picture of \"us VS them\", whoever \"them\" would be. But having a faceless enemy without a motive turned this film into something that felt like an advertisement for the US military.Also weird; no woman ended up flying the actual mission? Or did I miss anything due to the scarcity of dialogue during the dogfights? No biggie but it was a thing I noticed.",

In a HUUUGGGEE way.Maverick has appropriately aged, a bit more responsible and subdued with juuuusssttt enough of the old rebel in him to still be interesting. Enough of the past was referenced without it just being a replay of the original (i.e. You can watch it without ever having seen the original).The cast is better, the dialogue is better, the fighter plane scenes are better, the PLOT and subplots are better.As a theater manager, I can watch movies pretty much when I want. I've seen this 11 times. So far.How ever good you think this movie will be, it's better.It exceeds expectations ten-fold.RUN, don't walk, to see this on the big screen.It deserves its place as the as the #1 movie of 2022.",

            "review_title": "Ace Combat + Top Gun remake + Star Wars: A New Hope = Top Gun: Maverick",
            "content": "The first movie basically had no story. They just used all the cliches that Hollywood believes a movie has to have: A good-looking main character who is likable and a good-looking woman who will fall in love with the main character, pew pew pew actions and lots of explosions. Though it was a brave move to have the main character have a very close same-sex friend which seemed like they are gay. Perhaps they were but later they changed the script and that's why we saw that friend of his have a wife and a kid to make the audience believe they are not gay but I'm still not convinced LOL. TBH the first movie sucked hard but it was the only movie about modern military jet action to watch around and it has its wow moments (cobra maneuver scenes) but it doesn't make the rest of the movie good.So the 2nd movie is basically a modernized remake of the first movie that has a story this time but this time Maverick is the teacher. I don't understand why they ignored the ending of the 1st movie and changed Maverick's personality a lot. He was smart, full-of-life and confident. In the 2nd movie he is more like the Goose but his alternative universe depressive twin: Idiot, worrier, not confident but trigger happy and reckless. He is still the Maverick alright but not the full-of-life one so watching him being sorry about the past was cringy. I thought he did let go of the past in the 1st movie but why make him depressive again for no reason? Do they think negative vibes are necessary? In both movies Goose stuff was unnecessary and it killed the mood of both movies. And I have no idea why they exaggerated this Goose stuff so much.The first movie revolved around people who can do things and laugh at the face of death, in 2nd movie it's more like some emo stuff. People are about the cry if you had touched them a little LOL. There are only one character who saves the movie but sadly he doesn't take part in the actual story much other than annoying main characters in a few scenes.I especially didn't like the way Maverick intentionally made an idiot character to add comedy into the movie. Did you develop this movie for some 6 years old kids or old people who watched the 1st movie when it was popular back then? Yeah I get they wanted to develop a drama movie but childish comedy and old man depression don't mix well. If this movie had to be a drink and food combo it would be chocolate whiskey with hamburger LOL. It's like this movie written by the Top Gun 1 writer, a random kid and some emo young man LOL.Regardless of all the BS and when I considered this movie as some movie that takes place in an alternative universe of Top Gun in which Maverick is a different person made me enjoy how idiot he is and enjoy the story and as a movie it's not bad. For fan of military jets it's satisfying. But as a Top Gun movie it's bad especially because this is not the Maverick we knew. Yes, he is that dangerous pilot but he is not that Maverick. Also watching a movie that's basically like the first movie is boring. It bored me because I'm not a nostalgic person. Though there are some interesting scenes that save the movie from being a total waste of time.Story is like a video game called Ace Combat. There is the typical mission this video game series is known for. And imagine they wrote the story based on this classic Ace Combat mission, they added Top Gun plot on it and the key event of the movie is some rip-off of Star Wars: A New Hope's Death Star scene LOL.Plot and events doesn't make sense. The pilots are suppose to be best of the best but they are like they can hardly fly a plane so they require the basic education. I didn't understand what the hell is going on in the first event of the movie. They didn't even add a character that bothered explaining what's actually happening and what happened didn't make sense either. Also the mission didn't make sense. I don't understand why they just didn't use some high altitude bomber plane. I guess whoever wrote the story ain't aware bomber planes exist. I recommend them to read Catch-22 LOL.This movie had audio problem at the theatre I watched in which I couldn't actually understand what some women was saying, especially Jennifer Connelly. No I'm not making fun of the women or something. I guess in the theater there was some problem with the speakers in which some sounds that was between a particular range wasn't hearable enough or especially Jennifer Connelly has problem talking. For example I could perfectly hear what Tom Cruise was saying everytime even when he murmuring but I couldn't understand Jennifer Connelly much even when she was yelling LOL. It's the first time I saw this woman so I'm not sure if she have a problem talking or not LOL.To sum it all up; it's dissapointing as a Top Gun movie, satisfying as a military jet movie and not a total waste of time as a movie.",

Yes, tons of fun. But they are a fraction of the run time. Don't come into this thinking it'll be like Mission Impossible where there are many interesting set pieces interspersed throughout a well paced movie, there are only 3. To make it worse the second one is repeated over and over and over and over again until they actually run the mission which is the last repetition of it.

At 7 stars I'm clearly in the minority.I first was disappointed with the scenes of the high speed plane. They were asking us to believe this plane could take off, climb, and achieve an unbelievable airspeed. I think that whole sequence could have been cut out without impacting the story.The other thing I was disappointed about was they tried so hard to tie this movie back to the original Top Gun that I think it was overdone. Many of the scenes felt almost as if they took clips from the original and pasted them in as if nothing had changed in 30 years.Finally the pace of the non flying scenes were all a bit sluggish. There was none of that sassy attitude running through the movie. The director tried but in my opinion failed. I would have liked this movie to stand alone more than it did.The flying scenes (the whole reason for paying to see the movie) were good.I would rate the non-flying scenes at 4 stars and the flying scenes at 8 stars.Just my opinion. A Top Gun Maverick DVD won't be joining the other 300 DVDs in my cabinet.",

It was exactly the same formula as the first one really. Overall it wasn't bad but I was great either. Also Lady Gaga song at the end is not good.

The filmmaking was impeccable, with clear and streamlined action sequences that made the spectacle feel fun instead of mandatory. The film serves as a reminder of the power of a great movie star, as Tom Cruise commands the screen and delivers a performance that is both nostalgic and emotionally satisfying.

No bumps there, and they managed to fill the time gap smoothly.The beggining was a good surprise and immediately left me with the impression that was going to be a hell of a good ride. The sports scene was not the same as the first one, but that was something hard to manage. Still, pretty good, I must add.Sound is what we'd expect from Top Gun, no less!VIsual effects are stunning. Combat scenes are breathtaking. Thanks for not using CGI too much!Soundtrack? Something that for me rarely goes well. But it was a good surprise.

It's a great action blockbuster movie.When it comes to the story, everything felt like it was put together and rushed as to fit the time length allowed. I would argue the story they had in the original Top Gun was much better. This one had Maverick rushing in to teach a Top Gun school and pick up a team for a mission. That lead to some animosity with his best friend's son, who happens to be in that same class/school.From this point on, everything was rushed. There's a lot of cliche moments. One of those cliche moments is the diversity in this movie. A lot of it forced as they typically are these days. Hollywood needed to check it off on their list. The latina fighter pilot, black fighter pilot, latino fighter pilot, Asian fighter pilot lol. I don't have a problem with that at all, but maybe it's just me the way I saw it. I know what they're trying to convey is today's military is much more diverse, but truth be told, that's not how it is with the Navy pilots. I should know. I was in those hangar bays for nearly 20 years.Regardless of the fact, the bread and butter is with the flight scenes. They are top notch and honestly best I've seen since Dunkirk.

It is a standard Hollywood action movie with predictable plot twists. What is outstanding is the aerial footage and the dogfight scenes. They are amazing! Real pilots performed the stunts, and it shows.Like most Tom Cruise movies, the movie is all about Tom Cruise. He is the star, the producer, and the driving force behind the movie.

This is yet another extended advertisement for the US military machine to induce induction into their ranks.It didn't take long into this dramatization that the enemy du jour was the one supposedly enriching uranium to a degree that wasn't favourable to a key US ally in the region. (See: Iran and the Zionist entity) Although, when the mission moved into the landscape of \"the enemy\", it looked surprisingly like Russia or Canada, both with an abundance of natural resources that the US would salivate over coveting. Geopolitical wet dreams aside, the acting was humdrum and the lines predictable, although having Jennifer Connelly in a decent role was enjoyable.

So when it was announced that it was being filmed, my excitement levels were on overdrive. However, I genuinely never thought the sequel would outdo the original. How wrong I was! It was 100% worth the wait, even when covid got in the way of its original release date. My husband and I had goosebumps as the opening song began, and from start to finish my emotions were all over the place. Goose's son, Bradley (Rooster), couldn't have been portrayed better than by Miles Teller. The similarities between them, are what makes the character of Rooster so believable. Having him playing the piano and singing 'Great Balls of Fire', was both heartbreaking, and a well thought out way to completely cement their connection. Especially when Maverick has the flashback to the last time they were all together, and Bradley (Rooster) was sitting on top of the piano, singing with his dad. I also loved that they both 'spoke to Goose', to help them get through any intense moments, and that they ended up flying together, with Rooster doing what his dad did. Their on screen relationship was electric - one cares unequivocally for one, the other is intensely angry at him, and when Maverick says he won't tell Rooster that it was his mum's dying request, and he'd rather Rooster be angry at him and not his mum, is such a beautiful and sad moment. He loves him like a father would, and you get to see how Rooster's feelings towards Maverick changes, and how Maverick finally sees Rooster as an equal, and not the boy he once knew. The acting by all cast members is of an extremely high calibre, the story itself is extremely well written, and the mission has your heart racing with you sitting on the edge of your seat. It was definitely better than the one in the original. Also, seeing Val Kilmer as Ice Man, really was the perfect touch. It's a film for everyone - a story of strength, power struggles, great flying scenes, heartache, saving lives, love, pride, faith (not religious), trust, and Tom Cruise still manages a flyby. The gratuitous beach football scene, is one not to be missed - if half naked, muscular/well defined men bonding, is your cup of tea. I certainly wasn't complaining... It's a movie to watch more than once, and the all the feels will still be there. 10/10 from me, my husband, and our children.",

Miles Teller is great as Rooster, this entire cast works, and each character is allowed to shine, and in the end you are completely invested in and care about these characters.The scenes in the air are honestly jaw dropping, I truly don't know how they filmed them, and what these pilots do in this movie is something to behold. They're exhilarating, exciting, and a joy to watch.The third act of this movie is one of the best I've seen in an action movie in a REALLY long time. You feel the stakes, and feel the sense these characters are in danger and could actually die, and you care about them, leading to an INTENSE final act.There's so much that can be said here. This movie must be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's one of the best blockbusters in YEARS, maybe ever.",

I saw Top Gun eventually on VHS then DVD many times. So when Top Gun Maverick was being made I was STOKED. Hey Covid hit and I waited.... AND WAITED. Anyways, I was so afraid this sequel couldn't possibly live up to my expectations... WOW WAS I WRONG! This is a superior movie in every way. The writing, the cinematography, everything is perfect. The flight scenes are so exciting and immersive.... YOU MUST SEE THIS IN IMAX! The music, the callbacks to the original, all flawless. I came out of the theater PUMPED!

            "content": "The COVID pandemic delayed the release of Top Gun: Maverick (2022) for a few years. Having only watched the original a few days prior to seeing this in the theaters, it was definitely worth the wait to see something like this on the big screen. The trailers only hinted at the spectacle that could be achieved over 35 years after the original wowed audiences with great fighter jet footage. That's not to say that this film doesn't lean heavily on its nostalgia-or plots that come strikingly close to other famous franchises.Part of the appeal of Top Gun (1986) was all the footage of fighter jet acrobatics. Most civilians never get to see these things outside an occasional air show, so there's an amount of awe involved when seeing what these marvels of modern engineering can do. Over three decades of advancements in cinematography allowed this sequel to surpass the original. Cockpit footage of these actors actually in these fighter jets, combined with high-definition shots of amazing maneuvers, made this movie quite exciting to watch. These scenes shown in the trailers made me-a Top Gun skeptic-want to see this film. I was not disappointed.Plot-wise, Top Gun: Maverick felt slightly more developed than its predecessor. My favorite part by far was the experimental aircraft test at the start of the movie. However, the rest of the film's plot felt familiar, but not in a good way. About a third of the way through, I realized, \"Wait a minute. This is just Star Wars (1977).\" Don't get me wrong, Star Wars' climactic battle against the Empire is a cinema-defining moment. It just felt weird packaged in this way. Add to that a few moments of blatant nostalgia and it was clear this movie was at least in part made for fans of the original.Improving on the visuals and story of its predecessor, I give Top Gun: Maverick 4.0 stars out of 5.",

Mr Cruise was absolutely right getting all the actors real life experience and camera time in those fighter jets, pulling real G's....hell, a dream for many non-actors as well of course.I watched this movie in 4dx (moving seats - felt like a roller coaster - air and water features) which made it even more immersive....will watch it again (in 4dx of course) for sure....this cinematography is a grasp for us normal people to experience what it is to be in one of those majestic supersonic, g-force bringing beasts.Only thing I was wondering about....why F18's....while the 'enemy' is rocking US made better planes (I know the F35's were not available at the time and they needed planes with dual seats, but this was not what the US would do imho lol)\nAlso...5th and 4th generation planes? Call them by their names guys....everyone knows an F22, an F35, an F18 of F14...Not minding that too much...awesome movie, awesome dogfighting scenes (and not twice the same scene as in the original one with the planes twirling about), very realistic when it comes to the flying (not the mission of course) and good acting....

Not even for Endgame or the collosal disaster; Die Hard 5.I saw this on the 21st May in Macau, 4 days before it's European realease.. ... Odd. Hence why it's the first review.I was excited / nervous for it to do well, but I had faith in Tom Cruise's dedication to his craft, and perfectionism.He delivered! And then some!A perfect sequel.. the opening had me giddy with glee, giggling and cheering and fist pumping the air in the cinema.The movie has everything. The flying is sooo amazing and real, with the actors really pulling those Gs in the aircaft. With Real character development for Maverick, some sad moments, and a beautiful inclusion of a not well Val Kilmer. A nice new personal journey for Maverick to navigate. It has So many links to the original, and the perfext balance is struck between nods and homage to the original film vs ripoff and copycat ala Hangover 2. It has everything.If you know the first movie well you will have alot of moments of 'oh that's just like that bit' and 'ooh is he gonna say that, or do this' a lovely experience to live.The finale had be squirming in my seat flying every twist and turn, clenched, excited, riveted and scared. It's almost like Top Gun meets Mission Impossible.. we also get the obligatory Tom Cruise running scene \ud83d\ude05.It doesn't repeat the story of the first one, but continues it into something else, that's entirely different yet very familiar. Maverick faces more challenges this time around on a personal level, and the love interest story is in keeping with a character his age who's lived his life. He is also more badass this time around.With characters like Rooster (have a think about that one) and Hangman, a kinda Iceman, Maverick rolled into one.. you get taken on a new journey for the movie, for them, and for Maverick himself in last chance saloon.It's obvious that it can't have the innocent 80s charm of the first one. That era is gone and making a retro movie would feel weird. But it's in its own era, it owns and embraces that, and makes the most of it too, with Tom Cruise and his mega productions to great effect. No using the same shot repeatedly ala Top Gun. Theyve got a tonne of flying and it's all concurrent.Eveything you want to happen happens. It's emotional, amazing, triumphant, sad, and fun (in no order!). A stunning movie, that could not have been better. Don't think this kind of movie can or will be done again. Stunning. Such and achievement.I will go again to the movies with my kids.. and feel like I should go a third time, to make it my most watched movie in the cinema over Endgame.

Solid direction, amazing stunts, decent acting, but a teeny-bop love story that was just pathetic.So now we get number 2. In honesty, it looked well shot, awesome stunts, solid direction again, but I just can't get enjoyment out of watching a bunch of one language only, zero culture Americans flying around in planes that they usually use to bomb innocent babies and children in Serbia, the Middle East or Pakistan.What joy can any psychopath get from watching a bunch of one language ONLY, couldn't tell you the colour of ANY foreign flags, has no idea who we fought in WW2, couldn't recognise a foreign language if it slapped him, in a plane. Who can enjoy that?Americans use these planes to burn, maim, disable and destroy thousands of innocent children in tens of countries. What enjoyment do you get from watching that? I'd like to see a movie where China or Russia, use planes to nuke the USA. That'd be an interesting aerial battle. The Chinese could state they'd spare anyone who speaks a second language and all the imperial AngloGermanic one language ONLY clowns would be bombed like the children of the Middle East.

I wasn't *invested* in the original like I was in Maverick.I do have some complaints:\ni wish Kelly McGillis' Charlotte Blackwood could have appeared in this movie or at least been MENTIONED. Kind of sad what happened with Kelly / Charliei noticed some minor continuity issues. For example, there's one scene where a pilot goes from the aircraft carrier to suddenly being in the woods with a parachute behind him on the ground.

            "content": "Finally, I have just discovered this cinematographic phenomenon, which continues to race ahead of all others at the top of the world box-office of the year, while waiting to be dethroned by \"Avatar: The Way of Water\".I don't understand the stellar early reactions, the overhyped critical acclaim selling it as one of the best films in cinematic history, or those who look down on it, claiming it's just another military video recruitment campaign disguised as a film. Because, in my humble opinion, it is neither.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022) is a good movie. Well written, technically flawless and performed with conviction while paying a fine tribute to Tony Scott's 1986 film.The best scene is undoubtedly the \"Iceman scene\", which is so moving because reality is larger than fiction and Val Kilmer partly plays himself. Those who have suffered from ENT cancer know this, and would not even want their worst enemy to experience such a journey through hell.What about the role of the US military? Well, I am the first to condemn the crimes of imperialism, but I also have the greatest respect for armed forces who defend their populations, and, of course, the greatest contempt for any invading force. Here I did not sense any heavy or silly propaganda, as I might have first feared based on some reviews.Hollywood is smarter than Washington and Wall Street, because \"Top Gun: Maverick\" had to toe the line when it came to casting its villains. Congratulations and thank you to the executives, crew and cast of the film for making a smart film devoid of political propaganda, which can be enjoyed anywhere in time. If only the majority of politicians and the media could have this decency and this intelligence.By the way, I know some \"Democrats\" who are unable to analyze the various shades of demonstration of human violence in Hollywood films, while supporting the jingoistic propaganda of some of their most powerful elected officials. Let's also not forget that President Eisenhower (R) warned against the military-industrial complex, while Truman (D) justified the use of nuclear weapons.The biggest weak point in my opinion is that Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, the astrophysicist and civilian instructor from Top Gun, played by Kelly McGillis, who was Maverick's primary love interest in the original film, isn't mentioned at all. \"What became of her?\" remains an open question when the end credits begin to scroll.In conclusion, the ethics and morality behind the use of force and the legality and morality of the mission in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" have been analyzed and voted on by the United Nations Security Council. It's a larger-than-life motion picture, and nothing else, which endears made-for-the-big-screen movies and delights aviation enthusiasts, while wishing characters with that kind of emotional and intellectual intelligence would deal with such important issues in the real world, which is unfortunately not always the case nowadays.",

            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" (released 5/27/2022 (Covid delayed 2 years), PG-13, 2hrs, star: Tom Cruise, Director: Joe Kasinski) was almost a scene-for-scene remake/update of the original, simply changing character names and actors for most, though keeping the same characterizations in place. This is mine and many, many others' chief complaint, but maybe after a 37-year (!) wait, they could claim it's really for the generation that never experienced Top Gun (1986) though that's not really an excuse given the VCR rental years, the DVD rental years, and the streaming years. However, the final 45-mins of the new mission raised this from a 5 rating to 7 or even 8. It was a great departure from the original and really broke new ground with amped up air combat. Yes, there was a LOT of implausible crappola after Maverick bailed out but it moved fast enough that you were kind of forced to accept it, part of the magic of movies. The final save scene was really reminiscent of 2012's \"Battleship\" so that kind of paved the way for this. But this kind of \"yea US military!\" seems out of place in today's world, though it's $1.5B box office will make it hard to dissuade producers of that.",

However, it had several flaws, such as the love story between Pete and Charlie that took way too much screen time, the ridiculous dialogues lines and the general cheesy American patriotism that was so beloved by the audience during the 80's. This sequel fixed all these issues and it is a way better movie. The action sequences are amazing and kept me on the verge, as the good guys are very often in difficult situations that are difficult to solve. Interactions and conflicts between different characters are believable. I loved how the relationship between Maverick and Bradshaw evolves along the way. The director played just the right dose of nostalgia with some sequences that were obviously quoting the original production.I feel that this movie achieved a lot: these were two intense hours and the payback for the audience is huge. You get to see a movie with a simple and yet entertaining story. The photography is phenomenal and there are some scenes that are truly breathtaking, especially if you watch them on a big screen. Cast members delivered some good performances, even though I was not very impressed by any of the actors, including Tom Cruise. He looked and sounded pretty average, I was expecting more under this department, especially from a star of this caliber. The music is always on point and there is a nice mix between rock classics, orchestral music composed by Hans Zimmer and some modern pop songs. I was pretty skeptical about this film, because usually sequels made several years after the original entry often disappoint me. Here instead, I was pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "Although I think the pacing, acting, plot structure, and flying sequences in this movie work extremely well, I can't help but have big questions about the nature of the conflict it revolves around. Both existing TOP GUN movies to me feel frustratingly unconcerned with the geopolitical situation leading to the climactic missions that everything else in the movies revolve around, instead to focus mainly on Tom Cruise's romantic life, rivalry with Val Kilmer, and his need to prove himself/overcome his inner demons that come from feeling responsible over the death of his friend.There's a few cryptic lines about the enemy country enriching uranium in a highly protected facility guarded by new 5th generational fighters, SAMs, and a few leftover U. S. jets. Well this would indicate that they are attacking Iran in a move obviously patterned after the Israelis and why they've been so keen on building bases in Azerbaijan. The writer probably thought just to replace Azerbaijan with a U. S. Carrier group and call it a day. However this has a few problems as there is no way an American carrier group would be operating out of The Caspian Sea (which is the only part of Iran with a tree-lined mountainous coast as depicted in the film). It's clear from the maps shown in the film that the planes fly North-East toward land (indicating they were flying out of The Persian Gulf) but the director changed the landscape so that it'd be more distinct from the deserts used earlier in the training sequences.All right, you might say the enemy country is kept amorphous because it could easily sub for Russia, China, or North Korea while conveniently not offending their audiences. However, all these countries get ruled out because they already have plenty of nuclear weapons and are not fielding large numbers of F-14's.I'm am little annoyed by the film playing things so safe, especially as it ended up getting banned in China anyway. As it stands, we are in a fantasy movie which in little way corresponds to the actual world. Personally, I would be much more interested in a little bit of back story as to what is going on in the world at the time, as I didn't find the interpersonal drama to be nearly as compelling. That said, the film maintains some small level of realism through the training sequences but relies on some pretty severe coincidences to move things along in the end.Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit for what it was, which was big dumb fun with a lot of extremely impressive aerial stunts and photography at play. Almost nothing looked too outrageously cheesy and computer generated outside of a few of the explosions and the Mi-24 helicopter. Cruise and Connelly both look good for their age, but remember that this film was shot 4 years before it was finally released. I can't help but wonder if a lot was left on the cutting room floor which would have tied up loose ends though, like whatever happened to Kelly McGillis's character and how & when his superiors change their minds on whether or not he'll fly in the mission. Perhaps we will find out if an extended edition ever gets released.",

The movie production team said this movie is really made by actors as a real pilot from special pilot course preparation. OFC, it seems \"impossible\" but plz remember, there is Tom Cruise, we mustn't use that word!The narration is about a legendary pilot, Maverick, forced to retire or do the last job as Top Gun Instructor for a confidential military mission. His personal life exp traumatizes him to take the job because he must become an instructor for the son of his dead pilot friends. Long story short, it's about time to narrate the movie with boys military & youth vibe, struggles, and romance.The pros are so many. Emotional, plausible, entertaining, and insightful for aviation military knowledge. From the beginning, the visuals, audio, costume, and sets are instantly bringing the audience to the movie. So real! The iconic look of Maverick style is still desired now! Pilot leather jacket and bomber jacket combined with Ray-Ban's aviator sunglasses, white tee, and blue denim through iconic Kawasaki bike. On the other hand, the acting performance and storyline are undoubted. Tom Cruise is still proving his perfectionism, perfect! The cons?! I'm sorry, I get biased with all of these pros HAHAHA maybe the romance is a lil bit okay, but it's still great!?In my personal POV, I'll guarantee for all of u, at least, You'll get positive vibes and force all of your negativity bias or depression to begone. This movie is so positive and a mood-booster. Currently, I still get overreacted euphoria of this movie lol. Don't miss it plz! Top Gun is considered the most iconic movie of the 80s era.",

This is a sequel from the original 'Top Gun' in 1986, and it is Paramount's biggest blockbuster of the summer since 'Titanic.' Tom Cruise did a great job of his performance to played Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell since the original 'Top Gun'. Miles Teller to played Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw who the son of Maverick's late RIO and best friend, Lt. (j.g.) Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw who played by Anthony Edwards, and Carole Bradshaw who played by Meg Ryan from the original movie. Also, Jennifer Connelly who played as Penny Benjamin who is Maverick's rekindled love interest, a single mother, and a bar owner. John Hamm who played VADM Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson who is the commander of Naval Air Forces who kind of reminds me of CDM Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf who played by Tom Skerritt from the original movie. Val Kilmer who played Maverick's close friend and former rival Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky from the original movie. In the sequel, the filmmakers were able to dub the voice over Kilmer's acting since he was diagnosed with throat cancer.If you guys didn't like the first Top Gun movie, then I suggest you guys could watch the sequel because it was a great story, fantastic visuals and special effects, and excellent cast and crew. The movie is directed by Joseph Kosinski who directed his big-screen directoral debut 'Tron: Legacy' and another science fiction film 'Oblivion,' and the producer Jerry Bruckheimer who payed tribute to his colleague Don Simpson who produced the original 'Top Gun.'

I simply loved every moment of Maverick, it's opening nod to the original and numerous, often subtle, throwbacks to 80's nostalgia. I found myself smiling throughout and also quite emotional too, the Val scenes particularly got me after watching the doc 'Val' recently, if you haven't seen it watch it! It's just a great film, some deliberate cheesy moments but they're by design not accidental and firmly compliment what has to be one of my favourite movies in years, if not of all time. It's just pure entertainment and exactly what the big screen is meant to be about, if you can revisit the original movie first like I did, you'll notice even more winks and nods and you'll likely enjoy it even more, top marks, 10/10!",

Ed Harris and Jon Hamm is no surprise that they fit perfectly in their roles.I've read in many places that this sequel has surpassed the original, but I don't really agree. When Top Gun came out, it was something extraordinary, it remained a classic. This sequel is obvious that is somehow better, since cinema evolved since then, but times have changed and I don't see Maverick becoming a classic like Top Gun. There wasn't the same hype as with Top Gun. Maybe because we have higher standards today. It's hard to compare them, but it is indeed a good sequel.",

Parts where Cruise seemingly was seemingly portrayed to be at a loss but it was just a ploy to make him shine). Tom still believes he's 28 years old. The other pilots looked like young guns and were cool and funny but they were NOT the focal point of this movie - it was ALL about Tom Cruise. The female pilot was awesome, Bob was cool, Hangman was egotistical but in a badass way and Rooster was awesome BUT they all had to take a back seat to allow Tom Cruise to steal the show with his \"shoe lifts\", his \"presence\" and his \"old face\". I thought Tom was going to be the badass captain and instructor - leading young men and women to be the \"elite of the elite\" but instead it was just about Tom wanting to be the spotlight at all times. There is NO WAY that this was better than the original Top Gun. Tom, you are 60 years old - you are NOT a young gun anymore. Let it go!!!! Act like a mentor, a leader or a badass father figure. Right now, you look stupid and its a total bore. Congrats on being able to do your own stunts but you are still NOT a young gun - it's time to just \"pass the torch\".",

When I was younger I was pretty obsessed with movies (tbh I'm still that way with movies) and Top Gun was a movie I watched over and over until I wore out the VHS. My mom even nicknamed me Goose because of this movie. I was super skeptical when I saw they were making a sequel because most of the times they're awful cash grabs just trying to make money off the popularity of the original.That's not the case with this sequel. Everyone actor is on their A-game and the plot has a purpose. The action sequences are amazing and you can tell how much work they put into this movie to improve on the limitations of the original. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise what with all the Scientology stuff but he brings so much emotion that I believe is very genuine. Miles Teller is perfect as Rooster, the similarity between him and Anthony Edwards is uncanny. Also, Miles Teller is an absolute stud and the beach scene of him shirtless is worth the price of admission alone.The only negative for me is the romance. It wasn't necessary to the story and if you weren't a hardcore fan of the first movie you wouldn't even get the callback to the Penny Benjamin that Goose mentions in passing at the beginning being this Penny.Overall, this movie is a 10/10 for me and will be an immediate buy once it comes to Blu-ray. I've already seen it in the theater twice and I'm sure will see it as least once more. If you're a fan of the first, you can't go wrong seeing this one.",

Top gun maverick's script is simple, weak in some points, especially with regard to the deepening of the supporting characters - with the exception of Iceman - and some canastrous effect phrases that despite being strange are consistent with the proposal of the work and our protagonist, the script seeks justifications for Pete to return to the action and even forces a little connections between the characters, however, when the plane takes to the sky, any and all criticism of the film comes to the ground, because the mix of special effects with practical effects are spectacular, the viewer is transported straight to the cockpit of a fighter jet and suffers, pirouettes, is hit, dives, climbs and is shot down with the planes, these are really incredible scenes that are responsible for causing affection, emotion, tension and apprehension to those watching. , the sound mixing is amazing, the clear and clean photography blends in perfectly with the scenery composition. Other points, the supporting cast works well, nothing special, Tom Cruise is very good, and the actor understands his character a lot, it's a charismatic, naughty performance and even when he needs it, the actor manages to have a dramatic rage.. note 8 .5/10.",

I feel I would've liked it more if I had nostalgia for the first Top Gun, but this is definitely a solid film!The visual effects and stunts look very good, but I expected a little more from the cinematography. The action sequences are so much fun to watch, especially in the third act, this really adds the tension built up. The colour palettes are subtle, and there's some good camerawork and use of slow motion, but it doesn't feel imaginative.The soundtrack used is very 80s and really adds a lot of life to the film, and the sound design is fairly decent. However, the score feels a little basic and forgettable.There are some great performances in this film, and in my opinion, Miles Teller really outshines Tom Cruise. The actors have a lot of chemistry and contrast well with each other, and I ended up really caring for their characters! The dialogue is pretty good too, and there's some very funny lines.The film sets up the story well, however it is quite hard to fully get into and isn't immediately engaging.

            "review_title": "Intense flight mission sequences and nostalgia make Top Gun 2 a summer blockbuster once again",
            "content": "I was a big Top Gun fan (as was mostly everyone I knew) back in the late 80's and early 90's. It was the highest grossing movie of 1986 for a reason. So I was very excited to finally get a chance to see this sequel a day earlier than the advertised release date. We went at the very first matinee and everyone in the theatre enjoyed it. It was fun and triggered lots of chuckles and laughs with subtle humor.I cried at probably at least five or six scenes, whether from nostalgia, heavy hearted references to either character deaths or character relationships, or the romance scenes. In addition to the humor and sad scenes, there was also some good drama and intense jet fighter sequences. The director and writers blended the concept of a difficult fighter jet mission with fun training scenes, romance, and callbacks to the original.I'm not going to lie- this is a good movie. I'm not exaggerating that I barely blinked during the entire run time of 2 hours and 10 minutes, with which most of the time when I wasn't being tear-jerked, I had a silly grin on my face or was chuckling at the subtle humor. However, I will say that if I wasn't a big fan of the first one, I might not have liked it as much as I did. That's because it was a great as a fan of the first one to have so many references to anything in part one.The ending was good, but it could have been even better, even though it was intense enough to have me sweating a little. But one of the biggest drawbacks of Top Gun 2 is also one of its strengths, in my opinion, in a way. I got the impression that ultimately this is a movie that is more made for kids and teens than adults, and what that means is that the content is mostly light and shies away from any kind of violence or sexuality, which would have made it feel more mature and realistic. For example, in the original Top Gun, it has heavy profanity, really intense romance and sex for a PG movie, a pilot dies depicted with a face covered in blood after ejecting, and the dialogue by actors like Tom Skeritt make the stakes seem higher and more realistic: \"what we do up there is dangerous\". Maverick's dad's fate in Vietnam is also discussed to paint a realistic picture of the stakes. Overall, it just felt more gritty, whereas \"Top Gun Maverick\" keeps it ultra \"clean\" considering the dangers of flying and the explicit nature of locker room talk and sexuality.What this means is you get a sequel movie that is much more appropriate for teens and kids than adults, yet being an adult I kind of wish the stakes would have felt as heavy as they could have been. It would have been sadder, but it also would've been more mature and realistic. It is what it is. It's still a good movie, but it could have been better.I'm glad that I saw it early. As a nostalgic, emotional, fun summer popcorn movie, it was a blast, but if you're expecting a Best Pic contender or something remarkably original and profound, unfortunately the writers and directors \"had the shot, but refused to fire it\", and for that the movie comes up a bit short in cliches, cheese, and yes even lacking believability at key moments. I think there was an Oscar-contender somewhere in this story, but the creators of it decided to go another direction, more into a \"popcorn\" and feel-good movie of the summer. That's fine and I don't blame them since the target audience was clearly younger kids, which makes it a nice, wholesome movie for a change.Jennifer Connelly, despite a small supporting role, was the key to this movie. Other than Cruise, who does have a few stumbling moments at times, her confident experience as an actor makes every look she gives and line she says add credibility to what is an otherwise rather superficial script for supporting actors. The other good role that stands out is Val Kilmer's pleasantly surprising (and funny at times) reappearance as Admiral Iceman. Then, Teller does a pretty impressive job as Goose's kid.At the end of the day, \"Top Gun Maverick\" succeeds and soars as a nostalgic, deeply emotional surprise triumphant action flick, with flight battle scenes so intense it'll make you sweat in your seat, while it also crashes into some of the mountainous cliches that have been built and established by Hollywood throughout the years. So grab a seat and some popcorn and take a trip back to the 80s and 90s, a much simpler time, with some updated special effects and tech upgrades.",

Couldn't be improved on in any way. Without fault. Ok, let's take the plot first. Well it's simple. Stereotypically simple, I don't think the writers put very much thought into it at all. 'Un-named' foreign power. Check. Developing nukes. Check. Violation of international law. Check. US can act unilaterally and without consultation. Check. Mission looks impossible. Check. Only one man can do it. Check. Deadline moved up a week. Check. Skeletons from the past, turns to bromance at the end. Check. Nick of time saves. Check. Leading man gets the girl. Check. Check! There is nothing about the plot or delivery that is original, it's just the same old ingredients, stirred up and fed to a wide-eyed audience. Yes, Cruise can fly a fighter jet and I take my hat off to him for that, but was this movie just an excuse for him to pull some stunts? Who knows because none of the characters seemed to develop beyond their immense egos. The one exception for me was Val Kilmer, no ego at all just the bittersweet true life story playing out in the movie. Perhaps a touching swansong and the only 5 minutes of the movie that felt real. I wasn't invested in any other character to be honest, as cheesey, predictable dialogue and action sequences just flooded the screen. As the action became more frantic, so did the utterly ridiculous strokes of luck. The whole movie seemed like someone had buttered 50 pieces of bread, thrown them all in the air at once and every single piece landed buttered-side up! Towards the end we were all shouting \"please make it stop!\" but no, more totally implausible US chest beating was delivered.Tom Cruise is a consummate actor and I have enjoyed many of his films but this was just a string of groan-worthy stunts.",

It's not meant to be realistic because its a film for entertainment purposes which is exactly what it delivers on. The cinematography is superb as are the flying scenes which are vastly improved from the original Top Gun. I thought the romantic element to the film was forced and wasn't needed as it did not fit in with the film. It was nice to see Ice Man make an appearance and of course there was some nostalgia with references to the original film but thankfully the 10 litres of baby oil used for the volleyball scene from Top Gun was scrapped for the sequel!",

            "review_title": "Out of the eyes of a military fighter enthusiast... Top Gun Maverick is not the movie we need - but the movie we probably deserve...",
            "content": "As said in the title - since a rather young age, I have been drooling and nerding about fighter jets.The first time I have seen the original Top Gun, I haven't been aware of what is realistic and what not. Yet even with this knowledge the original stays one of my favorite action movies - truly there are no particular great aviation movies out there..But did Top Gun Maverick improved on the original? Yes and also no...First of all - yes - the movie is just objectively better made. The flight scenes are absolutely stunning - and there are even mostly realistic planes flying (all of the main \"protagonists'\" planes are real types - not talking about the MiG-28 from the original movie). Except maybe the Darkstar.The problem is: there are also really massive issues.One is lazy writing. So kudos for Maverick to mention, that the F-35 would be the ideal airplane for the \"main story mission\". But lazy is, to take it out because of \"GPS jamming\"... really? It could be so easy to say, that the F-35C didn't achieved combat readiness before the mission... or something along these lines...?!But overall - the F/A-18 has nothing what the F-35 cannot do - maybe just, the experience of the SuperHornet sets it apart of the Lightning II.Then there is the issue that nobody really wants to say, that it is Iran. But Iran is the only country which still has F-14 Tomcats. What they don't have yet though are Su-57.And the whole \"Felon\" characteristics is simply nonsensical. The Su-57 doesn't really exist - as serial model (only about 15 demonstrators where produced - of those 15 - 2 pre-serial models - at least one of those has been destroyed. It is absolutely fiction, to expect that the Su-57 could be used for anti-air defense - especially not of Iran.Also the SAM defense could not be worse. You don't need to have every few km the same anti-air defense battery (one or two S-400 which look totally different are more than enough - plus maybe some short range systems).Also - the whole missile \"thing\" makes no sense. First: using \"flares\" against ground to air missiles which are normally seeking with radar makes no sense. Second: if a missile is close - there is no way you can avoid it with fancy maneuvers. And where is the enemy AWACS? If it is such a high value asset, there should be a form of AWACS... oh - and then: there would be definitely detection - even if the planes would fly very low.This makes me sad - because defending against air defense systems or against other aircrafts are far more like playing chess than than a \"dogfight\". With good writing and good cinematography it would have been possible to really catch the tension and the techniques a fighter pilot would use. But because of \"action movie\" - fantasy totally took over.So all action scenes were breathtaking - but like a Harry Potter attack. \"Movie magic\".Aside of the technical details: the \"personnel\" things were also not realistic. And focusing on dogfighting in the first \"days\" of training, while the mission mostly needed for ultra-low level flight? WTF...I do think, with a bit more input of real fighter jet pilots and ex-military conductors, the movie could have been far better.Instead of the \"magic\" Su-57, they could have used Su-30. This is a fighter jet Iran apparently really procured.The whole mission could have been far more realistic. No need for this \"villain lair\" in the middle of a volcanic crate.And to be honest: why should the Pentagon ask the Navy to do the job? If the target is so high value, a USAF B-2 Spirit could enter the airspace without the enemy having a chance of detection - and it would have far more payload.And even further - if the Navy anyway attacked the runway near the high value target - why not using loads of cruise missile to destroy the target?Some realistic S-300 or S-400 could have been used. And yes - the F-35C would have been also sexy - instead of the workhorse F/A-18 (let's face it - both the Super Hornet and the Lightning II are workhorses and not as sexy as the Tomcat in its time. But the F-35 is at least very modern and at the edge of technology - similar to the Tomcat, when the original movie came out).So no - the movie doesn't make any sense of a defense standpoint. This is sad, because the strategies and techniques are extremely interesting.So... did I enjoyed Top Gun Maverick? Yes for sure. Like an Avenger movie. If you turn off your brain, it is perfectly fine entertainment - with a slight dash of propaganda.What just makes me sad is: that it could have been just far better. But Hollywood is Hollywood I guess - and we are living anyway no more in a subjective reality?",

I didn't particularly love or hate the original Top Gun and wasn't sure it warranted a sequel, especially 36 years later, but this is pretty fun. The plot's purposefully minimal - the U. S. Navy needs Pete/Maverick (Cruise) to train some new pilots to fight some unnamed foreign bad guys. Obviously, this requires him to sit in a cockpit and show them how it's done.The new pilots are Bradley/Rooster (Teller - the 'Whiplash' guy), Natasha/Phoenix (Barbaro), Jake/Hangman (Powell), Reuben/Payback (Ellis) and Bob (Pullman). The drama comes from Rooster being Goose's son and the animosity that Maverick has created between them. There's also solid cameos from love interest Penny (Connelly), Iceman (Kilmer) in one scene, and Warlock (Parnell) & Cyclone (Hamm) as the Navy bosses.Cruise is as charismatic as ever, with lots of jaw-clenching and trying to do the right thing, his way. The \"new recruits\" are good and provide some energy to the plot, but the interplay between Rooster and Maverick drives everything. However, as with the original, the stars of the show are the aerial aerobatics performed by the F18s and other planes and the stunts/editing that makes it so fun to watch. Predictable, if a bit dumb ending, and it feels a lot quicker than 2 hours.",

            "content": "The Good: As someone who despises the original Top Gun and thinks it's amongst the most overhyped films ever...color me surprised that I really liked Maverick. I feel like virtually everything was done better with this film than the original. The plot feels more purposeful and cohesive; there's a mission, there are stakes, there's a reason Maverick is brought back.The characters are more grounded and relatable. Yes, there still mostly clich\u00e9s (the jerk, the nerd, the good hearted son-of-the-alum, the uh...girl), but they're not actively irritating, like the first one. Cruise is actually really, really good here. Unlike the first one, Maverick doesn't feel like an a******e. His arrogance feels earned, the way he acts is drawn from a legitimate (and selfless) place: he wants to ensure the young Top Gun students survive a dangerous (and almost impossible) mission. Miles Teller is also really good here; perfect casting as Goose's - hilarious named - son, Rooster.But of course, it's the flight scenes that steal the show. Plot notwithstanding, these are legitimately exhilarating and worth the price of admission alone. Again while i get there were technical limitations in the 1980s, the reason these scenes are better isn't the cinematography. It's that there's a better story and better characters involved. But yes, they're also filmed very well: you can tell what's going on, the scenes feel real, and they're unlike anything I've seen in a long while.The final 30 minutes of this movie are just pure awesomeness. It's great to see the mission built up this way and to see it live up to the hype. I can totally see why this film resonates with so many people. It has the spirit of an 80s blockbuster, with the technical and storytelling finesse of a contemporary film. It brings you back, but it far, far surpasses the original in every way (almost like the inaccurate memory of the original).The Bad: I thought, just like the original, the worst aspect of this movie is the romance. Cruise and Connelly are nice to look at, but they don't really have a genuine or well-developed romance. Cruise just sorta shows up and it's clear the script wants them to get together, but there's no reason they actually do. It just feels very half baked.I also have to acknowledge while the film is self-aware a lot of the time, there are moments when it leans a bit too much into the cheesiness. A bit to over sentimental, you know? The use of flashbacks was highly distracting and unintentionally funny at times. For example, when Rooster is playing \"Great Balls of Fire\" and Cruise is having Vietnam flashbacks about Goose doing so, I legitimately felt there was some cruel prank being played on him or something. That's at least how it felt.Oh, and I just have to nitpick here: did the final mission really have to have a video game esque \"weak point\" for the jets to target? Come on.The Ugly: So, as in the original Top Gun, the \"enemy\" country isn't revealed (for more obvious reasons today than back in 1986, honestly). However, unlike the original, where there's nothing in the plot that could possibly suggest who the enemy was, here we get tantalizing clues:Rogue nation developing uraniumMix of American and Russian fighter jets at their disposalUse of an air craft carrier to get the jets to the mission pointMountainous terrainIt's Iran. Definitely supposed to be Iran. That we're not explicitly told that is kind of reflective of the \"good patriotism\" of this film. It's obviously pro-American but it's not all up in your face with it.",

The flying scenes were the among the best I have watched. The visual effects, cinematography and the score complimented with each other perfectly.

I. Speech training to deliver his line's was interesting. I think it's commendable of the filmmaker's to acknowledge this.He struggles with something that would be hard for most people, yet still gives a good performance.Overall,A decent effort for everyone involved.(B-)(5/10)",

I miss the 80/90s simple approach to entertainment.The cinematography is on point. The action and stunts really are a step above. Acting is strong and compelling. The story is complete, a little vague on \"the rouge state target\". But who cares, there are fast jets pulling off insane maneuvers. If there's CGI, it's done well enough that it isn't noticeable.

            "content": "It was only 2 years ago that I watched the first Top Gun movie. I'm usually not interested in classic hollywood movies full of cliches and predictability, but rather movies with complicated stories, complicated personalities, unpredictability and moral dillemas. Despite that, I gave it a shot, as I felt the need for something simple and great. It turned out to be exactly what I wanted, and a wonderful experience.When I learned the sequel was coming out, I was thrilled but also skeptical, due to toxic ideologies destroying so many classics with political correctness.Eventually it came to the cinemas. I am very selective of what to watch in cinema, and upon hearing about good reviews, I decided Top Gun: Maverick was the perfect choice.The opening hits you right in the face with the energy that was dormant for over 30 years. The original Top Gun theme song so magnificent it tears you up. And then a burst of masculinity with classic rock music and playing with heavy machinery. The producers knew exactly what to aim at, recreated the soul in a perfect way and from the intro alone you know you're in for a treat.As the story starts to reveal itself, we learn about what happened in last 30 years with the main characters, and what their lives turned out to be like. They all keep their character and the actors portray them perfectly. We also meet new characters, young and cocky just like the previous generation. There is also a strong, but subtle enough mix of emotions in the movie, from romance, lust and friendly love to anger, sadness and grief.Obviously, the story revolves around the Top Gun and jet fighter pilots perfecting their skills and learning their limits before going to missions. The scenes are simply incredible, the filiming, the sound, everything is perfect. It really shows how the producers of the movie were eager to make it perfect in every way, and they succeeded.Despite being a hollywood movie with somewhat predictible outcomes, the story surprised me a few times, but what's important is the thrill of wanting to know how everything will turn out, and this movie certainly has it.The movie is incredible and I give it a solid 9. The reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because although it truly is a wonderful experience, when it ends, that's pretty much it. There's no philosophy about it, the story is simple, clear and all laid out, and there's nothing much to think about when it ends. In a way, that's the beauty of it, though - It's a movie where you don't need to think much, just relax and let the rush and emotions flow through you.",

It might pull off those last three, but it lacks the wokeness that Hollywood seems to love and cater to. This is a new classic that has surpassed the original 1986 film. It keeps the feeling and look that Tony Scott gave us, and matured it like a fine wine. Screenplay and direction made this work, a rarity for a sequel. The dialogue is tight, as well as the camera focus on the actors. The aerial shots and dog fights are incredibly well done - whatever CGI was utilized blended seemlessly into the background with the live action. The love story between Penny (Jennifer Connelly) and Maverick was mature and believable, nothing gratuitous about it. There's enough homage paid to the original to remind us again why we loved the 1986 film, without depending on it too heavily to justify the current version. I will say that the first 2/3rds of the film were perfectly crafted, in the Best Film category, but the last 1/3rd at times stretched credibility to where I said \"no way\" at least twice. Pretty dramatic shift in the action. But overall an amazing storyline well worth the wait. It's a roller-coaster ride of entertainment that almost everyone will enjoy. Go see it.",

I'm baffled by some of the reviews on here. \"The Mission\" is beyond stupid and the concepts you're supposed to believe within \"The Mission\" are childish in their simplest form. Jennifer Connelly and her \"daughter\" are complete strangers to the viewer and their characters are randomly dropped in the movie with no background and no character development. The relationship between \"Maverick\" and \"Rooster\" is forced and completely underdeveloped as well. The rest of the movie are scenes trying to draw your memories back to the original movie released almost 4 decades ago ( random shirtless beach scenes with characters you don't care about , singing bar scenes with characters you don't care about etc etc....) TOTAL waste of a movie in my opinion.",

So when me and my girlfriend saw it, I told them about it and they didn't know about the sequel. I knew I had to see it with them. So I saw this movie twice in three days and I could watch this movie over and over again just like the first Top Gun. I don't usually watch movies and the last few movies I did watch I fell asleep because certain parts of the movie were just so long and drawn out I stopped caring, but Top Gun Maverick is not like that. It's truly EPIC.I'm actually going to get a personalized license plate for my Kawasaki ZX6R that represents this movie and it's already reserved with the DMV for me! All the Maverick combinations are taken already though. I live in Virginia and they require a helmet but I think I'm gonna break the law today and wear aviator sunglasses and ride around the block, jk, or am I?

The movie keeps you on the edge all the way and although the story is not that great, it is the story this movie needed, nothing else.

Or maybe because being an aircraft buff, I instantly knew the MIGs they were engaging were F5 Northrops, a far inferior aircraft to the F14 Tom Cat, which made the dog fight scenes unconvincing.But this one... WOW, out of this world. Convincing enemy, convincing goals. If it's meant to be a franchise, this story not only neatly ties together the first Top Gun, but gives added dimension to Tom Cruise's character, Maverick, his love for flying, his recklessness, and most importantly, his relationship to Goose's son, superbly acted by Miles Tiller. On top of that, the goals were made clear from the beginning and the challenges in completing the goal was drilled into the script, which gave the film extra tension and extra focus.Like the first Top Gun, it's real planes, real aerial shots. But unlike the first Top Gun, which was filmed in unconvincing cockpits and backgrounds, the actors here were in the real aircraft, in the air, going through the maneuvers and pulling the Gs.A very neat story and a visual extravaganza, this is a treat.",

Great flying sequences, but maybe the combat training would go smoother if everyone stopped comparing their Johnsons every two minutes.Two hours of women used only as wise-woman emotional-support cheerleaders.Two hours of Maverick impulsively saving people from impulsive decisions by teaching them to act more impulsively. This recklessness - dare I say 'Maverick nature' - seemingly permeates the environment.The premise itself of using cadets to conduct a half-baked pre-emptive strike on a sovereign nation is impulsiveness on a strategic and political scale (WMDs, anyone?). Let's go full-meta and inquire as to where the decision to make this unasked-for sequel came from.Two hours of millennials dressing like their grandparents and rocking out to music made 50 years before they were born. We get it. It's a tribute. Please stop thwacking us over the head with it.The sad thing is not that so much was unthought-through.The sad thing is that impulsiveness led to so much waste.Jennifer Connelly is wasted as the torch-carrying single-mum.Glen Powell and Monica Barbaro are wasted as supposedly pivotal squadron members who are sidelined as soon as they spur the protagonists' character development.Ed Harris is wasted as the hard-ass Admiral, whose ominous drone program I swore would feature later on.Eight of the twelve pilots - including my fave Manny Jacinto - are wasted, as nothing they do matters, and the story only focuses on a few, especially Maverick's son-figure.The biggest waste was the potential for Maverick to pass the torch graciously to the next generation. (Top Gun Cinematic Universe let's gooooo!)Psych! He impulsively takes the torch and heads for the mountain.Ultimately, everybody loves Maverick, much as they snark about it. Admirals bail him out. Jilted exes float back. Juniors he betrayed risk their lives to prove themselves to him.The mountain does go to Maverick, our boomer aviator in aviators, almost proving that the world does in fact revolve around him.",

This all changed when it received critical acclaim. I watched it and I could not believe how GREAT it was.This movie is so exhilarating to watch. All the flight sequences felt so real and intense. This is mainly due to the use of real planes flying in live locations. Planes are often seen accomplishing complex maneuvers on rough terrain. All of this is accompanied by excellent music and sound design. This achievement is truly stunning and cannot be understated.Besides the great action sequences, this movie also has a surprising amount of heart to it. The movie mainly focuses on Maverick, played by Tom Cruise. He did a great job during some of the emotional scenes in this movie. All the supporting cast delivered great performances as well.As for criticisms, I would say the plot and characterisation are rather simplistic. However, this movie does not need a complex plot or a complex character for it to work. The stunning action sequences and the heartfelt story more than made up for the price of admission.I highly recommend watching this movie in the cinema, especially in IMAX. This movie is best viewed on the big screen. This is one of my favourite movies of this year, and I am glad to have watched it.",

This is my personal, detailed rating of the movie based on multiple key aspects that I believe define what makes a movie good or bad. I watched the movie in cinemas (Laser Ultra) with my family and we found it very entertaining. I didn't know much about the movie nor its predecessor, but I was pleasently surprised about the concept, adrenaline inducing action and filmmaking. Enjoy the review!I went into the theater blind, not even having watched the first Top Gun (which I highly regret). I didn't really have any expectations - though I did presume that I was going to witness some awesome practical effects. And that I did.I loved the story. It felt classic, but not to the point of cliche. It felt like a wholesome and exciting story. The characters were all very stereotypical, which is a good thing in this case. A mix of all these stereotypes thus made for the perfect team. I was pretty much entertained throughout the whole movie and didn't once feel bored or anything like that.Tom Cruise nailed it once again. For those including sometimes myself who might have thought at some point that Cruise is a great stuntman but not necessarily a great actor - this movie proved me wrong once again. Obviously he's still a great stuntman, but his acting is also top notch. There were points that I felt really emotional. I also liked Jon Hamm's character because I hated the character but eventually respected him.The action was insane! Having filmed this in actual fighter jets and in the sky made this movie incredible for me. I felt real stakes and was at the edge of my seat throughout all the action sequences. The adrenaline rush that they must've felt definetely pushed through the screen into our bodies. The right amount of humor was inserted and it was nice.The cinematography was incredible. The visuals of the film were top notch and oscar worthy for sure. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (and others). Definetely one to save on Spotify.This movie surprised me in a very good way. Didn't expect to leave the cinema this flabbergasted. I highly recommend this one to be viewed on the big screen - as per usual. Finally, my rating of this film is 9/10.",

Anyone who's followed the movie scene in the last few years have seen the reboots and so called sequels Hollywood has pumped out to try to cash on the Nostalgia. Some of the efforts are better than others, but most left a bad taste in your mouth and even tainted the first film's legacy.The technical aspects were amazing, excellent editing, incredible stunts, endless practical effects which is the way it should ALWAYS be done but unfortunately hasn't been for some time, and never on this level.Tom Cruise brings another killer performance as you'd expect, but everyone is on their A-Game.This movie is faithful to it's original as a sequel, I loved the plot points that were brought into the new film, as well as continuing on with Iceman and Goose's legacies. Rooster is a spitting image of his old man, and the way the story handled it was perfect. Just like the original movie, there was incredibly emotional scenes that you felt as if you were there. Many films cannot capture this lightning in a bottle and often come off arrogant or downright stupid.Growing up, I've always seen the greatest action movies (in my opinion) many times. But these were years and decades later enjoyed on VHS or DVD in my living room. I am truly glad to have been able to go see this the way it was intended, on the big screen. As of writing this, I have seen the film 3 times, in a regular theatre with Dolby Atmos, Ultra AVX, Ultra AVX D-Box. It was still just as awesome the third time. I am planning to see it again when it comes to IMAX in my area.If you're thinking about checking it out please do.

It was fun watching my classmates' back-slapping after we viewed the movie together. (A few years later the roles would be reversed when The Hunt for Red October came out.)Fun fact: when we students would have to fly back-and-forth from Monterey to LAX back in my flying days, this submariner would be the pilot because none of my naval aviator friends were rated to fly the Piper Cherokee 6 we had at NPS. They loved that!In any case, last night we watched Top Gun: Maverick and it was simply terrific. Way better than the first one. Much more realism, texture, and nuance. (I don't think Tom Cruise did nuance when he was in his 20s.) And a whole lot of memorable lines. One of my favorites: Admiral to Maverick: \"You're still a captain.\" Maverick to Admiral, \"Yes, but a highly decorated one.\"Loved it. And I agree-- this is a movie that should be seen on the big screen.",

            "content": "I have to watch the original now to reel me back in.Having been 16 when the original was released this will be a biased review but deservedly biased. The original stands the test of time because the zero usage of CGI with a realistic storyline. If you were a teenager back then you'll recall the surge in recruiting the Navy had because of Top Gun. To the point they had recruiters at movie theaters. This movie probably had a negative impact on Navy recruiting.This however is nothing more than a remake, reboot or whatever the buzzword is they use today with bad acting and bad/forced dialogue. If a sequel were to be done it should've been 30 years ago maybe post Operation Desert Storm.I don't mind sequels but don't like remakes being passed off as sequels. Top Gun was an amazing military movie. Top Gun: Maverick is a cheesy military movie. It's made for all those born 10 years after the original and passed off as an original for that generation much like so many other remakes.I can watch the opening sequence of the original over and over because it got me hyped for the movie and still does but this opening sequence...well, it tried.The mission itself is Armageddon(select group) meets Star Wars: A New Hope(destroy Death Star scene) meets Top Gun(fly fighters) meets Behind Enemy Lines(evade capture).Recreated fast motorcycle scenes on taxiways.Maverick gets called onto the carpet by his superior for a mission after screwing up much like he did in Top Gun.Maverick sitting at a bar alone deep in thought. Penny rephrasing an original Charlie(Kelly McGillis) line reference not being happy unless your pants/tail is on fire.Goose's son, conveniently named Rooster, dresses just. Like. Goose. Rooster even plays piano like his waterfowl Dad, Goose. Same song too! With so many similarities shouldn't hos call sign be, \"Gosling\"?!Rival between Rooster(the new Maverick) and Hangman who also has a call sign similar to Iceman. They call him Hangman because he always leaves you \"hang out to dry\". They called Iceman \"Iceman\" because that's how he flew, \"Ice cold\".Instructor(Maverick) is not known to his students in a bar scene much like how Maverick tried to pick up Charlie then he walks in and they are taken aback with similar introduction. And all within the first 35 minutes.Volleyball scene replaced with a beach football game in jeans but replaced with a horrible song.See a pattern here?They broke a \"major rule of engagement\" for breaking the hard deck and disciplined for it. See original.And I'm pretty sure Penny Benjamin lives in the same house as where Charlie lived.And it wouldn't be Top Gun without a training accident with ejection.Jon Hamm standing around with pursed lips for two hours. The one liners didn't land like they did in the original.Being a Veteran my pet peeve is movies not doing something correctly that's considered the most important of all Military Courtesies and Customs...the hand salute. Miles Teller completely jacked it up.There's a lot of praise for this movie breaking from the norm and not being \"woke\". Sorry to disappoint but this movie, is in fact, \"woke\". You have to look for it.Now for the good. Kudos for being able to bring Val Kilmer back even if for a short scene and realistically use his illness. And, of course, what everyone came to see which is the aerial footage.Watch it. See for yourself. I'm a Top Gun fanboy but not a Top Gun: Maverick fan. Very predictable because it is a remake.",

He showed himself like that, but on the other hand he gave the way to the young people.I wouldn't say the first'Top Gun' was the best film but now it became one the important film\nStory of film because of 'Top Gun Maverick' even the story was quite masculine, simple, sometimes rough and typical big budget entertainment film.It was great because those complicated flight actions were watchable enough. I was exited for them and all untwisted camera work and untwist music.Tom and Mills Taylor looked nice but I cannot forget mentioning Iceman a.k.a. Val Kilmer. He made me cry.I know it's not a war film, more like a sports film but I felt a bit bad the enemy. This could make audience's fighting energy high. One more thing I felt bad is the treatment of nuclear energy in this film, which was like James Bond series in old years. Although I know it's just a symbol.I don't really watch film because of the actors but Tom Cruises. I'm not asking about preference.

Cruise's once relatable emotional vulnerability that he incorporated into his roles is no more. Cruise has successfully eliminated these human weaknesses courtesy of a team of powerful influencers whom he considers gods among men. Their painstaking role in removing the emotional side of the actor known as Tom Cruise has put him into the unenviable position of playing a much colder version of Tom Cruise who must be \"on\" 24/7. His handlers have played a pivotal role in ensuring the characters he plays reflect the emotional limitations that Cruise seems to have developed with intentions that defy explanation..Don't let the narcissistic, temper-tantrum prone actor who seems capable only of playing the same role, under the guise of a different character name, keep you from enjoying this sequel. The visuals are incredible, courtesy of a near seamless mix of incredible cinematography and CGI. The sound editing is spot on, and the other award-winning actors do well to add the relatable human element and depth of character that more than compensate for Cruise's self-taught trademark lack of motional range and humility. .It's likely there will be a Top Gun 3, and perhaps a four, five and six. They will likely be equally adored - just as long as the sequels are budgeted accordingly and Cruise can continue to portray himself as himself, while surrounding himself with powerful jets (with similar cool lines and dominant offensive capabilities). Most important will be the necessary number of tried and true award-winning actors who introduce humanity and vulnerability into an otherwise predictable storyline with a predictable lead. Given these conditions; these likely forthcoming sequels will certainly continue to be worth the ticket price.",

But Tom Cruise and Joseph Kosinski really understand and know what they want from the sequel...it's a really long waited for making a sequel, ( and also because of the pandemic for making this release date putting another year ) but they have done such incredible job for making it right.For the whole visuals and cinematography, hands down the flight sequences are the next level from the original film ( or any flying sequences in any film ) the long wait to the technology for capturing the actors and actresses inside the fighter jet is breath taking experience. The whole experience brings much more intensity in those flight action sequences. ( MUST watch in IMAX )The storyline is also quite convincing, even the story has been 36 years ago. This sequel really brings lots of connections in the story of the original film, such as Val Kilmer of Iceman, Miles Teller as Rooster who is the son of Goose ( Tom Cruise flight partner from the original film ), using few of the main original soundtrack of the first one, and some similar classic sequences from the first, etc ( you can probably see them from the trailer ) it brings lots of old memories back and they have done it right in this.The only thing I may complain to this film is also the similarities, where there's really been little too much similarities from the original film, which may not bring me any freshness in terms of story wise. But other than that, the whole excitement watching this film in IMAX has been amazing. So I won't mind with those little tiny complain. Overall this film really brings practical flying visual sequences into the next level.",

In this movie Maverick does what he does to protect his comrades not put them in danger.Top Gun Maverick is much more family friendly than the first moves with the sex scenes dialed down, more diversity. And a greater respect for women than just frat-boy objectification.And then what was done so well in the original movie with the actual plane footage was even taken to a much higher level in this movie with cameras out inside the cockpit and real footage of the actors pulling Gs and really feeling the stress of those high speed maneuvers. You can see the physical tool the pilots endure in that kind of flying that you just don't get a perspective for in the original.I'm so glad they kept some of the original music from the first that really ties in to this movie.

They repeat the plot hole of having planes arm and fuel themselves only because the pilot wants to fly them - over and over again. An actual Naval Aviator wrote an exhaustive list of errors in the movie. For one, Maverick would have been discharged because he didn't get promotions on time. At best, he might have been a civilian test pilot.There is one good thing in the movie. The P-51 Mustang is Tom Cruise's own plane. He is an accomplished pilot in real life.

Tom Cruise may not direct his films, but his fingerprints are all over the ones he produces and you can tell her really cares about advancing filmmaking in Hollywood. From the sound, to the editing to the direction, Tom Cruise controls so many aspects of this film and for him to be front and centre and command the screen at the age of 60 is incredible.To yourselves a favour and watch this movie on the biggest screen possible!",

You can still catch up with your plans at any age, or at least until you are very very old. Perhaps until then we should keep working and not stress too much.I also loved the romantic part of this movie. It seems finding love is also never too late? Oh my gosh, I can't believe Jennifer Connelly was around 50 in this movie. I thought she's like 40. It's interesting to see Cruise's character dating someone closer to his own age. Nice.But yeah, it seems that even at that age you can date a hot woman and have a good relationship. <3\nShe also was absolutely stunning at an interview with Graham Norton for Top Gun with that black hair laying to the side.This movie doesn't have any green screens and the characters were actually flying IN the planes.Great stunts, great acting, great movie, great inspiring thoughts with our golden gentleman Tom Cruise.",

However, it lacks too much for me to give a high score.The premise is that Maverick (Tom Cruise) after 30-something years since the first movie has not made much of a carreer. That in itself is an refreshing idea: it makes him more an anti-hero than the typical Hollywood hero.He is given a last chance in the Navy to prepare a group of young pilots for a dangerous mission. The catch: one of those young pilots is \"Rooster\", the son of Goose - Mavericks's buddy from the first movie who died during a flight accident. Rooster holds a grudge against Maverick for multiple reasons and of course this gives some friction.There is also some mild competition amongst the young pilots. They are just a standard mix of all kind of minorities so that every one can feel included, They are basically cardboard characters and it is hard as a viewer to relate to any of them.There is also an unncessary romance between Maverick and the local bar owner (Jeniffer Conelly), which does not connect to the rest of the movie in any way. It is nice thoughThe final mission is an air strike against an unnamed other nation. Of the enemy we only see the exteriors of their jets and face shots of the sun-visors of their pilots. This does not help in giving a face to the enemy. I understand how it would have been politically sensitive to name a country as the enemy, but the least the director could have done was give some hints what part of the world this enemy is supposed to be in, so that we could all imagine our favourite enemy from those parts.The finale is spectacular, but predictable. The flight scenes are very well done, but unlike the original where one could imagine how challenging.it could have been to shoot those scenes, here probably most of them were done digitally, which takes away much of the awe factor.In summary, I feel that this movie does not improve on the original in any aspect. Given the choice, I would prefer watching the original for the 10th time over watching the sequal again.",

Now, this is a movie that nobody really asked for, including me. But hey if it's good I'll take it, and this movie was good. If you love the original Top Gun there's no reason you won't love this movie. I personally never loved Top Gun. I like it. I thought it was good, and that's how I feel about the sequel. I do think this film is a bit overhyped as being one of the best films in years. I'd say it's about on par with the original from the story, characters, acting music, etc. Though, I will say, the jet action scenes in this film are better than in the original. That final action scene blows the climax from the first one out of the water. It's all done practically from what I here. This film should be seen on a big screen for that alone.There's not much else I can say about this film. It's what every good sequel should be. It's very much like the first movie, honoring the fans of that film, but is also a logical progression as Maverick is in a very different place here than in the original. In the first he was a cocky recruit wanting to be the best pilot, and learning how to be a team player. Here, he's an instructor teaching other recruits how to be a team to do this impossible mission (see what I did there). Maverick also has family drama with Miles Teller's character Rooster, Goose's son from the first film. Those two are by far the highlight of the movie character wise, much like Maverick and Goose were in the original, while the other characters were just there. Jennifer Connally is the token love interest of the movie much like Kelly McGillis's character Charlie was in the first. Also, I find it weird that Charlie's character is not even mentioned in this film. They could've at least showed a picture of her.",

Tom is a maverick doing things his way, playing loose with the rules, blah blah blah.The acting was just as bad as the mustaches. I'm surprised they didn't give the female pilot a mustache just to show off how much of a badass she is.The visuals were amazing. They should have just shown the title of the movie followed by a bunch of jets doing stuff, then rolled the closing credits. That would have been a much better film.",

            "review_title": "The Perfect Blockbuster",
            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick was perhaps the biggest surprise of 2022 in movies. It bested the likes of Titanic and Infinity War at the US box office, has a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, got an A+ on CinemaScore, and even got an 11-minute standing ovation at Cannes. That is what you call success. On the surface, it seems like any other revival of a popular 80s movie. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell is recruited to train a new batch of Top Gun students for an extremely dangerous bombing mission, or they will be replaced by automation. But what is the recipe for success? There have been plenty of revivals/sequels to popular 80s movies lately, but none came even close to being as popular or well-received as Maverick.Maverick is good because it feels like an actual 1980s blockbuster, not just a revival of a popular IP. It's a very optimistic film, where there is no obstacle that cannot be overcome. It's somewhat reminiscent of the original Star Wars in that regard. So many films, even popular blockbusters, try to be subversive and deconstructive these days. A lot of these revivals, including the Star Wars sequels and the recent Terminator movies, are contemporary blockbusters with the facade of a classic. Top Gun: Maverick has absolutely none of that. The main thing it does right as a sequel is that it honors the legacy of the original and its characters, rather than put them down to prop up new characters.The characters, old and new, are one of the highlights. Maverick still has that unusual cocky charisma from before, but he still feels the weight of Goose's death 35 years later. Between this and repairing his relationship with Penny, it really is a film about leaving a legacy, and it's done very well. Tom Cruise's performance in this movie is also quite good. If there's one person who steals the show, it's easily Val Kilmer reprising his role as Iceman. Having him come back was a real treat given his health issues. Rooster is the main new character, Goose's son. His distrust of Maverick because of Goose's death is the central conflict between the two. The turn from distrust into trust is a great character arc between these two. Miles Teller was great, as was the return of Jennifer Connelly. The rest of the cast is good, too. Any of them would've fit right in back in the day.There are a few issues with the movie. The dialogue is wonky. The story, while classic, is nothing that's never been done before. While it is nice to see something that really does feel classic, it's possible to do that and come up with a new story.As a production, the film is incredible. This is a top-notch action production, one of the all-time greats. It takes you into the cockpit, with over 800 filmed hours of in-flight footage. The flight scenes, both training and real combat, are an adrenaline rush. The best thing about this is that there's virtually no CGI here. This is all real footage of real planes. The actors went through real training to make this movie. That's incredible. The sound also really stands out, especially when seen in a theater. The shots and cinematography, both in the air and on the ground, are fantastic. And, of course, you can't forget the music. Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away, the classic Top Gun theme, it's all here.Top Gun: Maverick is the perfect blockbuster action movie. It has the best action scenes, the best effects, the best characters, and it's a real, successful sequel to a long-dormant franchise.",

THAT is a significant accomplishment in any movie, let alone one that previously was a relatively mindless summer blockbuster.One actually sees the HUMAN side of the character \"Maverick\" and comes to actually like him despite his many flaws. In fact he grows larger as he continues despite his flaws. That resonates much more than one dimensional super hero type characterization because one realizes the price that has to be paid to achieve the extraordinary.There is great CGI in this movie interspersed with actual flight scenes. It's pretty seamless and will age well over time.Downsides? A few- knowing a small amount about aerodynamics and friction at high mach numbers lells us that hypersonic mach speeds are not ejectable and survivable conditions. The limiting factor on the SR71 blackbird aircraft was NOT the engines, but the fact that the leading edge of the airframe could not survive speeds much beyond mach 3. A bit of artistic license yes, but one that pretty much strains believability in any realistic scenario.The other downside is that one has to wonder, if the Navy possessed sufficient firepower to crater and render enemy runways completely destroyed they could not do the same for the surface to air missile sites that guarded the exctrance and exits to the nuclear processing site.Flaws aside it's easily one of the best from Hollywood in the last five years.",

The story actually fits well considering with the time that has passed working to its favour.You even get the Tom Cruise running scene as you would expect. End of the day this is vintage Tom Cruise at his best pushing his inner adrenaline junkie to the limits for us to experience.Hat off the the team for all the cinematography work etc it was stunning.This is the type of movie you want to go to the cinema for which does not feel as though it was a story built around CGI which most modern action is these days but more a compliment.",

Top Gun: Maverick is really a great movie and worthy successor of the original Top Gun from 1986.In Top Gun: Maverick Tom Cruise returns as Pete Mitchel. What has changed during the past 35 years? Nothing much, Pete Mitchell is still reckless, \"do not think, but do\" and goes beyond the limits of what a fighter jet is designed for. The only real difference is Pete Mitchell is a captain now.In Top Gun: Maverick Captain Pete Mitchell returns to Top Gun with the impossible task to train America's best fighter pilots for an assignment which is even more impossible. Where the young team of fighter pilots convinced they are the best of the best, Captain Pete Mitchell proves them there is still much to learn. And all that in a timeframe less than three weeks.The built-up of the movie is very much similar to the original movie. The flight scenes on the other hand are just great, spectacular to watch and you almost get the feeling you are sitting next to Tom Cruise in one of his jets. But also for this movie, you have to use your imagination.Top gun: Maverick, the movie for 2 hours of great entertainment and much more!",

The whole premise is flakey at best and it tried to bring about the cool parts of the og TopGun.... But it feels like it comes from someone who doesn't understand the og. Doesn't understand and love what the military can and does do. The whole plot line is from decades ago, just a nebulas bad guy using bad things and of course they must be eradicated...... the characters are boring and not all that interesting. I'm glad I didn't go in theaters to see it, this still comes off as a really expensive love letter from Tom Cruise to himself...... also I'm still here for the homoerotic oiled up men on men sports montage even if it doesn't do a damn thing for the plot. Also.... Can we also mention exactly how ducking bad it'd be if any American equipment /pilot were found in a foreign nation after a missile strike like this, let alone more than one?

The plot is similar to it's previous film.. an intense flight training in the Top Gun school and an incredible Ariel combat mission in the Climax. Top Gun is famous for it's insane flight action sequences, here in it's sequel it is even more Spectacular and adrenaline pumping. From the opening sequence to the last battle it was extravaganza.Every Scene flows so well and the little emotions it carried from the previous movie is so good and worked out very well. In the era of CGI's Seeing these kind of Stunts and actions made without green mat is so incridible. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing.. and the little Nostalgic moments were very neat and beautiful. Definitely it will be a action blockbuster of this summer and easily one of the Best movie of the Year.Top Gun: Maverick is one of those movie that you have to watch in the theaters not only because it's a great movie but the sound and the visual in a big screen is an incredible experience.

            "content": "To begin this is probably one of or THE best movie of the decade until now, but as a great movie it isn't perfect but firstable let's begin for the good stuff:TOM CRUISE is an actor who is impossible to say is a bad actor and this proves it, it's amazing how this man being old as he is does this work really great, no one old as he is would do this work as he did it, the balls he had to have to do this performance it's admirable, i think he should got insured his Oscar.JOSEPH KOSINSKI deserves without any doubt the Oscar for being the best director of this year, it's an object for study how he directed this masterpiece, how complex are the cinematografic shots, the control and the passion he should have to control all of this huge staff what is even more the quantity of planes there are, believe me when i say the direction is the best this movies's got.Jennifer Connely did a good performance, it's great to see her in a movie again but being honest i don't think so she will win her second oscar, is a great performance but is incomparable to her performance in \"A beautiful mind\" it's possible she could be nominated but nothing else more to expect there's yet a big left of the year so it's obviusly there wil be more options.One of the things that makes this movie good is watch old staff from original movie which it's gotta be cherish and that's what makes this movie a great sequel, it keeps some songs from original movie, but i will regard that part later. It has to be take in care that there's no one who was a bad actor everybody was great in this moment but not perfect as Tom was.Music here fits as a great soundtrack has to do it, every music you listen on this movie goes perfectly with each scene chosen anyway let's remenber part of this great work was made by Lady Gaga who i don't think will win the Oscar because there's left Elvis movie wich obviusly has to have a great soundtrack however if this movie results has a poor soundtrack the clearly winner is Lady Gaga.Getting back to the direction every scene of planes is perfect but clearly stands out the training scene and the final battle where we can see how it plays with the people's strain and by part of the training scene it's the firts scene we see and wich starts to introduce this prefect work of direction.But as i said not everything is perfect in this movie like de history.Dont misunderstand me the history isn't bad, final's really good i'd say is a 8/10, beginning from the good side this movie started good and it ended AMAZING but the history isn't a marterpiece in fact to be honest is an easy script it's just about how Maverick becomes teacher and how he's gotta steer a team at the final to just destroy a military base is a bit lazy history it'd be great have a deeper script and dialogues, i repeat it's not a bad history it can be better; it's a 6.8/10 for the history.And to finish the final is beautiful but the final battle more when you think Maverick'd have died, no it really obviusly he won't and just try to give a intrigue moment but it isn't so severe it's okay in fact.Anyway no one of these \"bad moments\" it's enough to say this's a bad movie, no, and is what we're in front of a masterpiece gentlemen.Simply is a perfect work of direction and how a movie can make people feel like, and that's what makes great a movie the fact of make feel people this way with those shots. The best movie of the 2022 and i bet it's insured 9.4/10.",

This is why cinephiles and movie lovers go to the theatre in the first place.This movie has heart, adrenaline, great acting, REAL stunts (just incredibly produced) and a sense of nostalgia so thick that you can't help but smile and feel emotional throughout the entire runtime. WOW, was this a fun experience. I haven't felt this way watching a movie in the theatre in a long, long time. People in the audience were genuinely cheering, laughing, clapping and standing up at the end. The pre-movie speech from Tom Cruise totally pays off: \"we made this for you\", absolutely you did.This movie comes at a time of serious decline in the filmmaking industry. It is a breathe of hot, fast, fresh air away from the current structure of pushing as much CGI/green screen on the audience whilst being accompanied with lacklustre plots, weak scripts and no character development. If Hollywood experiences box office success from terribly made cash grabs such as Jurassic World Dominion and the recent array of poorly made comic book movies... then they will be the films that will be shown in our theatres. We need more movies like Top Gun: Maverick... you know, the type of movies that have simple but well articulated plot lines; character and story development; emotion; heart; adrenaline; epic music; unreal cinematography; insane stunts; and yes... a nostalgic experience that not only pushes the envelope, but proceeds to surpass the original classic.I created an IMDB account for this to be my first review. For me, this is up there with recent classics like Blade Runner: 2049, Inception, The Lord of The Rings and other epics that do not fail to deliver. This will be considered a classic in due time and is incredibly rewatchable.Thank you to the team for this project after countless disappointments in the theatre lately. This is the 2022 Summer blockbuster that fans of the original, and fans of great movies needed. I am still smiling and listening to the soundtrack after that experience. Do not miss the chance to see this one of the big screen!!! Highway to the Danger Zone, Don't Think Just Do, I have the need...the need for speed and EPIC movies once again. 10/10.",

            "content": "This movie is an unabashed love letter to Tom Cruise as well as to gung-ho hoo-aa style military action movies favored by the production houses of Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer (the movie is also dedicated to Tony Scott).Tom Cruise is almost in every scene and the production goes overboard to ensure that everything - from the dialogue to the lighting to the dazzle of his smile to the whiteness of his teeth to the sun setting exactly so correctly behind him to the blackness of his hair to the agelessness of his physique - all of that continues to provide frame after picture perfect frame of more Tom Cruise than you can handle in a lifetime.In short this is the Tom Cruise production fanboy equivalent of what the Hallmark Channel does for romantic Christmas movies.You know exactly what you are going to get - there are ZERO twists in the story, no one gets so much as even a scratch, there is ZERO action on the ground, and there is not ONE villain you can see in the movie. All of the action takes place in the air, the climactic battle is a cakewalk for everyone and barely lasts 10 mins with just two enemy aircraft showing up to ignominiously bite the dust. And the ending is well....even romance movies could not come up with a better HEA ending!!!!!The entire movie is a stringing together of Tom's greatest hits moments - with every scene setup so that he gets to have the last word with the best punch or emotional line. Of course almost everyone is against him but secretly worships the very ground he walks on and of course everyone hides a golden heart with eyes ready to turn moist. Dialogues are corny puffed up and cringeworthy or make for a good laugh.So why did the movie work obviously? There is just one answer and it is the obvious one - because of Tom Cruise and because he is a superstar. THIS is what he does best and no one comes even close. He is the last great superstar from a forgotten era that no longer exists - that of the superstar action hero that the whole world immediately recognizes who channels macho action in a bloodless old fashioned Boys' adventure style movie making the way no one does. That is why Tom would never be in a movie like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan.No one probably remembers the Boys action hero Biggles book series anymore (by Capt WE Johns) but for those who do Tom is the Biggles avatar. He is also the Hardy Boys come to life - that is the era and image he speaks to.And yes the Production has done a beyond awesome job of all the aviation and aerial action sequences and puts you INTO the aircraft - that is how good it is.So go watch it for your love of aviation and for Tom ......go Tom, you got this!!!!!",

This movie didn't change that in any way, shape, or form. I DID enjoy it despite him, though.The younger cast were excellent, especially Glen Powell as Bagman. Oops, I meant Hangman. I'm not surprised he had his role beefed up. Miles Teller was also pretty good, but I've seen him do better. It would have been nice if they'd been able to get a bit more screen time for the rest of the younger characters, but that may have dragged the movie on a bit too long and slowed it down, so I guess it was kind of enough that they didn't just sort of sweep them all to the side.The cinematography was excellent, too, and it took that feeling of excitement in watching the dogfights from the first movie and amped it all up really well, and I like that they were able to really expand on the cinematography of the actual flight scenes and make us feel a lot more like we were actually in the cockpits.The ending kinda let it all down for me, though. It almost felt like they decided to try to be something other than a Top Gun movie at the last moment, with the stealing the F-14 and all that. Otherwise, it was a damn good movie.",

Even with all the hype and positive reviews, it did not disappoint. This is the kind of movie you want to see in theaters!I wanted a premium experience, so I saw it at AMC Dolby Cinema. The seats literally rattled like I was on the jet.I'm so sick of the same old superhero movies and fake green screen coming out all the time, this was finally something older audiences could really appreciate.I doubt there will ever be another superstar Hollywood actor on the level of Tom Cruise - who really goes beyond entertaining his fans and so dedicated to his work. It's amazing he can sky dive solo, and really flying jets himself. That is true dedication. I'm also glad he's against green screen and understands story is just as important as the actions.36 years since the original Top Gun came out and it's definitely a worthy sequel that surpasses the original. The technology advances and actors aging to fit the storyline makes perfect sense.The original had the most epic perfect legendary soundtrack, that is impossible to top, so I'm glad they reused the original score in the beginning - that brought major chills. I wish they would have used Dangerzone though.There were some really intense action, I laughed, I cried a lot... everything you'd want in a great fulfilling movie experience.Is the script Oscar worthy? No. I mean, the original was basically a popcorn flick as well. It's basically Mission Impossible in the air. But it's not just mindless uninspiring action - it's action sequences that you can admire and respect from all the crews hard work (not just lazy green screen) - and the story has substance.Jennifer Connelly still looks good, but her character \"romance\" was definitely forced into the script. The intensity of the romance is nowhere near Tom had in the original.Also I don't remember any memorable additional music in the new one (Even Lady Gaga's song). The soundtrack definitely fails in comparison to the original... again, that department is impossible to top.Other than that, this sequel is superior.Time flew by fast and the movie didn't feel 2 hours at all.Watching the first Top Gun isn't necessary because they give you flashbacks, but I think watching the original will give you greater chills when seeing moments with Val Kilmer, etc.This is the kind of movie you'll be satisfied paying your hard earned money for - not repetitive green screen same old same old superhero junk films.",

When I started watching it was a bit slow, pulling on the old \"top gun\" movie which I remember because Im old. The movie improves and continues to improve, the characters develop, the mood and chemistry between the pilots blossoms and the ending was spectacular. And all this to my surprise. I rated it as a 9. I have some carrier experience too, and still 9/10. Worth watching. The highs and the lows are amazing, and the ending brought happy tears to my eyes despite my prejudices. It is a story not something real. Take it as a fiction and nothing more. Well done Tom Cruise and co. Well directed, great special effects extremely realistic enough to make any aviation experienced person enjoy along with the novice. Thoroughly enjoyable. I hope we see more of Cruise in the future because he is still an amazing actor as are all the others that appeared alongside him. I am trying not to drop any spoilers so this is as far as I go.

The pace was quite fast so it didn't always take too long for some action to occur or it just went by quickly because I was having fun. As far as the action goes, it's much better compared to the 80's one, which is quite logical considering the evolution of cinematography with better cameras and better effects. So hats off to the action scenes. Very nice show. What was also better in my opinion was the story. More interesting and, I would say, more suspenseful. It was all so cool and I enjoyed it so much, but there was one thing I missed terribly much and that was the song Take My Breath Away. I understand that they didn't want to repeat themselves and give it a new twist, but when the song Danger Zone was played, which put a smile on my face, the aforementioned Take My Breath Away would have made me even happier. All this time I was waiting and hoping in vain that at least for a moment it would be heard, but nothing. For me, it was an incredible shame. It very much brought the film down for me. To sum it up. Top Gun: Maverick will be better than the original 1986 one for many people. It was good. A lot of people will be excited and I definitely recommend it to fans of the first one. Just giving my opinion here. A lot of people will probably remember Top Gun for the fighter jet action scenes, which are plentiful and really great and sometimes very suspenseful. It's because they're I'd say better that this film has gotten so much positive feedback. But I had a different take on the original Top Gun and that was the 80s atmosphere, which was brought out beautifully by the song Take My Breath Away. This movie is not from the 80s anymore. That's a fact. But if they've done Danger Zone, I'd ask for Take My Breath Away. I'm repeating myself enough. This thing bothered me, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong. This movie is hilarious and like I said you probably won't regret going to see it. I just wanted to say that for me, unfortunately, the absence of the aforementioned song made it lose the charm I loved so much about Top Gun. Other than that, a good film for me and I recommend it.",

Poor direction. What else can you say about a movie that has absolutely nothing to offer us? Even the opening scenes were the same as the first Top Gun, with the same music. How creative. I thought I played the old Top Gun movie by mistake (which I recently started and stopped because it was painfully boring). I liked the first one, but I was very young and foolish.

Keeping in mind that I'm a bit of a movie fanatic and that Top Gun is one of my childhood faves, it is probably accurate to say some of my critiques are overkill.Nevertheless, here goes.... **spoilers**1. Super heavy on the Goose stuff. We get it. Goose died in the first movie and Mav is tortured by it. No need for the incessant call backs.2. Goose's son Rooster might as well have been played by a no name actor (Rather than Miles Teller... who I think is awesome) since the character's entire identity consists of being Goose's son and being slighted by Maverick in the past.3. Along the same line... no character other than Maverick has any depth whatsoever.4. Tons of lazy info dumping inserted into dialog to explain Maverick's past 30 years.5. Hangman is just a douchier and less interesting Iceman.6. Love story with Jennifer Connelly was kind of pointless.7. Dialog was cheesy throughout a lot of the movie and they went a little too heavy on the nostalgia IMO.8. The mission the movie centers around is kind of ridiculous. They basically were like \"let's have Maverick and Rooster do the Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star thing.\" I mean Rooster even had to basically use the force to hit the target in the end. And I'm not a military tactician, but why wouldn't they have used a stealth bomber with precision guided bunker busting bombs or any other option rather than what they chose? It just doesn't make sense to me. Is it really so difficult to invent a believable mission that would require skilled fighter pilots these days?With all of that said.... I thought it was fun to watch for the most part. The action sequences were enjoyable. Pretty much every moment involving a jet was exciting. Seeing Val Kilmer do his thing was nice.I enjoy it well enough.... I wanted to love it.",

I don't think there is something more boring than the army... I also don't understand why these guys have to be portrayed as obnoxious, arrogant a-holes... They must be thinking they are cool or something flying their dumb F-whatever planes and their stupid little nicknames but to me al least it's completely the opposite.Another thing I totally despise are the goofy, dumb Hollywood little jokes stuffed in which this does not lack of course.So to summarize, this movie doesn't seem to be for me. In my opinion if you don't find the army stuff interesting (quite the contrary in my case) you'll probably not like it, it is not for anyone like I was initially hoping. I gave it a 5/10 because it has some good actors and for the effort they put into making it I guess.Last thing I want to specify is that I recommend the old Charlie Sheen parody, I definitely found that a lot more fun.",

Some set-ups and pay-offs are downright cringeworthy. You could argue that this is an hommage to the 80s, but it just doesn't work that well anymore.The scoreWhen original music is being heard, it feels great and appropriate. But when Hans Zimmer's music cues in, things go south, mainly because it feels like Hans just opened up some old INCEPTION Cubase projects and re-used them almost verbatim. Also, the VI-IV-I-V chord progression is so incredibly overused and cringe by now that using it in an unironical way should be considered a crime.The dialogue editingIn a blockbuster movie like this, I expect good, if not great sound quality. Some of the dialogue was severely over-denoised and trashy, which is unacceptable.The film editingNot a big issue, but at times there were strangely unmotivated and jarring cuts in dialogue scenes which kinda took me out of the scene. I wonder if this was a little hommage to Tony Scott. Probably not.However, these points shouldn't discourage you from getting a few cold ones and enjoy one of the best nostalgia baits ever created.

            "content": "Yesterday evening I watched \"Top Gun - Maverick\" in the cinema. Here is my personal impression of the film (spoiler-free and only minimal spoilers in the third paragraph, but I mentioned that again at the point):First, a few words about the original 80's film: I'm not a big fan of the film, because it lacks that certain something to be terrific. Especially the inner logic in the story is a problem of the film. But even otherwise it is only solid to good from today's point of view. The soundtrack, Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and the others, however, were convincing and I liked the film quite a bit.\"Top Gun - Maverick\", however, simply raises everything that made up its predecessor to a whole new level. Action, suspense, staging, sound mixing, camera technique and acting performances are all on a very high level. Only the story is extremely flat and only serves to justify the film and its extremely cool production. For me, however, this is completely okay.Briefly to the story (minimal spoilers): The enemy (not named/fictional) has a nuclear stockpile in a crater surrounded by anti-aircraft missiles and enemy fighter jets and a jammer. The Navy's best fighter pilots must destroy this nuclear stockpile. Maverick must train the pilots to do this and make the selection of which six of the twelve pilots will end up flying the mission. Goose's son is one of the twelve fighter pilots, which of course presents a personal challenge to Maverick. The enemy is shown only in the abstract throughout the film. There are no flags and there are no real visible people other than the enemy pilots. Therefore, the enemy image here is very abstract and impersonal. But this doesn't disturb the flow of the movie in any way, because the focus is just completely different. (end of spoilers)Despite the flat story, the film is very exciting and intense, especially in the last third, when it really gets down to business. Emotionally, the film was able to pick me up and let me sympathize with the characters. The film takes the necessary time to introduce the characters and build the relationship between the characters. The film never feels rushed, but also doesn't feel stretched out or too long at all. At 131 minutes, it has just the right running time.Tom Cruise plays Maverick, the eternal \"Captain,\" better than ever. He convinces with his usual coolness, charm, self-confidence and charisma. He gets emotions across well in the film and shows more of them here than in his other film roles. As always, Cruise is simply THE star par excellence.Miles Teller plays Goose's son \"Rooster\" very convincingly as well. The conflict between him and Maverick comes across well and makes for one or two emotional scenes. It is interesting that Miles Teller looks very much like Goose at the time.Jennifer Conelly plays Penny Benjamin, a woman who seems to have known Maverick for some time, though she did not appear in the original film. There seemed to have been some brief flirtations between the two in the past. Conelly plays Penny very convincingly and is a kind of \"anchor\" for Maverick when he gets stuck or to give him courage.Even Val Kilmer plays a short part here, and the scene is really extremely touching. I won't tell you more about it. A great tribute to the old star, who is unfortunately plagued by illness today.The other actors/actresses are more supporting roles, but each of them plays their part well and believably.The camera work is just insane. The shots in the cockpits, outside the planes and also the brilliant aerial shots from a distance are just a hammering sight. Frequently, long shots are shown, both on the ground and in the air, and that is always an impressive sight. Especially the shots that are so far away from the fast F-18s that they can be easily tracked by eye are really impressive as well.The cuts are also good, if sometimes a bit too fast. But that's hard to do any other way in this kind of film, since things are fast and furious here, so it fits quite well.The flying and action scenes are just unbelievably awesome and raise the bar for future movies that are about flying battles and planes to an extremely high level. The flying and fighting maneuvers are expertly staged and really press the viewer into the seat.The sound mixing is probably on the highest level, but unfortunately our cinema can't quite keep up. It's time for an upgrade in the cinema in my country.The soundtrack mixes new with old. A lot of the old film was used and a little polished up. One or two good new pieces are also included, including a good song by Lady Gaga. Overall, the music is still great and supports the feeling and atmosphere very well.The style of the 80s was well preserved and cleverly combined with today. The film exudes the charm of that time as well as that of today.ConclusionTop Gun - Maverick is an action spectacle of a special kind. The flying scenes and combat maneuvers are simply a feast for the eyes and worthy of reference thanks to the terrific camera work, the sound is a feast for the ears (assuming a well-equipped cinema), the music is an ode to the 80s and the story is emotional on a character level. This film should definitely be experienced on the big screen with good sound equipment!9/10 points - Medium rewatch value.",

            "content": "Who knew a sequel made 36 years later would not only surpass its predecessor but soar far above what anyone could have imagined. Tom Cruise has once again delivered a masterclass in the art of making a blockbuster with Top Gun: Maverick defining what makes a true cinematic experience. He felt the need-and though some may say it comes a few decades late-the need for speed never dies within all of us and this movie proves that right from its invigorating opening sequence.Cruise teams up with frequent collaborators, director Joseph Kosinski and producer Christopher McQuarrie, which told us we're in for a Mission: Impossible-level event film. Yet, all expectations were blown out of the atmosphere at hypersonic speed. The talent and dedication to the craft is visible from every actor's performance, every shot, every angle, and every heart-pounding flight sequence. This film is meant to be seen, heard, and felt on the largest screen with the most powerful sound system. It's sound mix is Oscar worthy, along with its inventive cinematography techniques that put the audience directly in the cockpit with Maverick.I have to admit I wasn't around back when Top Gun hit theaters and pop culture. But even I could feel the nostalgia through the soundtrack, callbacks, and tributes-and the many white-haired fellow moviegoers who all had an edge-of-your-seat thrilling time watching this rare movie. They really don't make them like they used to anymore.The visual effects here are minimal, of course, due to the very real practical effects as we see the daring young actors get taken up in the fighter jets with the adrenaline king, Tom Cruise. As he continues to age, he seems to be worrying less about his own safety and more about living in the moment and pushing past current filmmaking limits as much as he can. This makes for an obviously exhilarating filmmaking process which translates to nothing but pure entertainment at its highest level.Top Gun: Maverick cannot be hyped up enough because it's not just a nostalgic node to an iconic 80s movie. It's a breathtaking experience from start to finish that might be the last of its kind, just like it's main character. Still, it has made its mark-and hit its target-as a memorable summer blockbuster. It makes anyone want to come back to the theaters again and again, taking the highway to the danger zone.-TE (5.26.22)",

            "review_title": "Less of the Same",
            "content": "What does one look for in a sequel? More of the Same? Perhaps just more? In my view, Top Gun: Maverick is rather more....\"Less of the Same\".The plot is fairly thin and predictable. In fact it's so stereotyped, someone's trying to sue Warner Brothers for plagiarising their ideas. So there's Maverick played by Tim Cruise. He's never followed the rules, and consequently, never been promoted. He's still defying rules, orders, the laws of nature, incredible to think he's survived this long. Of course, there's a 'special mission'. Its impossible. Suicidal basically, so Maverick is brought in to show the Young Guns how to ignore rules in favour of instincts, and use their top skills to save the day.This of course is great vehicle to bring in the generation gap issue between today's \"Top Guns\" and the older teacher. Confusingly, Cruise can't decide if he's old or young; great care is taken to color his hair, and even greater care is taken to have just the right amount designer grey stubble. Ed Harris and Val Kilmer look comparatively ancient. There's an interesting quote from Kelly McGillis regarding her absence; she basically says she looks her age and that is NOT what this film is about. But don't worry, when it comes to playing football on the beach at sunset, Tom's showing he still has abs like the young guys.So without giving anything away, there are very direct references to the original film in the storyline. It's an attempt to add irony and sentiment. It only partly succeeds.There's no doubt that the stars of the show are the jets themselves.Todays technology allows much better coverage of the flying sequences than before. Cruise stipulated that his involvement in the venture would be predicated on minimal CGI, and this was for the good of the final product. In the initial flying sequences there's a \"wow\" factor but 30 minutes later it gets a bit like \"oh yeah another jet\". For me, this is rather like the whole film.....it doesn't quite...take off.Again, without giving much away, the action in the closing 30 minutes actually adds something previously missing; tension. For this reason, I've given the film a 7 rating rather than a 6 (which is the level I use for \"uninspired but watchable\").So in summary, this film does not set me alight. It will appeal to those who like action over plot (or indeed acting), and is definitely going to lose something on the small screen. If you want to see it, go to a cinema for sure.",

It was a pretty straight forward storyline, albeit safe, but it also executed the simple well. If I had to say anything, just to nitpick, I would say the motorcycle riding shots weren't always necessary... but then again, I feel they added to aspects of Maverick's character that played a role in his inability to \"let go and move on.\"",

This film while it was never needed after nearly 40 years since the iconic original had completed the short filmic story of \"Maverick\" saving the day and getting the girl at the end has under Tom's firm insistence that a return to \"Fightertown\" shouldn't just be a lazy cash grab like Disney Star Wars, but demand everyone be at the top of their game. A compelling enough narrative, while it does echo strands from the 1986 film is comfortable to get into it after several minutes. The whole cast simply didn't follow the trend of most of Hollywood's films today in bringing in the legacy characters to be humiliated and disgraced for the sake of a new younger cast that takes up the baton. It easily could've gone in that direction so many times, but thankful the direction and script thought better of it and instead the younger cast members were a very pleasant surprise. If I were to mark the film down somewhere, it would be the Jennifer Connelly character being the weakest part of the film and didn't need to be in it, purely there as love interest for Maverick at some point between the two films that was unseen. What would have been better and made more sense would've been to bring back Kelly McGillis, but understandably she isn't in the best of health and reports that she just wasn't even asked back which is very sad. Back in 1986 it was the legendary F-14 Tomcats that stole the show from a younger rising star with the dazzling smile, 36 years later it's the greatest action star of the past 30 years that now upstages the newer F-18 Super Hornet jets, as amazing as the aerial stunts are and they are real, the true star for two hours is Tom Cruise himself. No longer needs to prove it, he just turns up and shows why he's the best in the business. 10/10.",

Plus you got Tom Cruise in a plane, Tom Cruise on a bike and he even got his contractual running in. What more could you want?",

            "content": "Short and sweet, no spoilers.Builds off of original, which I saw in theaters as a child, and adds to the story without being mucked in too much cheesiness. This time Tom brings his own flying skills, his personal P51, a good cast, Bruckheimer and director Joseph Kosinski, who Tom made Oblivion with. Already off to a good start.There is an undeniable sentimentality that comes with a sequel 36 years later. It has the requisite Americana heritage - his motorcycle from the original, aviator's, bomber jacket, Hard Deck bar, shirtless American sports scenes, Ice Man - and patriotic mission which pitches Maverick into the fold once again. I will ignore further story details, which I find rather unnecessary to disclose. That'll be for you to discover.What does matter is that the action and stunts in this movie were absolutely stunning. Kosinski did an amazing job capturing the scenes and translating the imagery in his unique stylistic and cinematic way. If you are a fan of Oblivion's artful delivery, you will not be disappointed here.Storywise, sure... I can bang on critical about a few things. One being that I'm not so big on what the particular political war aims were. BUT... in a perfect USA, where we actually defend instead of act as henchmen for the globalist system, I could imagine what America should be and that the enemy is a shadowy black helmeted robot. But, personal politics need no place here for any viewer. It's just plane fun (see what I did there?). I was so immersed, like the original, that I once again emerged ready to pump some weights, buy some toothpicks, and attempt to enroll in Top Gun.Was it better than the original you ask? Yes. On every level.It only made sense to watch this in Screen X which project peripheral imagery on the sides of the theater walls, bring the audience inside the movie and cockpits. So if your theater has it, don't watch it any other way.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this movie. Let's make that clear. Watching this in a cinema with Dolby Atmos really makes you tremble in your seat. Most of the voters for this movie probably like fighter jets or/and are a big fan of the first movie. And that will explain the high numbers of 9/10 voters.The story isn't very good. It's predictable and has cliches. And while i'm not a fighter jet pilot I am pretty sure that many of the manouvers they make or impossible or extremely dangerous. Flying upside down while looking into the cockpit of another jet? Probably impossible unless both pilots are actively trained into doing this manoeuvre. Flying up between to other jets who are close together in formation. Extremely dangerous. With speeds like that this would be a very tight spot to move your jet through without hitting anything. But hey, it's a movie so i'll buy it.The mission itself is a mysterie to me. Why send in fighter jets when you have tomahawk missiles who can probably do a better job. And why does the enemy place surface-to-air missiles like that? Sometimes 3 launch sites right next to each other and all in a straight line to the mountain where the actual target resides. So far for stealth operations, the missiles sites are practically pointing right at your important target. I would say, if you want to use jets for this operation then fly around and attack from the other side because there are NO missiles there.Dying is also not possible in this movie. Mach 10 breaking apart with your test plane? No problem. Flying back without flares to save your buddy? Just do it! And of course, when you are about to get shot down a buddy pops up to save the day. The enemy didn't notice that he was being target at all.",

            "content": "'Top Gun: Maverick' isn't an Oscar winning movie. It isn't some some deep and meaningful societal drama. It isn't a superhero movie filled with mindless effects, bland characters and social messaging... Thank goodness!'Top Gun: Maverick' is what has been missing from the cinema in recent years... A movie with great characters who you want to root for. Action and adventure, a dash of romance, a classic hero, and a patriotic story of good vs evil. No agendas, no lecturing, just good old-fashioned heroic fun with heart.It hits all the marks, from the nostalgia nods (without drowning in them), through to being a sequel that adds to the original without detracting from it. The character of Maverick finally grows up, but without feeling like he's been a useless man-child in the interim. There are touching moments, most notably with Val Kilmer, and an appropriate level of romance to round out Maverick's character arc. The side characters are all enjoyable clich\u00e9s of the best kind, ergo the type that are established quickly and well, and that you like and enjoy.One factor that makes this all even more enjoyable is that Maverick is _still_ the best-of-the-best (With Iceman possibly equal...). He's not portrayed as the tired 'ace' who has to move aside for the newer, younger, superior hero. No, he's just the best. And that provides the film with a huge, grinning sense of satisfaction.The plot itself is nothing original, but it didn't need to be. It's a mix of inspiration from the original film, with a dash of Star Wars and even a little Iron Eagle thrown into the mix. The heart of it is Maverick finally finding a home, and dealing with the fallout from losing his best friend (Goose) in the original, and the repercussions it had on Goose's son.From a visual standpoint, the film is appropriately stylish and the hefty dose of real aircraft footage, mixed with the effects sequences, helps to sell the film far more successfully than if it had been done with digital effects alone.If I had one complaint, it would be that the music just isn't up to the original. Hans Zimmer does the job, and it works, but outside of Harold Faltermeyer's original main theme, only the 'Darkstar' music is particularly note-worthy. Meanwhile, the integrated songs don't capture the new era the way the original did, but how could they? However, the soundtrack is a minimal complaint.Ultimately, 'Top Gun: Maverick' succeeds by being all that it needed to be, without trying to shoehorn in anything else. It tells a new story but honours its origins and leaves the viewer thoroughly satisfied.",

I'm pretty sure half of the flying we see isn't possible and, of course, the last half hour includes a ridiculously unlikely set of events. But it's a movie, not a documentary. And this one stuck to the basics. I didn't have to groan through any of the usual bits of virtue signalling. In 95% of other movies, there would have been a compulsory gay relationship squeezed in, maybe a trans character, some comments about the evils of capitalism and definitely apologies for American history. Here we just got the movie, and just the movie. Maybe in some other era, back when all movies focused on entertainment rather than preaching, I might have scored this a respectable 6 or 7, but in a world of boring super hero nonsense and inane political lectures, this stands out as one of the best of 2022 and maybe the very 2022.",

Also I think tom cruise should be given the distinguished flying cross four the effort he put into this film as actor. Also I like that he got too fly the tomcat one more time and he demonstrated a carrier crash landing with the net thing also the navy's around the world with carriers they have all the components they need four a cruise at sea just like any airforce base too.

I have heard rumors that Mr. Cruise may want to spend time on the International Space Station (ISS).

Of course, those could involve civilian and/or military Earthlings and/or extraterrestrials. And I'd be happy to discuss my concepts with anyone.",

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, taking the audience on a 120-minute emotional thrill ride and surpassing the original film in almost every facet.Whilst there are clear elements of nostalgia, they do not detract from the story, in which Cruise's expertly-acted fighter-pilot ace \"Maverick\" must confront and overcome past trauma in order to perform his duty and mend his broken relationships.Though the script was not particularly notable, powerful lines were delivered and the actors seemed to sink into their roles, conveying a lot of meaning through non-verbal communication. It also helped that many of the supporting characters went through their own minor arcs. All this aided by a stellar soundtrack well suited to an epic blockbuster. In addition, I do not mind the presence of an acceptable level of old-school Hollywood cheese/cliche in the plot and script; we are reminded that this is a movie made for the purposes of entertainment, and boy does it pay off in spades.What can I say about that action that hasn't already been said? Go and watch this film. The final act is an absolute goldmine of all-time wide-eyed cinematic awe, and that's not to undersell the earlier action scenes.Full of heart and surely satisfying fans of the original whilst also forging a new path for the franchise, Top Gun: Maverick was an immensely enjoyable and satisfying experience. I will be re-watching it multiple times into the future.",

            "content": "Director Joseph Kosinski has had an interesting career in Hollywood. He made his debut with the long awaited sequel TRON: LEGACY. I found it visually stunning but a bit shallow. His next film was with Tom Cruise and it was a sci-fi movie called Oblivion and I liked it fine. His third movie was a firefighting drama called ONLY THE BRAVE and it was shockingly good. Made my top movie list for 2017. And now we have his latest film TOP GUN MAVERICK which is also a sequel that was long delayed for reasons including the pandemic.And it is bloody brilliant filmmaking.This is one of the best blockbuster sequels in years. And I would argue that it is even better than the original TOP GUN. The 1986 movie is a nice slice of 1980s cheese and it proudly flaunts its brash machismo no matter how campy it looks today. And the sequel TOP GUN: MAVERICK does contain a lot of that same robust filmmaking but also it lends some depth to its characters along the way.Tom Cruise is in fine form as an older and wiser Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell who is beckoned once again to the elite academy known as Top Gun. His task is to train a rowdy group of younger pilots for a top secret mission. One of the recruits is his deceased friend's grown son (Miles Teller) who feels some resentment towards Maverick. The other students are either too cautious or too arrogant but Maverick has to whip them into shape to meet an impending deadline.The supporting cast is uniformly good. Miles Teller is a natural fit for playing Goose's son Rooster. He even looks a bit like Anthony Edwards. Glen Powell is a riot as the cocky rival nicknamed Hangman. The other students are not quite as prominent but they're all likable people. Jennifer Connelly is basically the love interest for Tom Cruise to court but they have solid chemistry together. Jon Hamm plays Tom Cruise's snobbish superior officer but his shift to a more genial personality feels genuine enough.As has been reported, the highlight of the movie is the flying sequences. I am not exaggerating when I state that these are probably the most exciting flying scenes put on film in years. And it is elevated by the film crew actually using real fighter jets in these scenes. The dogfights and training scenes are directed in masterful style by Joseph Kosinski.One of the best elements of the movie that I did not expect is that it does not take easy shortcuts. You think something is being telegraphed or foreshadowed. But then the opposite happens and you feel rewarded for it instead of cheated. Well done to the cast and crew for making such a spectacular piece of popcorn entertainment.",

Also it's impossible in reality for such an ancient airplane (F-14 Tomcat) to shoot down a more sophisticated plane.For my taste it would be a good movie if Maverick was killed at the end (i hoped for this scenario when he said goodbye before the mission but my hopes proved false). Does Hollywood stick to such scenarios for fear of upsetting the good American citizen or the US Pentagon?",

The submersive cockpit camera is over the top. Tossing aside the green screen pays major dividends.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a perfect blending of the original, from music, characters, and various call back/parallels and the next generation of Naval aviators.

Having watched the 1986's is an advantage to understanding the relationship between Maverick and Penny, and also the friendship with Iceman. It is still alright to watch the 2022's without seeing the 1986's. Basically, the plot touches on romance, friendship, or bromance (brother + romance) and passion!The flow of the first half is a bit slow and 'old-fashioned', but it picks up fast in the second half, and it just blows you away!The movie carries quite a bit of nostalgia effects, like an 80's movie, slow yet steady. Once all the characters are well introduced... the movie goes well and takes you on a speedy ride.The visuals of the fighter jet scenes are superb! To those who \"NEED FOR SPEED\", this is the one! I love the action sequences of low-altitude flights and airborne dogfights, they are exciting, and breathtaking! It's also smart to direct audiences towards a predictable outcome, yet it turns out to be a different ending, which is a good catch!The young-flyers (secondary characters) were made extra in this movie. Most of them play very small side-roles, and their personalities are NOT outstanding enough to impress audiences, except Rooster.The emotional value is there, BUT it's very much 'touch-n-go\", not involving and engaging enough to touch one's heart.I gave 3.5 out of 5.0. It's definitely worth your money to watch it on the big screen, or I shall say.. you should watch it in the cinema, in order to enjoy the visual and sound effect!

The story is what you'd expect from a Hollywood sequel.There were unanswered scenes and questionable things.No pilot would have ever done what Rooster did by going back and saving Maverick. That just killed his career by defying serious orders and losing a plane. They did not show anything of what his punishment ended up to be. This stuff happens only in Hollywood movies btw....Also I don't understand if its cheap writing or some American thing. But what is it with most American movies that there is always big family drama? There is always someone who hates someone else and blaming him/her for losing a family member and then they make up in the end. Its really childish and tiresome.The drama between Maverick and Rooster was so darn boring. It made no sense Maverick was still punishing himself for what happened. These pilots can't guarantee their lives either during training or in real combat. Just accept it and stop making boring drama.When Maverick choose Rooster over Hangman for the mission it was expected from the first minute of the movie that this was going to happen. Hangman was the clear choice. But Maverick went with feelings rather than logic. What is this a Disney movie for kindergarten?There were also not much back story to who is behind the nuclear target and how they found out. They could have focused on more interesting stuff rather than party and trash talk.Lots of boring party scenes and off course just like in the first movie there has to be two dudes who compete and hate each other. By that I mean Rooster and Hangman. I also wonder if this is an American thing or just Hollywood.Sometimes I think, 7/10 is too much to be honest. But just out of love for the franchise I'll let it be a 7.0.There are other things I could mention but I don't like mentioning everything.",

A team of fighter pilots needs to navigate a perilous route full of anti-air defenses and drop a bomb into a narrow tunnel leading to something very valuable to the enemy. Seriously? Me and my 15 yo son were laughing loud - thanks the authors didn't bring a Death Star into the movie.2. Trying to avoid mentioning who \"the enemy\" is or any motivation whatsoever for carrying out an air raid on a foreign soil makes it all look weak and cartoonish. \"the enemy\" flying both Russian SU-57s (like there's more than one country operating those now) and American F-14s is hilarious.3. Why would you fly training missions in a real canyon with a risk of losing a pilot or an aircraft if you have the software able to plot the course and track how close the plane is?4. The whole training process sequence is bland. The Navy brings in this super pilot, makes a big deal of his appearance, and what does he bring to the table? Drills one 2 min course with the team and delivers motivational speeches? Feels like a lost opportunity - can we not show what a military leadership would look like?

            "content": "The film is undeniably a masterpiece. Beforehand I'd never seen any work from director Joseph Kosinski, although, after watching this it's fair to say I'm eager to see more work from him. The way he took a huge task like making a sequel out of one of the most classic 80's films out there and managed to make it as good, if not, even better than the first one is admirable and impressive. He made it feel like an 80's film, but at the same time had a modern-day feel about it too. The cast was certainly stellar and the performances from each and every one of the actors/actresses were phenomenal. Tom Cruise never fails to impress me and Miles Teller's portrayal of the son of Maverick's late best friend Goose was done to perfection. Although with performances such as War Dogs and Whiplash, it was expected. The cinematography and visual effects were stunning and you felt, not only, like you were in the 80s but like you were in a fighter jet! The pacing of the film was also terrific as well as the score.However, where it fails to meet the demands of the original film is where the soundtrack is concerned. Although it was nostalgic to hear the classical theme at the start and the end, as well as hearing a brief cameo of \"danger zone\", I can't help but miss tracks such as \"take my breath away\" during the romance scenes. This brings me to my second flaw. The romance aspect of the first film was spot on so the sequel shouldn't have been expected to live up to its predecessor. Therefore, I believe more of an attempt to develop the character of Peggy, would've been interesting to see. Although, it more than made up for it with the action scenes that were certainly more developed and exciting than the first one. And even if romance wasn't as developed in this film, the emotion was certainly still there and I believe it was more emotional than the first one.To conclude, the first one has greater aspects than this film in terms of the romantic development of characters and a more memorable and catchy soundtrack. However, it cannot be expected to be completely greater than the first film as it is a classic after all. Therefore to manage to make an action-packed, emotional, adrenaline-pumping sequel, was incredibly commendable and this is why it betters its predecessor and is a better-made film overall. I loved every minute of it and believe it cannot warrant anything below a 9/10.",

The scripting and the directing could've been a bit better. The flying scenes are all over the place, some look very realistic and other scenes look a bit cheesy. This kind of was shot in a Mission Impossible style, which I really wasn't crazy about. The acting was good, but the performances alone weren't enough for me to give this movie anything higher than a 5 and 1/2. This could've been a great sequel, if it was more carefully planned out and didn't have as much cheesy scripting. A lot of people love this movie and that's great. Like I said, this movie is good, but it's not something that I'm gonna jump up and down about. I only recommend this movie to viewers who love airplane movies and tv shows.",

            "content": "There's a lot of reaction shots in this movie. Indeed, half of it seem made of approving shots of its leading man mostly, but of the movie crowd pleasing trajectory itself. It would look ridiculous if it bombed, so good for Cruise, Bruckheimer and Kosinski that it didn't. It is probably a good thing that it made its Cruise against the requel concept idea very much the text as it gives the movie something to chew on over and not get annoyed too much at how it just twists the template enough to let the egotist at center fight against passing the torch. His winning over how time operate in Hollywood surprising more effective than it should. No one on the young cast besides Powell register much, the father/son drama barely hangs there, and I have no idea why the script goes through the charade of pretending Maverick wasn't going to lead the mission from the start. I do appreciate that while Cruise seems like a terrible teacher, the movie goes so much over the mission, it adds a lot to the actual execution. Kosinski empty calories formalism is put to good use in a context that it is all about praising the precision of film execution (I laugh a lot at how much Jon Hamm is there as the ghost of prestige television), at same time its precision is very much of the kind that never do anything even slight outside of it. Those final 40 minutes do deliver good on that, some very good plane action. I like that this foregrounds danger and death enough to make it feel weightier than most current Hollywood spectacle (it also knows how to use Connelly on this regard, in this very conservative movie the promise of well-earned domesticity matters more than father/son reconciliation). The movie action is exciting because it feels like it actually has something at stake besides cathartic third act CGI destruction as it has become the basis from the last 17 years or so of Hollywood blockbuster movies, it is good telling detail that a lot of Cruise does as a pilot through the final action set piece is defensive maneuvering.",

            "content": "I was onboard with this heroic effort right up to when the comical objective of \"the mission\" was introduced to the audience. The question is, if this was a 'catch-us-up-to-Maverick' film, complete with modern weaponry, why on earth was this nihilistic mission the only way to achieve the objective? Upon mission reveal, I felt the movie shifted to a point-earning plot found only in a computer game, which will probably be available shortly. Not to mention, the perceived enemy once again remains so opaque, you never get a glimpse of their anatomy below the neck in a cockpit.Given the 36-years of sequel gap of Top Gun Maverick, you obviously start with fixating on the associations with Top Gun. You piece who is who, and what ties they had to the original. The \"hard deck\" rears its ugly head a little too much for my liking. The story thoughtlessly tidies up some loose ends and establish others. The scheme moves in eerily similar ways to 1986, yet they insist on taking you through the archetypal storylines of aged vs youth, middle aged vs ancient, and very young vs aged. At some point one wonders how many Admirals the Navy has and exactly what is the age limit for such a rank.Top Gun Maverick is technically flawless with realism beyond the typical CGI. The realism extends to the actors, who are truly having their lunch floating to their tonsils if they still have them. Cruise sees to the technical aspects and gives this version a polish that was seriously lacking in the original. The dogfights are exceptional, and the ultimate camaraderie is inevitable. TG Maverick is a very good film, but with a plot hole bigger than the sun. Alas, the mission however, was one for Force 10 from Navarone.",

A younger version of myself decided early on not to like him, but time and time again he comes up with amazingly entertaining movies. That is why I was a little disappointed with this latest endeavour.Was I entertained while watching? Sometimes, but I also got bored and actually feel asleep during the \"climatic\" assault run.As I see it the problem is first of all with the story itself. It has a few good moments, but a lot of drawn out repetitive bits. The reason I fell asleep during the actual assault run was because I had seen this run practised about a gazillion times before in the preceding 2 hours. Also the film lacks character development and the acting was not very good. I couldn't have cared less if all the newbies had been shot down at the end of this film. The \"young\" pilot actors all looked as if they walked out of some fashion catalog and behaved like total cardboard tools. Maybe this is how real Navy aviators look and behave, but it didn't make for interesting viewing. Give me a young Steve Buscemi any day of the week. Also I felt the editing was not very good. Lots of drawn out boring repetitive bits with the constantly annoyed upper echelons. To my mind they could have cut at least 30 min and gotten a better film or alternatively developed the story and characters more and put 30 minutes of interesting viewing in there. One more gripe is that it was not very believable. In real life if 4 F-18's fly nap of the earth over an active combat zone and they get 20+ Sams fired at them at almost zero range simultaneously none are coming home.The good bits. I thought the first 30 minutes were interesting and Tom Cruise was good as usual. Jennifer Connolly still looks Cliff-tastic and although she is an amazing actress she did not get a chance to show it here. I did liked the unexpected Tomcat surprise and the actual dog fighting at the end.If you liked the original Top Gun go watch it for nostalgia's sake, but apart from that I wouldn't recommend.",

Or is it because I said something about \"US world police prop***anda\"?Anyway:\nI enjoyed this movie a lot. It has a straight and simple and yet captivating story and a lot of very good top tier action, and wich was done by using mostly practical effects and filmmaking and was not a CGI overkill, unlike so many blockbuster action movies nowadays.The movie also stands out as an example for a very good sequel, which might even be superior to the first movie.If you can see past the blatant and yet relatively sparingly inserted \"US world police\" prop***anda (which was in the first \"Top Gun\" as well), this movie can be a very fun ride for you, especially if you are into a somewhat cons*rv*tive action movie experience. Thank you, Tom Cruise, for giving us such a movie in the 2020ies!A very good sequel, maybe even better than the first \"Top Gun\".",

Pretty darn good it turns out.Of all the films to bring into the modern era Top Gun is on paper one of the hardest to mesh with current sensibilities. The America is bad ass spirit and corny dialogue that ruled the roost in 1986 just shouldn't work in 2022 but the filmmakers inject just enough 21st century flavour to deliver a blockbuster experience for everyone.The films success is down to two things, the moviestar charisma of Tom Cruise and the practical effects. People flying around in planes shouldn't be so thrilling but after years of someone standing in front of a green screen pretending to blast tennis balls on sticks there is no doubt the air of authenticity takes the action scenes to another level.The main challange the filmmakers face is finding suitable real world bad guys and a modern day mission requiring expert fighter pilots. The movie goes to laughable lengths to obsure who the enemy is but it is probably the right call. We settle for some small unamed rougue state backed by one of the also unamed big boys. The actual mission is, if course, ridiculously precise in what it requires but provides the perfect conditions for dramatic tension.Cheesy but plenty of fun, Maverick is better than it has any right to be.",

Sequels often go wrong in three areas which I think Top Gun Maverick got right1. Nostalgia- Right from the very first scene, you are transported back to 1986 when the first movie came out..and it's done so well!!.. not the cheesy flashbacks or remixed soundtracks..but instead, elements of the first movie brought in at the right time and place ..nothing too over the top. If there was anything that was a tad pretentious, it's probably the scene with Val Kilmer.. but then again Top Gun wouldn't be Top Gun if there was no Val Kilmer right?2. The Premise- In the first movie, aside from the adrenaline boost, when it came to storytelling, it felt a little flat in my opinion...But not 'Maverick'.. in addition to thrilling Adrenaline pumping sequences, the storytelling kept me engaged throughout with some timeless dialogues and funny scenes3. The ending- So how did they end it? Did Maverick die? Well, I won't spoil it but suffice to say, it was a satisfying end and to be honest a bit unexpected. This is where the movie shines for me and really went supersonic over the first one (excuse the pun)\nAll in all, Top Gun Maverick immersed me into a time when watching movies on the big screen was for that special experience while at the same time not diverging from story of this amazing character- Maverick.",

Coz Top Gun Is a Cult and Maverick was made only because Top Gun was one of the Best movie that was ever made and it still rules our Hearts.Also Maverick is the Best Homage ever given to a Director. Yes, Sir Tony Scott U truly deserve this for the Masterpiece U've created almost 4 decades back.Maverick was Good, but No one can match Sir, Tony Scott's Stylized Direction... His Films were in fact are, Truly Stylish and Engaging... watch any of his Films and U'll second me on this. The opening Sequence in Top Gun'86, where planes are landing and Danger zone is played in the backdrop, is one of the Best and the most stylish opening sequences ever shot... Ohhh the Silhouette shots were out of the world. And one secret I just wanna share, It's one of the many reasons I became a Filmmaker. This is what true Inspiration is !!! Thank U Sir Tony Scott, fr being a teacher to Me. (That's why I call him My 'Sir')And to Sum up, 'This is How Cinema should be made... Just Pure Cinema !!! Where U cry, Laugh, Whistle, where Ur Heart keeps pounding on every Action Scene'. And the Best and the Last one, I still Envy Tom Cruise, coz His Smile Still can Kill Many Ladies. But Guy's I can Live with it ;)I had almost forgotten the feel to Experience Cinema in Real !!! So Thank U Team Maverick for making Us Experience and Emotionally Feel a Movie after So many Years !!!I Salute, Director Joseph Kosinski, for making a MindBlowing Sequel, by keeping the Soul & Nostalgia of the Original TopGun'86 intact.Also I would like to Thank... the one & Only Jerry Bruckheimer, for entertaining Us & Producing some of the Best Movies ever made, over the years.TopGun Maverick is Truly a Cinematic Experience !!!",

The new pilots played by new such as actors Lewis Pullman, Monica Barbaro, Glenn Powell, Miles Teller and Jay Ellis, were very interesting and rich characters. The most interesting among was Bradley \"Rooster\" Brashaw who is the son of Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw and there is even a flashback in the film where Maverick remembers what happens when \"Goose\" dies in his arms.\"Rooster\" considered \"Maverick\" as responsible of the death of his father but at the end in the last fighting scene \"Maverick\" saves him and then \"Rooster\" saves \"Mavrick\" when Mav's plane is downed before his is downed. Both will fly back and return to their aircraft carreer on a old F14A Tomcat which brings more magic to the film, since during most of the film and since 2006 the Navy flies exclusively on EF/18A Super Hornet andwhen the the first Top Gun was filmed back in 1986 , the Navy was flying the Tomcat and \"Goose\" was \"Maverick\" 's RIO. The flight and combat scenes were truely outstanding, intense and realistic. At the beginning of the film, Maverick also flies a prototype which is the sucessor of the lockeed SR71, the SR72 at mach10.2 but then ejects because the plane is uncontrollable. Tom Cruise brings an incredible performance as an actor and a director. He really outdid himself in this movie. Specially mention to Jennifer Conelly who plays Penny who is not missing to evoke or making us remember the original character played by Kelly Mc Gillis back then. Finally, a special mention to Jon Hamm which I loved as Don Draper in Madmen, but who here plays a very jealous and envious admiral of Maverick's unbelievable and top level know how. I highly recommend this movie.",

The supporting actors were borderline B grade as they had to fulfill the 80s vibe interactions of fighter pilots in line with the 1st movie, but they did get corrected/refine as the show progressed.Would had hope there was a more prominent dedication to Tony Scott just at the start of the ending credits, but I heard there was one in the credits later.",

            "content": "I genuinely cannot enough good things about this film. It had everything that anyone could've asked for in a sequel. I actually watched the 1986 Top Gun the morning that I went and saw the sequel. I had no idea WHAT to expect after the original.I watched the original with absolutely zero knowledge of the film or even Tom Cruise. Somehow, I had never seen a film where Tom Cruise was the main protagonist. I had also never heard of Anthony Edwards before in my life. I had probably heard Maverick & Goose at some point before I watched the film, but I didn't really do anything with that. I kind of thought the original was going to be bored when it started, but it hooked me within minutes and of course the tragic dogfight scene and everything after had me sobbing on my couch for a good 45 minutes.I had a few hours in between finishing the og version and going to see the sequel. I genuinely did not know how they would top (lol no pun intended) the original, but they did. They absolutely blew it out of the water. Every time there was a Goose callback in the film, I couldn't help but tear up. I absolutely lost it when Rooster made his entrance. Miles Teller has always been a star, and I'm glad people are appreciating him for the great actor that he has always been! The dynamic between Mav & Rooster took my heart on a two hour rollercoaster, but I would genuinely do anything to get more screen time with those two. Every interaction they had made me have an emotional reaction (sometimes heart-wrenching, other times heartwarming). Tom and Miles have such an incredible dynamic on screen, and I NEED another film with their characters. Miles did such an incredible job carrying on Goose's legacy and I swore that in the scenes after Rooster came back to save Mav after he had just saved him and they were in the F-14... that was Goose in the back. Like, it looked just like him. I am just so blown away by their performances. Then when they hugged at the end? \"Thank you for saving my life.\" \"It's what my dad would've done.\" I was in tears. I couldn't do it. Then right before Lady Gaga's masterpiece of a closing track \"Hold My Hand\" showed us the credits and Rooster hit the picture of Goose??? No. I could not see anything but tears after that. I have to have more!Digressing from the main characters, I think what makes a film good is when you can follow the main protagonists and navigate their stories/conflicts and then be satisfied at the end with the conclusion of said stories/conflicts. What makes a film GREAT is when the supporting characters carry just as much weight as the main characters. This supporting cast was nothing but captivating. I loved every second that every one of the supporting characters were on screen. Phoenix/Bob were such a great duo, and I knew they would become two of my favorites right from the get go. Payback/Fanboy were also two very great characters! I enjoyed their interactions with each other but also with the rest of the characters! And then of course... Hangman. I had never seen Glen Powell before and I've watched most of the things he has acted in, but I knew he would have some kind of redemption arc the second he showed up on screen and spoke. I loved the Mav/Ice & Rooster/Hangman parallel. Then when he pulled that little hat trick out near the end? My heart genuinely was about to stop. I could sit here and ramble on for paragraphs about each character, but I'll stop here.This film was nothing short of a masterpiece. I didn't have to wait 36 years for it, but the 7 hours between me finishing the original and then me seeing the sequel seemed like an eternity. It is hands down my favorite film I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly. It had me on the edge of my seat with my heart racing pretty much the entire time. If I wasn't in painful anticipation of what was happening next, I was moved to tears. All around, this film has everything that a summer blockbuster should. I'm sure everyone has probably seen a video of THE beach scene by now. The soundtrack was also absolutely amazing, so after you watch the film... go pay the soundtrack a few listens. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go see it once... and then twice... and then maybe even 10.3 more times.",

You cannot have a quality movie without a true villain, or at least an evil force of some-kind.The movie is about evolution of the good guys to some ecstatic point and then...nothing.You remain with your mouth open and wide eyes and you then say: you mean that's it??The villain in this movie is, lets call it STUPID, or let's name it for what it really is: A HOLE IN THE GROUND. In a nameless country...\nC'mooon people, IN THESE HARD TIMES IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH!The movie make cannot be politically correct, impartial and memorable , all in the same time.It is about taking sides, about choosing, and about assuming a clear position.Let me give a few examples:\n\"First blood\" - the villain was a fat redneck sheriff in \"Jerkwater USA\";\n\"First blood part two\"- the Russian bastards (He's dead now!!)\n\"Star wars\" - Darth Vader.... The Emperor...The Empire...The Dark side...Catching my drift here? Good.At least name the country for God sakes, there are plenty of declared enemies to the free World?! (Syria, Iran, North Korea, Russia, etc...).OK, if you do not want to upset the people there at least create ONE bad guy, and since this is a movie about aviation maybe they could create an enemy Ace with multiple air-kills , hated by everybody (and their families?). There!That is one aspect.The other aspect: the movie maker insisted on the VISUAL too much.The tech aspects that for the average viewers don't make sense (how many of the spectators really know what 1G is??) are described in detail. O this is not a movie for the naval aviators, is it not? Those guys are spending time in the gym, or learning procedures, or watching tactical videos, or FLYING MISSIONS.The cinematography looks good, maybe too good, but there is no real story behind it. Everything looks like a very well made computer game, with the difference that they are using real jets.Talking about jets: The movie begins with the biggest whopper in cinema history yet: you CANNOT trash a multi-billion $ hyper-sonic jet and make a career move after that, ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET, Maverick or not, Tom Cruise or not (maybe that is the reason the Navy didn't cleared Cruise on flying solo). The only way you will go is towards a penitentiary...after a gigantic Court Martial or a live TV law-suit.Anyways...\nWhat I am trying to say is: you do not need that much VISUAL to tell a memorable story. You only need a strong subject. And NO, enriching Uranium is not a good story, even the poorest countries in the world are doing it (Pakistan, India?). This subject is so OLD, literally.Nobody uses Uranium-based nukes since the 50's. Thermonuclear weapons were invented ? Helloooo?!?!You can achieve a monumental effect with so much less than IMAX cameras inside real life jets.By example: think of \"Dogville\". Totally unfair, not an action movie, so what? That is ART people, everything goes, and also \"no points for second place\"...\nA very strong cast, and a FEW LINES painted on the ground, a very strong story, developed scene by scene and you have your masterpiece right there.From a military point of view the movie is a joke, never in 1000 years will The Navy risk the lives of the best of the best to hit a hole in the ground, people crammed in 30+ yo jets. NEVER.The cruise missile (interesting choice of words, ha-ha) was invented, or a tactical nuke launch from far away, or a submarine parked right into your backside. Or a team of SEALS deployed on site. Or just pay the local government for a revolution, (lately)...\nDo not get me wrong, I am a fan of the original movie, I know it line by line, seen it dozens of times...but.... Maybe the cast was better in first part? Maybe the enemy jets had a red star painted on the tail (just about enough).Maybe the actors were stronger (James Tolkan, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside, even Meg Ryan, etc)..Maybe the script contained better lines for the actors, nothing from the first part can be found in the second part...\nOne exception: Ed Harris, which had an extremely short appearance, misused resources if you ask me.Sorry, besides the deformed faces and the pilot going sideways as an effect of G-forces , got nothing left to take home with me. Oh yeah, and maybe some push-ups :))And those images are not NEW to me, watched it already on the Discovery channel :)",

            "content": "I remember watching the first Top Gun as a kid, and I did not enjoy it that much. But the scenes that stood out was Tom Cruise smiling on his motorbike, and the beach volleyball scene. In this sequel, we have Tom grinning a lot on his motorcycle, and a beach volleyball scene. There are nods to the past movie, and somehow Cruise seems so different from all his other characters. It seems that Cruise is aware that he is getting old, and that message seems to be be clear in the movie. Though he is a top pilot, he is clumsy and does not fall in a heroic pose like a superhero. He sits back to watch younger people play. He even seems vulnerable. Here we do not see a self confident Tom Cruise like in the Mission Impossible franchise, or any Tom Cruise playing action hero. We see an aging fighter who is aware of his age and unable to let go. Cruise's character has to train a group of top pilots for a mission, but his past haunts him when one of the recruits is the son of his former team. This drama drives the plot of the movie and works well for Cruise. Both Cruise's internal conflict, and his conflict with the recruit makes the movie enjoyable, as you care for the characters. The action scene, and flying scenes were exhilarating. It is filmed like you are there flying, but without getting nauseous. This shows how well the flying scenes were well filmed. The mission almost feels like the Rebels planning to destroy the Death Star, only here, we see clearly how dangerous it is through the training, and when the mission starts, we actually fear for everyone. I honestly think this is the best Tom Cruise movie I have ever seen because we get to see Cruise showcase his acting skills more. Besides that, Val Kilmer's appearance was great, and Cruises chemistry with the supporting casts makes you believe they have actually gone through a lot together. John Hamm was ok, since he was not given much to do. I wish they had more Ed Harris. Oh, I forgot they do have Tom Cruise running, because that is what he always does in action movies. So go ahead and enjoy. Definitely recommend it.",

But then he lives, and he stole an F-14 taking off from a 50m runway, only to fight fighter jets 30 years more advanced than his. Anyway I don't mind the extravaganza, in the end that's what the character is all about, but it really felt like the movie was about to finish and some executive just ordered another 20 minutes because of the potential for more sequels.

But this film is better than the original in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The positivesThe story is simple but the characters are well written. \"Pete\" has a great arc about leadership and it also helps that \"Tom Cruise\" is doing a fantastic job. His characters likeable and \"Cruise\" has plenty of chemistry with the other actors. The romance with the character of \"Penny\" is believable and you want the two characters to get together. The graduates have their own distinct personalities and are all played by fantastic actors. The standout was \"Miles Teller\" as \"Bradley\" who is a very conflicted character but is arc is satisfying even if the ending is my biggest flaw. The action is thrilling. It feels real and that's all thanks to the stunts in this film. The cinematography is great but does slightly dull down when the movie gets going. The humour lands very well most of the time and the scene with \"Val Kilmer's\" \"Iceman\" was one of the best scenes in the film.The negativesThe only big problem is the ending. I did have a feeling halfway through if what could happen and the way the movie was going I was bracing myself for it. It didn't happen but I think the film would've been better if a more tragic but emotionally satisfying ending would've happened. Finally, while it is great that \"Val Kilmer\" is in the film and they used \"AI\" to let him speak was brilliant. It is really noticeable that \"Val\" isn't talking. It got kind of distracting when it happened but it still didn't take any emotional weight out of that scene.Conclusion\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a straight forward story that emotionally hits you. It's well written characters, Believable romance, amazing stunt work and action, brilliant cinematography, excellent acting and Funny moments make the sequel better than the original. Just a conflicting with the ending and some noticeable \"AI\" are the only flaws for me.I'm going to give \"Top Gun: Maverick\" a:8/10.",

The acting of the major characters befit appreciation. The stunt choreography is as good as the first part. In short, the movie lived up to the hope provided by the trailers released at least a year back.End note: - The movie was made to show the necessity of using fighter aircraft in modern day warfare. However, the mission undertaken by the hero and his team, can only be best executed by weaponised drones. That will be the greatest irony and a question that will haunt every military aviation expert long after watching the movie.",

            "content": "WOW! Just WOW! You have to watch this film in a theater before it leaves; this film is so worth watching and worth your time! And definitely on the big screen experience with big speakers!In a world that is fatigued with Marvel superheroes and funny (most times unfunny) and unoriginal content, Top Gun comes to bring a breath of fresh air with a new, compelling and realistic story that has nothing to do with superheroes or a franchise*, and still packs the action and high stakes of a Hollywood Blockbuster thriller! It is so refreshing, there's no man-to-man combat or hand guns, just the jet's missiles and bullets, but it's not an uncomfortable \"army\" film. This is a film of heart more than army. The army is but a small part, and the only thing you get to see are the jets and battleships, making this film focused solely on the characters, and the mission and training with the jet planes. The story is so simple and straightforward, but at the same time brings unexpected twists, and the stakes get higher as you move along. There is real peril, and it is very realistic, and yet, it takes you out of the boringness of the daily life and takes you on an epic mission and flight. Plus, you don't need to do any research; the film explains itself. No need to watch previous films, or need to know about the army, or jets; everything is explained in the film so you can enjoy it to the fullest. A wonderful experience.The characters are not empty slates, they are compelling, with their own realistic backgrounds and growth throughout the film, which makes you care and connect with the characters. Real relationships, real connection, and real growth. Straightforward goals, but incredibly difficult to achieve, which makes you journey through the story along with each of the characters, especially the protagonist Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. There are romantic moments, but not uncomfortable or cringy, they seem really good for the film, and the broken friendships from the beginning come to a satisfying conclusion. The connections between the characters make the stakes for the mission higher than ever and you actually fear that any of the characters will die.This film has one of the most impressive plots and action sequences I have ever seen! The mystery and difficulty of the mission is impressive as we travel with the trainees to master their given mission which is attempted in the climax. The training sequence was fun, fulfilling, with a few laughs along the way, along with scares and sequences that will get your heart pumping faster than ever and keep you at the edge of your seat as accidents happen. You truly feel the stakes and the pressure of the mission as the pilots leave for their mission, and attempt the mission. And oh my gosh!The jet scenes. JUST THE JET PLANE SCENES are a wonder to watch! You truly feel like you are in a jet plane taking on the G forces, and attempting crazy maneuvers. But the sequences are so well shot and cinematographically made, it is so enjoyable and fulfilling to watch. Many unexpected twists and challenges with the jet planes, but it is an absolute JOY to watch. The stunts that were pulled with the jets is something like I've never seen before.The heart of the film is something absolutely gorgeous. There's a backstory and a wrong that needs to be undone to restore the relationship in the film, and it comes to a beautiful conclusion at the end of the film. And the way teachers and students, fathers and sons dare to give their lives to save the other is something truly astounding. Something so beautiful AND satisfying to watch.And the musical score, was FANTASTIC! It elevated the emotion and epic-ness of the film! The cinematography was gorgeous across the entire film. You really feel people poured their hearts and work into this film. This film tried, and it did it.This film gets a 10 out of 10 from me. It is an absolute MASTERPIECE in a time where masterpieces are so rare in the cinema world. This is an amazing story and spectacle you have to watch, if possible on a big screen with good speakers. This film did not disappoint, it met with the expectations left with the trailer, and what you expect of a good film. Seriously, Jurassic World: Dominion is going to be around for some time, watch this film before it leaves the theater forever! Big screens is where you can truly experience the spectacle of the jet sequences and the mission and battle at the end to the fullest.Seriously, you don't have to be a jet fan, or army fan, or fan of anything to enjoy this film. You will love it!*(I'm aware of the 1986 release of Top Gun, but I'm not counting it as a franchise as it was ONE film of over 30 years ago.)",

            "content": "Watched this one right on the heels of watching its prequel for the first time in a while. It does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. Maverick tried teaching at the Top Gun school like he said he would in the original, but it didn't work out. In the meantime, Maverick has been doing what he does best (flying and satisfying his need for speed) yet only advancing from Lieutenant in the last movie to Captain in this movie, despite distinctions and accolades. The love interest \"Charlie\" changes to Penny, daughter of an admiral and former flame mentioned in the first movie, the victim of one (or more?) of Maverick's youthful escapades. Maverick is called back to teach at the Top Gun school, but past aches resurface when Maverick realizes that one of his students is Rooster, son of Maverick's former right-hand man Goose, who died when one of Maverick's risky maneuvers went wrong in the first movie. If you enjoyed the first movie, chances are good you'll like this one as well. (Then again, if you enjoyed the first movie, you've probably already seen this one. I'm a little late to the party again.)Tempted to give this one 10 stars. I might later. For now, the final star could be said to be missing because of the film being \"too good,\" I guess. Dialog is crisper, snappier, and more Bottom Line Up Front in this one. With Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Jennifer Connolly, John Hamm, Ed Harris and more, this one packs lots of star power. Flight sequences are so panoramic and absorbing that I wish I'd caught this one in an IMAX. All this, though, meant that the whole time I kept reminding myself involuntarily that I was watching a movie. A very good movie, though.I felt a little more \"lost in the weeds\" in this one than the other. Think that's because I was a little tired when I watched. That lostness was just over details; the overall story is presented very well. Maverick is called back to teach at a top flight school. Maverick must whittle down a group of a dozen or so top students by about half to fly a dangerous mission. This worst-case scenario involves a tiny target in a remote, inaccessible and tightly defended area, which means fast and dangerous maneuvers in and out. Maverick culls the squadron down to the \"cream of the crop\" by pushing all his students past their boundaries, training hard to guarantee success on mission execution. (Training and execution are both very exciting to watch!) But Maverick must balance rigor with caution, especially since Rooster is still coming to terms with Maverick's role in his father's premature demise, which also weighs heavily on Maverick.This conflict (and others, as in the last film) between Rooster and Maverick resolves very nicely. The worst-case scenario's terrain robs the group of the advantages of modern technologies like GPS, so they're flying in planes not unlike what Maverick flew with Goose. Rooster learns the difficulty of \"grace under fire\" while making split-second decisions. I think they call the training in here Live simulation, since they're in effectively a dress rehearsal, using actual planes; think I would have like to have seen more Virtual (e.g. Computer-based) simulation, which may have helped accentuate the difference between planned and real-life missions.I don't know if more Virtual would have detracted at all from the realism, though. A lot of this movie seemed \"truer to source\" than the first, although there are still cinematic flourishes like the trademark flying upside-down over an opponent's plane. For example, I didn't notice until reading through the Goofs of the first movie that they were using \"bogie\" instead of \"bandit\"; I did notice they were using \"bandit\" more in this movie. These are the sort of \"in the weeds\" technical details I felt a little lost in. Was trying to see if I could spot Goofs of my own, but I'm still learning about the field.It's a great movie with a well-written story and stunning visuals! Good for piquing interest to learn more.",

At this point it makes you wonder, how something like this was accepted with such budget?!When Ed Harris arrives we get ET vibes of \"military = bad\", \"adults = bad\" \"old adults = the worst\", \"old military members = evil!\"\nThe scene when Tom passes \"mach 10\" and this nerd jumps up to give it to Ed with his silly Pentagon comment, was just pathetic. It must have been written for children.Then even stranger things happen. Tom the rebel \"steals\" the expensive plane, crashes it but instead of going straight to military court, he becomes instructor. At this point it's clear, this movie is pure fantasy.The bar scene makes no sense either. They act as if Tom's flying buddy was killed due to his incompetence, not 39 (?) years ago, but yesterday. The son looking like him, playing the same song was just embarrassing to watch.The mission itself was like a video game (although games are probably more realistic). The fact that Tom was brought there as the messiah with the only solution makes you wonder. I'm no military expert, but wouldn't it be better to send all the tomahawks straight into this \"volcano\", instead to the runway?If Tom was the only one who could barely simulate a successful outcome of this \"mission\" (with one second of time left), are we really supposed to believe that the other \"elite\" pilots (Tom smocked with ease one by one) are able to pull it off (under deadly pressure)? They must have honed their skills by doing pushups and playing beach volley.Speaking of the other pilots... They all appeared like cartboards with zero character depth! Why was Ice Ice? Because in the 80's movie he was portrayed with character.Let's talk about the scene where Tom and the copy of his buddy were shot down. What is the best thing to do for a pilot in this situation? Don't escape into the surrounding woods, because that would be boring. Run straight into the enemy base instead and capture one of their planes on a destroyed runway! You don't know if it's working, or if it's fueled, but that's OK.

Only this time it's F-18 Hornets but the effect is still the same.What follows is 2 hrs 11 mins of pure unadulterated joy and flying by the seat of your pants. The third act of the film is by far the best part of the film and is a real adrenaline rush. The flying sequences are the best I've seen in a film and as we know the actors were actually taken up in F-18s to film these sequences and that's what makes this film so ruddy good.The only thing that made me go really? Was a part involving an F-14 Tomcat near the end. But, I guess they had to shoehorn one in at some point within the film. Other than that I'm ready to see the film again and most likely will.

Yes it was an enjoyable watch but I scratch my head a few times as I just don't know if there should have been a sequel.Lots of cliches like being saved at the very last minute etc. Also, flying low between a valley to drop bombs down a hole reminded me of the Death Star scene in Star Wars, even the words \"Stay on target\" were used LOLFor me the character of Jennifer Connelly didn't really have much meaning and I felt the character was just thrown in as a filler.I will just say it's a good movie with action and the new generation will like it. Definitely a fine moment for Mr Cruise.",

They tried to reuse settings, styles and events. Gen Xers who watched Top Gun in their youth will have a 80ties flashback.* No named enemy. It is clear that they fight someone, but this enemy is very unspecific. That way, you are inclusive.* Diversity. We have a female pilot and every skin color is present (we might argue that we are missing a bit Asian American presence, but this is common in all modern movies, focus seems to be to include African Americans). The only thing missing was a gay person, but sexuality was not a topic in this movie (besides the one of Maverick)\n* Maverick, the one and only, he is the hero. He and just he. It is difficult to write about it without spoiling something, but sometimes it feels it has been written also for Tom Cruise.* Still, the movie provides what every one wants. Suspense, emotions, conflicts to be resolved, friendship, sexual attraction, sentimentality.All in all, I see Top Gun: Maverick as a very good movie, just I do not see it as an elite movie. I assume this high rating is there because they do not piss off any group.",

The conflict between Maverick and Bradley Bradshaw is a really strong chemistry . A lot of tense , fun scenes , especially if you enjoy the 4DX version , the fighter jet scene will certainly become more tense and exciting at the same time.

I was so thrilled to get some history from Penny Benjamin. People complain that \"Charlie\" was not brought back because of her age, but she was mature in the first film and her character should have moved on from the troublesome Maverick.

            "content": "What's not to love about the original Top Gun? The homoerotic overtures, the age-old trope of Americans as mighty warriors for justice facing a malicious, peer foe flying nonexistent aircraft, plenty of military porn, cheesy dialogue and great music, and a rebellious yet capable and lovable hero. Oh and did I mention awesome photography of military tech?Top Gun: Maverick tries to stick to the same formula and largely succeeds in it. The good things I'll list here because unfortunately they are few. Great photography...and that's about it. To be fair, the references to Goose are more or less successfully and tastefully done, the supporting cast of Cyclone, Warlock and Hondo are good, and it was heartwarming to see Val Kilmer reprise his role with dignity, especially with the way his own health issues were integrated into the filmOther than that, the movie is not really good. The plot is a rehash of a Cold War mission that makes no sense today, the dialogue is bad to atrocious for the most part, Jennifer Connelly is wasted on her role and her lines, and the young pilots team is cartoonishly cocky and insufferable.My biggest gripes are doctrine and technology related. The Mach 10 aircraft may well be in development, but merely as a test bed, and definitely not something that would be pulled in favor of more drones (that still require pilots, whatever admiral Ed Harris may think), and would not require such a dramatic scene.The mission itself makes no sense since there is no mission an F/A-18 could do better than an F-35, except maybe dogfight (oooh now I get it!). Send in 5th gen aircraft to avoid all those SAMs and enemy 5th gen aircraft, not get detected, perform SEAD/DEAD (suppression/destruction of enemy air defense) like it is meant to, and perform the same laser guided bomb drop from a more secure position. Also, I'm not the first to mention that the mission is suspiciously similar to the Star Wars trench run, but hey, it makes for great flying shots.The mission itself also additionally makes no sense with what we know about peer state 5th gen aircraft (i.e., Su-57, NATO code name Felon) and the state of their military after the Ukraine invasion. But this is an old movie, really.Finally, the hero. US military has an up or out approach to personnel, meaning if you don't get promoted sufficiently quickly, you'll be essentially fired. That also means that Maverick would have been out by the time of the Obama administration and given his record, he may not even have reached captain rank, but he's such a lovable rapscallion and has the back of his more career-minded friend, 4-star admiral Ice.Tom Cruise's performance is just him being Tom Cruise. To the reviews saying he gets too much screen time - the title of the movie has his character's name in it. Whaddya expect? That said, he was fine, like he is intensely convincing and charming in his every role, as intense and borderline creepy as he is in his life off-screen.I did enjoy the movie. The flight scenes are the best part, and really are nailbiters. Plus, the nostalgia factor, heavily stressed on purpose, does its thing for all of us who grew up on its predecessor. But, this one will not attain the cult status of the original, nor will it provide excellent opportunities to mock and parody it. A great summer blockbuster it is, a 10/10 masterpiece epic like many reviewers here say, it ain't.",

If you never saw Top Gun, strap yourself in for one hell of a ride!There are many types of sequels - this is one of those \"make it again but better\" types. The plot will feel very very familiar to anyone who's seen Top Gun. There's more and even better action scenes - the last 40 minutes are quite incredible - like Star Wars battle scenes but without most of the special effects.Aside from the action scenes there's some good acting, just enough humour without going too far with it and a touching cameo from Val Kilmer.What I didn't like was the slightly absurd plot you could fly a plane through, the wooden rivalry between the young pilots (which had none of the bite or credibility of the Maverick vs Ice Man rivalry in Top Gun) and the lack of the many killer lines from Top Gun that have since entered Cinematic Folklore.Overall it's a very entertaining watch for anyone who enjoys action films. It has loads of references to and much of the original cast from Top Gun to keep the \"original\" fans happy.

All cringe.In my opinion, boomers needed something from their past so desperately, that they held on to this and must have focused on only the great cameo by Val Kilmer, and wiped all the bad about this film from their minds.3/10 at most.Never mind. Now I see why it is rated so highly. The comments about being non-woke speak loud. It isn't that this is a good movie, because it really isn't. It's because the group that fills other pages with complaints about wokeness finally found a film they can use as a springboard for their message.

The actors feel the G forces for real and it shows (so to anyone who says they are \"aviation experts\" and s**t on this film then they are clearly missing the point). It pays homage to the original with a goosebump inducing opening sequence. The acting is phenomenal by absolutely everyone in the film. The flight sequences are draw dropping. The cinematography is mesmerising. The plot, whilst yes may be predictable and \"inspired\" by a popular trench run still really hits home as a breath of fresh air amidst the drivel that is churned out by Hollywood these days. It got me excited, it made my draw drop at the aviation, and it made me cry.Yes - Mav wouldn't have survived a Mach 10 ejection. Yes he would have been fired from the navy for insubordination years ago, but this is a fictional film, not a documentary on the US navy.

It really does deserve the hype.Think what you will of Tom Cruise but the man clearly works his ass off and it really shows in this film. He has my respect.

            "content": "You'd have to be a pretty lax romantic to prefer Top Gun 2 over Tony Scott's original. The imitations of it, as early as the opening credits, are not pale - but just imitations nonetheless. The action is sensational, of course, and the practicality of the actors actually manning the jet fighters should be commended. But the story isn't anything too impressive, despite it universally being lauded as such by critics and fans. Pete Mitchell reminisces, there's a personal feud between him and his best friend's son, Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller) and the passing on of skill and wisdom to a new generation... These are fairly basic plot elements, especially for a legacy sequel. Should it aspire to more? No. In fact, I don't think you could've gone any other route with it.Bradley still harbouring resentment towards Maverick for his father's death is stupid. There's no way around it. Logically, the blame shouldn't fall on Maverick, which is thoroughly examined and concluded in the first story. Maverick throws Goose's dog tags out to sea, and thusly moves on with the solace of truth. Why he's still holding on to guilt, nearly four decades later is unrealistic, narratively. I liked the nostalgic detail of Bradley playing the piano though, as his father Goose did in the first movie.Jon Hamm and Ed Harris go wasted as the Chief Admirals, offering little to the movie despite being excellent actors. Jennifer Connolly, a wonderful actress, turns out to be somewhat annoying as Penny Benjamin, simply because her character is presented as significant to Maverick. All she does is smile at him and recall off-screen memories which have no impact on us. Kelly McGillis's Charlie of the original goes completely unmentioned; a cardinal error on behalf of the screenwriters. She was the love of Maverick's life, and that's pretty clear by the awesome romance in the original. But no, forget all about her - now she's replaced. Try as it might, TOP GUN: MAVERICK cannot hope to tap into the same level of heart and atmosphere which made the original beloved. The soundtrack, too, which incorporates the talents of Harold Faltermeyer and Hans Zimmer, oddly doesn't thunder in as often as it should. It felt like it was in every scene of the original, and really elevated the overall iconography. The final action scene in the mountains is epic, and it's great to feel your seat rumbling with power of the jets. It's effective in making you fear for Maverick's life, or worse, a repeat of history with Goose's death. There's a short little set-piece which feels more something out of Mission Impossible, where an attack chopper chases Maverick on-foot. It's so over-the-top, and I love it. It's the only time where the movie embraces itself as a pure sequel and shows us something brand new. It's vintage action, and probably appeared in a draft for Top Gun 2 back in the early 90's. Side-note: it would've been beyond incredible to see Val Kilmer's \"Iceman\" swoop in to save Maverick and Rooster at the final second, instead of his rebooted counterpart \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell). Ridiculous, but incredible. Val's the best.In the end, though, I don't think there's any point in criticising TOP GUN: MAVERICK. It's like, why would you? It's better than 90% of the mainstream schlock Hollywood pumps out these days, and is, clinically, a good movie. Well produced, well acted and with some amazing aerial action to boot. It doesn't hold a candle to the first, but I guess people have \"lost that lovin' feelin'\"...",

Like the rest of you, I've been hearing about Top Gun 2 & had been looking forward to it for ages, and finally, it's here. I didn't care to watch any of the trailers, since watching trailers these days is equivalent to watching the entire movie. So, I was going to the cinema with no expectations whatsoever.It's superb really. The intro pays homage to the 80s Top Gun. I had always wished I'd been around when the first movie was released so I'd watch it on the big screen. The intro was so like the original movie that it felt like I'd time-travelled to the 80s and was watching the original movie on the big screen on release day. Goosebumps really! Like the original film, the story is not that complicated or filled with plot twists, and it doesn't spend a lot of time with throwbacks - I'm looking at you Wachowski - to the original, instead, it gets cracking and gets the job done.I had a couple of drinks before goin in, to offset the woke BS that's now part of basically every reboot or sequel. There's none of that in here, & nothing like 'The Message' being shoved down the viewer's throat in this. Do yourself a favour and go buy a ticket and a bag of popcorn and watch the movie. What that's going to get you is, compressed air mixed with jet fuel being lit, and then dumping even more fuel in for good measure. What I love about movies like this, is simplicity, executed with great attention to detail & practical effects. None of that superhero stuff peppered with endless green screen fakery.Watching movies like The Northman & Top Gun Maverick kinda gives me hope for the future of cinema. Or maybe, it's the last of a dying breed of films. But like Maverick says, \"..maybe.. but not today\".",

But I was very disappointed when I realized it was done in the most cringe worthy way possible. All the smirks that were trying to be flirty were so forced. They were also just spoonfeeding us flashbacks to make sure we remembered which scenes they were reenacting.It basically felt like a pet project of Tom Cruise's ego that wanted to show the world that he's still \"got it\" or something.

For realskies.The plot is clear, straightforward, and engaging. Unlike so many other movies where the storyline is confused and/or muddled by subplots and twists and turns, Top Gun 2 keeps it simple, in the best possible way.The cast is great. Whether it's someone like Glen Powell (Call Sign: Hangman) who portrays the \"smug\" fighter pilot who knows they're the best of the best, Bob (Call Sign: Bob), whose \"boringness\" brings a healthy dose of comic relief, Miles Teller (Call Sign: Rooster), who plays the role with much heart, or even Jon Hamm (Call Sign: Cyclone), who sells the \"prick\" of an officer who can't stand Tom Cruise's face.The scenes taking place on the ground as opposed to in the air are a bit of a hit-and-miss.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is one of the greatest love stories ever and perhaps the greatest sequel ever made (other than The Terminator 2). I haven't had such positively strong feelings about a movie in a long, long time. In my opinion, it is easily the movie of 2022. Perfect blend of classic and modern.Top Gun: Maverick is a love story about Pete Mitchell, call sign ''Maverick'' (Tom Cruise), a distinguished pilot/naval aviator who uses his tough life situation to his advantage in order to re-ignite the past love with a stunning owner/bartender of a local military personnel favored bar Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). Penny Benjamin was only referenced as a character in the original Top Gun, so bringing her on the big screen in the sequel was a great decision as is shown in the movie how much potential her character had.Due to the facts that Maverick and Penny have a shaky history and that Penny is now a single mom, meaning her priorities have greatly changed, Maverick realizes right away that he's going to have to really dig deep in order to achieve his goal, which is of course, to win Penny's heart again, this time once and for all. Thus he puts an epic, extatic and romantic plan in motion in order to achieve his goal.With the help of his old friend/wingman Tom Kazansky, call sign ''Iceman'' (Val Kilmer), Maverick gets reinstated back as the instructor in the famous Top Gun school in order to be close to Penny's bar and therefore close to Penny. He cleverly drops by to her bar and acts like he didn't know she owned it in order to keep things casual which doesn't go perfectly. Penny forces Maverick's hand with the bar rules and puts Maverick in a situation where he's forced to pay for everyone's drinks at the bar. Unfortunately for Maverick, his card gets declined which reveals to Penny that he doesn't really offer the financial security she, as a hard working single mom, deserves. However, Penny immediately shows why she got a hold of Maverick's heart by showing she doesn't mind and thus reveals, although very subtly, that Maverick still managed to lay a very much needed foundation for the achievement of his ultimate goal.Upon arriving at Top Gun school, Maverick enters the second stage of his plan. He uses Bradley Bradshaw, call sign Rooster (Miles Teller) - his former deceased wingman's son (who is also one of the top graduates at Top Gun school), to practice being a father figure and with it convince Penny that he's fit and able to be a good father figure, which is crucial as Penny has a daughter. Throughout the movie, Maverick goes all out and over the top to achieve this crucial part of the plan - he gets really into it to the point where he even saves Rooster's life at the end of the movie even though he didn't have to since Penny was not there to see it. By the end of the movie, Maverick and Rooster bond like father and son, thus showing Maverick's second stage of his plan is complete.And while completing the second stage of his plan, he also completes the third and final stage of his plan - the mission he was sent to do for the Navy which he manages to do in a spectacular fashion, therefore solidifying himself as the man Penny has been waiting for.The message of the movie is beautiful and clear cut - it's never too late for love or, if you want, all you need is love.

Let's remove the rose tinted spectacles for a moment and be truthful here; this film is terrible in so many ways, but the fact remains that it's really good at the same time. The plot is weak, the dialogue is really cheesy, and most of the acting is very average at best. What makes it great is the way it has brought in the nostalgia from the original, and thrown it together with some amazing visuals and a soundtrack that just has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. Right from the moment the lights go down, and then you hear the sound of those tubular bells ring out for the anthem during the opening credits, you're immediately transported back to 1986, and all those feelings come flooding back. There's lots of scenes that are basically a reboot of the original, and obviously lots of elements that try to continue the original story but the mix is well balanced. As long as you don't overanalyse it, because some of the decisions and basic physics don't make sense, and can get past the cheesiness of the whole thing, and don't get too bothered by the old 'USA saving the world from the (unnamed communist) bad guys' narrative then it's a thoroughly enjoyable film.",

From the opening clip with Tom vouching for what you are about to see was not CGI, I got a bad feeling how it was a shot and who wad in it was more important than a story. Borrowing directly from Star Wars IV, Dambusters, etc we get a lame plot of gee can we hit a difficult target that's well defended. And after we're done shooting the hole we'll have aerial combat. The scenes of Tom bouncing first left and then right in his cockpit are shown over and over after we have to watch other pilots doing same. As for plot, we need pilots in planes because there is GPS jamming but that didn't stop a hoard of cruise missiles from flying thru the same airspace to bash the enemy airbase. An airbase that is home to scary 6th generation fighters we're told again and again. Later we find out those fighters are parked exposed on runways while a protective hangar is being used to shelter a remnant F14. Coincidence? I think the better movie would have been Tom training to kids for the attack only to have the timetable advanced. To save their lives, Tom flies overwatch in the skunk works plane from Scene 1 and engages the enemy's high tech fighters in the next evolution in air combat. Now that's Top Gun 2.0!",

Then he is sent back to Top Gun to train newly qualified Pilots to carry out a specific mission which is three weeks away. The mission involves flying F18s in a twisty valley at over 1000 km/hr at an altitude of just 100 feet.Why they used F 18s when the Navy has F 35s which are the latest tech boggles my mind. Also why they used fighters instead of precision guided missiles is also confusing.There are too many close ups of the action sequences. A movie of this kind with lots of action sequences requires wide shots which are missing.Why would the Navy send newly qualified pilots when there are more than a thousand F18 pilots to choose from?The two seater F18 is called the growler but they kept calling it the two seater.Since Kelly McGillis is not in the right shape to be a love interest, they hired Jennifer Connelly to be Maverick's love interest.

The satisfying development of the closest relationships Maverick had with the other main characters of the movie. The sight of the F14 back in the air, and the reminder that it was at one point the master of the skies.

These days you have to switch off your brain to be able to watch any movie produced in Hollywood.The good guys are talking and interacting and we don't know anything about the other side. We just know that they have a Nuclear underground facility.Dehumanizing the enemy is the first step for a war.If you're into pentagone propaganda movies so this is for you.From a technical point of view this movie is perfect. That's all I have to say.",

            "content": "It has typical blockbuster cliches, typical navy ego co.k measuring who's the best games, the bar with everyone Rock'n'Roll mode ON in it, the strong independent girl but too week for the hero, the cool old motorcycle together with the cool old propeller airplane and the coolest 80s sunglasses. But all this without Tom Cruise would be just another Jerry Bruckheimer movie who's name btw showed up 3 times before the first scene of Maverick movie even started. Not being American but growing up heavily influenced by that culture this movie took me out of today's 100% everything industry era and placing me in some different long forgotten life, the human 80s where everything seems like another planet. The Top Gun theme is a masterpiece and this summer brought 80s back in such a classy way along with Stranger things season 4 and now Top Gun Maverick that it was a joy to be back. Hope they keep up making movies and shows inspired by the 80s deep well vibe as it works like a charm. It brings a touch of soul that's missing in today's industry. Personally the 80s atmosphere America's for me is really best or true version of America there is. Love it. Miss it. Tom Cruise has such a hartfull, strong and charismatic appearance. He marked the lives of billions trouought his long career and he's still doing it especially in Top Guns Maverick without any signs of slowing down. Respect to the floor. He's the GOAT in what he does. Val Kilmer is a true legend and he got the recognition he deserves that got many emotional. Miles Teller really thumbs up, Glenn Powell, Jennifer Connelly and others also for such a good job. Musical score is strong, powerful and acts as a wingman of the movie. The action, direction and visuals are insane. All off it so impressive but bottom line Tom Cruise and Top Gun theme are so another level the move should be named Tom Cruise's Top Gun Maverick.",

            "content": "This movie is way better, way more substantive, and way better executed than the iconic film it is a sequel to. And my praise is not just relatively speaking, the film is an actually good film. In fact, 90% of my issues with it all stem from it's role as a sequel and would be irrelevant if it was a standalone film. The story is tighter (though it still has a few blockbuster-sized holes -- and some intentionally vague stuff designed not to offend any potential viewers in any potential markets -- in it, you just go with them, as we do when it comes to blockbusters in America), the acting is strong, and the emotional stakes feel more authentic within the larger context.It's 100% true it's a vanity project for Cruise, and I justify those aspects (including a few unbelievable things if you know anything about the Navy, Navy pilots, or flying a plane--all things my dad and brothers did/do, giving me an inside view) by saying as a movie star, he's earned it and knows fans will go along with it. Tom Cruise isn't needed for this movie to be good, but he's needed for this to be a TOP GUN sequel and they make decent use of him.I have to join the chorus of folks who find that Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan got shafted. Not because there aren't valid story reasons for them not to be there as the script was written (or in McGillis's case, even get a true nod) but because the script was written in that way, while still finding a way to include Val Kilmer (deservedly) who can't even speak anymore due to the ravages of his real life cancer, and touch up his appearance significantly. It's common industry knowledge that TOP GUN tested poorly but the romance aspect with McGillis tested well, leading them to do substantial reshoots to add more of McGillis, more romance, and a sex scene that wasn't originally shot. Sure, she isn't a conventional romantic lead anymore, having gained some weight and allowed her hair and appearance to deviate from Hollywood standards, and that's a real thing. But she was an essential part of the film's success. If they'd wanted to, they could have written a phone call, an interview on a podcast, or done any number of things -- same as they did to include Kilmer -- to honor her contribution and reward the many female fans who not only flocked to the screen for the romance but literally made Tom Cruise the bona fide movie star (not just rising star) he was after the success of the original. When Cruise & Co. Controlled all aspects of the film, they could have included McGillis or honored her (as they do, in a very substantive way, the absent Ryan) but choice was made not to. I don't think she should have been the romantic lead (who goes all the way to marriage and kids with the instructor they had an affair with while away at a training program--not many, so it's realistic they aren't still together) and I do fault the film for that.But at the end of the day, if you never think about the first film, you can't say it's not a great film, and enjoyable.

You get dragged to these places because someone (not you) decided that it was the least risky place to meet another couple. The food comes, and you're dreading it...and then..blammo! The food tastes great.That is what this movie is. I have to say that a 30+ year gap between the original and the sequel did not promise much to me. I think of the shows that I stopped watching because they were on hiatus during the pandemic and I just couldn't get back into them--I'm looking at you Killing Eve. So 30+ years? I didn't have high expectations. Suffice to say...they were all exceeded.This sequel catches up to Captian Pete Mitchell (Cruise) who, in the intervening three decades, has accumulated a closet full of accommodations, achievements and feats that were distinguished...distinguished...distinguished (inside joke for those who've seen it). Now, \"the enemy\" (an enemy nation is never mentioned by name) has built a site to weaponize uranium that is in the bottom of this canyon rimmed with SAMs and only low-altitude fighter jets can fly in under the radar and blow it to smithereens.The brass want Cruise to train the latest crop of Top Gun graduates to do the mission. So he is given twelve fighter jockeys to mold into a team--this attack has to be done by four aircraft. And the predictable, contrived, and all-too-familiar devices come into play. Cruise meets his team the night before he is introduced to them. In a bar. Where everyone is singing. They embarrass themselves. Even tossing him out of the bar onto the beach. The next morning...The 2nd in command announces him to the class from a podium in front of the twelve aviators. Cruise walks up right through the middle of them just like Kelly McGillis did in the original. The pained expressions of the fighter jocks take place next. There is competition, humiliation, insubordination, passion, a beach scene where they are playing two way football at the same time!!! The brass isn't happy with Maverick, the fighter jocks aren't happy with Maverick...the new Penny (played by Jennifer Connelley) isn't happy with Maverick...So the mission comes up. The \"graduation-cut-short\" scene in this film is that the uranium enrichment plant is coming on-line early and the crews have to accelerate their training. The 12 jocks all try to fly a simulated run to knock out the enrichment site but can't get it done. Mav pushes them hard but they are not able to do it....tempers flare and Mav has it out with one of the fighter jocks. And because of this--Mav is grounded by the brass. Huh? Here is where the movie loses what little credibility it had to start with. Apparently the pilot who is distinguished...distinguished...distinguished enough but only got one grade promotion in the last 30 years didn't do anything egregious enough to get grounded. But somehow in this movie, he stepped over the line (where no lives were lost) and got grounded when \"the enemy\" is about to enrich uranium and destroy the world? Nope.So, what does Mav do? He, of course, steals a plane and shows that the mission can be done. So what does the brass do? Of course, they name HIM mission lead...the guy they grounded 3 scenes earlier.The logical fallacies in the move are too numerous to count. For example, the reason four planes have to fly this mission is because they are in pairs. One of the planes points a laser onto a target while the other plane fires the missile. The next pair do the same thing but actually blow up the facility. Somehow, high level bombers couldn't do this? The opening scene in the movie saw Maverick's program being shut down so unmanned drones could be funded. Perhaps they could have done this mission? The pathway they fly down to the uranium enrichment site are lined with SAMs (dozens of them) but \"the enemy\" didn't think to put SAMS right at the site itself? There are dozens more.Back to the movie. The rest is predictable so I won't go too much into it. To the shock of no-one, I'm sure, the mission is a success. What happens after the success of the mission though is straight out of Monty Python. Its almost comedic.The saving grace of this movie are the fighter scenes. They truly are spectacular. I'm sure there was plenty of CGI but, unlike a lot of films, you can't really tell the CGI part. Connelley and Cruise sizzle on the screen. I hope those two make another film together...there is some real chemistry between them.So I give this movie a 7 out of 10. Much like Chilis, Applebees, and Pizza Hut....sometimes they hit the mark just right. But, in the back of your mind, you know that there is better food down the street.",

And why not, if it is a pilot and not the box that determines the outcome of the dog fight, then the pilot might as well soar as a superhero and knock out a couple of 5th gen fighters out of the air with his fist (pretty much what Tom Cruise has done in a museum-aged aircraft).

Enjoy this movie, if you are into excess glamour and perfect characters that mold circumstances to them rather than challenging themselves with any hardships.",

            "content": "Ok, I grew up in the 80's when Top Gun first came out. Loved it then, still love it today. I have seen the movie more times than I can count. So after 30+ years of anticipation and teasing, they finally made a sequel. My only hope was that it wasn't going to be a Hollywood disappointment to try and milk more money off a good name. Time and time again we have scene remakes or sequels that had potential but the flubbed the opportunity and some make you ask why. Ie Ghostbusters (3) or Indiana Jones 4. With Top Gun: Maverick, I was putting my faith in Tom Cruise since he tries hard not to put his name on anything that is going to tarnish his ego as an actor. So when it was announced before covid that they were going to make the movie, I had as much anticipation as I did when they announced Indiana Jones 4, only this time I had some reservation because of the final project of IJ4. Then came the trailers and the interviews of the cast members on YouTube, and again my anticipation went back up.I have to say, I love movies but I have a love/hate relationship with trailers as most of the times the way they construct the trailers, it ends up being better than the movie, or gives you a preconceived notion of the the plot and kind of ruins it for the viewer. As for Top Gun: Maverick's trailer compared to the movie, I really thought it was going to more like a remake for the new generation, especially after watching the trailers and other clips. Boy was I completely happy that I was wrong.This movie surpassed even my expectations so much that I am actually writing this review. Top Gun: Maverick checked all boxes for a great movie. It had nostalgia from the original without being a copycat movie. It had romance like the original, short and not overly dramatized. (which apparently I learned after via IMDb is actually an Easter Egg). Breath taking action was a must especially since the original had it, but seemed to lack something but was masked by the fact that it was a good movie. Character development lately in movies seems to take forever, but here it seemed to lack that because it was really irrelevant and bits were added as needed to move the story forward.As for the movie itself. If you see this movie and you loved the original and if you don't feel it 5 seconds into the opening, then just get up and leave, If you do feel it, and you will know what I am talking about when you see it, then hold on to seats and don't eject because your about to get the ride of your life. You don't just get to see the movie, you will actually feel the movie. Other than Imax documentary or a 3D movies, I have never, and I say this true, I have never felt a movie to the point that I felt like I was actually in some of the scenes. This was all thanks to Tom Cruise and his push to have the actors train and then film in actual fighter jets instead of the industry standard CGI. It really made the movie because it felt real, because short of real war, it was real for these actors and actresses. The only thing they could have possibly done was take a note from Disney's Soarin\" ride and pumped the smell of burning jet fuel and heat into the theater.Top Gun: Maverick is a part II.36 years removed, but could easily stand as an original. I personally think that this was a great movie, and actually makes the original even better. I don't usually brag about movies, especially sequels, let a lone write reviews this long. But after the movie, I could not stop telling people how good the movie was and they must experience it in the movie theaters. Some will say that TG:M is better than the original and if you take everything into account except with digital cinematography can offer, then I would have to agree 100% with that. Like I said before, Top Gun is a good movie, Top Gun: Maverick was a great movie that made Top Gun even better and can be easily seen as better than the original. At the end of the day, I will maintain that I thought the last Spider-Man had this distinction, but now Top Gun: Maverick is now my favorite movie that I have seen in a long time.",

I had chills all over my body while watching the film. Sure it's nostalgic but what else does it have to offer? It has a great and unique story that's easy to follow. Characters in this film are written better and have a purpose to be in the film although there are some who are just \"there\". The action sequences are intense and breathtaking. All were done real and blows my mind how they got it done. Tom Cruise is just insane and the best actor of all-time! The pacing for this film is extremely fast and doesn't even feel like the runtime given. The cinematography is amazing as the film is shot beautifully! The ending of this film was good although it could've been written better. I don't have a big gripe on it but it still could've been better. Jennifer Connelly and Miles Teller are also amazing in this film as they're so enjoyable to see on screen. I hope this film gets Oscar Nominations as it absolutely deserves it. I believe this is the best film of the year after watching 14 select movies from this year! It's a great sequel and just an amazing experience. Go watch this film on the biggest screen possible and support the people who made this film for the audience! Another great Tom Cruise movie!Letter Grade: A.",

The love story was not set up enough, I did not buy it or care, it felt like an afterthought. Ed Harris is in it for like a minute, and glowers the whole time. It was good to see Val Kilmer, I'm glad Tom Cruise insisted he be in it.The movie is very cliche. My wife and I called out scenes before they happened, like who pulls a Han Solo at the end and shows up to save the heroes out of the blue. And a LOT of shots and little moments were lifted exactly from the original. All that said, the ending came together well for me, it got me inspired and on the edge of my seat.There are also some laughs throughout, and some nice emotional moments. All in all this may be great simply because there's nothing blatantly bad about it- except why did Maverick choose the team he did at the end? He ignored the top pilot and instead chose the dude who almost passed out earlier? Small quibbles. Great cinematography, a solid plot, great music (love the theme), and some nice emotional moments elevate it above the standard blockbuster. Not to a 10 in my opinion, but a solid 8.",

That includes those who gave it a 10/10 rating; was it cos' they came out of watching Wiseau's The Room? Usually, dogfights make the movie stay in audiences' memory long after it disappears from the box office (e.g Blue Thunder); unfortunately, Maverick doesn't give us classic battle scenes.The 80s Top Gun made an impact because it was a cultural statement, especially during the Cold War / east vs west thing. It was a time when the world by and large bought in to the Hollywood hype that only America could save the world and the Russians, Arabs were the bad guys. It was the era of Rocky vs Drago, Rambo vs the commies.TG also announced the arrival of the cocky screen persona of a young Tom Cruise as a global Hollywood brand, who went on to solidify that persona and his box office cred in subsequent movies. It also didn't have to compete with a generation of high octane, SPFX powered superhero movies, so a movie filled with somewhat bland dogfights could still get away with it. Then, there was also the evolution of Cruise as an actor who sought to move away from a teeny-bop poster boy, with movies like Born on the Fourth of July, Few Good Men. With the Mission Impossible franchise, he went on to achieve the near impossible - intelligent action movies that consistently satisfy both critics & audiences.Maverick doesn't belong in that league. It's a decent enough watch if you don't have much to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but beyond that, it doesn't add anything new as a sequel. Throw in the 80s soundtrack - and I'm guessing this was to attract nostalgic audiences who grew alongside Cruise's movies.As its predecessor, Maverick doesn't try to punch above its weight as pop corn fare. Where it fails to satisfy largely boils down to the fact that its dogfight scenes are nothing to shout about; old F-18s that attempt the impossible by approaching Mach 9/10. The camerawork and battle angles don't give you any edge of the seat moments. The only exciting scene was the opener, where Maverick pilots a B-2 bomber-like experimental plane to exceed Mach 10. If they had stuck with that same jet in the finale, then maybe I'd felt differently. But the F-18s didn't have that same punch in your gut sensation, so the finale turns out to be a lame bomb-the-enemy exercise.Couple that with cliched plot material & movie dialogue, or characters that occupy space to fill up time in between action scenes, and Maverick missed an opportunity to reinvent the dogfight movie. An unnamed enemy, hoo-ra dialogue, machoism, uptight admirals who always wanna clamp the hero, guilt & family ties - it's all there; evidence that the script went through the same run of the mill Hollywood factory. Well known character actors like Jon Hamm or Jennifer Connelly are pretty much A-list wall decos who's characters don't add value to the plot; especially for an Oscar winner like Connelly, you wonder why she accepted a pedestrian role with lame dialogue that could have been played by lesser known actresses. Guess the production team wanted big names to give credence to Maverick. Most of the actors' emotional projection - including Cruise's - seem laboured and unconvincing.Only Miles Teller manages to inject some emotional depth into his Rooster; the loss of his father and the tension it creates with Maverick, is well projected by Teller, despite the fact that this too, belongs to the cliched school of movie plots. It reinforces my sentiment on Teller and just how good he is as an actor - he always gives 100% - whether or not the movie itself stinks. I'm hoping that he'll nab an Oscar one day. My only issue with his Rooster was - what's with the 80s moustache? In any event, Teller's moustachioed appearance bears an uncanny resemblance to Paul Newman's Gen. Leslie Groves in Shadow Makers - check it out.To conclude, if you wanna a TC fare that you can constantly go back to, then go watch MI. Or even Collateral. Leave Maverick for rainy days streaming.",

I think they could have done without some of the dialogue with back story that probably wasn't needed (we know this guy so we didn't need the minutia of the details shoved in) But hey, it's about Mav so I was eating it up. ;)Fave parts of the story for me were the relationship between Rooster and Mav, the flight scenes and some good ol fashioned heart tugging flashbacks, Additionally, they imparted some really good life lessons for us, the next gen. They are a class act; showing how people are infallible, forgivable and able to grow and learn and love.

Or when a scene is so thrilling that you find yourself on the edge of your seat, holding your breath? Well, I lost count of how many times I felt like this watching Top Gun Maverick. A sequel that is superior in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY to the original film.Top Gun, from 1986, is a great action movie, no wonder it became a classic, but we have to admit that it has its flaws, a little relevant plot, which is basically two guys arguing about who has the biggest dick. Top Gun Maverick is arguably more polished, layered, tense, and emotional. We start the film with several established relationships between Maverick and other characters, such as his friendship with Iceman, and his relationship with Penny (Connelly), which doesn't need to be didactic for us to realize all its nuances and complexities. The mix between the old and the new is very present here, including references to the original flick, without ever seeming out of place, or mere fan service. I don't know if I need to talk about the action scenes, but they're absolutely mind-blowing. The sound effects and soundtrack will leave anyone with goosebumps. The CGI doesn't draw attention to itself, and a lot of the visual effects are practical, which brings a wonderful physicality to the action.The supporting cast is very efficient, with Hangman being an updated, and even more douche, version of Iceman, but without the same personality and presence as Val Kilmer's character. Miles Teller also doesn't shine much, but he does a good job. Tom Cruise is the absolute standout, no exceptions.Perhaps something that Top Gun Maverick lacks is the courage to let go of some characters. Despite having moments of life or death, literally, where we feel like anything can happen, there is no real risk, which ends up taking some of the weight off the mission.A film that really deserves the title of Blockbuster, which goes beyond the a mere action movie, and delivers us an exciting, mind-blowing and chills-filled adventure.",

Also, I liked the new volleyball scene (I guess it was filmed better than the old one). All in all, a good first after-covid \"popcorn\" movie to see in filmtheatres.",

Seeing it from that view made the viewing experience that much better.Now the storyline was good. Blast from the past and they manage to bridge both movies well with little information.

This was a thrilling and meaningful film. The fist one was good; this one was extraordinary. It did have that annoying \"man-up\" tension, but that's part of the story. Very impressive non-DCI scenes that were very refreshing. I've stopped watching many films because CGI has ruined them. Cruise is nearly ageless and is in top form in all respects. He's finally made me let go of his Scientology shortcomings and jumping on furnature on talk shows; we've all done some crazy stuff.This is a must watch movie. I saw it in D-Box and since I was the only one in those seats I was very self-conscious because my seat was moving and no one else's was. It was very distracting (my feelings, not the chair) but I'm glad I had the experience anyway. The only reason I don't give 10 stars is because while this film is outstanding, it probably won't last 100 years like, \"The Wizard of Oz\" will. It isn't revolutionary like \"Avatar\", although there is nothing to criticize about it. It really is a perfect movie in every respect for the here and now and on my personal scale, 9/10 is as good as it gets and is a score I gave to one other film, \"Star Trek - The wrath of Khan\" for the treatment of the death of Spock. And yes, I give \"OZ the only 10/10 score because your great great grandchildren will see it, but probably won't see \"Maverick\".",

The first scenes in the movie I dont understand why it even needs to be in the movie, the scenes with the super airplane flying mach 10.It feels like there could have just been a shorter intro to let Mav get back to top gun.2. After this the movie for a long time feels right on point until u arrive at the scene where Mav and Rooster gets shot down.When this happens the movie loses its realism characteristics that it has built up thru out the entire movie as 2 people behind enemy lines, just got shot down, with no injuries run around a military base stealing a F14 who just also happend to be exactly there and not destroyed.I understand sometimes things just gotta happen for a movie because F14 is iconic but I was really hoping they would have done a different approach to get it into the film.3. The best song from top gun 1 was Cheap tricks Mighty wings. However they never used it in this film and god there was so many times in the movie it would have matched perfectly to take this movie to the next level.Other than this, bravo to everyone involved in making this movie .It blows away everything else that hits the theaters now a days.",

This is one of the sequel movies that has been made 20 years later, because there was a fitting story to take it forward, not just to make use of the legend of the first film and make quick bucks by creating unimaginative sequels and taking the audience for a ride.Hope Hollywood comes with sequels of the quality of this movie, if they ever choose to come up with sequels for yester year classics.",

The delays for this film just convinced me more that it would be a flop, boy was I wrong.I didn't expect anything from this film, I was hoping for it to at least be a decent directed movie with an ok plot, but I got more then I could ever imagine, the plot was a solid 10/10, one of the best written stories I've seen on the big screen, I am still In shock after a week from seeing the movie, and I am so excited for my next opportunity to watch it again.The characters of the film were great, and the returning cast were a complete fan service, Tom Cruise still hasn't lost his charm as maverick and they even managed to get Val Kilmer to act In a few short scenes. But I think the best characters of the film were by far the new additions, and I am talking specifically about 'Rooster', played by Miles Teller, this character bought some of the most emotional stakes I've seen in any film, mainly through him being the son of Mavericks deceased wingman from the original 'Goose'. The other pilots present throughout are also great, and feel like genuine people, bringing some strong comedic relief.The cinematography for the film is some of the most realistic and incredible practicality I've ever seen, those where REAL jets 99% of the time! I was amazed by how real the movie felt, being a huge step up from the original, which if I'm correct only used flight simulation for most of the climactic scenes.I can't say to much else without spoiling, so I will leave it at this, this movie is one of the greatest if not THE greatest sequel of all time to a classic film, everything about it will leave you either on the edge of your seat, or staring in amazement at the big screen, if I could experience this movie again for the first time, I would do so 100%, please see this movie, whether it's at home or before the film leaves cinemas, I can guarantee the movie will end up high in your ranks as it has mine, I give this movie a 10/10 and I would make that an 11 if I could!",

Then Rooster takes a bullet for Cruise and they both end up behind enemy lines. (Nice...)Comically they escape by stealing an older fighter jet (for nostalgic reasons I'm sure), and just before they can be shot down, Hangman comes in and saves their lives.I wouldn't say it's predictable, but Goodness Gracious does it have to be so corny?Every time it was a moment for a character to come alive, they used the same quote \"Dont think, just do!\"I feel like the writers didn't think, they just did- and wrote the corniest most nostalgic plot they possibly could.It was very entertaining yes, and very pro-America.

            "content": "It was a surprise to see the poster of the sequel to one of my favourite childhood films, in a recently renovated cinema house in my hometown of Peshawar, a city that is an hour away from Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, its a city which for the longest part of the last decade post 9/11 had only seen blood,chaos and suicide bombings. So to see maverick's poster outside the cinema which was once shut down for a long time when it was almost war in my city, it was a breath of fresh air to buy a ticket to see top gun mav. The film is overall really beautifully filmed, the casting, the screenplay, the direction are top notch, the youngsters fit in their roles really well, however i must say i did not digest john hamm in his role as cyclone for some reason, i felt he was wearing a uniform but was a disconnect from the charecter, he acted more like his charecter from mad men tv show. Jennifer connely has really good acting skills, i think her role could have been of more substance and that could have also added a lot to the film apart from its high fidelity air combat sequences, connely's role could have had more meaning to it. The biggest turn down for me was how maverick easily slips into enemy air base ,easily finds a tom cat f14 parked, ready like a piece of cake ready to be eaten , maverick and goose's son run towards it and within seconds easily taxi it and fly off the enemy base, this made the film look like an indian film. Over all, i loved the film, its continuity from the prequel and how well the cast (except for hamm) have played their charecters. Two of the minor turn offs apart from john hamm for me have to be the absence of a new soundtrack song which i wish were there and as good as berlin's song in the prequel, and the second turn off has to be maverick still being a captain. With this review, i rest my opinion about the film, lots of love from Peshawar,Pakistan.",

I do feel based on the flow and story that it was 100% intended to be just an entertaining sequel, and not a possible Best Picture nominee. I bet even the ones who made the movie are a bit surprised on it's success. I grew up in the 80's, so don't get me wrong here. I'm always open to a modern continuation of movies or tv shows from my childhood. I don't think it's the best movie I've seen, and I do feel like it's a bit overhyped (A 2nd release in theaters? Really?). I'm glad people truly enjoyed this film and see it as a 10. I just personally don't feel like it's that amazing, but again, was definitely entertaining.",

Top Gun was adolescent, Top Gun Maverick is middle-aged. The latter is a more complete movie than the former.Action: The mission of the Top gun team is quite challenging and entertains throughout. The fighter jet sequences, the backdrop, the dog fighting is out of this world in a realistic sense, if that makes sense. Tom Cruise is on fire here. His age doesn't show in a bad way at all and the co-stars match up well.The 'Americans as the savior' concept is where the movie fails. In 1986, US was not perceived as a villain by many in the world. Its different now. I wouldn't blame the moviemakers for that. The soundtrack of Maverick could have been much much better.In a nutshell, an outstanding action movie and a great sequel with sufficient drama. Tom Cruise doesn't disappoint. Thank you and cheers man!-- I'd like to add that I saw the movie thrice and it only got better, like aerated wine. There is so much fine tuning to the flight scenes! OST still felt dull.",

How can Pete 'Maverick' pull another soldier's papers? I have heard the theory that it was because he knew iceman. Even if he pull his paper's, how did Rooster know that it was Pete who pulled his papers.The fact that they sent them out on the mission and none of them passed the simulation course training was weird. Yet when they actually flew the mission, they succeeded.Furthermore, Maverick steals a plane and did the simulation course in record time. Instead of reprimanding him for stealing the plane, they promote him to team captain?There were other plot holes like how did Rooster's mom die?I felt it was not a great plot. There were a lot of the same old school movie clich\u00e9 like Maverick having a love interest.I appreciate they used real planes and avoided unneeded CGI to give it a realistic experience, but I wouldn't give it the same rating everyone else did.",

He looks fit and has looked after himself but like me, now at the same age, he needs to become more of an actor than an action star.The question is asked, early in the movie, by Cain, played by Ed Harris, why he is still a Captain and not an Admiral. It is the most critical question of the movie. Ed Harris must be way past military retirement age himself.It turns out that Maverick is a test pilot. Still taking risks that should have killed him years before. Defying all the rules Hollywood style. This is a tale of miracles throughout.The problem of a sequel more than 30 years in the making is how to reference the old movie. There will be two audiences. One that saw the original, bought the VHS tape, maybe even watched on TV. The other is the younger audience that never saw or remembered the original.The callback was the subplot of being returned to Top Gun by Iceman. Played by Val Killmer and both showing and acting his age. Killmer is an Admiral and has progressed while Cruise is determined to keep his boyish charm.The tension in the new generation is Rooster. The son of his wingman that died in the original movie. Flashbacks follow. The son is even wearing his father's 1980s moustache. It seems out of place and distracting.It all felt out of place for me. The personal story was that you need to buy into the idea of redemption for the death in the original movie by way of the relationship between Maverick and Rooster.Your alternative was just to enjoy the action sequences. They were fun and thrilling. Once sitting in the plane with Maverick and his team you could forgive most of the subplot and the mustache. Enjoy the flying - which is what you came for anyway.It honours the original movie and is a good sequel. They did a great job on the flying and the action. I feel I should give it 10 stars but I could not quite take onboard the father/son dynamic and I felt there was better drama to be had with the Maverick/Hangman relationship that wasn't fully explored.",

Like so many others, I loved the original Top Gun and played the soundtrack (on cassette tape!) for decades. That movie entered our collective culture and stuck with us. Luckily, I was thrilled by Top Gun: Maverick. You already know the Maverick character from 1986, and it's fun to see what he might be like after 30 years of continuing to defy authority and get into and out of scrapes. Maybe he's not the most mature role model, but he's cool!Rather than waste time with a lot of character formation and plot, we get right to the action. We are in the theater to see screaming jets, feel the explosions of the rockets, and have our hearts lashed by unsubtle emotions. I found myself enjoying this film much more than I expected, actually captivated by it. I was completely taken in by the action and the adventure. Do I believe that the two pilots shot down over the enemy forest (in a mystical sunlit snowfall) would survive? And find each other unhurt? And steal an antique F-14 that they used to escape back to the carrier? No, that's ridiculous! But I don't care!",

It all made sense, they probably started adapting some of our traits which repetitiveness is one of them. But besides that? This was a really great movie, just at the right time.Who I was really impressed with, was John Hamm! We had to stop the movie to search his background, just to make sure he wasn't in the military at all.. That's how well he played his role, & I hope we aren't the only ones who took notice. He deserves so many doors to be opened because of this portrayal.Last, I just wanted to thank all those Real Fighter Pilots out there who do this job everyday, & all those who make their jobs possible.

From directing (Joseph Kosinski) to writing (Ehren Kruger, Christopher McQuarrie, Eric Warren Singer) to soundtrack (Hans Zimmer, Harold Faltermeyer) to acting (Tom Cruise, Jon Hamm, Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Charles Parnell). The movie tells the story of Capt. Pete Mitchell (Maverick) who returns to Top Gun school again after 36 years to teach an elite group of fighters how to accomplish a mission. The story is actually good as the movie doesn't need you to watch the first movie. It's so emotional, you'll smile, sit on the edge of your seat, you'll feel the danger that they fall in. The soundtrack is as good as it can be. The cinematography is stunning and the whole movie should be seen in IMAX to enjoy every detail in. The acting is superior from everyone from Tom Cruise to every role in the movie especially that Cruise made the crew fly real real jets and they had extensive G-Force training sessions to withstand the physical demands of the G-force pressures during flights. At the end, the movie deserves the wait, the hype, and to be watched on the biggest screen available. My rating is 10/10.",

A Su-57 (5-Generation aircraft) has R-37 missiles (hypersonic air-to-air missile), the R-37 uses a Doppler radar, so flares won't be as useful as against infrared missiles.3. And the Carrier Group would be sunk with 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missiles even before the Hornets reach the destination. I said Carrier Group, a Carrier is always part of a Carrier Strike Group, composed of at list 4 major ships, plus logistic and supply ships, etc, roughly 7,500 personnel\n4.

            "content": "This is nothing but a self indulging joy ride for Tom Cruise in US fighter jets funded by the masses. I can literally see him sitting in his mansion going: \"what other cool stuff could I do in life... hmm fly in a modern, operational military jet?? How to do that? Hmm lets do a TG sequal. And to be fair that would be all in all fine if at least he did his homework and made a decent movie.How this movie has gotten such good reviews is beyond me...\nI work as a pilot, flying jet aircraft, and I can say that the realism, when it comes to the flying and military aspects, is non-existent. Period. In basically every facet of the movie. There are some crumbs of realism in there but they are obliterated by nonsense hollywood action for dramatic effect. This movie is about as realistic from a flying and military perspective as the worst XBOX flying game, mind you game, not simulator. The \"Star wars rip off trench run mission\" that the movie revolves around is simply and plainly, absolute nonsense... with too many unrealistic aspects to even begin to list... Ok, just one, the millions of SAM sites along the trench, but none in the trench? Or in the crater?One of the biggest pet peeves I have is that the so called 5th gen fighter (SU-57 in real life) is elevated to some sort of super plane, which the US military (the most ridiculously well funded military and air force in the world) is somehow incapable of matching...clearly they need more funding.... except that the US also has 5th gen fighters... two types even... one of which is in the movie in the beginning.. the F-35. But it is eloquently, very briefly discarded in the movie as not appropriate for the mission due to \"gps jamming\" but for some reason the F18 is unaffected by this...sigh... true reason: there is no two seater version so there would be no IRL shots of the cast. Which is fine I guess, but the whole underdog premise, which military technology wise the US would never be, is just nonsense.OK so the realism is about as present as Kelly McGillis in this movie. It could have still been a decent movie otherwise...right?? But no, between the terrible, juvenile acting, over the top Americanised/hollywood, \"forced\" comedy and drama, this is really just a cheesy, walk down memory lane for Tom Cruise, with throwbacks to the original movie (which was heaps better and actually more realistic than this one!). The only thing I remotely liked were the flight scenes and footage, however even that was dampened by all the edited and mashed together shots...This should not be called Top Gun 2, it should be called Fast and The Furious, aircraft drift....",

Also, it's highly unlikely that Maverick could continue in the Navy after so many skipped promotions.But with those inconsistencies aside, the movie is highly enjoyable and it's a great nostalgia exercise.As it's usual with action movies, there's scarce character development (specially with the team of pilots) and although the action scenes are perfectly done, the plot is somewhat generic and the ending is pretty obvious.The romance and emotional moments are keep low, just like the original one, but this time the film is less pop-oriented and feels more mature.In the end, Tom Cruise confirm his star status and appeal with the audience.",

I didn't like, hate, feel for or relate to a single one of them. I have met fighter pilots on several occasions and they have been impressive, engaging, disarming but mostly humble people. The polar opposite of these cardboard, yeeha all American clowns. At least the characters in the original were somewhat interesting.The script was not just embarrassingly corny and cringeworthy, it was boring. What has happened to script writing in Hollywood? If you're going to dump a 100 Million plus into a film at least employ someone who can write.The storyline was so lacking in credibility, it should have been classified science fiction fantasy. Come on, give me something that will at least suspend my disbelief for a while.The acting? What acting? Each scene was either hammed up or indifferently delivered. Nothing flowed. The scene between Maverick and a very ill looking Ice was difficult to watch. I mean, really? I like a bit of sentimentality as much as the next person but Val Kilmer, playing an Admiral of all things, just looked and sounded sad.Worse yet, the things supposed to be the stars of the show, the jets and the flying, were pretty awful. These scenes were mostly poorly directed and stuffed so full of CGI they looked cartoonish. All too often we were shown current Super Hornet jets doing things that they simply can't do to the point of monotony. This took away any authenticity the movie may have had, and \"rendered\" the whole experience one big yawn fest.But possibly worst of all was the disconnect between the age of the main character and the way he carries on. Lets face it, Tom Cruise ain't getting any younger and he's showing it, but it seems this Maverick bloke hasn't grown up at all.Crashed and Burned.",

I know it off by heart having watched it over 100 times.TG Maverick abandons all of this other than the amazing flying scenes - in fact that is the only thing that saves the film.Far too many nods to the original - it got cheesy by the end.The script was like something out of Mission Impossible. In fact that is what the premise of the film was - an impossible mission. But with this impossible mission everyone came home apart from poor Ice Man who's death and funeral only took about 24 hours - probably the fastest in US history.The first half of the film felt empty as we caught up with what Maverick has been up to for the last 20 or so years but in reality we didn't learn much. The last half was action packed but only just managed to save the movie.I'd have loved to have spent less time with the Maverick catch up, less time with the shoehorned Penny Benjamin and more time learning about the pilots. This could have been a perfect segway into a 3rd Top Gun with Rooster and Hangman taking over the Maverick and Ice Man rivalry.I desperately wanted to walk out of the cinema having loved it - I wanted to text all my mates saying how good it was but I couldn't. I rattled off a couple of sentences surmising the plot to my wife and realised how silly it all was:Maverick is a test pilot or a secret plane - he takes it up against orders and blows it up - doesn't get sacked as Ice Man conveniently phones up as it happens and brings him back to Top Gun for an impossible mission that no one else in the world can train people for - he trains them - gets sacked - steals a plane and completes impossible mission - gets his job back - flies impossible mission - gets shot down without parachute opening and is fine - Rooster saves him - gets shot down - they meet up and steal an old plane - shoot down 2 super jets and save the day - then they land and they then make up and work on planes together.I don't know, maybe I'm being harsh. Knock 30 mins off the start with all the Maverick and Penny stuff and it would have been pretty awesome.Will probably watch it another 99 times.",

On the edge of my seat. The Flying sequences are Excellent! I watched it on 55 inch TV screen. I would loved to have seen it in the theaters. Tom Cruise knows how to make a movie as do the producers, directors and crew. I can't say no violence in the movie because of enemy pilots being shot down, but at least no torture of anyone, no blood and no women being abused. So this is my kind of movie. Old style with values and trust. I wonder how many people inquired to the Navy recruiters what it takes to be a Navy Pilot? A friend was offered to take a ride in one of the Local Air Show Jets. He refused. I wish I had been there, because even though I don't like to fly commercial anymore, I would fly with any one of these pilots in a heartbeat! Go Navy!",

There is never a very clear establishment of the individual characters' reasons to put their lives at stake for this mission, apart from them being part of the navy. Even though that sufficed, I think it would have been better if there were a personal connection between the enemy and the main protagonists. Perhaps the enemy could have caused some past trauma, perhaps motivating the pilots further, just before they are about to fail.However, this is very minor in the face of how excellently everything else is executed in this film, with the cast being well picked, great directing and cinematography, as well as amazing visuals.Rating: 9/10.",

            "content": "On paper Top Gun Maverick is the sort of film I despise. It is a Hollywood blockbuster film sequel of a beloved (though overrated) 80s pop corn film classic, yet I found myself won over. The original film itself does not justify a sequel so that justification needed to be earned by the film and it to earned it. On the surface it has all the makings of a rubbish film. Characters with little depth and a greater emphasis on action and spectacle. Yet those qualities are what make Top Gun 2 work. People have described films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now as experiential films as they have a greater emphasis on the cinematic experience which is used to further enhance specific idea. I think this can be applied to some extent to Top Gun Maverick, though naturally any comparison beyond this would be practically blasphemous. Top Guns main appeal comes from the cinematic experience. It is an immersive film by design and this is where it it succeeds at. One of the problems with the the first film was its emphasis on character but given the characterisation was rather blunt and surface level, it resulted in a rather cheesy and corny film which at many points are rather laughable in execution with the flying being in the background. The flying scenes have always been the highlight and top gun masterfully makes use of it. Its by no means perfects as the character beats are fairly clich\u00e9 and predictable and it does annoyingly repeat a lot of elements from the original. Overall it is an exciting and thoroughly entertaining film and a suggested watch if you want a nice piece of escapism.",

However, the mission in the film is 100% the mission to destroy the Death Star in \"Star Wars - New Hope\". Pay attention to the details, the scenes play out almost identically, including the target monitor going out, torpedoes firing into a small hole and a \"you have the force\" moment. I would have wished for a Star Wars movie like \"Maverick\". That would take the Star Wars franchise to a new level where it's more realistic.Thanks for an old-school US blockbuster. I've been missing that in the movie world for a long time.",

He still lights up the screen and keeps you entertained, and that's exactly what this did.The action scenes were great I felt like I was in the cockpit and it was extremely intense. This movie gave me more respect to our men and women in the military who fly these jets. I know if I was one of them in that jet i would either pass out or lose my lunch.Definitely 10/10 for me.",

Action scenes pushed aviation and overall stunt level to its limits, but never crossed the \"impossible, bs\" line. Cruise, being an aviator did everything to build the action scenes on a solid structure.Soundtrack is just as the way it should be. Danger Zone is there from the start. The iconic tune, \"Take my Breath Away\" was not in the movie and I am glad it is replaced to reflect the changes in Maverick's life, just the way it should be.I consider Top Gun: Maverick the true, classy return of the theatre after the pandemic.

Tom Cruise performs charmingly and more adorably than before mainly because he got old adding some kind of bitterness to his aura. The plot, however, is insanely naive and self-righteous. In other words, too much American. They just make a plan to sneak in other nation's(not named though) and drop bombs on their territory and bug out dodging from their self-defense missiles. The bandits pilots' face are sealed with full-face masks and made unidentified, and just killed by heroic navies. Aren't they going to become another Goose for their families? I cannot be ignorant about the indisputable fact as a person like it's repeatedly saying \"don't think.\" The soldiers on shipapplauded two survivors who snitched an outdated(but ready-to-go) plane on their recklessness and brave hearts, but I cannot dismiss the following disastrous result.

But what you cannot deny is his love for movies, the blockbuster specifically.I'm sure most people turned their nose up when he announced a sequel to a, let's face it, average 80's movie that lives through nostalgia and when the Pandemic hit and the film saw multiple delays I'm sure people were expecting the worst.What did we get? A hell of a blockbuster ride that took us back to the glory days of cinema excess but wrapped in a surprisingly tight plot, small on scale but big on action and character moments. You had a grown up Maverick.It's exactly what the world needed at the right time, pure escapism with great acting from a mixture of veterans and newcomers. There's not too much you really need to say about this movie other than it's a great time at the movies. Grab some popcorn, sit back and enjoy as it spills over you.It's also really lovely to see Val Kilmer back in a touching scene and huge kudos to Tom Cruise to putting his foot down to make sure it happened. Val Kilmer is one of my favourite actors and it's a shame we don't get to hear his silky voice but he will always be my huckleberry.Tom Cruise.... you may love him, you may hate him, but as long as that man wants to keep the magic of cinema alive i'm coming along for the ride and feel the need.... the need for speed.",

He did not have much of an impressing charisma back then (in all his movies I only see a guy trying hard to appear like a cool guy but failing) and he has lost the rest of it since.

Tom Cruise's 46th Film is an Action Packed, promising delivered Hollywood Blockbuster awaiting to be seen from an audience on the big silver screen.Achieving what Top Gun: Maverick finalized is an extraordinary feeling. The Story carries itself with a calm opening staring Tom Cruise, and a trip down memory lane through portraits on a wall of Goose and his family from the first \"Top Gun\" Film. We are immediately introduced to the score as well as the personality of Maverick himself. After many years, Maverick still seems to be dedicated to flying, and going against commands just like his younger confident/reckless self.A new series of younger cast members is sweet, and faultlessly introduced. We meet a good chunk of prior Top Gun Academy graduates at Penny's Bar, exploring only a few piolets that have the chance to fly in a mission more complicated than any other mission Maverick has flown.Monica Barbaro playing Lt. Natasha 'Phoenix' Trace is the only female Top Gun Academy Graduate in recent years according to the film's cast and story. She brings a fresh satisfying performance, and perfectly shares the correct chemistry with the cast. Since she is one of the \"more talented\" piolets as introduced in her first flying exercise with Maverick, we get to know that her, as well as all the other piolets are very ambitious, and ready to impress even though it seems harder than expected.The films story is noticeably dull after act I, and easily identifiable during act II. Director Joseph Kosinski does a decent job trying to keep the audience hooked, as well as Claudio Miranda with the Shots, but the Top Gun franchise already having a specific theme and mood set, its harder to identify specific director elements since its a franchise film.The Shots in Top Gun: Maverick are beautifully crafted. The Cinematography from Oscar Winner Claudio Miranda does not disappoint with the use of interesting angles giving us an exact perspective of how the characters feel and certain times. The Lighting and Jet Shots are equally as interesting to watch.For a film in 2022, Top Gun: Maverick is easily one of the better pieces of Film shot using a Digital Camera (Sony VENICE) still delivering a natural movie look. Although the film started out interesting, and became dull, but later retained the audience based on the more interesting side of the plot, and the exciting score, Top Gun: Maverick was not entirely a bad film, but extremally pleasing for a sequel that has nearly took 4 decades to produce.",

There is a little bit of a carbon copy sense but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It is still action packed and told much more logically than the first one\nPlot:1.5/2The acting also took a major step up throughout this film as well. Cruise is better than he was in the Original and his playful banter with Teller makes for wonderful chemistry between the pair and I believe better chemistry than cruise had with Anthony Edwards in the first one. The side characters also get much more changes to shine and have memorable dialogue and storylines attached to them\nActing:1.5/2The biggest improvement between the first and the second one has to be the storytelling. It never felt like the original Top Gun had any sense of direction but this one there was a clear objection and a clear target from the beginning that guided the entirety of the movie and this main objective allowed for the characters and the storyline to build from it\nStorytelling:1.75/2As stated previously, there are many things that this one takes from the original which doesn't at all make it bad. It just makes it a little bland at times. There's no major plot twists and nothing to get you out of your seat but the pure enjoyment the film brings makes up for it in so many ways\nCreativity:1.5/2Just the original, this film benefits from the use of sound and I'm sure an in theater experience makes this movie quite a spectacle. However watching from my bedroom I still felt the intensity of the plane shots and it also utilizes camera work so much more effectively than that of the first one as many of the shots are outstanding and put the watcher in a place the original did not\nOther Factors:1.75/2Overall, Top Gun Maverick was everything I thought the top gun franchise would be when I watched the first one. It had high action, good acting but also moments that made you think and showed true meaning of friendship and family. I understand why it was such a major hit\nOverall:8/10.",

Not much else in the acting department--the movie is clearly 75% Tom Cruise. That leaves 25% for the flying this time and nothing for a forgettable sound track. Some viewers will miss Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan; I miss Kenny Loggins and Berlin. Cruise himself has lost a lot of his early brash appeal, but the weathered version has his own appeal.

You don't have to stuff a cheap love story inside an excellent action movie just for the audience cinematic vibe. The movie was about teamwork, a suicidal mission. This kind of love stories are kinda cheesy nowadays. It blurred me out a little bit, looking for it was just a few scenes that won't ever affect the plot. All i say, you don't have to build a love story to achieve a good-written movie, the movie was perfect enough. I loved this movie quite much, maybe the best this year, but could have been legendary and historical by adding some spices!",

            "content": "A thrilling and moving movie that everyone should watch! Gorgeous cinematography, insane flying action sequences, thrilling, emotionally moving, and a sequel that absolutely surpasses its predecessor. Well-paced, executed & has that re-watchability factor. There's so much great action, incredible stunts, big laughs, and emotional moments that really send the viewer on a journey, which is exactly why we go to the movies. The film is lovingly dedicated to the late Tony Scott, who directed \"Top Gun.\" and they were able to give justice to it! Salute!The opening text mentions how in 1969, the U. S. Navy established a school for fighter pilots. It is officially referred to as Fighter Weapons School, but the recruits call it \"Top Gun\". We see several recruits and Navy men on the ships where the pilots take off or make their returns.Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) rides his motorcycle to a base where he is set for a scramjet flight demonstration, but he is told that Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain (Ed Harris) is on his way to shut the program down to redirect funds elsewhere. Not feeling deterred, Maverick takes the jet just as Cain arrives, and he flies it into the sky, taking it past its original Mach 9 projection and hitting Mach 10, to the delight of the crew. However, Maverick tries to take it faster and ends up wrecking the jet, but he manages to eject in time.Cain chews Maverick out for his actions, but while he wants to have Maverick grounded, Cain instead informs him that he has been called back to NAS North Island by his former rival/colleague, Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer). Maverick heads to the base to meet Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson (Jon Hamm) and Rear Admiral Solomon \"Warlock\" Bates (Charles Parnell). Cyclone makes it clear that he doesn't see in Maverick whatever Ice sees in him, but he informs Maverick of the task at hand. A rogue nation is operation a uranium facility, and Maverick must teach a new group of recruits to find a way to make it to the base and bomb it.Maverick goes to a bar where he reunites with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), an ex-girlfriend that he left a while ago, which pissed off her admiral father. She bears no ill will toward Maverick, but she ends up making him pay a round for everyone at the bar. At the same bar, the new class of pilots are there to drink. Among them is hotshot Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin (Glen Powell), who sees himself as the most likely to lead the new class. There is also Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace (Monica Barbaro), Robert \"Bob\" Floyd (Lewis Pullman), Reuben \"Payback\" Fitch (Jay Ellis), and Mickey \"Fanboy\" Garcia (Danny Ramirez). Entering moments later is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of Maverick's late best friend Goose. After Maverick's card declines, Penny has Hangman and Payback playfully throw Maverick out. Outside, Maverick watches Rooster playing the piano and is reminded of Goose, but Maverick still feels guilt over Goose's death.Maverick later meets with the pilots to introduce himself and go over the mission. Since the facility is located deep at the bottom of a canyon, Maverick's plan to take it out involves having two jets destroy the entrance to the facility before hitting the base itself. Some of the pilots aren't onboard, like Hangman. Rooster resents Maverick because he pulled Rooster's application and set his career back by four years. Maverick then goes on with the dogfight exercises with the pilots, showing off his skills to mess with the younger crew. The pilots that fail their exercises are forced to do push-ups. Later on, Hangman discovers Rooster's connection to Maverick.Maverick goes back to the bar to pay Penny back what he owes her. He then spends the afternoon on her boat with her, and there is clearly still a spark between them.In the next round of exercises, Maverick explains to the pilots about how they may lose oxygen and consciousness if they fly too high, reminded them of how high and low they will need to go when they carry out their mission. During the exercise, Rooster is shown to utilize a more cautious approach in his flying. Hangman brings up Maverick's friendship with Goose, which provokes Rooster into nearly attacking Hangman, but the other pilots split them up.Ice requests Maverick go visit him. He is suffering from throat cancer and can mainly communicate through a computer. Maverick expresses his concern over working with Rooster, fearing that something will happen to him like with Goose. Ice tells him he must work closely with Rooster, and he manages to speak to Maverick and tell him that the young pilots need him more than he realizes.Cyclone steps out onto the runway to find that nobody is there. He finds that Maverick brought the pilots over to the beach to play volleyball as a bonding exercise, which appears to work since they are all having fun. Maverick later goes out with Penny and tells her that he pulled Rooster's application because his mother asked Maverick to look after him before she passed away.The pilots then undergo a training exercise to strike the target at a certain altitude and in a certain amount of time. Everyone fails to complete the task as needed, with Phoenix needing to eject before her jet crashes. Maverick chastises Rooster for how he handles his exercise, leading to them arguing over Maverick hindering Rooster's flying career. They are interrupted when Warlock comes in to inform them that Ice has died. A funeral is held for him days later, with Maverick, Penny, and the other pilots in attendance.Cyclone decides to take over instructional duties from Maverick. When he proposes an alternative plan, the other pilots seem to question him. Outside, the radars detect Maverick flying his jet to complete the exercise, where he is able to fire at the target on the ground with seconds to spare, impressing all the pilots, including Hangman.The mission is carried out, with Maverick picking Rooster as his wingman, and being joined by Hangman, Phoenix, Fanboy, Payback, and Bob. They fly toward the facility, with their nearby aircraft carrier firing Tomahawk missiles at the base to destroy the runway, causing enemy jets to scramble back toward the target. They manage to launch a missile and destroy the facility, but the enemy sends more pilots after them. The pilots start to fly back, but Maverick's jet is shot at, causing him to crash.Rooster turns around and goes to save Maverick. A chopper begins firing at Maverick while he is on foot, but Rooster shoots it down, just before his own jet is shot down, but he manages to eject himself in time. Maverick and Rooster reunite and devise a plan to get out of there. They spot an F-14 Tomcat and take control of it. They start to fly away and are pursued by enemy jets, leading to a dogfight. Although Maverick manages to take two of them out with bullets and flares, they run out of weaponry just as a third jet comes their way. Rooster is also unable to eject himself, so the two accept that they are about to die until Hangman comes through and destroys the last jet.Maverick and Rooster make it back to the carrier, where their crew congratulates them. Rooster and Hangman have a newfound respect for one another, while Rooster looks at Maverick the same way his father looked at him.Rooster helps Maverick work on a P-51 Mustang in Maverick's hangar. Penny shows up, and Maverick takes her for a flight in his plane. Rooster sets down a photo of himself and Maverick right next to an older photo of Maverick and Goose.",

During the beginning allow yourself to get familiar with each character and try not to ask yourself how is this movie going to be better than the first one.? Give the movie a chance to develop and then at the end make a decision about the impact it makes. Whenever possible, try to see the incredible amazing stunts and aircraft maneuvers that will only allow your imagination to flourish. Even though some of the scenes will keep you at the edge of your seat its incredibly realistic. Of course , these men flew without any fear and it obviously showed the ability for true American aircraft pilots to reach excellence and it showed how they can train to be the best in the world .Not only does this movie make you feel good about the American Air Force it also makes you feel proud about the American Air Force. We can encourage our future generations to reach greatness and true greatness can be achieved and emphasize that with training and practice and education anyone can become the best pilots in American world history. This movie showed the importance and the characteristic of having close relationship with the ones you spend time with training and showed how you can become the best . Humans work best when they have a team with plenty of training to reduce any errors and the movie showed the skill and education to fly a plane has purpose and the purpose is to become a better pilot and this interesting set of pilots ability to become the best comes with the ability to remain tactful and relaxed and precise and calm during their maneuvers. Truly believe that this movie will remind the younger generation that they can accomplish anything that they want if they place enough attention and whenever you try to break a new record you can expect America will come through. If it all possible one day we will have aircraft that will be able to accelerate and perhaps even have less propulsion and I would assume when America does reach that stage they still will need good trained responsible pilots conquering and becoming better.

The transition from the old to the new Top Gun era is spot on.And then there's the powerfull air-combat scenes which I honestly didn't expect to be that good. The merge between real flight scenes and CGI is simply brillant. As viewer you have no idea what was filmed in the air what's produced by the computer.Also, there's the right amount of homage to the spirit from the original and its characters like Iceman or Goose obviously.

            "content": "Top Gun Maverick is a movie that has been praised full heartedly by cinema goers, but what garners this praise and admiration for the film? The answer to that question is nostalgia, nostalgia for the original film.Now, as someone who has never seen the the first Top Gun, this nostalgia spell has not been cast upon me as a viewer, therefore, not obscuring my judgement, as a result, I went into this film with neutral expectations. So without entering the theater with rose tinted glasses, how was my experience? Quite frankly, the film was mediocre and at most times boring, the reason for this is the writing and cliche tropes that we've seen hundreds of times, particularly from cinema of the past. Tom Cruise's character, Maverick, is the skillful older character who is \"Out of the game\" but forced back in by a desperate situation, his task being to train top aviators, in doing this, Maverick becomes 'The reluctant hero'. The trainees are also cliches, they are \"the best at what they do\", and consist of 'Hangman' the talented jerk, 'Rooster' the brash secondary main character with a history to Maverick and son to his dead friend, 'Goose', finally, there is 'Phoenix', \"the badass chick\" along with other less notable characters. Other typical characters are Jon Hamm's 'Cyclone', the hard to win over authority figure and lastly, Penny, the old fling and love interest to Maverick.With all the information regarding the characters, the film goes pretty much exactly how you would expect it to, no twists, characters fulfilling their expected roles, it feels as though I have seen this film so many times because how many movies follow it's generic structure, with the film almost having nothing unique about it.Despite my criticisms of the movie, it does have one slight saving grace, that is perhaps it's USP and by far the best aspect. This one great ingredient of course has to be the visuals of the fighter jets, the action sequences and intense scenes involving jets. The feeling is visceral and small details like the Gs acting on the face of the pilots gives a realistic and an immersive feeling towards the scenes. One reason for the scenes being so great is the choice to use real US army jets, this being the instrumental for the realism and perhaps why many scenes involving jets can really be felt and captured the awe of movie lovers, particularly those that love action movies.Regardless of how great the facets of the films involving jets are, the rest of the film is mostly as dull as dishwater. Top Gun: Maverick is just a film with a few good scenes surrounded by drab and boring ones and there is nothing to be done to save this mediocre script from not being slightly below average. I understand that this is, in many ways, an homage to 1980s cinema, however, it just feels like any other American military film. This film is not good, it just reminds people of something they like, distorting the actual image it's projecting.",

For US army movie enthusiasts this could be a comfortable casual watch but for anyone looking for a deeper storyline than that this is probably not the best choice.",

Not the typical hero we often see from him. He is real. Vulnerable but not in a tok obvious way. Great acting.I absolutely love this movie and it touches every time I watch again.Why not a 10/10.

I think hearing all the hype, I was expecting more and was a bit disappointed. There were holes in the plot for me... i.e. Where was this base they were targeting? I won't spoil anything, but some of the conversations between Maverick and Jennifer Connelly's character had me scratching my head and thinking \"huh?? What are they talking about? Did I miss a movie somewhere?\" Just a weird dialogue and disconnected side plot. Also, and I LOVE Jennifer Connelly, all the way back to Labyrinth, but man, she overacted the heck out of this role. I didn't believe their attraction for a minute. She's beautiful, 100%. But the romantic scenes were sooooo cheeesy. They weren't necessary. At all. And, for background purposes, I'm female. So it's not like I don't like romantic flicks, but wow, I just wanted them to get back to the action. Haha. Which by the way, those flight scenes were awesome. Kicked butt. Totally made the movie. But the cheese could've been cut and they could've nixed her character completely and made it entirely an action flick and it would've been way better. I honestly felt like the overacting was the fault of the director, because I don't feel like they do that in other movies. And it was only Tom and Jennifer at fault. I loved Jon Hamm, the Iceman scene, and the younger generation all acted their butts off and did a great job. Overall, worth seeing, just bring a barf bag for a couple scenes. And not because of motion sickness. ;)",

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I thought the interaction between the young pilots (naval aviators) wasn't as robust as the original Top Gun; the interactions weren't bad, I just felt they could have been better. Another user, who gave it 1 star, said the aerial stunts were not possible; well, this is a fictional action movie, not a discussion on aerial combat techniques. If you go in looking for logical aerial maneuvers, I suggest you not go to any science-fiction or action movie because this movie was just for fun action, not a lesson on actual physics.",

I'm pretty sure the navy has a thousand different ways to deal with them, from jamming to ARMs to just hitting them with the tomahawks they (for some reason) used to crater the runway.Secondly, why didn't the team have any support whatsoever? Where's the electronic warfare aircraft that would be jamming enemy SAMs? Where's the aircraft responsible for neutralising air defenses? Also why didn't they have any cover from the enemy fighters?There's also the fact that they could have just sent a B2 or some other stealth plane to take out the target but what fun would that be? I bet a missile strike would work just fine as well.Anyway, absolutely spectacular filmmaking and storytelling, great emotional and character moments, but you've got to switch off your brain; you can only suspend your disbelief so far before it starts bothering you.Maybe I just think too much about movie logic, but this definitely dampened my enjoyment slightly.",

If you go to the cinema once in your life it should be for this movie.Just to make this perfectly clear for everybody: The plot is not about aviation. It's about teamwork in a competetive environment, heavily focussed on mind-over-matter. The planes are there for the drama and for the action, not for realism of any kind. This is not a documentary and it doesn't care about realism - which is a good thing, because the movie wouldn't be thrilling at all if that were the case.The mission is suicidal, the training illegal and the behaviour of Maverick would've caused him to be in prison or shot down by the military for not listening to anybody and violating basically all laws of aviation AND the navy. Nothing is correct concerning military regulations, piloting rules, aviation physics, weapon systems, you name it. And it doesn't matter at all.Fans will like the movie for the same reasons as the first one: Planes are beautiful and exciting and we all believe in Maverick, a Hotshot who breaks the rules (and laws of physics) to get the job done where nobody else can.That being said, even if you like your movies to be realstic, watch it anyways. The aviation scenes alone are worth the visit.As they said in the behind the scenes trailer: A movie like that has never been done and probably will never be done again.So take your chance and watch it now.

A drug epidemic, political turmoil, Russian aggression...are we talking about the 80's or today? Although the cinematic enemy goes nameless, this film feels like it is retelling a true story. Delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, its release seems to align with current affairs in a way that couldn't be more intentional, if not for the pure happenstance that pushed back the release.This film does not miss a beat. Literally from the word \"go\" you are thrust into a whimsical world of nostalgia competing for screen time against a modern day instant classic. This piece is a well calibrated dance that does not leave you feeling duped. It has all the hallmarks of past action films that we miss, such as cheesy humor, cocky characters, and the music that makes it all so beautifully palatable.From the title screen you're introduced to the aging Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell who looks phenomenal for his age. Wearing his archetypal outfit to include the white T shirt, denim jeans and that iconic bomber jacket. He unveils the classic Kawasaki bike and makes his way into work. It looks as if nothing has changed in 36 years!Maverick is now a test pilot for the US Navy. He wastes no time at all getting into trouble as he deliberately disobeys orders to remain grounded on a upcoming test flight. This series of events sees him reprimanded by his chain of command. As it all looks dim for Captain Mitchell, an unlikely set of orders saves him from UCMJ uncertainty. He gets word that in lieu of traditional punishment, he has instead been reassigned by orders from a specter of his past: Iceman, who is now an Admiral.Upon arrival to the Top Gun facilities Pete is greeted by a whirlwind of emotions. He walks into his own shadow; of the past he shared with his classmates, including his deceased friend Goose. Maverick now faces the prospect of teaching among many other pilots, Goose's son, Rooster. Old wounds, old flames, and old memories come together and pit Pete against his own wishes. With only a matter of weeks Maverick has to cultivate a team of top performing Top Gun grads into a well oiled strike force in order to eliminate a growing nuclear threat.The film is a corny 80s classic that so many of us love mixed with a well-shot modern masterpiece. It is full throttle fan service for the older crowd with callbacks and nods to the previous film, but it is also a great introduction for a new generation to cling to. You are given the same Maverick/Iceman type of rivalry, along with a feast of other young alphas who undertook the role with no doubt in mind what was being asked of them.Sequels have a reputation for not living up to their predecessors. Sometimes they're hyped up too much for the sake of ticket sales. From a fan of the original film, take it from me. This film might be better than the original. It closes chapters that you never felt were left open. It has a few good laughs, and honestly it almost made me cry. For every predictable thing that comes to be, there's another one that is unexpected. This film is an instant classic and should be viewed while it is still showing in theaters. I highly recommend watching it in IMAX or a Dolby Certified theater. It will be great on DVD/Blue Ray, but you'll never understand it the way it was meant to be unless you watch it in a theater!",

You can't recreate a classic. Even the special guest appearances from original cast were just lame and sad.

The sequel.It owes a lot to the first film borrowing much of the story line from the first and it mirrors the plot very closely. Negatives first...I think the film was 15-20 minutes too long. I think the story dragged a little after a brilliant opening 30 minutes. There was no explaination of who the enemy was. The fighter pilots in training failed the mission everytime but then suddenly found the ability to complete the mission in real time. A good old fashioned montage would have been nice here. They re-used some of the one liners from the old movie which is nice but could have come up with new idea's. There was the odd chuckle in the movie which went down well but could have done with a few more.Onto the positives...The scenes with the jet are just incredbile. They certainly rival the first movie and better them with today's camera technology. The romantic scenes mirror a similar pattern to the first movie which are sweet. The nostalgia to the first movie brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions. The way they opened the movie paying homage to the first movie gave me tingles and throughout the movie I had goosebumps as it flashed back to the original movie.On the whole, it's a reason to go back to the cinema in years. After a long period of rubbish sequels, superhero movies, CGI movies and dreadful idea's, this is a properly old fashioned action movie. It's predictale, explosive and a beautiful way to lose your self for 2 hours or more.I think this films owes a lot to the first but they've done an excellent job. Would I re-watch this again? Probably once yes, but after watching this it made me want to re-watch the first Top Gun over and over again.As I said in the title, I think this is a love letter to the first movie and aviation. I only hope other film makers take note from the success of this film and keep it up.",

When I watched the movie in the cinema, I was truly amazed by it, even if I don't like watching a lot of Military-related movies, I wasn't bored. In the movie are a lot of explosions, romance scenes & airplanes. Rarely do you see sequels that beat the originals, but this one is much better than the first. The budget for the movie was $170 Million, which is kinda low for a Military movie, but still, there are a lot of great scenes. The British Aerospace Harrier II (British fighter jet) from the movie is flown by the actors in real life. The filmmakers did an amazing job with the Military costumes. Tom Cruise made $100 Million from the movie, only 1% of the movie's total Box Office. The film began production in May 2018, and this is why the sequel to the original was 36 years long. My opinion is that \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the best Military movie of this decade because the movie had the heart in the story. If you want to watch this movie with your family for a night, it's a great choice.",

It does pay homage to the original but I would've liked to have seen it do that in the beginning and then try to stand on its own feet. I actually started to fall asleep during the middle act, it slows down HARD. It is well done though it's not bad, they do a bit of character building and rapport between connelly and cruise but then picks it back up again for the final act. IMHO the first and last are a decent 8 but the middle act dragged so much it really could've used some editing room chopping.... how did maverick even.....in the opening.....15 minutes?

            "content": "Thirty-six years ago the original 'Top Gun' (1986) made Tom Cruise a star. Here we are 36 years later, and 'Top Gun: Maverick' becomes his best-performing movie of all time. Against all odds, it was able to steal the best memorial weekend opening from 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End' with $5M more. Once again Cruise is Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick and it's as if he had never left.Now I was expecting a solid flick, but the sequel has exceeded all my expectations. I was left speechless. The callbacks to the original movie were expertly crafted from all the characters, dialogue, and even simple gestures. Do not even get me started on the soundtrack. The opening number with Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins was a MUST and a perfect intro as it was before. The casting was very well done. Miles Teller AKA Rooster playing Goose's son was spot on. Seeing the famous Penny Benjamin in the flesh was also great, played by Jennifer Connelly. I absolutely loved how they carried on Iceman and made it so Val Kilmer could have his moment.I was very impressed with novice director Joseph Kosinski. He did outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full-length feature film (most notably TRON: Legacy). Finally, I must give kudos to all the stunts and visuals as they were breathtaking. The camera work is perfect. They somehow fit multiple IMAX cameras into the jet, so that you will feel you're in the cockpit. This took a lot of dedication from both Cruise and the cast as they went through extensive and arduous training. Remember this going into the film. Also, be sure you watch the original before.The story is superb, as Maverick struggle to balance his own unresolved issues and coach the new Top Gun pilots with an impossible mission. The plot is very high stakes and will leave you with goosebumps. 'Top Gun: Maverick' is technical, visceral, and thrilling to its core. It has you on the edge of your seat all while being invested in the lives and emotions of those risking their lives when duty is called. It will take you on the highway to the DANGER ZONE.",

            "content": "One of the top reviews here explains it all; this movie was made to cater to the generation that was still young when the first one released. Now, for others than that age group, the movie might be a bit underwhelming.This review will contain slight spoilers, probably nothing you couldn't figure out if you know what this movie is about.First of all, I would like to say that the movie is probably more like a 7 out of 10, and the 6 stars represent my (lack of) enjoyment while watching it. However, I don't believe that this film was smarter, wilder, or more surprising than most of today's action movies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because it is a \"good average\" movie, but unless you have some sort of attachment to the first film, you might forget this sooner than the latest Marvel movie.What's good, is that they took extra care when it came to the action scenes, which is welcome, since this is first and foremost an action movie. Everything is much better in this regard, than in the first film: better cinematography, more interesting situations, enhanced visuals, easy-to-follow action, and more entertaining character interactions. This stuff is truly great in this movie, hence the 7 stars.Sadly, it loses 1 star for me, because for an action movie, it tries to portray some real drama, and gets involved in character arcs that take you out of the movie, essentially worsening the experience. Also, I'm not trying to say that only one movie can have a scene like this, but they could have come up with something better than to have the most crucial moment of the impossible mission be shooting rockets into a small opening.Aside from the main mission being very vague and so clich\u00e9 and unimportant, that not even the creators cared to put effort into its background (for example, we only get a few throwaway lines about why this is all happening, which deflates the importance of the supposedly very important mission - just because you say I should care, I will not necessarily do that), the movie is lacking in several other details. One such thing can be the dialogue, that is sometimes better than in the original, but at other times it returns to being way too sentimental, or straight up dumb. Most of these are lines you have heard a million times in mostly American movies, that try to pull your heartstrings with sentences like: \"It's time to let it go.\", or the movies most repeated and possibly silliest message: \"Don't think.\" I understand, what these sentences mean, but if you are trying to tell someone that they are stuck in the past, or that they need to experience the \"flow\", then maybe don't do tell them in the most clich\u00e9d and vaguest way, especially if this is all happening in a movie. These interactions really got me less attached to the story and characters; they were so unrealistic, that my suspension of disbelief was practically gone.The movie also has a lot of \"fakeouts\", which are just annoying after a point, and make you not care for the characters for even a second, because you know they will survive somehow. Oh my God, he fainted, he will crash into the ground! Nope, he woke up. Oh my God, they shot Tom Cruise, he crashed and died! Nope, he's fine. Oh my God, he's being shot at by a helicopter and his team got orders to not rescue him! Nope, a rocket destroys the helicopter, and oh, a friend crashes too!... but of course survives. And this is not even all of these kind of scenes, which felt very stale after a while. I know that most of these make sense because of the characters/character arcs, but I still feel like the movie is taking the viewers for idiots (especially with these messages). So, in the end, pretty much everything turns out as you think it would, and I'm not sure this is worth two hours of anyone's life.There you have it: probably one of the most negative reviews written about this film. Again, the movie has its moments, and the action is good, well-shot and exciting (except for the many-many fake deaths), so on a lazy sunday afternoon, it might be worth a watch. For me though, the mishandled dialogue, the over-the-top messages, the mostly shallow characters and the drama for the sake of drama (thinking of you here, Ice) ultimately dragged down this okay, very predictable action movie. Unless you're a fan of the first one, I don't think you will enjoy this movie more than your average Mission Impossible, especially since there is almost nothing, that's really clever about it. I know a lot of people will not like this review, but this is how I saw the movie raw, without any nostalgia-glasses applied, comparing it to modern day action cinema. And while it didn't exactly fail that category, it certainly didn't surpass an average action movie in any aspect.",

            "review_title": "A Top Gun movie with a plot, thicker than the original, but still lacking in places",
            "content": "I just got home after watching the movie in the theater on ScreenX, and while it certainly has its moments and delivers more than a few thrills, I think it was missing something, or rather, it left something on the table, the potential for a truly great movie. In my opinion, Top Gun: Maverick was good, a bit above average, a solid 7.5, maybe even pushing an 8.0 out of 10, but that's mainly because of the visuals and action sequences, and I just think it could have been better in many areas, including the action sequences. I cannot understand how this has an 8.6 rating here, probably too many people lost in the spectacle and not thinking enough.I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I think it needed a bit more of everything, a deeper core, that means more heart/soul. I know there was definitely something there, I'm not saying otherwise, but it could have gone just a bit deeper to make us feel a bit more. To me, the emotions never culminated, they never went all the way, the movie never took us all the way, and because of that, it just felt hollow or something, unsatisfying, at least for me.And the same goes for the plot, it could have been just a bit more complex to give us a slightly fuller movie instead of the rather linear one-dimensional story we got. Yeah, we got the character conflicts, some motivated by the backstory from the original movie, and of course, that colors the story and gives it context, but ultimately, this movie really goes pretty straight from A to B. There may have been a few pauses along the way, but no real detours, and it's the detours and meandering, when done well, not aimlessly wandering to find dead ends, that make a story more complex.When I was thinking about how to review this, the first thing I wanted to say was this is really Mission Impossible 6(and yeah, I know it's coming out next year, I saw the trailer during the 20 minutes of previews before the movie, ugh....), but now that I've started writing, I realize it's not sophisticated enough to be called that because this was aerial acrobatics driven by a somewhat thin story line, though certainly greater than the original movie, it's still pretty superficial, with some soulful nostalgia mixed in, nothing more, nothing less.Lastly, in regard to missed opportunity, and I don't understand why this most fundamental thing is absent from so many action movies, and that's the action climax, in this case, a true all-out battle. I wanted epic dogfight scenes, Star Wars with fighter jets if you will, but while we got a few nice set pieces, they could have taken it to the limit and pushed it over the top, mainly by using more planes, but they didn't. I don't know, maybe there are regulations on what can be done that prohibit such scenes, there probably are, but I wanted \"controlled chaos,\" well, more controlled chaos; more, more, more. I mean, I feel the need, the need, for speed, taking me on the Highway to the Danger Zone; I didn't quite get it.But I suppose my biggest issue was, and yes, I know it's a movie, but I didn't really find it very believable. I get that it's Tom Cruise as Maverick, and he's a legend, in the movie and in real life, but what he does in this movie strains credulity just a bit too much for me. I'm not saying you can't do it when you're old, but I think it's hard to do the impossible when you're old and out of practice, no matter how naturally talented someone is.I guess I should mention somewhere here that I am not a fan of the original movie, mainly because it didn't have much of a plot/story(in one professional critic's review I read, they said it's more like a Navy recruitment ad than a movie), something which was definitely remedied here, well, let's say improved upon(there is a story, though it's pretty basic), but this was very reminiscent of the first movie, mostly in good ways actually, but personally, I found Top Gun: Maverick rather predictable, not that that's bad, it was just pretty clear where it would go, which it did. Also, I didn't feel much of a sense of suspense or fear, nowhere did I really believe any of the characters were in real danger.I guess my first thought when I left the theater was that it was a good movie for the first part, I don't know, let's say up to the halfway mark, then... and I don't know why, I wouldn't say it lost its way or went off the rails or anything like that, this wasn't Baby Driver, but, I'll just say again that I thought it was missing something, something which could have made it a truly great film, not just a good film.",

The beautiful people do amazing things with tax payer money. But the action works with the story so well that you won't mind at all. I am a fan, but the film has its problems too. We don't learn enough about Maverick's backstory but that's Tom Cruise. The fights with the 5th gen fighters were not realistic, but the hero had to be a hero. In reality, Maverick would not even see them coming. In the end, your heart will pound and you will have fun.",

But from my humble perspective ....TOP FUN!Yes, there will be some who pick out some holes in the events, an element of predictability and the usual cliches ....but actually to use an American cliche - this film is still AWESOME!At an easy to watch 12A, it makes it a great family film if you want to get to spend time with your teenagers, that will even get everyone talking afterwards. Even younger kids will absolutely love it ....and will dream about being a fighter pilot for years to come! Obviously, also get ready for the calls (not just from the youngsters!) for a decent cool pair of shades this summer, but like with the original, that fashion will be back and at least there will be good wear from them ....just like this film (as with its predecessor) will also wear well, stay iconic and, again, will be talked about for years to come too.Look past some of the very minor shortcomings and the expected, unsurprising jingoism and just go and enjoy \"the ride\"! Guaranteed smiles, laugh out louds and possible tears but just as important breathtaking action, action and action!Easily worth the price of the cinema ticket, even for the family, as it will be a classic memory for you all ....it just depends on how many times you go because you WILL be tempted to go again! And if you can see it at an IMAX or 4DX it's definitely one of the few films that's worth it!So if you're into your blockbusters, this is definitely a genuine one that you can buckle up and enjoy. \"Don't think - just do!\" ....and you won't regret it!!!",

It is far too common that Sequels for Standalone films are produced purely for 'nostalgia money' but Top Gun: Maverick is an anomaly of modern-age filmmaking. My respect for the cast and crew was further enhanced by the knowledge that they used practical effects and put the actors in actual Military-grade fighter aircraft. Too often are films quickly made and rushed with the use of CGI and it is incredibly refreshing to see a movie created with sheer passion and commitment to creating this sequel. I was not born to witness the original, but my Mother and her Friend's enjoyment in the cinema proved to me that this movie whilst bringing a new plot, could also pay homage to the feeling of the original.The story is told in a manner that is neither boring nor underplayed, and the return of iconic actors in a realistic way further enhances the respect given to the original. Although there are elements of the plot that are bland, the feeling of the movie suits the narrative. The actors all deserve huge credit, not only for their performance but also for their dedication with flight-training to partake in their roles to the best of their capabilities.This is a great movie in a time of over-saturation and CGI, I am so refreshed to see a movie that does not rely on the use of CGI and soulless storytelling, more like this, please.",

Again, it's a good movie, but if you have this movie rated as an 8 or above, I'm guessing you haven't seen a great movie in a while. I like Tom Cruise and Miles Teller, but the rest of the characters are pretty boring (I.e. Stereotypical military servicemen and women with one nerdy guy to spice things up). The movie is basically one giant promo for the US Navy (I'm sure they invested some pocket change to make this film). I will admit the flight scenes are amazing. But as movies from the past will tell us, just because a movie has a large budget with state-of-the-art technology, doesn't automatically make it a great movie. Some great movies were made on a budget a fraction the size of this film. I think people are a little too nostalgia-crazy for Top Gun that they are blinded from seeing the faults in this movie.",

At the same time, none of the scenes feel forces or unnecessary, you always feel like you're in the middle of the story, you just don't wanna look away or you'll miss it.I give it a 10/10, no an 11/10, this is a must see for this year and this decade and hopefully for a lot longer!",

Only two issues for me.First, I couldn't figure out how Maverick and Penny knew each other. I now know, after watching several 'behind the scenes' YouTube videos today.Second (and this could be considered a spoiler), I was frustrated by the Tomahawk missiles being sent too soon, alerting the enemy. It did succeed in increasing the tension, tho, so perhaps, from a movie making/watching perspective, that was the point. From a military perspective, it was not well planned ... IMHO.

The script is inane at times just awful. But the actual plot of the attack is basically the same as the original Star Wars attack on the Death Star. Travel along a deep trench with enemy defences in turreted batteries defending it, then drop your bomb down a very tiny hole in an almost impossible way and wait for it to explode. If a voice had said 'he's switched off his targeting computer' and 'Maverick, use the force' it would have completed the ludicrous plot steal and made me laugh, but it didn't because it was pathetic.Then steal an enemy F-14 to escape?Trying to pretend the target wasn't Iran was also too much of a stretch. Other than the flying that's the trouble with this film. It simply takes credibility and shoved it down the toilet.

            "content": "\"That was not going to happen ever. That was never going to happen,\" Tom Cruise replied when asked about releasing this long-awaited sequel onto streaming services.And Tom is absolutely right about this.I had the wonderful privilege to attend a special screening of this film before worldwide release. Top gun: Maverick showed what a great sequel should be: Perfecting what was not enough in the previous serial films while retaining the best elements of the previous works. I wasn't born yet when the first Top Gun movie was released, and it was until about three years ago that I watched it for the first time. While enjoying the action sequences and loving the original soundtrack, I wasn't really fond of the storytelling of the first Top Gun movie. However, Top gun: Maverick ingeniously weaved the plot of the first film into its own story and the storytelling was much better paced than the first one. What this film told also really deepened the depth of the whole story, and I'm sure people familiar with the first movie would no doubt be moved by many sequences in this. Moving on to the real draw of this film - action sequences, Tom cruise, other fellow actors / actresses, and the crews really challenged what seems unachievable in filmmaking. Thanks to the technology nowadays, the action sequences are not just better than those in the first film, but also some of the best ones I've ever seen. 100% deserved to be witnessed in the best cinemas such as IMAX. The soundtrack by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady GaGa, Hans Zimmer, and Lorne Balfe is really good as well. I won't say it is better than the 1986 soundtrack considering the legacy of the latter, but this new soundtrack really did its job excellently. Some emotional parts in this reminded me a bit of the tracks in 007: No Time To Die last year, maybe due to involvement of Zimmer, though.This movie is not just one of the career highlights for Tom Cruise, but also at least one of the top sequel movies this century so far. You won't miss much if you just see this sequel directly without knowing what was going on in the first Top Gun movie because this sequel would tell the essential plots of it. However, it definitely brings lots of surprise (and tears of joy) to fans of the first film.",

I KIND OF FELL IN LOVE WITH IT THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT... I'VE SEEN IT NOW 30 TIMES OVER WITHIN THE PAST 3 MONTHS... SO AFTER WATCHING IT SO MANY TIMES THAT 1986 MOVIE I STILL THINK THAT MOVIE IS OVERALL THE BETTER MOVIE OUT OF THE TWO BECAUSE OF VAL KILMER... HE WAS THE SECOND MAIN CHARACTER PLAYING ALONGSIDE TOM CRUISE IN 1986 TOP GUN WHICH IN THE SEQUEL MOVIE ICEMAN VAL KILMER WAS ONLY IN IT FOR ROUGHLY 10 MINUTES... VERY SAD AND DISAPPOINTING... THE REASON WHY VAL KILMER ICEMAN ONLY HAD A 10-MINUTE PART IN MAVERICK THE SECOND MOVIE IS BECAUSE HE WAS GOING THROUGH A SERIOUS CONDITION WITH THROAT CANCER..... SO HIS CHARACTER HAD MANY DIFFERENCES BUT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY ICEMAN ONLY HAD A 10-MINUTE.. BUT STILL NICE OF THE DIRECTOR AND PRODUCERS TO BRING BACK ICEMAN VAL KILMER BACK IN THIS PHENOMENAL ACTION-PACKED SEQUEL TOP GUN...I'M TRYING NOT TO SPOIL THIS MOVIE FOR YOU BUT THE SEQUEL DOES HAVE MORE ACTION THAN THE ORIGINAL.... IT HAS MORE CHEMISTRY WITH THE CHARACTERS.. YOU ALSO GET TO SEE GOOSE IN FLASHBACK SCENES... YOU ALSO GET TO SEE GOOSE'S SON WHICH FOLLOWS IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS BECOMING AN AVIATOR PILOT ETC.... ALSO THE SEQUEL TO TOP GUN IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONGER OF A FILM AND YOU GET TO SEE MORE DIRECT TEAMWORK AND THEM TEYINF TO WORK TOGETHER... TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WHILE FLYING THOSE F-35S OR F14 PLANES WHICH COMPARING IT TOO THE ORIGINAL 1986 TOP GUN IT JUST SHOWS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AFTER DECADES HOW TOP GUN MOVES FOWARD AWAY FROM THW 1986 MOVIE... YOU GET MORE SCREEN TIME WOTH OTHER ACTERS IN FILM AND NOT JUST ON TOM CRUISE MAVERICK...I DO MISS MAVERICK KISSING AND HAVING SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME KELLY MCGILLIS IN 1986 TOP GUN AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY I GAVE THIS MOVIE THE SEQUEL LOWER RATINGS THAN THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE KELLY MCGILLIS DID NOT PLAY IN THE NEW SEQUEL WHICH KIND OF MADE ME ANGRY.. IT KIND OF MADE ME DISAPPOINTED.....BUT OVERALL I'M NOT SAYING THE SEQUEL IS BAD AT ALL.... IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE... I'VE SEEN IT THREE TIMES NOW ON A STREAMING SERVICE APP THAT I FOUND.. IT'S A VERY GOOD MOVIE... THERE WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE ANOTHER MOVIE LIKE TOP GUN OR TOP GUN MAVERICK.. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO REALLY SAY ABOUT TOP GUN MAVERICK EXCEPT IT HAS A LOT BETTER ACTION SCENES MORE EXPLOSIONS A FEW CLIFFHANGERS AND IT BASICALLY GIVES YOU A FULL-BLOWN 100% EXPERIENCE THAT MAKES YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEATS WHEN YOU SEE THESE ACTORS IN THE PLAINS DOING WHAT THEY KNOW BEST AND THAT'S BEING AVIATORS AND ALSO KNOWING HOW TO SURVIVE AND HOW TO WIN AGAINST FIGHTS AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES IN THE AIR AND LOTS MORE!!!!!SO TO END THIS REVIEW OFF... I THINK 6-7 STARS OUT OF 10 IS REALLY GOOD... I JUST THINK THE ORIGINAL 1986 TOP GUN MOVIE COMING FROM MY OPINION AND MY EXPERIENCE GROWING UP AS A KID IN THAT GENERATION STILL LOVING THE ORIGINAL TOP GUN FILM.. I JUST DON'T THINK THIS NEW MOVIE SEQUEL WILL BE AS GOOD BECAUSE OF THE LACK MISSING OF VAL KILMER ICEMAN.. BUT ALSO THE CHARACTERS WE GET DONT OFFER ANY LOVE SCENES LIKE THE ORIGINAL WITH KELLY MCGILLIS AND MAVERICK... THEN YOU HAD ICEMAN VERSUS MAVERICK IN A FEW SCENES ALMOST STATING TO FIGHT EACH OTHER. YOU DONT GET THAT IN NEW FILM.... THOSE SCENES YOU DON'T GET THAT IN THIS NEW MOVIE... THE ORIGINAL TOP GUN 1986 I WOULD GIVE THAT AT LEAST 8 STARS OUT OF 10 EASY..... HOPEFULLY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM THE ORIGINAL 1986 TOP GUN MANY YEARS AGO DECADES AGO WAS BASICALLY MORE SIMPLE IT WAS MORE ON THE MAIN 3 CHARACTERS OF MAVERICK ICEMAN AND KELLY MCGILLIS INSTEAD OF EXPLORING OTHER CHARACTERS WHICH IS WHAT MADE THAT MOVIE BETTER IN MY OPINION IN 1986...BUT THAT'S ALL I GOT... HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE THIS REVIEW... I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU GUY.. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL EVERYTHING... YES THIS NEW TOP GUN SEQUEL CALLED MAVERICK IS WORTH WATCHING... IT HAS A LOT OF ACTION SCENES WHICH THE ORIGINAL DID VERY LITTLE WITH...SO I THINK THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW EXPECTATIONS BUT DON'T FORGET FROM MY STANDPOINT THE ORIGINAL WAS BETTER CUZ IT HAD THE LOVE SCENES IT HAD THE ICEMAN VERSUS MAVERICK AND LOTS MORE... THE ORIGINAL WILL STAY THE BEST IN MY BOOK GOING FORWARD UNLESS THEY MAKE TOP GUN 3 IN 15 OR 30 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN BUT IF IT DOES.... IT DOES.....

The story of Rooster (son of goose) is crap, Jennifer Conoly and her daughter is so forced ocz we here her name in the previous movie I guess. The movie shows no regard for Navy-Army rules, basic reasoning and character development just like the first time where Admiral are treated like school principals, you can disobey any orders you feel, most threating cover op is run by bunch of weird pilots who have limited stuff when they can actually bomb the whole facility instead of pin point shooting from 30 ft, plus there is no consequence of this action ever discussed.I have no idea why this movie is rated over 8.5 in IMDb by 3,00,000 people.",

There were also too many throwbacks in my opinion, few less would still send a message to the fans of the original and they wouldn't be so in your face.That being said, the movie is a good piece of action flick, it has this 80s feel and it doesn't really try to be something that it isn't. Good acting by Cruise and pretty thrilling fight and flight scenes. I saw it in IMAX and I would argue seeing it in a cinema makes a difference. The plot is thin, but it doesn't matter. I liked it.",

And the mission itself was clearly stolen right out of Star wars. Even destroying the target by way of bombing of a ventilation port! 3 meters? Wasn't the exhaust port 2 m in Star Wars? And the whole idea of flying down the canyon, like what else could you think of? And I suppose they stole that idea out of Independence Day with Will Smith and that Canyon scene. However I guess you can't have just another dog fight as in the first top gun movie. All the flight scenes were superb! However, if I seem divided...I AM !",

Yes there were some implausible moments, but they weren't going for an Oscar, they were trying to entertain.My only complaint is that they actually spent too much time on Maverick. I think if they took 5 minutes away from Maverick's love life and used that to focus on the students and given Mav and Rooster a 1 on 1 scene to sort out the past, this could have created a better setup for the ending and got a 10 star for me.",

The sales are likely due to this: people crave movies that entertain more than attempt to deliver a political or social message.Good performances, good story. Greatest movie ever? No, yet very entertaining and good. Well worth the watch. I checked on IMDB for the first Top Gun rating. As of writing this it is at 6.9. This is a great follow up. It's a must see for fans of the first. This one picks up well from the last. Though the first was better, so I'm going with a 6 rating here. Compared to other movies coming out lately though, it's much better than most.Nice to see:Cruise still delivers. Either the guy doesn't age or they have the best in the business making him look good.Great story arc with Goose's son and Cruise.Seeing Val Kilmer in the movie despite his current personal struggles honored the part he played in the last film as well as his career.Flaws:They could have easily trimmed 20-30 minutes off without story loss.Who was Jennifer Connelly's character? Was she even in the first one? Didn't he end up with the blonde? No discredit to Connelly as an actor, though something about her gives me a negative bias. Maybe she played an evil character in a movie and that stuck with me. Her acting was and is fine. Didn't understand her part and not much chemistry with Cruise. Felt like I was missing something here.I felt no immediate threat. What was this box they are trying to blow up? Who exactly is the enemy? Don't we have other tech that can get the job done? Drone strike? Missile barrage? Something? Why do we need these pilots to fly this crazy course? Maybe they answered this and I missed it.

Good cast, though, and very credible resemblance between 'Goose' and his son 'Rooster'. Credible performances by everyone.

I was dragged to this last night and kind of liked it. Cruise's cocky Maverick has been humbled over the decades which made him different. It was great to see Val Kilmer and recognizing his current health conditions, it was utilized in this portrayal. It was poignant.Okay, did anyone else see the similarities to Star Wars Episode IV? The mission was right out of the Death Star attack. The trench run and the target being only a few meters. The widened mentor who served with the dead father of the son who now needs to be trained and has some issues to overcome. The words of wisdom from the mentor that you think too much about it, just go with your feelings (Use the force Luke).",

I have no idea who they were that time until Betamax player came, then VHS player, VCD/DVD player. My uncle buys a copy of Top Gun each and every time a new vcr system for home entertainment comes out in the market. That's how much he loves Top Gun- that I understood! It was really cool to watch it with the whole fam!And now that I've seen the sequel after decades! It didn't disappoint me, my husband and my mom. It even exceeded our expectations! This movie is truly spectacular! Loved the story, there was enough flash backs to understand what is happening now. The special effects! No CGI! Actors where all inside the cockpit of a flying F18. Even the scene with the old F14 was rad too! This is the highest level of effort and dedication! Made me really happy. How I wished my uncle's still here with us. He would have cried, he surely would have love this movie.So thank you Paramount and to all the producers of of Top Gun Maverick. You're all awesome! You all gave my uncle's favourite movie a beautiful ending that it deserves and you brought back one of my amazing childhood memories.",

Which may or may not have helped given the unfortunately demise of Anthony Edwards' character yet AGAIN.. but now at last, I'm equipped to deal with it and move on. Cue the arrival of Rooster, Goose's Naval aviator offspring who fits the bill in every way.Too Gun: Maverick surpasses all my greatest expectations in every way and made a mockery of the little nagging worry I had that a sequel could never live up to what so many of us wanted - needed! - it to be. But seriously - they've smashed it. Tom Cruise is on absolute top form as the remarkably well preserved - not a grey hair in sight - mature Maverick. The story line is brilliant.. it does a whole lot more than nod to the original but doesn't it without being cheesy.We get to explore our unresolved teenage angst about Goose because he manages to Be There in every part of the film - it's as much about him as is it Maverick and yet his son is a whole new character who is exactly who we need him to be. His ability to be a totally believable son-of-Goose is testament not so much to clever casting (it is clever for sure; there's some definitely facial similarities) or the carefully placed if somewhat, slightly unfashionable moustache, but rather to the talent of the actor who carries it off fantastically. Those were some tough boots to fill!I'll let others with far better technical knowledge them me wax lyrical about the breathtaking fighter jet scenes.. of which there are many. They are deserving of every compliment. The soundtrack rocks .. there's romance.. and there's even a purely gratuitous beach football scene featuring oiled male biceps for us all to enjoy. It honestly has everything. Go see it. It rocks.",

Where was Charlie and why didn't she make the cut. She is a fine actor and the continuity of the storyline should have had her in it.

            "content": "I went into this movie with more wide-eyed optimism than anything I've gone into in the past twenty years, but I was bitterly disappointed. I'm sure I won't be able to sufficiently explain why, but I'll try none the less...People are so starved for good content in movies and television, that anything that even resembles \"good\", is praised. I'm not saying that it shouldn't be, with the trash we're subjected to now. I'm just saying that the bar has been lowered to such an extent, that this sub-par crap is all we have to look forward to anymore. And, it's a sad state of affairs to be sure.In '77 Star Wars changed everything we knew. In '86 Top Gun did it again. If you didn't live through those times, you'll unfortunately never know how impactful those films were and how over time, every action movie that Hollywood has produced since then, has been slightly more watered down and gentrified than the ones that came before them. Until, at the end, it all just becomes what we have now. Movies with no soul.As much as I love what Tom Cruise is doing and tried to do with Maverick, it still lacks the gravitas of the original Top Gun. It's hard to explain the differences between the two films, but if you've watched the first Top Gun, maybe you can grasp what I'm getting at. Top Gun, other than the horrible casting of Kelly McGillis (who looked like Tom Cruise's mom), was spot on for the time. The way that Tony Scott and all involved, did their research, got real fighter pilots to coach them and nailed the fighter pilot lingo - that's what made it work so well. An example from the opening scene...\n________________Flight OP: \"Ghost Rider this is Strike. We have unknown aircraft, inbound Mustang. Your vector is 090 for bogey.\"Mav: \"Talk to me Goose.\"Goose: \"Roger, I've got 'em, 20 left, 30 miles, 900 knots closure.\"Cougar: \"Mustang, Mustang, this is Ghost Rider 203, I've got an inbound bogey, heading 270, at 10 miles, 900 knots closure.\"Flight OP: \"Ghost Rider, take Angels 10 left, 30... (cut off)\"Cougar: \"Merlin, see if he's a single.\"Merlin: \"Goose, you see a trailer?\"Goose: \"Negative Merlin. Looks like he's a single.\"Mav: \"Uhh, Cougar, I'm gonna go head to head with him.\"Cougar: \"Take it easy Maverick, I don't like this ####. I'm gonna break high and right - see if he's really alone.\"\n___________________This is true fighter pilot lingo, or at least the best that Hollywood can do. We heard none of this in Top Gun Maverick. It was all just pretend crap with no substance and no accuracy to the true realm of fighter pilots. The original Top Gun had a base in actual military operations and that's what made it so compelling.Cheers, Sev.",

            "content": "This film succeeded with its impressive practical effects and very well-achieved aerial stunts. The predictable plot offers little in the way of surprise in the end. The new characters are one-dimensional generic types and provide little cause to care about them. Tom Cruise's performance is charming and is easily the best human element in the film.So much of the runtime re-hashes or reinvents familiarly favorite scenes from the original film (shirtless, sandy, athletic montage; \"Great Balls of Fire\" at the piano in sunglasses; Maverick on a motorcycle chasing a jet along the runway; surprised reactions to learning your Top Gun instructor was the person you met a bar the night before, etc.), that there is too little plot remaining to justify this film as a sequel rather than a remake. I would rather watch the original film for those scenes as that film had real charm. Additionally, the forced love interest with the ever-pleasant Jennifer Connelly character does not work well to advance the larger plot, and only adds to the run time. Tom Cruise has an urgent mission to save the world, but he has time in the evenings to rehash an old flame we know of only by a throwaway line in the original film? I don't buy it.It was nice to see in this Top Gun film more attention paid to enemy combatants instead of the pure training as in the original film. This was a nice concept which suffered in the end. The main difficulty with the plot is this film wants us to believe the bad guys are hidden in the mountains somewhere and only low-flying crackerjack pilots can save the day. (Flying in fast and low under a time crunch to strike an impracticably minuscule target while dodging overwhelming aerial defenses is the Death Star attack all over again...but without Porkins).And who are the bad guys? Considering the amount of attention they receive in this film, the main villains are the three Rear Admirals. There is no subtlety with these characters as they are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians. The only Admiral not a jerk is Iceman. The \"real\" enemy feels like an afterthought. Sure, the bulk of the film after the first 30 minutes serves to train to fight these unseen foes, but we only get to real action with the baddies in the last 20 minutes of run time. The rest of the time the Admirals create the conflict and tension with Maverick, and it never makes sense why they should care so much. And so I can't care so much.",

Disgusted to see Kelly Mcgillis and Meg Ryan cut from film only to be replaced with another heavily hair dyed and makeuped Jennifer Connelly? Yes, we get it Mr Hollywood Producer, ones to heavy for you and one hasn't had good luck with plastic. Try doing a movie based on stripped down actual characters and what they should look like 30 years later. I'm sure their acting would speak for itself. Hell... why use Val Kilmer. He looked old enough to be your father with only 3 years of age difference. Val has had plenty of hardships over the years, but he wears it well. Oh wait, ya'll had to kill him off too after his brief debut. Watching Maverick smooching up with Jennifer Connelly looked sooo wrong. How stereotypical, and perfect and sexy everyone had to look the parts. Do we even offer good movies and storyline anymore? Or have we evolved into a society which has become so engrossed in shallowness that we dont care if we spend money on crap that will hit a regular TV channel fast. BTW this is not the real Navy.

When watching on 4K bluray I was impressed by only one thing, the amazing low altitude flying in F18 Hornet by Tom Cruise. This was also the only good about the film and the rest felt cliche, predicable and the flashbacks to the first movie felt forced. It did not have anything adding to the story with the copy of \"Great balls of fire\" singing and beach volleyball playing other than showing some flashbacks to Goose which you get anyway from time to time. The love story felt thin without any tension and the \"Iceman\" scenes where dull and boring. Then when the mission starts it starts to be very unrealistic. One single aircraft carrier without supporting fleet is sent to a noname \"terrorist state\" to attack a nuclear storage in the mountains. Nearby there is an airfield with some Russian/China looking 5th generation fighters mixed with some old F14 Tomcats. Why any terrorist state would have that strange fleet of aircrafts flying is beyond understanding. If it were old MIG-29 it would have made more sense but the F14's where thrown in only so that Tom Cruise could capture and fly one of them. The entire film is focused on Tom Cruise and 90% of the story is made up only so he can show flying skills and some acting. The rest of the actors are forgettable without any remembering one-liners or acting that was the joy of the first Top Gun movie. Even the music is best when the old songs are played. Hans Zimmer does some good synth programming which sounds like outtakes from Inception or The Rock. If you like to see Tom Cruise flying F18, F14, P-51 Mustang and riding Kawasaki GPZ and Ninja motorcycle this movie is great but it does not hold for an over 2 hour long movie.",

In a era where most movies are average at best this was a bright light and stands out, but it doesn't really warrant its IMDB 8.6/10 score but its definitely a solid 6/10 (Above average).",

Me again..So after loosing Dad to his crash and missing a lot of things since, today, I put on my flight jacket and snuck Dads ashes into the Cinema with me so we could watch TOP GUN MAVERICK together. We were both so so keen to see it when it was announced in 2019, Alas Covid... and Loosing Dad. BUT it was well worth the wait..Mavericks was everything I wanted it to be, and Everything I needed it to be. If you haven't seen it yet, do it. If you have, and you have seen my posts about loosing Dad, You will know all the moments I cried, laughed and jumped out my seat and cheered like a idiot.. in the middle of a packed! Cinema.It was truly what I needed... Weird how today was also the 2year anniversary since I last saw Dad in person at the WA boarder.We met up to give him the Dragonfly Viking we built and he could finish it in quarantine for us to fly. Still shattered that he will never get to be my wingman, but its interesting how I ask for his help often like \"Talk to me Dad\"...\nAnyway. Safe flying aviators \ud83d\ude42P. S. If Anyone knows how to or has contacts of contacts to get this message to Tom Cruise. I want to say thank you too him. I didn't know needed this movie. Even without all the emotion I have, best action movie ever! \ud83d\ude42\n----------------------------------------------------",

He's matured but has not lost that rebellious, give authority \"the bird\" streak which earned him the Maverick moniker.In some ways, the human actors play second fiddle to the planes and there are some simply stunning live action flight sequences.

It takes everything what we liked about the first movie and combines it with a modern setting and filming technology. The action scenes are superb and you never have seen such immersion in a movie. They take you right into the cockpit and it's just a bliss to look at and displays even more than the first movie, how amazing these people are who fly those jets and what it takes to do so. The great lack of CGi (it's still in there) is very welcoming, as most movies rely only on that today. It takes you back to old action movies and how these were done. You notice immediately it's real action and you also see how better real action is to look at. Beside that, not much needs to be said about the other stuff, as it's just like the old movie, only that time passed. It's basically what Star Wars 7 and Matrix 4 did, but way better. It's not even a bad thing it being almost a 1:1 copy, as it just takes the old formula to another level and slightly mixes it up a little. I liked all the references to the old movie and all the cheesiness. It's just what makes Top Gun be so fun and good. Fast machines, macho behavior, flight training, beach fanservice, flight action and so on. Things I definitely wanted to see as a fan and I didn't get disappointed at all. It definitely takes you back to the old days but let's you stay in todays time without feeling bad or disappointed like other movies did. Even without being a fan, it's well worth a watch as the action scenes alone make it so worth it. Absolute recommendation for any action fan. Tom did go to unbelievable lengths yet again. If you thought Mission Impossible Fallout was already amazing with it's action scenes then Maverick is even more amazing.",

All of which I'd say are a requirement for any Top Gun sequel.I found it to be a refreshing blockbuster that's not based off of comic book source material. Though, the title character Maverick is essentially Captain America in a fighter jet.It's impossible to discuss this movie without touching on Tom Cruise. Love him or hate him, you will be hard pressed to name a more iconic star of American cinema of the last 40 years. His star power and talent is on full display here.It's patriotic, American, and will undoubtedly boost recruitment numbers for the Navy.

But surely there was at least one that was better than this. And then there's best picture. I think the word \"best\" must mean something different to me.Watching Maverick riding super-fast on his motorcycle, too macho to wear a helmet, is exciting when he's in his 20s, but when he's over 60-years-old?

The story and screenplay are kept clean to allow the flying sequences and action stunts to do most of the talking on the screen. All the supporting cast is near, precise and clean. The ending is really good and unexpected as you start thinking of different scenarios while the movie enters the climax sequence. I wish more actors and directors would go back to old school films where audience are not overdosed with CGI and chroma keying. If you loved top gun 1, I can guarantee that you will love this even more. I also think Tom Cruise will not do one more top gun in this lifetime.",

I was literally on the edge of my seat from the scene 1 to when the credits rolled. It's that good & it was very refreshing. The jets, the technology today & how they shot the sequences were amazing & felt very real.This movie is a perfect 10/10 in every way. It's apolitical & there is no signaling at all, which unfortunately has become rare in movies/Hollywood these days.

Maverick didn't like this and he decided to do a new plan and in his plan they have more chances to be alive, but the mission is very, very difficult.The commanders didn't like Maverick's idea, but Iceman, the leader of leaders, approved the idea of his friend.Maverick didn't have much time to train his team and he had a conflict with rooster because rooster's dad was the duo of Maverick in the past, but he died as a pilot with Maverick.This is a very emotional film because Maverick has many conflicts with the team, his old girlfriend Penny, the commanders and the time.This film has a very good production, and compared with top gun 1, top gun 2 has so many battles and effects, and it makes a better film, because when the plane explodes the effects make us feel like the plane really exploded. And analyzing the plot, this film has a more interesting plot and with more surprises, principally in the final, when Maverick is alone at the island full of enemies and Rooster go back to help him and they escape from the island, the audience think that the conflict are resolved, but in the way back home they had another problem, and this surprize the audience a lot.Concluding, this is a new film based on an old film, but with a better production and a better plot. Additionally, this is a film with many surprises, so you can't say the finale of history if you don't watch it. Thats a nice film for everyone who likes action movies.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise is back as an older smugger Mayonnaise who, hasn't matured, gotten a promotion, or learned a thing since the original Top Ham. In the first 10 minutes, our \"hero\" directly disobeys orders, willfully destroys an experimental military jet by trying to turn the volume up to Mach 11, and impossibly survives a Mach 10.3 ejection. Rattled but completely unscathed, Mayonnaise appropriately finds himself in a roadside diner where he charmingly snatches a glass of water off a waitress' tray because exploding in the sky makes a hero thirsty.For his rebellious sabotage, Mayonnaise is punished just as the real U. S. military punishes-he is demoted from experimental test pilot to Top Ham instructor of an elite group of Junior Top Hams. Our entitled hero reluctantly accepts the severe punishment and manages to suppress a tantrum which we know he is capable of.Next, we are introduced to the most culturally diverse, whitewashed cast that this film's audience will tolerate. A co-ed fraternal order of affirmative action light, a.k.a. Mayonnaise's students. We make shallow acquaintance with these one-dimensional characters in a roadhouse-style Air Force bar that is conveniently owned by one of our hero's ex flings, Penny Benjamin. In this passive aggressive scene, Penny playfully extorts a bar tab out of Mayonnaise as revenge for past harms inflicted on her while the youngsters ostracize him for the crime of being old in America. Penny rings a bell three times and the Junior Hams gleefully throw the old geezer out on the ground. The whole scene plays out with the synthetic warmth of a Norman Rockwell illustration.The next day, the Junior Hams are introduced to their instructor. From the expressions on their faces, we see that they regret mistreating Mayonnaise. Not because it is wrong to disrespect the elderly, but because they are now in a position where they can be punished. Training begins and Mayonnaise predictably spanks all the toddlers via dog fight simulations and push-up contests.At this point, while holding back laughter and vomit, I chose to salvage the rest of my evening by revisiting the box office. Refund for Top Ham and re-ticket for a different movie. Always request a refund for unwatchable movies, so they don't profit from you. Vote with your dollars.There is a huge market for movies like this, and there are plenty of them. Many become top box office draws. I'm glad they exist, because every audience should have a movie that they can relate to. I'm just sick of hearing right-wing media complain about leftist Hollywood when what feels like a majority of theatrical releases glorify right-wing ideology. Hollywood is the Olive Garden of entertainment. Endless breadsticks, salad, and blandness. Patrons of Hollywood blockbusters and the Olive Garden vote with their dollars. It's the one true and pure universal freedom. The rest is all BS. Amen!",

            "review_title": "A boring rehash",
            "content": "I know I am in the minority here, but this movie was mediocre, at best. The original movie had chemistry, action and a plot that flowed. With this remake, it felt like they sat at a table and said \"We have to have these elements from the original included\" and then they tried to build the story around it. The result was a jumpy, uneven movie. In fact, I was so bored, I actually started checking my watch 40 minutes into the movie and kept groaning when I realized how much longer I had to go.Here were my biggest disappointments (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD):1) Too many of the plot lines were plucked from the original and too many of the flashback scenes seemed forced. The scene in the bar where the students throw him out of the bar, only to learn the next day that he is their instructor? Pretty much a rip off of the scene in the original where Maverick hits on Charley only to find out the next day that she is his instructor i Tom Cruise on his motorcycle racing the aircraft? I actually thought they had taken that footage from the original. The cocky, pretty-boy rivalry between Rooster and Hangman? That is Maverick and Iceman all over again. The love scene? I thought this was from the original as well, except with Jennifer Connolly and not Kelly McGillis. Team football on the beach? Oh, well, at least it wasn't volleyball. This is typical of Hollywood producers - if something worked in the original, let's rehash it and try to repackage it as something new and people will come to watch it because it is movie with an A-list actor. Frankly, I find this insulting that Hollywood thinks I'm so small minded that I don't know when I'm being shown the same movie in a glossy new package.2) There was much touting about the footage being more realistic this time because the actors were in the actual aircraft for the flying scenes. I am no pilot but, quite frankly, I did not feel that the realistic footage made the movie better. In fact, when I watched the original today, I was more focused on the fight scene and less concerned with the fact that the actors' faces weren't curling from the G-forces.3) The plot in the original may have been a bit of a stretch but it was still plausible. The plot in this one was completely ludicrous. The original \"crisis\" was far-fetched, but when they just happened to stumble on the enemy's fighter jet that they could just fly out on a destroyed runway. Really???? I know we go to the movies to be entertained with fantasy, but this is just flat-out laughable.4) Tom Cruise's ego - ALL of his movies are so ridiculously long and self-promoting. He is always the hero who can achieve the most impossible tasks. Yes, we all know you do your own stunts, Tom. You can stop trying to overcompensate for whatever it is that is driving you to seek constant adulation. It was entertaining a few years ago, but now it is quite irritating.5) Chemistry - there was NO chemistry among any of the characters. Even the Iceman/Maverick bromance seemed forced and none of the newbies seemed to click. The original characters had so much chemistry - even the ones that were minor characters - and this is what drew me into the original so much. There was so much forced banter and ribbing with this group that just seemed to fall completely flat.I am happy that many people were entertained by this because we all need some escapism right now. But, for those of you who, like me, hate when sequels are just a remake of the original, it is better to save your money and wait for this to come out on Paramount + (If Tom Cruise will ever let it.)

How many times has a movie disappointed us and especially how many times has a sequel been god-awful? Too many to count.I saw Maverick two days before the movie came out, at an early access showing at AMC. My husband loves aviation. He is a pilot and our son is a pilot in the Army. So, we went for the IMAX theater and paid more for our tickets, as my husband has anticipated this movie since 1986. So he wanted the full experience. Ha ha.Well, ladies and gentlemen, it was worth the wait! (And the extra money- hands down) I had not been to an IMAX movie for over twenty years. They used to make me motion sick.There have not been many movies that I have recommended my friends and family to go see in the theater. This is one of the few.All I can say is: do yourself a favor and go watch this movie while it's on the big screen. You won't regret it.(No spoilers from me. I don't want to take away from any aspect of this film. Don't read any spoilers or detailed reviews, just GO.)Oh and as the geeks we are, we dressed up a little for the movie. We are huge Top Gun fans. Aviator glasses and flight suitsOh. One final thing- this movie is classy and well done. It's nice to be able to go to a movie with your kids, have a great experience without excessive sweat words and nudity. This is how it's done.And IMAX was great. No motion sickness!",

            "content": "To anticipate it. The film grabbed me as an old TopGun- (and anyway aviation-) fan. The action scenes are just fantastic and even though a lot of CGI was used here despite many air combat scenes that were filmed in real life, you never get the feeling that anything is computer generated here, with the exception that certain flight maneuvers would never be carried out in reality. But optically it is shot perfectly and you are right in the middle of it. The gags don't fall short in a few scenes either. The window jump scene and its ending... Brilliant!But...\nThe story is appropriate in relation to the first edition around 30 years ago and seems authentic, but somehow too much is repeated here. Many scenes create a feeling of \"didn't we see that in the old movie before?\"\nThe piano scene in the bar, the motorbike rides... even the intro, apart from the better picture quality, could be almost 1:1 from the first film, with even the music being the same.Sure, for those who haven't seen the original TopGun movie, this can be helpful in understanding the story, but for the \"old hands\" this seems unimaginative. There would have been other ways to relate to the former story.That's why I can't give the film more than 7 stars.Nevertheless, it is very worth seeing. It's exciting and, like the first TopGun, almost unbelievable, in the truest sense of the word.If you don't take the film too seriously and just like great, action-packed flight scenes, and can ignore too many parallels to the old film, then it's worth going to the cinema or buying as a BD-disc!",

At times, I felt like it couldn't quite think for itself, like a filtered down rehash of the original. And other times I was thoroughly impressed and totally blown away!!The highlights for me were the jet fighting scenes, especially towards the end and they totally make the movie. Wow! Gave me a whole new appreciation for their amazing ability and the pilots who fly them. This was something that the first movie couldn't quite deliver on. Thank you modern movie making technology!Really, that was kinda it for the highlights! I actually have quite a few issues with this movie. Mostly; the story is just plain not very good. Something that the first movie excelled at. And the cast of characters. In the first movie they felt larger than life, but this time they felt kinda boring and put on. I wasn't really buying into them.The character, Rooster, was a big part of the movie and while I thought Miles Teller did a fantastic job, they didn't develop his back story enough.Also, Jennifer Connolly's character; who is this woman and why does Maverick care? It's almost like they felt obligated to put in the love story angle but they did a horrible job. Truly disappointing, especially when compared with the fire he had with the Kelly McGillis character from the original.The \"talk to me Goose\" lines were just not working for me.A big part of what made the original movie so great was the AMAZING music! You've lost that loving feeling, take my breath away. But this time all the good music was sourced from the original and the new music was very pedestrian.With all its faults, you would think that I hated this movie, but actually it was worth the price of admission and I came out with a big smile on my face.

Sure there were some dramatizations for example that bird strike taking down an F18 in such a dramatic way or that steep turn the Darkstar took at Mach 9 (would be a 30G+ maneuver). Other than that it was very accurate. We even heard \"bitchn Betty\" yell \"Altitude, Altitude\" which was awesome!This is a movie I will show my kids later to fascinate them for aviation.

I actually prefer Penny over Charlie, but I prefer the love story in the original Top Gun more, but either way Penny is still a great character. The best part of this film is definitely the 3rd act, it is spectacular. The track is also amazing, from Lady Gaga's Hold My hand to OneRepublic's I Aint Worried. This is an all around great film, and I highly recommend you watch it.Overall I'd say it's 9.5/10, it's not perfect, but it's close!",

This movie was done so well that my family saw it three times in the movie theater. It was so much better than the first one as Top Gun was more of a romance story with the action being secondary IMO. Maverick was all out action/flying with a small secondary romance subplot. It was also very well done in the fact that you never see the enemy's face so this movie will stand the test of time and not dated to 2022 in regards to which country was the antagonist. Again, kudos to Tom Cruise in this movie and to his cast. Top notch.",

There are a lot of advancements in technology in the second movie. The Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) made you feel you were really there, and it also made you feel like the actors were flying the jets themselves, because they were! Let me explain. This \"Flying\" was a combination of CGI and the actors actually flying the jets, because the movie crew couldn't go out to the Himalayas or the Arctic and start shooting footage of the actors flying around mountains in Super Hornets, so they picked Lake Oroville, Feather River Canyon and made the place look like it was snowing. At the end of the movie, Maverick flies off into the distance while Lady Gaga's \"Hold my Hand\" is playing. However, the movie characters have too much plot armor. Maverick went crashing down at Mach 10 and survives, not to mention that both Mav and Rooster blew up, and both of them survived! Afterwards, Maverick gets targeted by a large enemy helicopter and every single bullet misses him! Overall, great movie, but could've been better.",

What a temptation it must have been for the studio and the creatives to board the en-vogue subversion-train and give Top Gun a 'modern' makeover that online trolls could go to metaphorical war over.Yet, Top Gun Maverick withstands those temptations and instead chooses to honor and respect its cinematic predecessor and give us a true to formula action film, with a refined structure, believable character development and state of the art flight sequences. All while remaining free of excessive misfires of comedy or the urge to make us feel ashamed about liking 'that sort of entertainment'.Tom Cruise fully embraces his aged hero figure while gracefully passing the baton to the younger generation, replacing the unintentional-seeming homo-eroticism of the original film with genuine themes of brotherhood, friendship and forgiveness. With Top Gun Maverick and following the reinvention of TRON in 2010, Director Joseph Kosinski certainly has established himself as the man to honor and preserve an IP while giving it a fresh new layer of paint. All these things combined make Top Gun Maverick is a standout in 2022's action film offering.",

            "content": "Raised in the '80s, I grew up wanting to join the US navy even though I'm not even an American. The US soft power was extremely efficient on my generation through movies like the original Top Gun. I re-watch the movie from time to time and once more before watching the sequel. It has its limits obviously but still, Tony Scott was an artist, the music was phenomenal, the characters were well written and it talked about real issues like friendship, pride, death and grief. And boy that sex scene was promising when you're a teenager.To begin with, I was quite pleased with how this sequel started. The intro sequence is full of potential and I started to think that we were going to explore what happens to a 1985 hero after the movie ends and time passes and he gets older and out of fashion. At start, Maverick seems lonely and a bit of a loser to be honest. One can't help but wonder what went wrong and how someone who seemed unstoppable ended up being a failure. It's such a missed opportunity to not have gone further in that direction.Instead of that exploration of deep questions about what it means to be a hero, the tragedy of that condition and the loneliness that comes with it, we get a below average action movie extremely badly written, with a completely improbable plot without real stakes, instantly forgettable characters no one cares about interacting through unbelievably bad dialogues.No one's hurt, no one dies, no one is really emotionally involved, no sex obviously, it all seems fake. And the worst is that there's not even an original score, the producers basically live free and make money on the original movie's qualities without any interesting input of their own whatsoever. As has rightly been said in many reviews, the Top Gun universe isn't richer with that movie, not even a tiny bit.Tom Cruise keeps repeating that he refused the idea of a sequel for decades until he read the script of this one. This is really hard to believe given its utter vacuity. He turned it into yet another and completely unnecessary Mission Impossible episode, which seems to be the only type of plot that resonates with him for quite a while now. He worked for many great directors and I'm sure he valued cinema at some point in his career so it's quite sad to watch him indulge in this type of intellectually-empty entertainment.What does it say about our time that Hollywood isn't able to top its basic hits of the 1980's ? What does it say about our time that people seem to thoroughly enjoy that movie without even noticing how it insults their intelligence ?",

The whole movie is made to be ranked as a General Audience: good or bad I let you decide but that doesn't help raising the movie's interest.There is strictly no acting: it's a Tom Cruise \"woaw how young do I look\" and that's it. Jennifer is lame, John Hamm is awful, and the others (who ?) are ghosts. There is strictly no character development for the flying squad: the rivalry between 2 of them is not expanded, the female character (what's her name?) is there because she's a woman etc. Some scenes are truly third rate: the (very long) bar scene which is non sense and unrealistic and the beach one which is poorly trying to bring back an \"all American 80s Rocky style\". Finally the Jennifer / Tom love story is so lame : running into her again in the bar suddenly \"he is not going to let her go again\"Then comes the last 40min with the mission scene: well executed, sometimes funny but does it does make up for the rest.Poor scenario, poor direction, poor actors, lame movie.",

What bothers me the most is the missing story, because nothing really happens after the two hours of telling and showing that the US Navy is the best in the world. The otherwise well-liked Jennifer Connelly also turns out to be the wrong cast, because there is zero harmony between her and Tom Cruise.",

Having done that, it made the experience of Top Gun Maverick a whole lot more complete and understandable.Making this movie required hours upon hours of film making and, sadly, much had to be cut out to make the movie fit the industry's 2-hour model. That is readily apparent. This movie could have been a whole lot more with some of that cut footage being restored.This was a school teaching pilots for their next mission. But, there wasn't a lot of school in the film -- on the ground or in the air. Aerial teamwork never comes into play until the grand finale to the story. At least the beach football game offered a glimpse but not enough. Like, when they climb out of the hole, why do they roll over to go down the other side? It has to do with G-forces but, that's never mentioned. Pilots will understand but the audience, well not so much.A lot of character development between Mav and Penny would have also contributed greatly to the film. Do people who never saw the original know who Penny Benjamin is and what her relationship to Maverick is all about? What about the other pilots? Anything there? There is a gaping hole in that regard.I have read that Joseph Kosinski doesn't plan on a \"directors cut\" but, I hope he seriously reconsiders this decision. Another half hour of material can transform this excellent film into a superior film easily.",

Giving the viewer a massive \"welcome back\" impression after so long.However it is not as perfect as what the original Top Gun in my opinionIll break the review down in 3 segmentsFirst, The action, because this is what Top Gun is about. It is miles better than the original with much more aerial shots and real scenes. It justifies itself with the final segment of the movie where the action is really intense, the best dogfight scene for a movie i have ever seen with an impressive set of visual effects, both practical and CG, this is what DCS and Ace Combat dogfight will look like if they become a movie. However i do find that the \"training\" part of the movie feels off and a bit shallow compared to the original, the shots are gorgeous and impressive but it felt too dense and that moves to the next topic.Story, the pacing itself is fine, however it does feel like it is squeezed in compared to the first top gun, this is where i find the movie is most lacking. I understand the movie is around maverick himself but i cant help but notice the lack of deeper development on the other characters, it felt shallow and only touched on the surface, along with what looks to be plot holes that could have been explained better and some twist that really does not make sense. The plot does rely on quite a lot of fan service that i appreciate at does link up nicely but ends up making the story feels weak and not as memorable compared to the original, but i appreciate this move as it brings back the original cast together along with introducing the new characters.Last is the cinematography, original Top Gun looks impressive then and still is now, this movie tried the same style which i appreciate yet for some reason it does not hit me quite to the same amount, it still has breathtaking shots and the aerial photography is much more involved, the opening scene does give a massive \"welcome back\" feeling yet something feels a bit off probably because the movie environment is set different, don't get me wrong it is still impressive but I'm not sure if this is better than the original.All in all this movie is outstanding for a sequel, everyone involved knew what they were doing and they delivered, from beginning to the end this movie is an action roller coaster that i definitely recommend to watch.",

            "content": "I've never seen the 1st Top Gun but I'm an avid believer of watching and reading things completely to better understand everything as a whole. This is especially true with Top Gun. The 1st movie isn't really great and the graphics, although probably amazing for the 80s, are pretty terrible compared to modern day Maverick. But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND watching the 1st one to have a better understanding the foundation of the relationships and the story that continues some 36 years later. They do flashbacks so you get an idea, but it doesn't really resonate unless you've seen the movie.Again, it's not necessary to watch the 1st one to understand Maverick's story, but after watching the 1st one, it gave us ALL THE FEELS. It was an extremely great and satisfying viewing experience. My husband was bored watching the 1st one, but he did say watching it made Maverick more emotional. We probably wouldn't have realized how deep the movie was without watching the 1st one.Overall the movie has humor, nostalgia, great friendships/relationships, and good action. What more can you ask for? Highly recommended!",

Of course some of it was unrealistic but for the most part it was pretty accurate. I felt the story of the original was better, probably because the concept was new and more character development occurred. A lot of this movie was merely copying segments from the original. Fundamentally, this is the typical plot of a non-conformist in trouble who is then called in to save the day.I also found it interesting the mission objective was straight out of Stars Wars - fly down a canyon low to avoid the guns (SAMs) and target a port about 3-feet across. And of course \"Don't think, just do!\" - Top Gun's version of the Force? I expected more originality.",

I have a soft spot for 80s over the top corny action and they could call back on that even with a more \"modern\" film and somehow get away with it without the movie becoming one big eye roll. There were a ton of great action sequences in large part because they actually shot them and the actors in real jets, minimizing CGI is always a great move when possible. The movie was silly, swaggering, and if you could suspend your belief or even use of basic reason (almost out a love for the 80s action homage) then it was a ton of fun. If you come in expecting a tight standalone package I think this rings hollow but seeing that almost 40 years later they manufactured what feels like a solid top gun sequel with Tom cruise looking like he's barely aged 20 years that's quite an accomplishment. Fun movie. Don't go in looking for anything more.",

Obviously with all that was released, I knew the filming and the art of this movie was going to be really good, and I knew it would be good to see because of that.What I did not expect was a really good story to fit into the movie, even as a Top Gun fan. For all the flaws that the original movie had, it left alot of meat on the bone for this one. This movie had alot more character to it, and it makes the original movie better than it was before this movie came out. If you haven't watched the first one yet or haven't in a while, I suggest watching it before you go see this. There's heart into this story and I was pretty shocked by it.Obviously no movie is perfect, I do wish a couple of the characters were developed more instead of plopped in to meet the \"blockbuster\" quota, and I wish there were some more footage outside of the F/A-18's that weren't as tight as they were but that is a complete nitpick.One of the better big blockbuster movies we've seen in a while, it reminded me why I love movies. I was expecting a cash cow nostalgia type that was a cool movie to watch, but this is more than that. It's a needed supplement to an already classic movie. I wish it never ended.",

For me, it felt like I was watching two different films; the separation between the romance storyline and the action storyline was very distinct. It felt as if when you're writing the rough draft of an essay and you haven't quite got your paragraphs in a comfortable order yet. Or as if you're trying to fit too many points in - to cover too much ground. There were a lot of great scenes, but they just didn't really feel that attached to each other. Additionally, it felt like we were given an explanation for every scene which contained a throw-back to the 1986 film; I don't think this was necessary! I think they would have flowed better if this didn't happen (for example, the beach scene). This is where the 1986 film is superior (the flow).I was hopeful that the modern revival of this film would have reduced the chance of cringey romance however, that was not the case. The will-they/won't-they chase between Penny and Mav felt forced and predictable. Like a rushed slow-burn. Also, the dialogue between the two didn't help; the cliched motivational one-liners made it worse for me as it only affirmed their lack of chemistry. This storyline didn't really advance the overall plot or add any character development to anyone during the film. So, it felt slow and relatively redundant. Goes to show that Top Gun: Maverick is better in the air, than on the ground...However, the music score and cinematography really help pull the film along, especially around the more adrenaline-building scenes. My only criticism, regarding the action sequences, is that no one could survive that many crashes (especially from Mach10)!Regardless, I did enjoy the film, so I'd rate it a 6/10.",

Then we had our usual Hollywood ending, where despite the mandatory crisis, Tom Cruise incredibly returns to the mission, successfully destroys the target, and becomes our hero. Was anyone really surprised by this typical Hollywood ending? I'm LOL.* All of the Iranian surface to air missiles failed to take down a single American plane and everyone returned home safely.

Audience response has been nothing short of phenomenal, earning over $1.4 billion at the box office to date.As the film opens, viewers discover that Pete Mitchell (aka Maverick) has aged but he's still the Maverick. Ignoring orders from his CEO, Maverick skips an intermediate stealth fighter test and switches directly to the project final objective target (Mach 10) to save the project and succeeds but at the cost of the aircraft which explodes. Fully expecting dismissal by commanding RAdm in charge of the project, Maverick is informed he has been reassigned to Fightertown USA (Top Gun Training School) instead.A secret mission is necessary to eliminate a uranium refining complex being developed against international sanctions in an underground location within a mountain that's due to start receiving nuclear materials within 3 weeks by a rogue Nation. The mission will involve a low-level approach under enemy radar thru a winding narrow corridor heavily defended by SAMs on both sides followed by an extreme ingress and egress with massive g-forces while targeting a minuscule drop zone requiring a precise strike not once but twice to have any prospect of success. An impossible mission. Sounds like a job for Ethan Hunt but Maverick will have to do. What! Typical military intelligence. The pilot best suited for this mission is tasked with training other Top Gun grads to complete the objective. To succeed Maverick will have to resort to unorthodox training techniques to develop personnel who function as a team and think outside the book. His role is complicated by the inclusion of the son (Rooster) of his deceased best friend (Goose) on the training roster.Top Gun: Maverick succeeds in every level possible. It utilizes all the best elements of the original while updating the story relatable to today's audiences. Cruise has committed every resource to this personal project. Guess who really owns that WWII vintage Mustang in Maverick's hangar? Did the Cruise missiles come from that same source? Probably not. The visuals are excellent throughout (example: Darkstar test flight). Never have computer screen simulations been so exhilarating. The musical score which includes themes from the original film augmented by classic and current songs should satisfy viewers young and old. And the movie also injects humor into the film regularly to offset the more serious themes.Cruise fully committed himself to his signature role as Maverick eliminating the cockiness of the youthful character for a more measured performance but retaining his rep as a 'maverick'' at critical moments within the structure of the story. Not only does Maverick have to contend with his own morality, obstinate superiors, and the eventual end of his flight career but he also wrestles with his guilt over Goose's death, along with potential casualties among his trainees if he fails as an instructor (especially Rooster, because it involves a promise). Flying jets is easy. Making life and death decisions for your charges is gut-wrenching. Will Maverick ever be able to form long-term relationships with the opposite sex or just die alone?Cruise's performance is backed by the entire cast including Ed Harris (Cain to Maverick's Able), Jon Hamm (Cyclone), Charles Parnell (Warlock) and Bashir Salahuddin (Hondo) with newcomers Monica Barbaro (Phoenix), Glen Powell (Hangman) and Miles Teller (Rooster) shining among the mission's Top Gun candidates. Jennifer Connelly as Maverick's old flame, Penny, is believable in a romance targeted for mature audiences which rates almost a PG rating. As the only returning member from the 1986 hit, Val Kilmer's gives a touching performance (to anyone who's aware of Kilmer's real-life medical plight) as Maverick's confident and 'guardian angel' Iceman (Adm. Kazansky).The Mission Impossible overtones are as obvious as is the nature of Mavericks Day job which is really a risky business. Wait! Doesn't Penny's Porsche bear a striking resemblance to the same vehicle from Cruise's 1st hit in 1983? Maybe. And doesn't the climatic mission run strongly mimic the attack on the Death Star in Star Wars: ANH? The fighters must maneuver thru a narrow corridor lined with weaponry to deliver a surgically precise strike on a minute target not once but twice. Was that Obi Wan imploring Rooster to trust his instincts or maybe Jedi master Maverick on the headphones? 'Use the (Naval Air) force, Rooster'. Whatever! The film exceeded all expectations, so I give Top Gun: Maverick 11 stars out of 10 stars.On a casting note: Was Ryan Gosling ever contacted about a certain pivotal role? Just curious.",

The character Rose, played by Betty White, on the Golden Girls was 55 years old according to the show. Can you imagine Tom Cruise romancing Rose from the Golden Girls?!?I didn't really plan on watching this movie, but I'm so glad I did. Perfection!

And everyone will feel the same about Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connely: they look amazing for their age. Jennifer makes a good replacement for the original actress that played Penny. Tom Cruise is as charming as ever and the others are fine actors.I will not rate this move 10 out of 10, like many others. Some may still be in the adrenaline rush created by the movie. It is a good movie, maybe even the best of 2022. 8 out of 10 for me.",

I am a lover of all the MCU/DC movies and REALLY enjoy those...however, this just brings you back to something I never truly realized I have been missing the last 10 years or so. To give you an idea of MY favorite \"blockbuster\" style movies, I would say Interstellar, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Dark Knight, LOTR, Logan, Infinity wars, Winter Soldier, Blade Runner 2049, Avatar, Jurassic Park, T2, Aliens all are at the top. This movie safely falls into that list now. This is the rare movie that even bests the very good original...this is the new T2, Aliens, Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight...The \"feel\" of this movie is almost identical of the original Top Gun (music included..thank you!) but kicked up a notch...but in a VERY good way...nothing is forced. It has the unbelievable adrenaline rush when needed, it is funny when it is needed, it is touching when needed. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. It will make you laugh, it will make you get a little teary-eyed, it will make your jaw drop, it will make you cheer, it will make you look at the people next to you just to give them a big smile/grin, it will make you think \"wow I have missed movies like this...and wow I LOVE movies!\"This movie is NOT meant to be streamed, or wait till it comes out on 4K (at least for the 1st watch). Please..please...PLEASE go see this at the best theater you can find (IMAX, Dolby Cinema, XD...) Yes, it will cost you more, but it is 100% worth it. I am VERY fortunate to have a pretty amazing HT that sounds better than most theaters (Even if they sell it for 3 times the usual 4K price..It is a day one/pre-order must own)...however, if I had the option to get this hard copy 4k/Atmos disk TODAY and screen it at home for all my friends/family, I'd still say no and tell them all to go to the theater to experience like it was meant to be...ENJOY!!!",

Just pure Navy Officer tripe when this was totally ig owed during the dark star test previously. Riding up to Dark star in his motorbike.I doubt real test pilots do this.The Top Gun movie from 1986 actually followed pretty closely to real life apart from the prank of buzzing the tower.... but even then that happens in real life.I'm expecting a reasonable story here....Where the first movie kept up a fun and jokey pace where character interaction was a priority.Now it's absolutely weak, non existent.The music is the same and that is the only plus at the moment, apart from Tom Cruise.Compared to Dunkirk, 1917 and 13 Hours, Top Gun Maverick has had an extremely poor beginning. All those movies had excellent character interaction.This one seems to be about Tom Cruise or the creators were too scared to bring in the thing that worked in the original top Gun!!The character interaction humour, teasing, jokes, insults, etc....We aren't at the half hour mark yet, but we missed on keeping a good pace with after the carrier scene at the start and the bar scene...let's hope that can be carried over and maybe save this.No Goose too...We just need to get characters!!! Sad!!!About the 25th minute we actually progress into character development.We soon find out one of the central themes of the movie is from the original.Whilst the training scenes in the hour before the mission leave a bit to be desired, they aren't bad, but I think never can equal the amazing cinematography of the original. Or maybe i just miss the F14s and the F18s even Super Hornets don't cut it as they can't do Mach 2.But slowly the film picks up steam.Compared to the original it was a slow and quiet start indeed.But towards the end the reward will come.The authenticity of the enemy fighters really did trump the first one and deserves full marks.Hopefully they can do what Star wars creator George Lucas's did and go back and refine the original film hopefully using the Mig 29 as an emery rather than a US fighter (F-5) painted in Russian colours.Spoiler alertThe theme develops in the end with Gooses son and really does a good job with mending brokenness from the first when Goose died.Whilst the film is a little light on humour... once you get past the first quarter of the film, the first half hour, it does come together nicely.Although I'm quite critical of the beginning and would have liked to have seen a bit of enemy fighter \"dialogue\" as in manoeuvres after the carrier scene, it was creative genius to use a test platform taking the next number of the SR-71 Blackbird, namely the \"SR-72\", the Darkstar.The film Top Gun Maverick gets an 8.1/10 for me. Even though the Officers above Maverick weren't that great, the film worked. I guess Tom Cruise carried it with a few others.If you went on the first half hour it would have been a 4 or 5/10.Spoiler alertThere is a nice surprise in the ending for those who are mighty fans of the F-14.......",

It goes out of its way to make him more of the hero above anyone, like no other heroic moments could happen without him involved. Half of the cast is just happy to be there, but the other half has A list actors that seemed forced to give lackluster performances. At the same time, its effin Top Gun lmao\nOne main thing about the original that I overlooked until recently, is how they handle PTSD. He was, and still is messed up over Goose, but they refuse to talk about it directly. This would have been a good moment to discuss that about his character, to help it be relatable with our actual veterans. But, cliche comes back and you have to suck it up.It is formed like an 80's/90's action movie. It gives you those warm nostalgia feels, but you can also tell what is about to happen next just based on the timing of the plot.IT'S A SUPER FUN MOVIE, not a film. It's a great summer opener.They give love to Val, which was as good as a moment as they could have done, but shows how he doesnt have alot of time left. The mission itself is straight up a Mission Impossible kind of thing, so you can see how Tom was controlling the production. They have an unnamed enemy (RUSSIA) that they have a mission set for in the first ten mins, and what they are doing is IMPOSSIBLE. You almost expect them to say it too.Their target is basically just like the Death Star.It's more of an Ace Combat movie than Top Gun, the main mission is actually a ripoff from the last game. Ace Combat fans will understand. I'm actually re-downloading as you read...\nSTRONG 7/10, based on visuals and sound. Incredible.(The opening is an exact copy of the original and I loved it.)\nSpoiler Alert!!!!!Hans Zimmer & Lady Gaga do the music?!?!?!",

What made this movie so good is all the actors took a really intense training for month to shoot these scenes and Tom Cruise did too many dangerous moves.",

            "content": "Even in 1986, the original \"Top Gun\" had a slight vintage feel to it. Given how reminiscent of a bygone period its fighter-pilot training school setting was, the movie inserts an opening title card to make it clear that it takes place in the present. Even if \"Top Gun\" is heavily influenced by 1980s masculinity and Cold War-era jingoism, it also has the air of a genuine military spectacle that might have been produced by an earlier Hollywood studio structure. And now, 36 years later, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" gives a double dose of nostalgia - for both the 1980s original and the by-gone Americana it first inspired.The fact that \"Top Gun: Maverick\" doesn't take itself too seriously is one of its best qualities. Yes, if you choose to look for them, there are emotional throughlines (and meta connections), but there are also shirtless beach football games, sexy romance scenes, and characters that seem to have been plucked straight out of a 1940s WWII movie. Even though \"Top Gun: Maverick's\" realistic feats are comparable to those in the \"Mission: Impossible\" movies, \"Maverick\" stands out thanks to its purposely cheesy seriousness. And while that somewhat restricts how in-depth the movie can actually go with its plot, it nevertheless provides a welcome change of pace in a blockbuster world dominated by smirking, sardonic action movies.Even though it must have been absurdly difficult to film those plane acrobatics, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" excels because of its clarity. It is possible to follow the action visually, which is not often the case in high-budget action blockbusters. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, it takes little mental effort to track emotional developments. (Predictability is both a benefit and a drawback in this case.) This is classic summer popcorn movie entertainment at its most exhilarating. And Cruise is merely the mission's main man.",

Always when a new sequel is made to an iconic movie, some might think that there was no need for it, and let's face it, most of movie series do not become like their first part..and the following parts may become distorted, vulgar, and unwatchable versions. This did not happen here with \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"While watching Top Gun Maverick, I went through a lot of feelings \"nostalgia, fun, enthusiasm, love, friendship, responsibility, patriotism, loyalty etc.\"\nIt was an interesting movie that took me back to the 90s without clich\u00e9s. It was smooth without complications, but at the same time it made me realize more about the modern techniques of fighter planes and about fighter pilots and their emotions.I had no complaints about the romantic track between Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly\nBut what I really liked was the dialogue \"It's time to let go\" between Maverick and his friend, his \"guardian angel\" who always rushed to rescue when he did something unusual \"Iceman \" played by Val Kilmer \"His presence was like a cherry on the cake despite his inability to speak due to his health condition, but it was a wonderful scene\nloved it because pf the meaning behind it , We don't need to make our lives wasted by drowning in the spiral of the past, \"as Maverick did .. Or sometimes I feel that it belongs to Tom personally, but I felt that it was one of his most sincere moments on the screen since his first appearance 40 years ago.Anyways i loved the film and loved every single performance,From Miles Teller to Jon Ham , Glen Powell.But, but, but, in the end, it is one man who has carried the entire film on his shoulders from the word \"go.\"\nBS : I 'm not convinced that this man is about to be 61 years old.",

No CGI.And boy, does it show!The cinematography is beautiful and the action sequences are breathtaking, you're really sitting in the cockpit with the pilots and experiencing the g-forces.The story is simple but even just the training scenes leading up to the complicated and dangerous mission are incredibly intense and exhilarating.And the third act, the actual mission is edge-of-your-seat intense, anxiety-inducing suspense and wall-to-wall action.It's bonkers. Totally bananas.Add to that a surprisingly emotional story, a great cast of young pilots (Miles Teller and Glenn Powell being standouts), a lovely leading lady in Jennifer Connelly and a charismatic Tom Cruise who brings his absolute A-game portraying the charming daredevil pilot Maverick still haunted by his past mistakes and loss, and what you get is a seismic bomb of a blockbuster that brings everything a movie fan could ask for and then some.Kudos to Tom Cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie released where it belongs, on the big screen.

I could recognize the trailer easily enough from Tom Cruise and all the jets, but I wasn't as invested in it as people who have seen and loved Top Gun since 1986. Although, the trailer looked awesome and I thought it would be a cool movie.I saw Top Gun about six months after the trailer had been released, but the world was deep in the COVID-19 pandemic, so at that time, the movie had been delayed until November 2020. For the next two years, Maverick kept getting pushed back more and more, and I was wondering if this was actually a good movie or if the directors were just trying to delay the disappointment for as long as possible.Finally, in May 2022, Maverick was released and it was so much better than I thought it was going to be. Is it a perfect movie? Not by any means, but it did what it was supposed to do - be a fantastic sequel to the 1986 hit. It was really cool to see what Maverick still flying jets and getting into trouble, as well as how he handled Rooster being on his team. I really loved seeing the new characters, especially since they had included a female pilot. Even back in 1986, women were not allowed to go to the Top Gun school, so to see a female pilot who had not only graduated top of her class, but was now an expert flyer was really amazing.The plot is very similar to Star Wars: A New Hope, in that there is a dangerous machine that must be taken out by a skilled team of pilots - it even took two shots for each one to be destroyed. However, this allowed for some really cool stunts and maneuvers that you didn't see in the 1986 film. It was great to see Maverick as a teacher, but still be just as reckless and cocky. You could see him on the other side of the training, but still with that same pilot attitude he's always had. We even got the same style of beach scene and romantic love interest between Maverick and Penny Benjamin.As far as fan service goes, this movie really does it well and as a huge Top Gun fan and daughter of a naval aviator, this movie was everything I was hoping it would be!",

Rooster's entire character is basically a walking reminder of Goose and he is only relevant because of how Mav feels about Goose all these years later.Outside of a good cameo, Iceman functions as a kind of Deus Ex Machina/Fairy Godmother/ Magic Shield for Mav, blocking any consequences from the number of illegal or unethical decisions Mav can't stop himself from making. In addition to everything that should have gotten Mav kicked out of the military in the original Top Gun (which was somehow pardoned with Iceman's influence) and everything since then he's done to get kicked out (also pardoned with Iceman's influence), Mav can't stop being reckless, disobeying orders, talking back to superior officers, breaking laws, and racking up a whole new list of ways to get kicked out. But the viewers know that Mav and his career will be fine - because he's the hero. There's no passing of the baton, no lesson learned, no development, no stakes, nothing we haven't seen before or couldn't see done better somewhere else.",

            "content": "I absolutely love the first movie and remember being a little girl watching it and loving it. I honestly wasn't expecting too much, since sequels usually have a hard time beating the original movie.... But then a friend of mine watched it in Cannes (!!) and told me everybody was cheering so much after the movie was over and she loved it. So I got over excited, of course, and went to one of those special sessions before the opening night. It is AMAZING, you feel like you're in a cockpit and I cannot believe how the actors had to direct themselves inside those planes!!!! You can barely notice the little CGI and the whole plot is somehow similar to the original one. Yet... I don't know if there are any star wars' fans here, but there's a scene that reminds me of episode IV (shooting the tiny hole of the death star) and another that reminds me of episode VII (remember Rey and Finn finding the Millenium Falcon?) :)\nAnyway, everything works. I love how Maverick deals with his gosts of the past, he is kinda treated like old stuff sometimes yet doesn't care and is the old Maverick we know - doing crazy stuff, being the best up there and showing who is the boss, the best of the best.I mentioned Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and Star Wars because those are action movies with emotion, laughter, romance and a true heart in the very end of the day and I didn't feel stuff like this outside (few) superhero movies for a long, long time (ago in a galaxy far away).Needless to say (again), I was in the first session, there were serveral 40+ guys with me in the cinema and we were all crying like babies... On top of seating in the edge of our seat. Guess this says more about the movie than any other review.Plus, I've seen it twice already and Tom Cruise made this special appearance yesterday just before the movie started and he thanked the audience for being there and going to see it in the big screen. Basically showing streaming services who is the boss. Say what you will about his personal life - you've got to admit he is an amazing actor, producer and truly cares about his audience. This movie should never be seen outside an IMAX theater.",

Top Gun is without doubt my favourite ever movie ....I could watch it over and over again and recite it word for word.Unfortunately my 3yr old autistic son dictated that we couldn't get to the cinema to see Maverick on the big screen so perhaps not being able to do so hindered my overall score but here we go anyway......\nI had goosebumps at the opening scenes with the original background music and danger zone hitting the speakers at full blast. The film quickly set the scene that Maverick was still only at 'captain' status. I expected that tbh as we all kind of knew anyway that he'd be drawn back to Top Gun to teach in this film.The effects and overall blockbuster type scenes were nothing short of spectacular but I was hoping to get some sort of back story to some of the main characters.We all knew that Rooster was the son of Goose but never really got a good description of Maverick & Rooster's relationship over the years, however turbulent that relationship was. Some better context would have led the storyline a bit better here. Also the character of Penny wasn't described very well and how her previous with Maverick played out in the past....she kind of just appeared as a bar owner and Maverick seemed to know her from the past.The film was amazing but personally I would have preferred to have had an extra 15 minutes to watch where the producers have more of a backdrop to the main stars of the film.....it just left me wondering at the end rather than thinking 'Woah...what a great film'\nVal Kilmers scene was essential for the movie I thought but once again left a lot to be desired...yes I know Val is not in a good place with his health but could have been done better.In summary then, I think it's a fabulous movie but would have liked to have seen Maverick play more of a mentor type role to Rooster and have Miles play the main role rather than Tom.Great effects but more character story backdrop would have been nice.",

Movies like James Bond where is neutered in his own movie while some diversity color checkbox of non-heterosexual preference of low quality build rescues and saves the hero in his own movie. Also, besides the gender/race benders there's also the cringey dialogs as if we are too stupid to understand and dumbing it down to moronic levels (i.e. Trump level) so we understand by explicitly saying the things.Thankfully there is none of that in this movie. This movie's Maverick is Maverick and his char is intact and while he has matured, he still is a hotshot whose nature is the same and wants to prove himself and push the envelope more. The women are all strong smart women who do a fantastic job, whatever they've been given. There are diverse characters but it is not stupid over the top ratio and explicit with the checkboxed people occupying in your face positions everywhere with cringey dialogs.I found Tom Cruise, Jon Hamm to be stellar standouts. Curiously, I also found Miles Teller (Rooster) also a great addition and standout. The Hangman guy and Phoenix girl (she was so pretty but so perfectly cast as well) and Jennifer Connelly and her daughter were so perfectly cast and acted.The action stole the scenes with edge of your seat thrill. Tom Cruise's gamble of no-CGI is amazing imo and he's just so good at this. And yes, Tom Cruise does run in this movie ;)This is a truly great film.

Like its 1984's predecessor, Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up with the fellow lead cast and co-producer Cruise and director Tony Scott (who'd unfortunately passed away in the early production year) to restore the original bohemian, freewheeling soul of the eponymous character \"Maverick\" with decades of preceding reputation as a steadfast fighter aircraft diehard now summoned to perfect the hard skills of a budding team of special tasked pilots. Haunted by losing his late bestie, his training mate \"Goose\"/dad of trainee \"Rooster\" (a strikingly identical Miles Teller as the son of a 36-years younger Anthony Edwards) in the previous accident, \"Maverick\" went against the trial rules and pushed high risk altitude flying to make sure the team know how to make their way back in crisis.Fans can tell Cruise is physically on par resuming his ageless role, despite tucking away his small belly in two shirtless scenes, but genuinely not shortsighted and qualified still as an aviator. To counter his immortal charm at the best going rate, an equally dateless Jennifer Connelly starred as his interest of heart. Both Ed Harris and Jon Hamm stood out in their uniformed character; the kicking top gun graduates are added with a black-lives-matter conscious and, whether that really matters for any subtext observation, the co-ed team's beach valleyball game scene deliberately recreated and reprised as a famous homoerotic moment in the tradition of the duology films.And once again just for the fans, new director Joseph Kosinski worked out the Sonantic-enhanced voice of the post cancerous Kilmer and gave his character \"Iceman\" a much respectful departure.The only disappointment is the totally inappropriate, unnecessary and embarrassing closure soundtrack, I mean, why involved Lady Gaga?!! Her music even as to date is far too incomparable to Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock's \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin.Produced by Skydance Media and Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer, this high-octane sequel to one of the eighties' most memorable movies was first distributed by Paramount Pictures states-wide and available in IMAX, 4DX, ScreenX and Dolby Cinema experience.168 people found this helpful.",

There is no doubt this is one of cruise's all time best films already in his long filmography. The authentic work that went into every frame generously shows by Kosinski. As the jets cut through the atmosphere and brush their target soils in close-shave movements that leave you in awe.

But here - they did it. I watched it with the breath held for the better part of the movie. Air scenes are just insane. You can actually feel like an actual participant of the action. There's a few scenes that are a bit cheesy, but it just had to be there and it's not over the border. Cruise does his job exceptionally well in this film. His character also doesn't disappoint and feels really natural. All cast did a rather good job IMO. Very good cinema. Highly recommended!",

As supporting characters, seeing Jon hamm and Jennifer Connelly in the same movie felt surreal. It's not often Hollywood gets it this right with so many opportunities to go wrong. A masterpiece.",

If you think, you're dead.\"It really makes you feel connected to the character journey's.The suspense makes it an amazing movie to watch, but sometimes it is just\nto predictable which kinda feels like you are spoiling the movie for yourself.But overall it is an amazing journey and a solid 8.5 for me!",

The Football scene Vs the VolleyBall scene.The only thing creative was Penny Benjamin, that's was only a name whispered in the first 15mins of the original.Was expecting a lot more.

But all feels Extremely Stupifying when Tom Cruise hits the screens and for no wonder why he insisted not to use CGI instead all actors were in a cockpit flying jets, because this film deserve to be seen big screen as possible and for it's outstanding Visual/Cinematography made you feel like you are in the cockpit.

Heck, I even watched the original Top Gun over the weekend in preparation. To say that I have been anxiously awaiting this, or, that I have been anticipating this to be \"THE movie\" of 2022 is an understatement.So, the question is: \"How was it?\"Hmmm. How should I put it?Well, to start with, I won't tell you whether or not I cried. No, you'd just laugh at me anyway, like Eli does when I cry in movies. No, I won't tell you whether I cried (or how many times). Instead, I'll tell you that Eli cried. Twice.How about the action? I'll refer you to the King-Schreifels article published earlier today in The Ringer. I'm serious - if you're planning on seeing this movie, that article is a must-read background piece to help you understand what you've watching. The TLDR is that Tom Cruise insisted that this movie have no CGI and no green screen shots of the fighter jets. This is the real thing, and it is adrenaline pounding, tension building, fingernails-clutching-the-seat-handles, get your heart pumping movie.How does it compare to other movies? Did Eli & I enjoy this? How can I best describe it? Let me say this: I'm filing a formal complaint against IMDB and considering even filing a lawsuit. You see, when I went to rate this movie, IMDB disallowed me from giving it the proper rating that it deserves. Oh sure, IMDB would allow me to give it a measly \"10 stars\" but that does not do this movie justice. It needs not 10, not 11, but 12 stars to do it justice.On that note, I've made a decision. I'm cancelling Netflix, Paramount +, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime. We have no more need of them. I'll also be purging my Vudu library of all movies except for Top Gun, and soon, of course, Top Gun - Maverick. I *might* consider keeping other Tom Cruise movies, simply out of respect for The Master.From now, every time I'm tempted to watch hot garbage like Braveheart, Gladiator, or The Dark Knight, I'll be watching Top Gun - Maverick instead. No doubt you're asking yourselves \"What about The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption??\" Pshaw. There is no longer any need for watching those poorly made pieces of trash. The Shining or Avengers: Endgame? No! Disgusting! NO!!! Nothing else is worthy when you have an opportunity to watch Top Gun - Maverick.Thank you, Josiah, my 22 year old son, for suggesting that I purchase an AMC A+ pass. It will allow me to see Top Gun - Maverick for free multiple times this summer.Now the only remaining question is, will your mother still love me if I go to see it every single day all summer?Oh, and, finally, I suggest watching it in IMAX. It was shot with made-special-for-this-movie IMAX cameras.Viva Tom Cruise! Viva! We are all unworthy.",

But whatever amount of money was spent on special effects, real life fighter jet footage and scenery.....the ball was completely dropped on 90% of the supporting cast the Director forgot to connect the audience to.The other Top Gun pilots, bless their hearts, they tried. But they should have been kept in the Hallmark movie realm and not brought into a summer blockbuster alongside Tom Cruise. Will you care where this crew of Top Gun cadets are in 10 years? Nope, and neither will I. Nobody is knocking Cruise, Ed Harris and Jon Hamm....all of them do end up saving the movie somewhat from ending up in the dust bins of the $2.99 DVD's at your local gas station in a few years.The groupthink on this has been pretty annoying too. Post a take like this on social media and you get ripped apart. I'm just glad I was able to see other 3-star reviews here on IMDB that felt exactly the way I did. The campy plot, the Star Wars ripoff scene where they show how exactly the target will be hit, and every other cringe-worthy bits of bad acting, glaring plot holes and all around disappointment.I have no interest in ever seeing this movie again. Sad because I loved Top Gun growing up and have easily watched it 100 times. I wanted so badly to see that blockbusters were back post-pandemic, they could be well rounded, have some superior acting and even few plot holes. Sadly, there are few redeeming qualities to bring me back to this. I'm thankful I didn't drop $30 on this with my SO in the theatres.... I think I would have been rightfully pissed off. $2 Redbox on a Saturday night was enough for me to say \"never again\".I.",

That didn't stop me from watching the original at least 100 times from childhood to now. I grew up with the original, that's for sure. Between Top Gun and the various video games about jets, I LOVED everything about it.Fast forward to about a year or so ago, when the Top Gun: Maverick trailer first hit the big screen, my eyes widened and my mouth flew open I was so excited. I had a stupid smile on my face the whole time that trailer was on screen. Now, the sequel is out and I can say without a doubt it was EXACTLY what I was expecting and blew past that line going mach 10. It played beautifully into the original, continuing the stories of Maverick and Goose, each in their own special ways. With almost 40 years passing since the original, and the technology that came along with it, they made an absolute masterpiece of a movie that will be sure to please anyone who loved the original. I know I was grinning like a fool for most of that movie, and when I wasn't, I was gripping my seat with anticipation. I'm going to see it again soon, that's for sure.",

However, a few things are pretty predictable. But still two good hours at the cinema! Of course, the effects are AMAZING and obviously, you feel the 36 years gap between the two movies haha. A real pleasure for your eyes, but also for your ears with Hans Zimmer's music and some old songs we hear in the first movie.

It's just a nightmare.(semi-spoiler) There's no goddamn way that the US Navy would command a mission like that, it's dangerous and bizarre for no reason at all. Who cares if you can destroy the \"\"\"\"\"enemy\"\"\"\"\"\" weapons if you expose them that way with 3/4 jets and 8 of your best pilots in their territory?And FINALLY, the most atrocious one. Every single scene with Jennifer Connelly it's absolutely cringing and anti-climatic. Nor that I dislike her or anything. But she and Mavericks look like two dolls trying to impersonate some Harmony book story, it's totally laughable and it really destroys the movie's credibility. There's no passion or chemical, nothing similar to Maverick and Charlie, everything it's bland and patinated.Except for these points, the film it's enjoyable and kinda funny. I loved the piloting scenes, they're really well-made and realistic. The nostalgic elements don't really bother me at all, I think they're just a little homage to the previous episode, trying to bring the attention of the older ones without boring the youth viewers.Tom was good, and his character didn't withered.It's unfortunate that they ruined a decent movie like this just cause of shallow writing.",

Another reviewer mentioned it brought back memories of childhood, same here buddy!Disclaimer: I'm a career active duty USAF fighter aircraft mechanic.

You can tell there was a lot of effort put into the flight scenes which is why you should see it on the big screen. Tom Cruise is THE movie star of the last half century. They somehow made a war movie that stays away from any politics. The casting is great. The audience I saw it with on early access Tuesday made it fun. If you want an escape from the grueling topics of today, I highly recommend going to your local theater. I'd watch this by myself, on a date, or with the family.

On multiple occasions aviators simply disobey orders with no repercussions. An example is Rooster being ordered to return to ship but instead attempts to rescue Mav resulting in being shot down. Or Maverick being grounded and yet procuring a plane and flying.The mission itself is ludicrous. For some reason the U. S. doesn't want to use pilotless aircraft or missiles. So, the planes must fly under radar really, really fast to avoid detection. However, right before the attack a massive Tomahawk missile attack blasts the nearby airfield but not any of the SAM sites. There also was no plan as to rescuing any aviator who might be shot down or providing any combat air patrol for protection if enemy bandits should appear.I would increase my rating to five stars for anyone who has not seen the original but as a companion to Top Gun is thing is bad.",

This film has everything you would expect from an absolutely terrific film; Action, love, wit, twists, drama, suspense, sadness and joy.

With borrowed lines, music, character arcs, and plot devices from the original \"Top Gun\" film, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" was heavy handed with its nostalgia. The flight sequences were an adrenaline rush for sure and the in-flight camera work was impeccable. However, the film seemed more like a reboot of the original with a new mission for the next generation and just another opportunity for Tom Cruise to show-off. I was really looking forward to this film, but came away feeling disappointed.",

This is why we pay and go to the cinema. It was well worth the 30 year wait! My only gripes with the movie were the survival of Maverick after his test plane explodes at Mach 10. I find it hard to believe you'd eject and survive that, and the Tomcat taking off on such a short runway (minus a carrier catapult) were my only 2 major gripes. But it's a movie after all and I loved every minute of it. Can't wait to see it again. Hollywood take note!",

            "content": "Top gun: Maverick is a cinema masterpiece. It finds the perfect balance of action sequences and character development. The action is exciting and meaningful, it does not fall victim in the way many films do by overdoing the action with new technology, rather focuses on making it realistic and delivering it in a way that suits the film. The action in the film, of which there is a lot, is a complement to the overarching plot and does not hold the plot up on its own. The way the film carefully constructs relationships among characters allows for a compelling dynamic and for the audience to care about the characters. The acting is superb with an excellent casting selection. The way the film weaves in a love story without making it feel redundant or unmeaning-full is impressive, and it tremendously benefits the film by providing balance and a time for the audience to relax. Each part of the film felt distinguished and each part was exciting in its own way. The exposition was creative in the way the character was introduced, as it allowed the audience to rather than be told about Maverick by watching him in action, pushing himself to the limits and never giving up. What I would consider key parts of the character's identity. This method of delivering information about Maverick is exciting in comparison to many expositions which often focus on learning about the character in a past tense. The 3rd act had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, managing to stray from typical endings and give the audience something fresh and unpredictable. Complementing the fantastic plot and characters, the cinematography is breathtaking. From the first scene which utilizes creative shots to give the film a fresh feel about it, to the end action scenes which are beautifully captured in a way which lets the audience clearly understand what is going on. The action is captured so clearly it leaves no room for conclusion and makes the whole film flow perfectly. In conclusion Top Gun: Maverick was an unbelievable film, comprised of an amazing cast and inspiringly written. It uses creative cinematography to capture the breathtaking action sequences without feeling unrealistic, it is certainly one of the all time greatest action films.",

I got a rush like I have never felt before in a movie setting. Ithough it was much better than the first. Obviously the dog fight scenes are absolutely better. It was the story and how they tied the first movie in with this. I liked this because it wasn't about the sex appeal of the characters. It was not aimed that way. The characters played age appropriate roles. Many movies have either entertainment value or a good story line. Not usually both. This has both..you feel your adrenaline rushing as the planes take off.. I just re saw the first one again.the second one has more of story behing it. The way they tie the first and second togwas done so well. I would recommend this to anybody who has dreams of flying. I would go see this. Tom cruise never ages and is fantastic.",

How do you eject out of aircraft travelling at mach 10 and not die....or at the very least suffer spine compression ? Why didn't the 2 dozen cruise missiles launched at the airfield instead target the main target in the mountain ? Why didn't Rooster remove his ejector seat safety pins before declaring the seat had \"malfunctioned\" when he needed to bang out? Why did Pete keep asking Goose to talk to him constantly ? A few other annoying gaffs I could mention but as I said, overall , a good old gung ho romp with plenty of American Hoo Raa moments to split up the excellent flying scenes . 8/10.",

The blockbuster film which has not been on the screens of our cinemas for a long time is very distinguished. Joseph in my opinion wanted to rewrite this storyline with a good script and not lose the action. I think he did great.Every actor has his place. Lieutenant Bradley (Miles Teller) was especially distinguished for me. He well felt his hero who lost his father and perfectly conveyed the whole picture to the audience. In terms of aerial photography, the film was a success. This is especially felt on the screens of large cinemas, every turn of the fighter makes you empathize and turn your head for it, and in moments of overload, the pilots themselves seem to stop breathing.The film definitely appeared in the list of my favorite action films, but it is worth noting that it is necessary to watch it on the big screen, as the sound and effects are transferred there much better.",

So, the collective wisdom of iMDBers is that this spin-off (it would be a stretch to call it a sequel) is better than the original. Better than one of the most iconic movies of all time? Does that sound right to you?Let's explore that. I recall a critic - I think Lindsay Ellis - noting that, \"once you understand that Top Gun is a sports movie, everything makes sense.\" And of course she was right. Top Gun deserves to be judged not against Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, but against Bull Durham and (particularly) Escape to Victory.So, when I sat down to watch Maverick, I was expecting Rocky II - only set in the National Fighter-plane League. What I got instead was a quest movie. Cruise seemed to be playing some kind of Aragorn/Gandalf character - leading some mostly-indistinguishable Hobbits/Dwarves/Top Gun graduates to Mordor where they were to roll inverted, start their descent into the cracks of Mount Doom and fire laser-guided munitions at Sauron's uranium enrichment plant. And at the end, Cruise flew off into the Grey Havens with Penny Benjamin in a P51-D, leaving Samwise Goose in Fallon Naval Air Station where he would be elected as Mayor seven times. Or something.And that, for me, is a problem. I love a good quest movie. But the first movie was about Cruise's cheeky grin, Kilmer strutting like a rooster, bumping your head, shagging your teacher and winning the fighter plane cup. Top Gun: Maverick has none of that. It's got fighter planes in it, but other than that it has nothing in common with the original. It's not even of the same genre.Talking of fighter planes, the real star of the original was not Cruise, but the F-14. It's a spectacularly beautiful aircraft, but more importantly it can act. A sweep of the swing wing is as iconic as Roger Moore raising quizzical eyebrow. And as technically proficient as FA-18 is, its acting vocabulary consists of engaging and disengaging after-burner. That's fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. The FA-18 it lacks star quality.All in all, Top Gun: Maverick is fine. It's just fine. Visually stunning. I enjoyed it. But as no point did it make me grin from ear to ear like the original still does today.I am a devotee of the original movie - to the point that I reckon I could recite the entire script off by heart. And here's the thing: in thirty-six years time, there'll be nobody out there that can recite the entire script of Maverick. Or even think of memorable quote. Or at least not one that isn't directly lifted from it's infinitely superior original. Better than the original? Donnez moi une break.",

You don't expect fusion or intrigue, but it's still good every time.Shots of text message convos are poor cinematography. Panning over the photo of Mav and Iceman about six times is wasted space. Cliche shots abound. Character expressions and personalities are canned and might as well be CGI. \"Dad and 'son' wrenching together\" shot made me cringe-how cheesy can you get? There are countless scenes like this. Are we in the zombie apocalypse that so few others seemed to notice this? I watched this again with my wife recently and she, not a movie aficionado, cringed outwardly, without my prompting.Looping back around to the positives: no political agendas! Tom Cruise, way to go, you've brought all of America together around a movie by not clobbering viewers with divisive agendas. That alone brought this film from 5 to 7 stars. Hollywood take note. A distinctly subpar, cliche movie got ridiculously high ratings, and one of the primary reasons was that it united people instead of dividing them.But let's be clear. The original was groundbreaking. I'm in my thirties and I'm saying that. Top Gun: Maverick was like a nice daydream.",

The training flights for the mission were in my view a bit too short, only showing that Maverick hits target after target. I wished it would have a been a bit longer like the scene in the first movie with Maverick and Viper.The acting was good overall, maybe a third movie could be done with Rooster, Hangman and the rest of the gang being teachers at Top Gun.",

Beautifully written. And the cinematography was, well, literally breathtaking. The original Top Gun (1986) was classic. Top Gun: Maverick for me was, freaking LEGENDARY. To answer your question, \"Did Maverick live up to the hype?\" Umm...an understatement.",

            "content": "Like a lot of Gen Xer's, I was captivated and enthralled by the original. This had a lot to live up to, and some big shoes to fill. It did not disappoint. Just like the original, the viewer is immersed in spinning, plummeting scenes filled with action, tension and a bit of humor peppered in. Tom Cruise is at his best, and like all his movies, throws his heart and soul into the production. No longer the young, cocky colt, he is now the experienced stallion who teaches and leads the herd of wild pilots fearlessly and selflessly. In the first movie, his character was confident to a fault, taking risks for his own ego and chasing the ghost of his father. Now, we see him matured, wise and still full of amazing feats. With only one ghost from his past to face, he is the epitome of the hero's journey come full circle.I wasn't sure about the storyline at first, but it does commit to closure and yet continue the legacy of canon.Val's role is tear jerking and genuine.Bravo, this is what we were aching for to arrive. Even though we streamed this at home, we found ourselves clapping with joy at the end credits. A sequel is difficult to master, but this is polished, worthy of the original, and a true gift from Tom Cruise.",

There is a lot of clich\u00e9s, borrowed from other movies, including the mission scene that imitates Star Wars. The acting is mediocre, and I found Tom Cruise's pitch black hair, very distracting. Jon Hamm who looks younger than Tom has signs of grey hair to suit his age but Tom looks like an ageing old man trying to look like one of his students.It's a good popcorn movie especially for the visual effects but the story and acting is flat. Would I watch it again? No!",

Which we as viewers accepts even if script is not fully convincing. This has got Tom cruise, his action, his charm ( which still exists ) & what you need. Dam buster was made beyond its time. It is still equally watchable considering that times technology. A Great War movie. This is rather not classified as war since no war time is reffered. A regular action thriller with big budget & star cast. One time watch for old sake. It will not bore you but it is also not a special one!",
