Even though we have bunch of stars in the cast, Vikram shines out everyone, at the same time everyone's space is kept well...\nMovie has lot of Easter eggs from the beginning to end. Lot of reference to Lokesh and Kamal movie references.The movie is surprise sequel to \"kaithi\".Lokesh compromised little bit in master, here its full and full Lokesh show with mass moments. First half Kamal is there in very few scenes only, but shown as much as possible shades of him. The first half belongs to Fahad and VS. The interval block with Vikram BGM ending is ultimate. The first half is kind of perfect version of \"valimai\".Second half is filed with action sequences. The Milk fight scene and climax Kaithi fights are top notch. Movie has more gore and violent graphics...Lokesh handled the second half brilliantly and balanced with all cast perfectly. Very big Kudos to Lokesh... Climax Surya's cameo and Other surprises are claps worthy....\nMust watch for everyone and Repeat watch for Kamal/movie fans.Getting ready for the next show.",

            "content": "The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kamal Hassan starrer \"Vikram\" has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with \"Maanagaram (2017)\", \"Kaithi (2019)\" and \"Master (2021)\", all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.3-time National Award winner for Best Actor Kamal Hassan stars as a grieving father heartbroken at the loss of his son, who was a policeman investigating the burgeoning drug mafia in Chennai and who had, before his mysterious murder, uncovered a staggering cache of illegal drugs the syndicate safeguarded . Enter Fahadh Faasil, a black ops specialist charged with unraveling the mystery around the carnage unleashed by the cartel as a result. Vijay Sethupathi stars as the head honcho of the vicious and vengeful mafia operation and is first shown to the audience in one of the most intricately weaved, deliciously bonkers intro sequences for an antagonist in recent memory.It is testament to Lokesh Kanagaraj's directorial genius that he manages to give his three lead actors enough room to develop their characters and build a connect with the viewers. If it is Sethupathi's quirky eccentricities that catch the eye, Fahadh's intensity weaves a subplot of its own while Kamal excels in the emotional sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj had told us to rewatch his classic \"Kaithi (2019)\" before we went to theaters to watch \"Vikram\" and with good reason, with the two movies being intricately connected and seemingly leading up to an extensive LKU-A mouth-watering Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe! A fantastic cameo from superstar Suriya is the cherry on the cake, with the actor looking the most stylish and massy he has in years!The director's penchant for crime thrillers, retro music and biryani continues to hold good for \"Vikram\" with Anirudh Ravichander's music rendering a soaring sheen to the narrative being built. The callbacks and references to old Kamal classics blend smoothly with the storytelling and are never jarring or contrived. The actor's phenomenal voice modulation and expressive eyes elevate even simple sequences to another level, especially his interactions with his toddler grandson.Master stunt choreographer duo Anbariv continue the same rich vein of form they displayed in the KGF franchise, but this time sacrificing the larger canvas for more close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat in tight spaces. Girish Gangadharan's cinematographer is other-worldly as usual, soaking up the bone-crunching action in all its glory. Editor Philomin Raj also deserves praise for ensuring that a movie with a seemingly daunting 3 hour run-time is never boring at any stretch.While you might see many of the plot's twists coming, the visual grammar, treatment and picturization takes your breath away, nevertheless. \"Vikram\" is yet another endeavor from a superstar fanboy that pays rich dividends, along the lines of Prithviraj's Mohanlal tribute \"Lucifer (2019)\", Karthik Subbaraj's Rajnikanth-starrer \"Pettah (2019)\" as well as Amal Neerad's ode to Mammootty, \"Bheeshma Parvam (2022)\". Highly recommended! Long live the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe!",

            "content": "Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146 minutes of running timeThe film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them. This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business. Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission to rid the nation of the drug menace.Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.",

The police hire a shadow gang to find them out and the drama unfolds.There is style, unimaginable action sequences, Thrill , suspense and all of this performed by some of the most talented actors Indian houses right now. Fafa gets to play the most interesting part as he transforms with the movie. There is a journey to his submission to the lawless justice and when you have an actor of Faasil's calibre it only becomes hauntingly beautiful.

            "content": "Lokesh is one of my favorite director and my favorite film of him is Master, it was Awesome combination of storytelling, emotions and Fan service of Vijay.Here, I guess Lokesh was trying to live his childhood dream and encorporated everything he loves in a single movie and tried to make it the greatest movie of all time but he only succeeded partially. As a Refrence I would like to say 'he was trying to make a Guy Ritchie film with a SS Rajamouli film with a Michael Bay film with with a Quentin Tarantino film' all four in one along with full tribute and Fan service to kamal hasan & full utilisation of Fahadh Faasil. In the process he went into overkill mode & as a result the film visually looks Awesome with some great mass moments but that's about it, you take nothing home with you. You don't care about the story or the characters much, you just wait for the next mass moment and action scene. Also in trying to tick so many boxes he wasted awesome Vijay Sethupathi ,who was phenomenal in Master but he had nothing much to do in this film, he was just a generic villian whose only role was to growl looking at the camera.Now I am going to talk a bit about SPOILERS for those who have seen the movie, and for those who haven'tSPOILER ALERTEveryone's Excited about Surya's cameo, his character was build up like he was the boss of all bosses; but I didn't feel one bit intimidated or intrigued by his presence.Instead of the star presence and the gravity that he has there was nothing new or exciting about his character, he was shouting, trying to be menacing and unpredictable but his role just went flat for me. It didn't kept me hooked or Excited on how he would produce a great challenge and antagonist to Kamal Hasan's character in the next part, it just looked like Surya was trying to play a drug addict mob boss villian.All in all it's a decent watch for Kamal Hasan, Fahadh Faasil some action sequences and mass moments but nothing more than that.",

            "content": "The greatest challenge for Lokesh Kanagaraj, as a filmmaker, wasn't just to offer several hoot-worthy moments for fans of Kamal Hassan, but to come up with a first-of-its-kind pure action film featuring a trio of actors who are known for their spectacular performances. His packaging totally delivers, with a fantastic outing for all the guys involved. Plotwise speaking, Vikram is basically The Batman set in Chennai. A serial killer is on the loose, and a special ops team is tasked with finding the culprit. While that's just one way of putting it across, Vikram is a lot beyond that. It's also about a father avenging his son's death, and a massive drug bust; it's also about gangsters, special agents, and rogue cops - Lokesh's universe-building skills are excellent!I'm SO GLAD Lokesh chose these actors to play their respective roles. Vijay Sethupathi's antagonist act is even more menacing than the one in Master, and when he's high, he's next-level. Fahadh Faasil essentially holds the proceedings together in the first half, in a solid feat that keeps getting better. As for Hassan, this is a film where the director just lets him run amok, going absolutely wild in the set-pieces. Speaking of the set-pieces (choreographed by Anbariv), these are some of the most well-crafted and staged works you'll see in an Indian film in a good while. DOP Girish Gangadharan captures all the pyro-filled beauty of the action, while also using close-ups to pick up the subtler expressions of the dashing trio.And there is no Vikram without Anirudh Ravichander, whose remarkable music and background score elevate the film to greater heights. The riff-filled theme music is one that'll stay on my playlist for a pretty long time. The editing by Philomin Raj ensures a certain pace to the film's events, even when it shows signs of slowing down. Suriya's late entry sparks even more delight when he's playing a full-blown baddie, with chances of him squaring off against Dilli (from Kaithi) all the more possible now. Yes, (re)watch Kaithi before seeing Vikram for an enhanced universe-building experience.",

            "content": "Filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj uses the talent of actors Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and Kamal Haasan brilliantly in his latest venture Vikram.Vikram is a befitting comeback of Kamal Haasan to satiate his fans' 4-year-long hunger to see him on the big screen. The title Vikram is borrowed from the actor's own film which released in 1986. However, the story is set in director Lokesh Kanagaraj's cinematic universe wherein he has interlinked characters from his previous directorial Kaithi and the old Vikram. The music of the film is composed by Anirudh Ravichander and the dialogues are written by Rathna Kumar along with the director.Lokesh Kanagaraj has loaded Vikram with a battalion of characters but he has ensured that all of them have their due scope to perform, even though some might have lesser screen time including 'Ulaga Naayagan'.This simply shows his prowess as a writer who values his story over simply paying the fanboy tributes to his guru Kamal Haasan for the sake of it. But that doesn't mean there is a dearth of mass moments for his favorite star. Every time Kamal makes his entry, the background music with Anirudh's voice - 'Once upon a time, there lived a ghost' - feels electrifying, quite literally.Vikram truly comes alive post the adrenaline-filled interval scene. Action is Lokesh's forte and the second-half has impressive stunts (stunt directors are Anbariv masters) and a superior camera work by Girish Gangadharan.Watching Kamal Haasan, who is apparently 67 years old but certainly doesn't look that way on screen in this all new action avatar takes one back in time to the early days of the actor's career - younger and dapper.The film is in a way an ode to the veteran actor with umpteen number of references from his older films like Kuruthipunal, Panchatanthiram, and Nayakan. Dark humour to detailing, all departments of Vikram have worked in unison to render a massive salute to the exemplary filmography of the legendary Kamal Haasan.On the other hand, Vijay Sethupathi is remarkable as Santhanam especially in his whistle worthy and quirky introduction scene. Though it was refreshing to see him try out something new shedding off his usual Sethupathi-ness, his tight-lipped dialogue delivery instead of coming across as an interesting characterization was only a major distraction.However, Fahadh Faasil steals the show with an all round performance exhibiting passion, love and revenge at perfect levels.Kamal Haasan is, as has been emphasized already, fabulous. Vijay Sethupathi fleshes out an edgy criminal whose frazzled heart and addled mind push him in startling directions. Fahadh Faasil sails through his role with such aplomb that one can never have enough of him. How tantalizing is the prospect that the consummate show-stealer will be back to reprise the role - repeatedly hopefully - as the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe expands and moves into the future!",

The film is a complete commercial paisa wasool movie.First half of the movie is fantastic. Fahadh Faasil is the best young actor in today's time according to me. He has done a superb job. Vijay Setupathy is a gem of an actor. I loved his entry scene here. No other actor can pull up this entry scene as he has done it. Other star cast is also very much suitable and provide a good support. First half belongs to FaFa and Vijay.While, the second half is a treat for Kamal Haasan fans. Ulaga Nayagan- Kamal Haasan is extremely good in the post interval portion. You will be surprised to see him firing constantly from the giant machine gun. That scene is on another level.Though, one may find first half awesome and second half a bit stretched. I found that there are some surprises in the later half, but there are a few blunders too. But just a few. Like I didn't get the scene of child re-breathing.Special mention to the actress who played the role of a maid. She is superb.Lokesh's direction is improving gradually. This film will be considered his finest directorial product. He has done a fine job, without getting caught by the idea of too much slow-motion, which many people hate including me, and which were too much in KGF. Though, this film is different from RRR and KGF, it can be compared with Pushpa. As part 2 is coming here too. People are going to love Surya as the bad guy in part two. Just a glimpse of him in the end was terrific.Anirudhha has done his job superbly once again. The title theme music is on my mind while I'm writing this. Extraordinary music with a catchy tune is what Anirudhha offers to you!On the whole, a must watch movie in theaters. This is how a good commercial south indian movie looks like.

There is drugs & gangsters with politicians. Then there is a suspense that is so diluted that you know it from the very beginning what it is because of the casting. When the actor become bigger than the story, the story loses it's value, shine & life. The director tried to make it a show with unnecessary style but it is played so many times in films. The story is bland and has nothing new to offer not even any moments to remember. The VFX is below par even for a Tamil film. The music & the lyrics are worse than the screenplay. The teaser that was shown of the film was a show. Nothing in the film resonated with the teaser. The teaser was excellent with Kamal getting ready to feed a lot of big shots probably gangsters at the same time gets ready with guns and ammunitions. So the teaser was a fluke.Why does Kamal Hassan's face look so much filled with VFX or make up? It looked bad in the trailer itself. Make him look his real self! I am in awe of Vijay Sethupathi's expressions. His first I watched was Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom. While actors go for 6 pack and body transformations to show off themselves (and not their acting skills) Sethupathi's physique has never come in between his class acting. Sethu should stop taking such films. He's already done Vikram Vedha & Master with similar roles. Fahad is a brilliant actor as well but he is so good in dramas more than such action films especially Malayalam dramas.Aniruddh's music has always been more of a copy of what has been already heard be it using Ilayaraja's old music for his 'famous' Why this kolaveri d or be it here the lullaby that has so much resemblance to the opening credit song from Nayakan - Thenpandi Cheemayile. The music is a huge dud. I hate the way films say 'an aniruddh musical'. That's what you say about Ilayaraja or A. R. Rahman. This boy hasn't come out with any music that has transcended boundaries and with the kind of music he produces, I doubt he ever will.If they are going for a sequel, hope they write better.

This turned out to be a typical mass masala movie involving gangsters, corrupt police officials whom the hero literally mows down using a WW-I era machine gun. I wish I could get back those 3 hours of my life, my money and my dead brain cells.Needless to say, this is going to be my last kamal movie. If you're a die-hard kamal fan who doesn't care about others think and wants to kill some time watching this in a theater, go for it.",

How does he successfully defeat the gang of Santhanam, forms the rest of the story.Performance wise, Kamal and Fahad Fasil have done their part good. If first half of the film is dominated by Fahad Fasil, second half of the film is dominated by Kamal Hassan. Vijay Sethupathi's villain role could have been better as comparing his role in \"Master\", the villain role in this film seems to be weak.The film has surprise cameo roles connected with director's previous films. The film has got good production values but screenplay of the film is simple and many twists are quite predictable.Direction wise, the film is not as good as edge of the seat thriller \"Kaithi\" nor it is not as bad as \"Master\".

After KGF: Chapter 2, it was Vikram, which I loved a lot. Be it the cast performance, cinematography, editing and direction, everything was picture-perfect and top-notch\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffdThere were lots and lots of Wowww moments in the film. In the first half, Actor Fahadh Fasil sir completely steals the show through his macho body and eyes. Vijay Sethupathi too steals the show as menacing villain. He made me to hate his character. Such a splendid performance.Second Half- Completely belongs to our Aandavar! None other than our great Kamal Hassan ayya. Our Ulaga Nayakan sir! Lots of goosebumps and firy moments\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25The song Naayakan meendum varaan was really a worth. It's a mass comeback of our great Ulaganayakan. Pathala Pathala gave me vibes.The way Lokesh sir links the scenes with Kaithi was massy and superb. Supporting actors- Narain sir, Arjun Das sir, Harish Uthaman sir and the rest had limited screen to share. However, they left an impact through their intensity. I felt there is some connection between Kaithi and this film. Let's wait and watch. In the end, Suriya sir's cameo appearence is another big highlight. Everyone must watch his scene.So, coming to the direction, I loved Lokesh sir's way of linking the plot. After Kaithi, this was the film, I loved the most along with his Master and Maanagaram. Lots of twists and turns are there in the film.Music and BGM by Anirudh Anna was awesome\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffbAnd coming to the stunt sequences by Anbariv Anna. They have given lots of soul and efforts to this film. Especially the gun scene in the climax. It was more goosebumps than KGF: Chapter 2, where the same was shot. Enna, anga Periyappa! Inga namma Vikram sir! Avlo thaan. But, marana mass scene. The film have inspired me to work on different stories in the storymirror alongside KGF: 2 and Tenet.My rating: 5/5\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udca5Worth a watch nanbargale. As I said, \"Sirapaana tharamaana sambavam irukku.\" Kollywood would go to the Pan-India level with the help of our Ulaga Nayakan ayya and this is an inspiration for me as an aspiring and upcoming film director of Kollywood. If KGF: Chapter 2 inspired me to work on gangster genres and create a similar universe of those, Vikram is in top-notch. It had inspired me to think to next level of developing and thinking spy stories. A new path for innovative screenplays. Thank you Lokesh sir! Thank you so much for giving us a memorable film. Keep making films like this!\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5",

            "content": "This is probably the first-ever spin-off kinda film that too with so many top actors playing in it and luckily it has also worked very well.The plot isn't so intriguing but the screenplay and twists & turns of so many characters all over the film are something that has worked really well, especially the Agent Tina character came as a huge surprise and the linkage of Kaithi as the film happening in the same timeline is something that keeps us hooked and finally the Surya character although being so shuttle, it gives a very good lead for the sequel.Another spin-off like this could be the journey of the Rayappan character from Bigil, this probably might take Vijay's status to some other level but only time will tell if it'd happen at all.Irumugan/Lucy kinda drug sequences with Vijay Sethupathi aren't so attractive to have in the film unless they got portrayed by him so differently starting from the introduction of auto balti action sequence.And most importantly, the possibility of having so many spin-offs with marvels like Loki-universe(LCU) is something that could take this Tamil cinema to a wholly different level. This is supposedly the start of Tamil cinema's upward journey.Kamal is the only top actor who's comfortable in sharing screen space with co-actors in the industry to a greater extent which is why this film has paid him off so handsomely after a very very long time, its good to see that his ambitions would grow further in delivering a quality film that takes up the industry standards.And not to mention, the real hero of the film is Anirudh, the BGM and the soundtracks are nothing but just his best and totally exceptional ones, this is probably the rock star's best, IMAO.",

            "content": "As much as I enjoyed this movie, I still feel like this shouldn't have been a Kamal Haasan movie.Kamal has had a string of great movies recently... With Unnaipol Oruvan; a dialogue-heavy movie where the conflict required no excessiveness, with Vishwaroopam; a movie while flawed, was ambitious enough to take Tamil cinema to a non-Tamil accustomed front, with Uttama Villain; one of Kamal Haasan's best movies to date that is one of the very few movies in this exaggerated industry to consciously portray cinema as an actual art form, with Papanasam; one of the most simplest, yet a brilliantly made thrillers, with Thoongavanam; a movie that seemed to rid itself of every cliche that plagues the Tamil cinema industry (this includes the runtime as well), and Vishwaroopam 2; well.... Vishwaroopam 2 never happened.And after 4 years, we have a new Kamal Haasan movie; which while enjoyable by Tamil cinema standards, doesn't have the ambitions and the cinematic progressiveness that Kamal movies have had. It was very well written, especially in its first half, but ultimately ends up being a Tamil action movie and I need not asterisk anything. The energy of the movie never waned and while it did seem like the writers hyped the story into a cliche third act, the movie holds up well, very well in fact, in the entertainment box.Overall, I'd rather have seen this movie with some other actor since I feel like this macho persona is best left for someone that is not Kamal Haasan... not that he's bad at it, he actually did a stellar job, but because as of right now, he's the only big name Tamil actor to push the boundaries of this cursed industry. The last thing I'd want from him is the usual Tamil archetype overpowered Super Saiyan freak that we've seen a million times.",

If you are used to watching decent global crime detective thrillers, even some classic national/regional ones, then avoid this movie by all possible means. Total time waste.",

            "content": "*Vikram 2*_A Review by Rajesh Puvvada_*A* Tamil movie release in Pune on a working day. One would expect empty seats and a few loyal fans. I was pleasantly surprised when many fans were patiently watching the board with words \"Cleaning in Progress\". Lower level seats got filled up, and I made sure of that, when we all stood up for the National Anthem. People were a *plenty.**N* arcotics mafia gang movies have a common theme, gory ways of killing people. Intelligent ways of escaping, and the good guys finish up winning after many bruises. My original feeling was it is yet another Narcos extension. My feeling got crushed, when the movie starts with a search. A search to demystify an undercover agent. Amar(Fahad Fazil) the good cop tries to demystify the undercover a serial killing pattern, but realises it is a much bigger and a sinister plan behind it. He realises the serial killing spree was triggered by the capture of a Raw Narcotic *bounty*.*D* etermined to demystify, he travels to a great extent and finds out the various facets of Karnan (Kamal), who is actually is a victim of the serial killing. And that way we miss Kamal most of the first half of the movie. Amar's path crosses with Sandhanam (Vijay sethupathy) a quack, meth cook and a terrible gangster. The entry of Sandhanam is not from a glittering higher end automobile, but from a normal rickety auto rickshaw. The entry was really different, bear and very intriguing. Sandhanam's trade mark teeth line and his lip position to reveal it adds to the gory face lift. Every inch of his body and the every move of his will give you a characteristic of a thug on the move to regain his *booty.**A* nriudh's score beats all normalcy. It's the score and the power of the star cast that will let you live the movie through out. Karnan is revealed like a flickering lamp, which flickers after a long interval and over time flickers faster till it glitters brightly. The goose bump moment of the movie feels real. Even in that high octane pace of the movie, the audience clapping and whistling could not be missed. Though one can easily mark the behaviour of the audience as a first day first show mania, I sensed more *novelty.**V* ersatility at its best, is what I would sum up Kamal's performance with. No matter, whom you bring in, be it Amar, Sandhanam or Rolex (Surya), Vikram makes the entire cast look like an adorable puppy. No one can ignore an adorable puppy but one has to feel the ghost through out. Keep aside the ideologies and political inclinations, as a thespian Kamal outclasses every one in the movie. A great treat from Kamal after a long hiatus. Trust me the septuagenerian can shake a leg with a lot of ease, and he can put us all in shame. No exaggeration or a sublime performance, it was *brevity.**A* uthentic screenplay and script. Lokesh Kanakaraj does in best but stitching parts from his earlier blockbusters into this one. You will see scenes from Kaidhi snuggly nestled into this movie. The first half leaves a lot of moving parts in your mind and in the second half you will see that all those parts falling in place seamlessly. Thats the beauty of closing the loop efficiently. A lot of action in the movie, but I never felt anything superfluous, I felt it was all adding up. The introduction of the first batch of the special task force was pulsating. The revealing of the lady agent was simply outstanding, look forward for it. The metaphor used to rescue the next generation was very interesting, follow the path of the kid in the movie and you will realise what I mean by it. In the end all the twists will deliver a lot of *Clarity.**R* apid action scenes packed by Lokesh, wonderful background score of Anirudh, smart use of ageing weapons, expressive eyes of Fahad Fazil, Glittering teeth of Vijay Sethupathi and relentless performance of Kamal will give you all a wholesome treat. Oops! I forgot to remind you all the age of the Ulaganayagan. He is young at *Seventy*4.5/5 for the movie. A score of an infinity for Kamal. I just got my tickets booked for a repeat viewing on Sunday, and I am sure you will do many repeats.",

            "review_title": "An intense and ambitious execution that is more than \"just\" a fanboy commercial",
            "content": "With some of the greatest actors in the business, this directorial from the exceedingly talented Lokesh Kanagaraj has everything a Kamal movie has - an ambitious scale, plot-driven characters, strong technicality, and respect for the cinematic intellect of a commoner, and of course, the man himself!When a project of a mammoth scale is in development, a lot of things are at stake; there are numerous possibilities where it might not just work out. For such a project to make a victory leap, everything has to work properly, literally everything! It has to work big time and I am not just speaking about its commercial value, but its technicality, authenticity, and the culmination of every single person in the unit. Everything just has to work. And Vikram achieved every single one of these and much more than that!At first, I thought Vikram will be just another fanboy commercial, where the director might end up working \"too\" hard to make his beloved hero dance to his moves, resulting in a rather average product. However, Lokesh had other plans. And boy oh boy did he execute it in style!The \"Spin-off\" verse of Lokesh Kanagaraj - LCUThe term spin-offs, crossovers, and multiverse are not new to cinema-goers, especially the Marvel fans. However, unlike in Hollywood, it was pretty difficult to pull off something like that here in Indian Cinema. Though cameo roles by established actors are rather prevalent, it stayed mostly as an idea and did not take the next step ahead. Though there are exceptions in the horror-comedy genre, there wasn't a movie that is so true to its core plot and character development, until Lokesh came into the picture.In most of his earlier interviews, Lokesh never shied away from expressing his desire to make spinoffs and what-ifs with his favorite characters, especially Ulaganayagan's. The core concept of Kaidhi (Virumaandi) and even his last release Master (Nammavar) are great examples.So, when Kamal Haasan suggested something on the lines of his yesteryear espionage thriller (Vikram), Lokesh saw an opportunity and grabbed it like anything - the opportunity to expand his universe on a large scale, to make a multi-starrer that can lead to several other movies churning out in the future, to make it as a Lokesh Cinematic Universe.All of a sudden, everything became possible. It was possible to have a star like Suriya play an incredibly brief yet intense role in the film, it was possible to ask big actors like Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi to wait for a few more hours during the shoot, and it was possible to make a movie with one of the leading character not even appearing more than a few minutes in its entire first half! Everything seemed possible. Call it the recent OTT trend, call it the new wave but for me, the reason is the man himself - Kamal Haasan. He made it possible. He made everything possible, even though he is not there entirely, just like a GHOST!Kamal Haasan - The GhostWith a career spanning over 60 years, the impact this man-made on several individuals is purely limitless. So, whenever someone gets inspired by KH, it is as if the man is delivering himself. It takes pure guts from Lokesh to have one's beloved hero in such an introductory sequence, as the title appears. Even though KH is not there almost entirely in the first half, he is still there as a Ghost. No, I am not mentioning the narrative but the writing, in the technicality, in providing proper characterization, in providing moments for almost every character to relish on screen. As he said at an award function, it was as if he was directing the movie; he was Lokesh's ghost (Yes, it is an Interstellar reference).A 100% Lokesh Kanagaraj FilmAfter his 50% Vijay-50% Lokesh movie (Master), Lokesh promised a 100% Lokesh movie and he delivered! Right from the start, the narrative dove right into the plot. It did not deviate an inch, providing us an intense experience throughout. Every single aspect expressed on the screen is somehow a part of the narrative, which is surprising for me. To the core! I mean, even the supposedly \"Hero Introduction Song\" becomes part of the story after a while. I was expecting some emotional sequences like the ones in Kaidhi and thought Lokesh might not just succeed there but boy he surprised me there as well. Yes, there is an emotional bond between Vikram and the child but the child itself becomes part of the story and even an action-block!Learning from his mistakes of the past, Lokesh presented us with a narrative that stays true to its genre. Yes, it has romance, songs, stunt sequences, care, affection, and pain, but all of them are part of the narrative. Though seeming complex at first, the narrative opens itself slowly, offering us bread crumbs as we search through it, just as one of the characters mentions. Some might call it boring, complex, or simply a gimmick. I will call it respecting the cinematic intellect of the audience, a commoner.A Fanboy movieWhat does one expect in a fanboy movie? The celebration (and a tribute) to one particular person who is adored and worshipped by many. It should have elements that are extremely true to that person. For instance, Petta is a perfect example of a fanboy movie, where Karthik Subbaraj celebrated Rajinism like anything. Lokesh, who is an Aandavar fan (as they call him), incorporated everything a Kamal movie should have - ambitious scale, plot-driven characters, accepting that the audience is more intelligent, and having the right people with you, who share an equal love towards the same human.Often termed as an actor who speaks with his eyes, it was a great addition to have Fahadh Faasil in Vikram. He literally carried the entire first half on his shoulders, that is all about investigation and searching for bread crumbs. There is one sequence that involves him and a car driver, which was easily pulled off by the performer in Fahadh. Apart from being an extraordinary performer, he has been a constant admirer of the performer in KH. Even one of his latest releases - Malik - is a kind of ode to Nayakan and the performer in KH. Hence, I guess it was relatively easy for Lokesh to convince him to take the extra leap, for the sake of Ulaganayagan!Having already played one of the strongest antagonists ever, it was difficult for Vijay Sethupathi after Master to essay a demoniac role that has a similar intensity and yet looks different entirely. Though his role was overshadowed by other elements, his performance still stands apart from the rest, and there is something to take home, and this for me, is something good! This was a great space to make use of and Vjs utilized it to his benefit, sharing the screen space with some of the finest co-stars he could ever imagine.There is one more character I want to write about, scream about! Agent Tina! Though there were clues, I was completely taken aback by the character, and what a way to show perfect Indian espionage! Just wow! She is the Dancing Rose in this film! (Sarpatta Parambarai movie reference). But for the sake of people who are yet to watch the movie, I will keep my mouth shut, for the moment.!Though the cameo was extremely short, the gruesome nature exhibited by Suriya was something I was not prepared for. It was literally some ferocious, cold-hearted stuff from such a performer after a really long time! I am just hoping to catch on to more of his grey shades in near future. But, just for a moment, I thought, what if the Superstar himself has played the role. WHAT IF ?!The TechnicalityWith such an intense narration and most of it happening during the night, I could see the tiresome work from the entire technical crew members. With some great stunt sequences in its kitty, the twin duo of Anbariv choreographed the action scenes as close as possible to the reality, without over-the-top stunts. With great support from Girish Gangadharan (Cinematography) and Philomin Raj (Editor), the action part looked authentic and gripping enough for the audience and did not let them slip away from the narrative as well.The moment when a certain character steps out of a prostitute's room, Anirudh started playing his magic where I understood he is literally doing everything he can to make the score sound different! Be it the songs or the background score, Anirudh is still one of the major reasons why people are flocking to theatres in this OTT era.Special kudos to the ADs who were sincere enough to cover the logic loopholes as much as possible! Finally, CCTV footage looks exactly like CCTV footage!Final thoughtsOverall, it was purely a delight for cinephiles to witness the audience enjoy such a visual spectacle without many songs or hero appreciation! It's always the baby steps that matter and Lokesh took a giant leap with Vikram and I am happy that it is being received well by the audience and critics alike. I just wish this man stays for more mask-revealing years to come, and am eager to witness his growth all along!",

A subtle and tremendous performance. Fahadh in the other hand a unsung lead for the film, who untie the knots to make us more interesting. Vijay Sethupthi had the lower screen space and less performance comparing to the others. The last freaking cameo of Suriya was outstanding and a brilliant move to put on us on edge. Whole audience erupted. Now coming to the flaws the story was much predictable and screenplay was slow at some points in both first half as well as second half but overall a out and out action flick with suprise elements and terrific perfomers.

            "content": "So much excitement for VIKRAM. Based on a character of the same name from the 1986 movie VIKRAM who was a RAW Agent.The basic story here goes as Amar (Fahad) and his team of Black Squads take up the case of high-profile murders (serial killings) that eventually leads them to Santhanam (Vijay Sethupathi), a drug lord and the \"Ghost\", realizing that everything isn't what it seems to be! It's all out guns and glory from then on!The buzz for VIKRAM was there for a few years and then picked up momentum when the first teaser was released almost one and half years ago. The first teaser was just that. A tease! Director Lokesh Kanakaraj said in an interview before the release of VIKRAM that the teaser scenes were just shot to create a buzz among people. It had nothing to do with the actual movie though it gave us a taste of how the movie would be. The excitement peaked while watching with an audience comprising mostly of Tamilians and a some Malayalis. Hoots, Whistles, Cheers, Claps....it was a wild ride on and off screen. It was great to see that both Tamilians and Malayalis shouted out for both Malayalam and Tamil actors alike. No discrimination. Pure love for the actors. Just euphoria!This is one of the most stylish mass action thriller movies out there now and it has incited mass hysteria among the audience as well! One of Lokesh's best. Though his \"Maanagaram\" will always be my favorite. Followed by \"Kaithi.\" Kaithi was a ground breaking gangster movie, so fast paced, almost shot completely at night, on the road, out and out action with a sentimental thread of a father and daughter yearning to meet each other. Actor Karthi was awesome as Dilli. Now those who haven't watched \"Kaithi\", must check it out as it too has connections with this new VIKRAM. You can say Lokesh is creating his own cinematic universe, the LKCU or LCU! He has created a script that makes VIKRAM an extension of the movie \"Kaithi.\" VIKRAM is one of those rare movies that has stayed true to its genre and trailers. You watch the trailer, you get an idea of what you will be watching and you get exactly that and more with utmost satisfaction. That is quite rare nowadays, as most trailers pump you up but the movie fizzles out! Some scenes remind you of a Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez/Martin Scorcese (Scorcese is one of Lokesh's favourite Hollywood Director) style of movie making which is not bad at all because it results in visually stunning action scenes and set pieces. The movie has some of the most gruesome and creative kills and gore for an Indian movie! With excellent cinematography by our very own Girish Gangadharan, who is also a National Film Award winner for Best Cinematography for the 2019 film \"Jallikkattu\", which itself is an insanely beautiful/magical world captured on camera! Visually, Jallikattu was an immersive experience! Expected nothing less from LJP, the magician! Girish Gngadharan is also famous for his 11 minute single long take for the climax of the movie \"Angamaly Diaries\", another LJP movie.Coming to the actors, Fahad Fazil is no stranger to intense characters. His Black Squad agent Amar, is sharp, dedicated and cold blooded as well. His difficulty in maintaining a love life while keeping the nature of his job a secret, seems so genuine. The one who acts with his eyes, Fahad is in every way the perfect agent to step into Kamal's shoes, if ever the story takes that route. Fahad, as always is terrific in his role. Probably a cake walk for him. Both Fahad and Kamal has those intense eyes that tell us a million stories with one look. Kamal Haasan is back after a hiatus of almost 4 years. Vishwaroopam 2 was his last outing and it didn't do too well at the box office. Kamal once again proves why he is called \"Ulaga Nayagan\" (Universal Hero). At 67, he reprises his Secret Agent role from the 1986 movie VIKRAM. 36 years later! Though it's not ground breaking acting (not needed here) like some of his older famous characters, the moment he enters the picture, right from the beginning of the movie with the song \"Pathala Pathala\", you are mesmerized. When Kamal cries in a certain scene, you feel it too. Once upon a time, there lived a Ghost! Who is the Ghost? I'm not saying anything!Vijay Sethupathi seemed to be having a lot of fun as drug kinkpin Santhanam. A recent drug bust rattles him up and he needs to find and get it back. (This is connected to the movie, Kaithi). And that is all I will say about that! But Vijay Sethupathi was also terrific. Pretty much straight forward bad guy with certain unique nuances (a joy to watch) and a sudden jolt of power inducing drug that he pops into his system in times of need! Kalidas Jayaram had a minor role and he performed well. Surya as Rolex in a cameo role (around 5 mins) stunned everyone! He was fire on screen which resulted in the audience screming out at the top of their lungs for his mind blowing performance. Terror personified! Narain as Bejoy, also reprises his character from \"Kaithi\" and did his part well. Chemban Vinod Jose as Police Chief is also good. Vasanthi is a name and actress to look out for. I can't say anything else about that. \ud83d\ude03 Post intermission there are a few big twists and reveals that we never see coming! Never! And they are all done so well, so smooth! The 2h 26m runtime feels like a breeze! Kudos to Editor Philomin Raj. Spectacular editing as the movie is quite fast paced. Music Director Anirudh Ravichandran could be considered as a hero of the movie as well because if it wasn't for his music/bgm, VIKRAM would never be elevated to this level! What a badass backgroud score! Even when it's not about action on screen. It is already my new ringtone! The title track, incorporating the \"Vikram Vikram\" theme from the original 1986 movie is outstanding. As well as the melodius number \"Porkanda Singham...\" \"Pathala Pathala\" is a fun song to watch, though I am not a big fan of that one. Whenever there is a scene where Kamal has to walk towards or away from the screen, the Vikram.... Vikram...title song pops up and it's goosebumps!! Wow! Action by Anbariv , the stunt choreographer duo Anbu & Arivu is a class apart. Creative, unique and violent at times. There are certain action scenes that we have never seen before! Awesome!Lokesh is a Kamal fanboy and this is his fanboy moment. But what differentiates him from others is that inspite of all these 3 acting powerhouses together, it is still a Lokesh Kanakaraj movie. He did not have to conform to the mega stars' image! Which is exactly why the movie, BEAST didn't work as it should have! Lokesh has set the groundwork for a new cinematic universe with more sequels in the pipeline. Next could be Kaithi-2 or a Vikram-3 or both! After watching Vikram, thinking about the possibility of Karthi, Kamal, Fahad and Surya together in one movie peaks my interest so much! There are so many stories to be told, so many angles to be thought of! Kamal already hinted at a full fledged movie with Surya and him together. Awesome! Kamal, Fahad and Vijay Sethupathi played their roles to perfection.VIKRAM is a well designed ode to Kamal Haasan. A kick-ass, adrenaline-fuelled ode that deserves the blockbuster label it is now garnering.Watch VIKRAM in cinemas to get the full effect of a mass action movie. But brush up on Kaithi too before that. Enjoy!",

Vijay sethupathi became a clich\u00e9d villain hence didnt felt like a good act.There were some scenes which makes the audience stupid like Why kamal had to act as a bad guy infront of Kalidas' wife, Vijay sethupathi's family history (not sure why it was added), Vasanthi (agent Tina's) fight scene - she was asking to call kamal many times where she couldve called in first place,It took 10 minutes where they said regarding 3 km to reach at the end but fahad fasil managed to save the kid and appear from nowhere at the end within seconds.Surya's villain role went well but the motive remains clich\u00e9d, just to show he is the main villain the usual villain gimmick called \"kill the gang member who brought the bad news\" is applied.Like these there are many flaws and dumb scenes, however for a flick which entertains us, Vikram is enough.This movie got a long run time around 2 hours and 50 minutes, hence we can feel that at the end many scenes were cut short.If a regular movie buff who watched Better call saul, nobody, accountant, Dark night - can make out many scenes literally copied from thoseLike underground lab from Better call saul\nblack squad from nobody\nsafe house scenes from accountant\nending scenes from dark nightBottom line - a good watch in 2022\nIts coming in hotstar incase if you miss it in theatre.",

I came here looking for a suspense movie and the first half provided exactly that. Second half was all about loud stylized action, just like KGF or Pushpa.In the first half, the audience learn about characters by observing their actions and decisions. Not much is told but shown. Kamal's character and background is shrouded in mystery though. This is evident from the trailer (which too, thankfully, didn't reveal anything!)However, there are small hidden details (easter eggs) to look out for, and references to Kaithi and Kamal's previous films are fanboy moments for die hard fans. The film expects the audience to be attentive to detailThere are also some brilliantly shot scenes, revealing them would be a spoiler! Cinematography and Action Choreography join hands, are in sync, and they're way better than other films of the same genre. The songs are placed properly and don't feel like break from the plot.The story and screenplay is way too old and clich\u00e9 to be called good. This is just a massala commercial film with better suspense, cinematography, detailed action than other films of the same genre.",

            "content": "Vikram (2022) :\nBrief Review -Lokesh Kanagaraj creates a crazy universe of his own with a spiritual sequel to the 80s forgotten flick. Vikram promises more as a future franchise than the film itself. Lokesh Kangaraj's Vikram is a phenomenal idea for any cinematic universe, and surpasses many of the known universes, be it Bollywood or Hollywood. I won't take the names. No, wait, let's be clear. Whether it's Rohit Shetty's Cop Universe, YRF's Spy Universe, Marvel Cinematic Universe, or DC Extended Universe, script-wise, Vikram outperforms them all. But yes, the execution is a little faulty. The South-Driven mass elements are there to spoil its cinematic values, but those who have loved watching such films will have no issues. You have the cars flying, just like KGF 2. You have insane action like any typical south film (be it any film industry). It shows unnecessarily loud explosions on the wrong occasions, like in any outdated mass flick. Nevertheless, it still entertains you and keeps you hooked on the story. The biggest USP of the film is the assembling of three powerhouse performers. The living legend, Kamal Haasan, with two emerging legends, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil, and everyone getting equally great roles and their own shining shades. Uff.. it can't get better in a crime saga. That extra boost of Rolex Sir and Kaithi creates an irresistible atmosphere, and you can't wait long enough for the next films in LCU. With a bit of edgy finishing and stable action, Vikram would have looked more classy, but it's okay. Lokesh is too young to deliver an extraordinary mass film yet. Except for that mediocre action flick, \"Master,\" he hasn't done anything below par. Maanagaram was a tricky film for any debutant, while Kaithi was easier and more mss-friendly. With Vikram, Lokesh manages to merge two genres and two different storytelling styles, and hopefully he will get better with his upcoming film. Fingers crossed.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Kamal was probably undercover Hulk, can just one hit KO opponents with a single punch despite being a 60 year old grandpa. It was unrealistic to the core and the explosion/demolition CGI was worse than video games made in 2000s.The plot too was repetitive. Lokesh Kanagaraj already did Master with the similar plot of dealing with a drug dealer antagonist. It also casted some characters from this movie in it. Still Kanagaraj shamelessly claims that his movies are a part of a connected universe. How can a single universe have same people with different identities at the same time (like Sandhanam and Bhavani)? Vikram's fake Big Boss accent was infuriating to hear. People don't speak like a megatron in real life.Tl;Dr this movie was a tamil Michael Bay movie. It was a lot of explosions and no logic. Kamal Haasan once said \"Kathai ya araiya koodathu\".

In short, this could be a political wagon for the centrists if one keeps in mind the songs like \"Por kanda singam\" (\"Battle-experienced Lion\"). With lyrics stereotyping the slum dwellers of Chennai, I'm not sure how many more battlefields this acting king can dance in. (\"Aandavar\" = \"Ruler\" ? What was ruled in real life?)

Stop pushing everyone to watch this just cause you want a Tamil film to beat KGF/Baahubali/Dangal in collections..

I loved \"Kaithi\" movie but when I compare it with Vikram the daughter sentiment portion that Kaithi had was taking a bit more space or like mellowing down the screen play where as in Vikram we see a husband trying to save his wife , a grand father trying to save his grand son, drug lord trying to save his empire but these where handled with a subtle note such a way it didn't spoil the thriller that was unfolding in front of us. Some brilliant screen play out here.There were moments in the film which audience were so invested and engrossed clapping their ways as the story unfolds.Every Technical aspect fell in place perfectly for this movie. There wasn't anything that was underwhelming for me throughout the crazy ride.For me I found this movie thoroughly engaging start to finish with the stellar cast including three mammoths of south cinematic talents whose craft speaks for itself.Ok Surya was supposed to be a surprise but boom as the spoilers went out in advance before the movie git released his character appearing wasn't having that wow factor but nevertheless he gives us a promising glimpse of the next season.Can't wait for the next instalment to see what's there in Lokesh's vision.",

If one take out the gory violence the movie is a good thriller. The violence makes the film toxic and is definitely not recommended for children below 14. I made a mistake of taking my son and though he did like the thrills it is not a film that children should see and it is not a film that we should allow our children to enjoy. Glorifying violence of a psychotic nature has its consequences on the mind .Being a big fan of Kamal Hassan and watched several of his films over the last few decades I was very excited to see Vikram and he does not disappoint with his acting. He is better in the film that some of his recent past films. For that matter on the acting front everyone performs. The direction is also good. The music is too loud and in combination to the violence will give a migraine attack.Overall the film could have been brilliant had there been control over certain aspects of the film. To that extent the film disappoints.My request to Kamal Hassan Sir is to do more films which can be viewed by all. Even this film sans the gory violence would have been very good. Films like Appu Raja, Sadma, Mayor Saab, Pushpak, Nayakan and several others have left such a huge impact that expectations from him are always high. I may have seen each them over 10 times, lost count actually. All the mentioned films had a deep connect with the characters which is missing in this film. This film may do well in box office numbers as the buzz is good but it does not make it to the top grade of films that have been made in the past.",

Even if the approach seems a bit unusual at that point in time, the story and the characters on the other hand grow on us, albeit in a gradual manner.And then comes the second half and the whole dynamic suddenly changes, we get to witness a drastic tonal alteration that eventually led us, the spectators, to a gratifying third act, fraught with palpable drama, bombastic action pieces, and some unrelenting swag and flamboyancy from the core ensemble. The entirety of the climax is such a treat to watch.Although I have to confess, it is certainly not a flawless implementation, by no stretch of the imagination one can make such bold claims. It, for sure, had its fair share of problems and drawbacks but Man! I gotta say, Mr. Kanagaraj knows how to make all these films work! The trickery lies in his spirited presentation, and the exhilarating Music by Anirudh took things even further. Another banger of a composition to hum and remember for a very long time.P. S.

Vikram deserved to perform just as well, if not more than them and hence, this review cum appreciation note!!I have seen each and every Kamal Haasan film in Hindi starting from his blockbuster Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981) right upto his Vishwaroopam 2 (2018). In between, I have kept track of his regional accomplishments as well like Appu Raja (1990), Mayor Saab (1990) and of course the iconic Nayakan (1987). Vikram even references a famous dialogue from that Mani Ratnam classic. Undoubtedly, Kamal justifies his title of 'Ulaga Nayagan' meaning a global level hero in Vikram and the sixty seven year old star shines in each and every scene he appears...Kamal Haasan plays a mysterious alcoholic guy presumed dead but is very much alive and kicking and turns out to be the titular agent on a dangerous mission. Fahadh Faasil plays a secret agent himself who uncovers Kamal's truth and also cracks the lead to a mega drug syndicate led by the sinister Vijay Sethupathi. By the way, Sethupathi's entry turns out to be one of the film's highlight scene as he springs up bare chested from an auto rickshaw turned turtle. Another great moment is when an ordinary maid (Vasanthi) transforms in to a killing machine least unexpectedly...Director Lokesh Kanagaraj keeps his narrative style a tad confusing in the first half but once the cards are revealed to us, the second half goes full blaze in action mode. The climax where Kamal Haasan goes cannon blasting makes for a truly pulsating moment! The film ends with an introduction of another key character who presumably, will play a crucial part of Vikram 2. Bring it on fast, Lokesh Kanagaraj!! I won't miss that in theatres for sure..Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

He doesn't give us a proper intro to the story and pushes us straight into the world of Vikram making us struggle for some time to make sense of what's going on. Music and songs are great perfectly reflecting the tones of Vikram but it felt unnecessarily bloody and noisy at times. Though the camera work is outstanding, It does not give the chills we got from watching director's Kaithi for the first time keeping in mind that the stories of both are predictable.Cast is amazing. Another gem in Kamal's crown. For an actor this age his work in action scenes are almost perfect and his emotional acting is PERFECT as ever. Fahad gets most screen time and he uses it best to get the perfect landing in Tamil Cinema and as his fan I hope he gets more such roles. Vijay Sethupathi is somewhat disappointing. While his acting and body language is only getting better with each movie, his dialougues are nearly incomprehensible like 90 percent of the time. It might be intentional for this particular character but is off-putting sometimes.We get another Amazing Malayalam Actor Chemban Vinode Jose with a meaty role. The way it is tied with Kaidhi and gets us Bejoy, Adaikalam Gang and a Glimpse of Dilli gets us excited for a Big Franchise. Surya's cameo as a gangster comes off as a disturbing character.

Because of my friends' recommendation I watched both of his previous ventures Kaithi and Maanagarm and got very impressed with his narrative and filmmaking. However Master kind of let me down irrespective of some brilliantly shot sequences and the antagonist role. For the same reason, I had my reservations about watching Vikram, wondering if Kanagaraj could handle one of the biggest stars of Tamil industry along with 2 other most sought out South Indian actors of recent times. Finally I watched it 10 days into the release hearing all the good things about it.Vikram is quite a blast literally and figuratively. It is an action thriller similar to Kaithi but with more backstory to it. Although it is not as fast paced as Kaithi, Vikram is unique in its own way and isn't trying too hard to please the fans of Kamal Hassan. The movie has quite a bit of connection to Kaithi and I only wish the director would have made the audience aware of it much earlier. It is almost a sequel to Kaithi but it is also not. However it is quite clear by the climax that Lokesh Kanagaraj is set to build something of his own and it looks very very promising.Kamal Hassan plays a very subdued role until the banger of an interval scene which is probably the best moment of the movie post which his character gets more weight to it. It is Fahadh Fasil who has more screen time and is also brilliant as always. Although Vijay Sethupathi excels is fiery and excellent in his role, his character writing and makeup reminds you of his Master's role you almost end up calling him Bhavani. The best surprise is the Agent Tina character played by Vasanthi and the action sequence involving her created such a roar in the theater. Other supporting characters get their fair share of interesting moments which is also a trademark of Lokesh Kanagaraj's filmmaking. The final scene introducing the Rolex character feels like the start of a new movie but no one's complaining.Vikram is a pathway which could probably lead to more of its kind and hopefully will lead to more multi starrer movies in the future without having to balance individual stardoms.",

Kamal hasan, fahad faasil & vijay sethupati had set the screen on fire by their presence.. My god so powerfull was their acting.. talking about the story its just amazing.. so many twists & turns.. dialogues, BGM & action sequences are the pillers of the film..

First half of the movie (the length of usual full Hollywood movie) there are too many characters, too many puzzles and too many scenarios as if like they are preparing the audience for another 10 - 15 future sequels/ prequels. The second half has some good scenes though (reason for 3 star rating). Nevertheless second half too consist of too many characters and scenarios that at one point you would get confused with the names.At one point you feel like you are seeing some kind of South Indian film festival, as you will see so many known artists coming and going just for seconds. What's the point Mr. Director and story/screenplay writers?Kamal has innumerable successful films and Vijay sethupathi is a rising star. Why do they act in movies like this? (Why Vijay sethupathi is doing the same fist punch that he did in MASTER movie? One sample of irrelevancy). After watching recent movies like Unami pol oruvan, vishwaroopum-1, master, etc, in recent past and watching this **** it is very upsetting if you are a genuine fan for Kamal and Vijay acting skills.",

From his previous films, we could say connecting different parallel events and making all the characters from different scenarios coming all together for the final showdown is his prime talent. So, he is the best man to do this job of creating this fictional universe and He does this job exceptionally well. The events of kaithi are brilliantly connected to VIkram and Both share a really good Universe. We have some really good cameos (not to mention Actor Suriya's role that was lit) and the way the movie ends has really set up new ways for Kaithi 2 and Vikram sequel (and many more who knows!!).All the actors in the film have done a really great job. You would become an instant fan of Kamal. Vijay Sethupathi has a really interesting characterisation who looks frightening and makes you laugh at the same time. Fahad Fahsil was Incredible. Even his eyes show different emotions. Seeing Suriya with this negative role was exciting and different but it was great.A really entertaining story. Watching Kaithi once would actually help you understand the plot more easily. The events of the film take place at a really high pace. So watching it twice would give you a better understanding. The story has a lot of twists throughout the film. Stunt Scenes were really entertaining!! (Anbariv just keeps on entertaining us movies after movies - beast,kgf2,etc). New Camera techniques were used perfectly. One would notice This technique was previously used in Master and Beast in small amounts.BGM was rocking. Anirudh proved once again why He is the Rockstar. Been giving hits after hits. All variations were awesome and perfectly used.The only thing disappointing in this film is its VFX. They could have done better. We have seen scenes in Beast how the VFX have evolved in Kollywood. It's sad a film of this level has poor vfx. It degrades the viewing experience. Nevertheless, It is still highly entertaining. They need to get a better vfx in future films.Final Verdict: A must watch. Action movie fans would love this film!! Try not to miss the big screens. A Highly entertaining movie which is rewatchable.

An exception to their rule is the killing of a civilian Karnan ( Kamal Haasan) who is the father of a martyred police officer. Is Karnan actually who he seems ? Why the exception to the vigilantes rule. Is there a deeper conspiracy involved ?The first half is fast paced, thrilling & all about Fahadh Faasil who is absolutely brilliant in his role as a Black Ops officer as he goes about the investigation. Rules the first half totally. He overshadows the mighty Kamal Haasan ( for whom i had actually gone to see the film) .The second half is all about Kamal Haasan who is shown as the Tamil Salman Khan especially towards the climax. No complaints about his acting, but some of the action scenes are really over the top .. the Hero is indestructible to say the least. Narrative slows down a bit with some emotional scenes. Ending is total Maar Dhaad and Vijay Sethupati proves to be a worthy adversary to our protagonists.Brilliant casting, action and a fast paced narrative make it a worthwhile watch.My rating 3/5 ..

Featuring an ensemble cast led by Kamal Haasan, Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi, Vikram is 3 hours well spent.Set after the events of Kaithi, Amar (Fahadh) is tasked with the capturing a group of masked men, who are responsible for the murder of law enforcement officials. This leads Amar to the ruthless drug lord Sandhanam (Sethupathi) and the mysterious of the presumed to be dead, Karnan (Haasan).The film benefits a lot from its immensely talented cast. Fahadh and Vijay Sethupathi own the first half and that was my favourite part. I was a tad bit letdown by the 2nd half. Even the much awaited mid-credit scene featuring a popular cameo (Suriya Sivakumar) doesn't land the required impact (maybe the sequel will).Anirudh Ravichander's music is stellar (as always). The Pablo Escobar tune during the wedding scene was epic! Among the performances, everyone has their moments. I went for Fahadh and Vijay Sethupathi and I was impressed by both their performances. Kalidas Jayaram, Chemban Vinod Jose, Narain, Gayathrie Shankar co-star.Vikram is whistle worthy & a true-blue popcorn film. Among the phlethora of event films this year, Vikram takes the top spot (above RRR, KGF 2). The cast & Anirudh deserve all the credit.",

The twists didn't work for me and the only one I enjoyed was the lady fight cameo towards the end.The casting is like a competition of the best actors in Southern film industry. Kamal Hassan, VJS and Fahadh Faasil live their characters. But the man who walks off with the trophy is Fahadh Fasil who plays a cold-blooded man in first half who has to face his weak emotional side in second half. This man is pure class and another level in current crop of actors. I don't know if VJS has put on weight only for this role or its regular size but he really needs to lose weight.

Lokesh directed the film quite well, nothing was out of place or added unnecessarily as if to check boxes and the set-up for the cinematic universe was very organic. The ties to the OG Vikram film and Kaithi are there and the other films are tied in quite nicely. The pacing and cinematography was top notch with Lokesh totally mastering dark shots. Anirudh's music took the film to the next level whether it's the BGM or the perfectly placed songs.In terms of acting, casting is extraordinary and perfect as to who will best suit which character can't imagine anyone else in any of the roles. VJS is apt in his role and pulls of the intensity with a tinge of dark humor here and there although the Chota Bheem scenes with drugs were kinda weird. Next is FaFa, one of my favorites, he totally owned the first half and even the second half his scenes and overall arc was quite well designed with him dawning the role of a proper sidekick in the second half of the film. Then there is Kamal Hassan, I won't acting talk about his acting nor have to. In the history of Indian cinema, Kamal Hassan is a beautiful chapter, and Vikram is another feather in his cap. He takes over in the second half and the energy doesn't drop for a second. He has done other vigilante roles, like in Indian, but this one is totally different with high octane scenes. The scenes with his grandson and daughter in law are quite emotional and the last shot simply superbly acted and made by long for Vikram II.Last but definitely not the least Suriya, I truly wished they didn't reveal the fact that he was in the film and let the audience guess a little and be surprised at seeing him. But they revealed and slightly ruined the thrill but man oh man I never thought I would see Suriya like this. He was violent, massy, and able to send a shiver up the spine. Hyped to see how Rolex is shown in the upcoming films of the CU.Overall well made film with high octane scenes and a great undercurrent theme regarding drugs and the mafia around them. Be sure to watch Kaithi especially prior to watching the film to better piece things together or else some scenes may go over your head.",

The second half looks very week as there is no weight on scenes and just gunfires & killings in lots.However Kamal appeared in a few scenes - he is absolutely great in his performance.The individual character references and mannerisms are really good for Fahad and Gayathri VJS and that midget rouge Kamal and his team - Tina & santhana barathiNaraen character is wasted and did not add special value Dilli character reference was nice and logic miss for Adaikalam and his bro.Rolex is one useless character in the movie and Surya made no special performance. Anyone can walk out of a car and bunch one's head - that's nothing different a Tamil cinema villain did new. The same mannerism was followed from MGR, Jai Shankar, Rajini and Vijay period and Surya just followed the same act. I don't understand why the theatre and reviewers praising for Surya entry and performance..May be I m from another universe...After Master - I fully turned out to be a Loki fan and he is one step below Master now. Second half definitely needed a change but ended up very old fashioned...1st half very good and 2nd half average.. Definitely it's a positive response and review from me...No one can save the other.",

            "content": "(If you followed the promotion or at least watched the trailer, you should just trust it, because I've never witnessed such an accurate and yet not too revealing promotion for a movie)Vikram (2022) written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, a hardcore fan of Kamal Hassan, is inspired by the original Vikram (1986). To get the full experience and understand the references you should watch the first Vikram and the previous movies by Lokesh (or at least Kaithi, which gives you the best idea what kind of movies Lokesh makes).On the one hand it's an action movie and a tribute to the underrated action capabilities of Kamal Hassan. As I said, watch the trailer and you'll realize, if the action is your cup of tea. For the most parts it wasn't mine, but even when it was too over-the-top for me, I was impressed how it was shot.On the other hand it's a decent thriller with a lot of perspectives and a maybe predictable, but still intriguing mystery. There was also an enjoyable Scorsese-flavored natural humor throughout the movie, which honestly made me laugh more than most pure comedy movies. The cast is filled with stars and especially Fahadh Faasil as Amar was fantastic.A Lokesh movie doesn't need character depth, but here they fell a little bit too flat. While some areas had a great amount of details, more important areas were underdeveloped. So the suspense quickly faded out.In the end, I think if you loved the recent KGF 2 or at least the Stallone and Schwarzenegger action movies of the 80s, this movie will probably be a gigantic blast for you. If not, it's still a watchable entertainer with a lot of goosebumps, especially for Lokesh fans.",

I liked the character of Vijay Sethupathi in that movie and damn man his character is just..... very good. But there is also a thing that it's VFX is not good, I mean that they are average and what could we talk about acting, the cast of the movie contains the best actors of India. Story is also very good and gripping but sometimes the movie felt stretched but overall it is a worth watch movie.

            "content": "Till date I've watched the film more than 5-6 times, twice in theatres and rest on Disney+Hotstar and yet I'm not over this drug, the addiction level to this film is damn high! I guess I need to write a review about this film which will calm me down well!The moment I heard about this film my excitement level reached sky limits not only because it was a Kamal Hassan comeback film that too directed by my new favourite director Lokesh Kanagraj but also because the film also starred 2 of my favourite actors in India- Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi. I watched the trailer and that immediately intrigued me what the plot will be all about, hence I went to theatres without any friend of family member of mine and watched the movie with few people around as here in Hindi belt very few knew about Vikram releasing, all thanks to absolute garbage film Samrat Prithviraj taking over the screens. And I was blown away within few minutes of the film, it was literally a follow up to Loki's previous blockbuster Kaithi? Why was this kept a secret from the audience? Lokesh Kanagraj already established a cinematic verse with Kaithi and continued with Vikram yet no one knew about it? That was a complain I had but who cared in Hindi belt what was going on, I wished Vikram had same level of marketing that Baahubali series, RRR and KGF 2 had and same hype around audience in Mumbai.Plot: Within first few minutes of the film Kamal Hassan's character supposedly died and Fahadh Faasil starts his investigation around series of deaths and that keeps you hooked completely. I was blown away by the fact that Fahadh had dubbed for his own voice in Hindi, didn't know he spoke Hindi that well. Now I really hope to see him in some Bollywood film, not in side role but a lead role that'll justify his talent. As the story unfolds very little references to Kaithi was shown in the film, but the Hindi dubbing part pretty much annoyed me as in Kaithi they changed the characters' name from Bejoy to Arjun or Dili to Shiva but in Vikram they retained the OG names instead of dubbing them as well, why would those dubbing studios or dubbing directors do that!? They retained OG names from Kaithi in Vikram but decided to change Vijay Sethupathi's name from Sanhdanam to Chandan? Now in the future what am I supposed to call Karthi, Narain, Sethupathi Arjun Das or Harish Uthaman in future movies, their dubbed names or OG names? The continuity can't be blamed on Lokesh Kanagraj because it's fault with Hindi distributors how they ruin the fun. But that was easily avoided by first time viewers as no one had any idea about Kaithi in my theatre hence I took the enjoyment in the narrative, how the investigation unfolded, one by one every interesting character was introduced with Faasil leading the film from the front while Vijay Sethupathi seemed to be having a supporting role although his entry was whistle worthy, perhaps the best entry in the film unlike many heroes having lean or 6 pack abs shirtless entry, here the Makkal Selvan appeared bare body with flabs coming out and seemingly enjoyed the film like nobody else had done. That was the evil entry! And as the film reached interval point, VJS and FaFa were as excited and shocked as us audience when The Universal Hero appeared onscreen after a kickass action. And fro, that point Kamal Hassan took over the film and what followed was madness and mayhem presented by the mad genius Lokesh Kanagraj, how Vikram and his team fights out the drug cartel led by Chandan(VJS) with Amar(FaFa) joining the fight after taking a backseat.Performances: Before I get to the trinity of acting prowess I'd like to talk more about support cast. The one who stole the show with only one scene- Vasanthi as Agent Tina! The action she did, with fork knives spoons and tried her best to save Vikram's family was whistle worthy! That scene alone made me hoot for the film every time I watched it! Agent Tina was easily the best support character in this film. The very next best supporting role came from Maya S Krishnan as the escort. Those scenes were hilarious and brought the house down, well supported by Anirudh's BGM(I'll come to that part soon!) Chemban Vinod Jose did well as Police Chief who was surprisingly one of the antagonist of this film, besides other Agents, Chandan's men, Narain as Inspector Bejoy and other Vikram's team members did well as per their part with Jabir Sadiq emerging as another highlight due to the fear he brought in cutting leg, especially during Kamal Hassan time.Now I'll come to the lead performers- FaFa was the main man in first half. It became out and out Fahadh Faasil show in first half of Vikram and in some scenes even overshadowed the Ulaga Nayagan in his own film! He didn't have any quirks like VJS and Kamal Hassan did but stood tall in his performance leading the film well and kept us hook only through his acting. If anyone asks me who is the best actor of India in today's generation I won't say Ranbir, Ranveer, Vicky Kaushal or Ayushmann Khurrana, the name is one and only Fahadh Faasil! While FaFa lead the first half well, VJS brought the house down with his screen presence itself. Despite playing another villain he gave new dimension in his performance, this time the entry scene, his own take as contemporary hero till the villainous avatar took his place and the fear he showed humbled his character well enough which had too many shades and performer like VJS was surely gonna nail it! He's the Makkal Selvan The People's Own Treasure! Now I've talked about my favourite stars, let's talk about their favourite- The Universal Hero, The Ulaga Nayagan, The Kamal Hassan! He's 60+, almost 70 year old man and he was the Vikram he carried from his old film of same name, same character and same swag! Kamal Hassan in second half is what this film truly is all about! My dad and mom used to be big KH fans and I never had cared about him but after Vikram I'm eagerly dying to see his other films in Tamil as well, not just the old Hindi ones that I've watched. He's easily amongst the best actors in the world, imagine putting Al Pacino and Sylvester Stallone into one roll, yup that's who Kamal Hassan is! And while these 3 weren't enough, here comes the screaming cameo of Rolex Bhai, SURIYA! It was well teased earlier Suriya is going to have a cameo in this film, just not what I had expected! I thought it'll be some starry cameo or for the sake of audience, but instead it became an uproar of him playing the ultimate antagonist of Lokesh Cinematic Universe, bringing Kaithi and Vikram rolled into one big universe Lokesh Kanagraj created! If Ironman(Karthi as Dilli) is already in this mess, Captain America(Kamal Hassan) and Thor(FaFa) already dealt with Loki(VJS) than now they're ready to face the ultimate Thanos(Suriya) in the madness created by the Lokesh Kanagraj himself! Can't wait to see how the universe unfolds, especially the battle of brothers- Karthi vs Suriya!While the 3 pillars above are covered up well enough, we cannot forget the fourth pillar of this film- Aniruddh! The BGM provided for almost every character and every situation is as addictive as a drug and uplifts the film well! The Vikram remixed, VJS entry and fight scenes, Amar's own music, the Escort BGM(how smartly that was used needs unanimous hoots) and of course the Rolex Music as cherry on cake, amongst all of them Once Upon A Time There Lived A Ghost emerges as my favourite! I've made sure even my family watches this film again and again and they did, totally love it as hell! The scene in which KH FaFa and VJS were facing each other is easily amongst the best face off in Indian film industry ever! Just wished a proper face off between Amar and Chandan, but Vikram was enough for Chandan to face! Going with all 10 stars, only wished Hindi dubbing was as good if not better than RRR KGF films.",

I really don't understand the people giving 9 and 10 out of 10 stars to this movie, and comparing it to the blockbusters of South Indian cinemas like Baahubali, KGF and RRR. I'm sure these people don't even know why these movies are so good. Vikram is far from any average movie. It's pure trash that doesn't deserve an average rating above 5.",

            "content": "Vikram can be termed as either a Kamal Haasan comeback or Kaithi 1.5, serving as an entry to Lokesh's Cinematic Universe.Vikram can also a spinoff of the original Vikram (1986) where gaps are filled in between the events of 1986 film and this story. It's\nlikely that in the development of this film, Kamal would have rendered an idea where post Agni Putra's episode in the 1986 film, Agent Vikram\nis assigned to lead a Black Ops squad the following year (1987) consisting of squad members (Agent Lawrence, Agent Tina & Agent Uppili). The\nsquad was deemed successful for the Govt, up until 1991, where the squad experienced critical failure and had gone underground as a result\nof that failure.What's interesting here is that Haasan takes a backseat in the film and lets Fahad Faasil drive with support from Vijay Sethupathi, Chemban Vindod and others. Faasil gets a solid role here and makes up for his one-note appearance from Velaikaaran, where I felt he was severely limited.As for Sethupathi, he was as good and on par with Haasan and Faasil. In fact, would rate this far better than his recent performances, where I felt he was just sleepwalking through his earlier roles. As a film, Vikram is far better than Kanagaraj's Master, where I felt the compromise between a Vijay film and a Lokesh film tilted more towards the former.Any blemishes? The blood and gore in the film won't be to everyone's liking. However, if you can relish the blood and gore from the KGF duology (specifically Chapter 2)\n, you'll love this movie. Also, that Suriya cameo was just awesome.Another criticism is the Pan India Marketing. This is still an issue with Tamil films projecting themselves as Pan India but unlike Rajamouli's RRR or Neel's KGF, Vikram had only Kamal to do the promotions across North India to get the Hindi version across. The result? Not so earth shattering collections in the Hindi belt, yet thanks to the hindi version being sold for under 3C, the collection is double/thrice that, so it's still a profit thanks to the word of mouth. But this promotional works for Pan India needs to be worked on from the Tamil Industry.Coming back to Kamal's return with this Vikram; Hope he realizes what the paying public has been missing all along while he's been delaying or\nshelving projects, doing needless reality TV show anchoring (Bigg Boss Tamil) and above all, Politics.PS: Please watch Kaithi before watching Vikram.",

But I was particularly impressed with FaFa, who almost stole the show, in spite of Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan present in the film. Vijay Sethupathi carried his character and incorporated quirky mannerisms which worked for the film. Direction by Lokesh was brilliant and original. The cinematography was great, especially in all the fight and chase scenes at night. Also, this is probably the best score I have ever heard from Anirudh. He is in the form of his life when it comes to massy BGM. The BGM perfectly complemented every scene and to the overall tone of the film. The BGM is among the best of this year.I did ignore some flaws of the film and dubbing issues, just because the movie was super engaging and fun to watch. I would give this a 10/10!",

The movie Vikram is like that of a Sirius Star (brightest star in night sky) in the world of movies not just for LK but also for Kamalhassan who at this age still continues to prove he's the best of all . The story is so very detailed that slowly we get immersed into the movie and start travelling along with the stars not wanting for an end any sooner . LK with this solid storyline ensures almost a flawless screenplay making every scene interesting and not to be missed. It's definitely a great success for LK to get a star like Kamalhassan to adapt to the need and rather not to tamper the story to adapt to the star value . And big big thanks to aandavar to listen to the needs of the director and delivering the best . He is the biggest actor , he is the biggest producer and this is the biggest national movie (KGF - Kamal's Grand Film) . And yes beyond Kamalhassan , we have some relatively bigger names like the seasoned actor Vijay Sethupathi, the very natural and a brilliant actor of all times Fahad Faasil , the man with Bass voice Arjun Das , Kalidas Jayaram , Naren, Shivani , Gayathri , Chemban Vinod Jose, Santhanabarathi and Surya towards the end of movie predominantly aimed for the next part. Agent Tina by Vasanthi is awesomatic and a total surprise. The movie was like a World of War, something we would have seen in Hollywood with so much of arms and ammunitions lighting up the movie screen and Anirudh blasting the speakers with his amazing BGM and Title / Pathala song. He is like this small sized bomb by look but when ignited delivers a thunderous output . The in-depth study on the props and sets put up by the art directors needs a mention here . Very realistic .

The cinematography by Girish Gangadharan was world-class & especially those Cam Robot movies were out-of-the-world! The action choreography by Anbu Arivu was among the best Tamil Cinema has ever witnessed! 'Vikram' is undoubtedly a world-class action movie on par with Hollywood's finest \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc!Last but not least, Ulaganayagan Kamal Hassan was an absolute BEAST in this flick!

It's a Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe) where the drug dealing between the government officials & mafias continue to raise stakes.New characters being introduced. Some plotholes clear doubts that exist in Kaithi. Cinematography is top notch. Camera work in the action scenes feel like they're inspired from hollywood project Upgrade ! It's overall a masterpiece from a South Indian box office. The bgm score from Anirudh really hits you hard (Although it still needs some tweaking).The reason I gave rating of 3 notches down, is :\n1. It still depends on the star cast to pull mass audience into theatres.2. The amount of gore is so ample with restricted censor rating & not recommended for young teens & to be seen with a family.3. Dubbing into other languages like Hindi haven't taken much care & promotion over PAN India is very poor.",

Every time ether Vijay Sethupathi or Fahad Fasil come on screen they demand your complete attention. Watch this movie for them. The story is shaky at best. The westernised sound track to give a wow factor seems a big miss for me as well! If you had 2.5hours and it's rainy and gloomy outside and you can't do anything else watch this movie.",

It's very stupid and I don't know why kamal's character was narrated as drunkard and womenizer. Lokesh only think night scenes make the story quite interesting. But it only worked in maanagaram and kaithi. In master and vikram it's not working. Lokesh needs to work more on his story and screenplay. In master and vikram too bad in both dept. But he succeeded in both movies with star value only. I really wonder how kamal agreed to do this movie with this story and screenplay. I only say kamal and lokesh rided on their luck that the movie got this kind of blockbuster. But not really worth for this kind of hit or fame.",

At the very beginning,movie goes so simply until the real plot comes in the scene. Drug cartels,corruption & masked murderers, the entire film is set in underworld. Kamal Hassan as Vikram is truly a Ghost like character,Vijay Sethupathi as Chandan/Sandhanam is just mind-blowing you can feel comedic as well as insane in same character & Fahadh Faasil as Agent Amar is so unpredictable, his way of solving the mysteries behind masked murderers is great. No doubt that the casting is absolutey superb. Four Top Class actors in a single movie is like a perfect Dum Biryani(Lokesh Fans will understand). The storyline is filled with so much intense suspense & one can't predict what will happen next. You can't miss even a single scene the story makes audiences to stick their eyes to screen.Cinematography is so dark & subtle. The camera angles were quite impressive,it made the action scenes more awesome. Every scene is shot very precisely. Aniruddh's music & bgm took the whole movie to a different level. The music & bgm gives justice to each & every scene. Movie has a great badass bgm which makes action scenes more entertaining & truly 'Badass'. But before watching Vikram do watch KAITHI which suprisingly serves as prequel to it. Most of the characters are linked to Kaithi. With this movie director Lokesh Kanagaraj has given birth to an action packed multiverse.At the end, a surprise cameo will completely blow your mind & will make you more excited. This characters brutal entry creates a terrific bang. Dont miss the end.\"The End Is Beginning\"",

With having a Biggie like Kamal Hassan, Loki managed to give equal character importance for FaFa and VJS. Movie starts with FaFa as a Team Head of a Shadow organization assigned to investigate a seriel killings, which leads him to Connect with VJS and Kamal. First half was an investigation thriller which Loki written and narrated in a most Stunning way. It's happening in a Crime World and Loki wrote an exceptional first Half to explore the Story of this world and it's dark secrets. I was blown away by the first half, it was too amazing.. even though it is predictable in the midway still it kept me engaging throughout the first half with a Bang! Intermission sequence.And starts the second half.. when the First Half over with it's investigation and the big reveal.. second half went on full gun blazing action mode. The latter half is filled with lots of guns, lots of deaths, lots of blast and lots and lots of actions. It was an amazing theatre experience. KH, FaFa, VJS this trio proved their worth in an extravagant action movie. Other than them even the other characters like Narine, Chemban Vinod got their own importance for them. That's what I liked very in loki's writting.. not giving all the Grace to the main Lead and Making other characters dumb.. that was happens in big Star movies but here the Director/Writer managed to break that stereotype, he gave all the goosebumps moments to Kamal Hassan and also gave the other Stunning moments to FaFa and VJS equally. Infact Kamal allowed FaFa and VJS to dominate the first half and he arrives at the interval and the steals the moment.The problem I found was with an exception first half writing the second half Only has Guns and actions. The whole story is explored in the first half itself.. so the latter has guns , blast , guns , blast and again guns and blast.. Loki gave dozens of gun varieties to the actors and let them to go and play with it. That's what i found as a drawback.. may be he should have wrote something more in the second half. But those actions made you forgot About the drawbacks and the connect between Kaidhi and This will not at all make you feel about any drawbacks.And I found Suriya's Cameo as very ordinary and Cliched. Infact It looked like Kokki Kumar's entry in 'Vai Raja Vai' , in Lokesh Kanagaraj's Version. Nothing impactful. Overall VIKRAM lived upto it's Expectations and the buzz it created. An outstanding raw action movie from Kollywood. Loved it very much. Looking forward to 'Lokiverse'.",

The movie is gripping, stylish, suspenseful and unending. Kudos to The director, Lokesh Kanagaraj, who brought out the best performances from every single actor in the movie.

The director was aware of what he was getting himself into, he knew how to make an action flick. Vikram, Kaithi & Master and evidences for that.The action sequences were beautifully choreographed, the visuals were fantabulous like the rest of his films, performances of every single character was perfect, amazing screen time for every actor on screen.Positives:*Performances*\n*Visuals*\n*Choreography*\n*Cinematography*\n*Songs*Negatives:*Slightly Slow Paced*Had a fun time with the film, dont hesitate to watch it in cinemas, its definitely a film meant for the theatres.9/10.",

So many slow mo shots, which is fine.. but Kamal was just not the right person, it was clear that some scenes were played by stuntguy. Which is obvious.

I think everyone will fall atleast in one of these. Jokes Apart, the film was a good theatrical experience. It had a lot of goosebumps moments. Some notable moments were VJS intro scene which was class as well as had a lot of humour in it (I could see the whole theatre laughing), Interval block, FaFa saving the chil, Agent Tina fight scene, Suriya intro scene. Also the scene that takes place in San Franciso reminded me bit of Dark knight rises scene (But it cannot match the original). Almost all characters are still in my mind which means the characters were well written. But it thought the screenplay was bit laging in first half but it takes a surge from interval. Also VJS character was not that well written and it had nothing unique but VJS by his phenomenol acting and humour aced it. Kamal sir no words, FaFa no words. If you want a good theatrical experience you should watch it. Also it is important to note the fact that Lokesh somehow tried to connect Kaithi and Vikram and bound them into a Universe. I dont know if it has scope, but the last few scenes raised my respect towards Lokesh as a writer even though screenplay is not that engaging. Also the scene in which Kamal explains about drugs and its side effects deserve a mention. Overall, watch it atleast once, if you think you didnt understand it watch it twice.",

            "content": "Three cheers to team Vikram!!!Helmed my Kollywood's present-day \"master\" of gangster films - Lokesh Kanagaraj - and starring a surprise-filled ensemble cast, 'VIKRAM' surpasses the director's previous flick by multiple notches and proves to be a limitlessly goosebump-giving re-entry for \"Aandavar\" Kamal Hassan! Other than the superstar, my favourite in the film is definitely the ever-reliable Fahadh Faasil \"FaFa\" in yet another of his neat performances.The film interestingly happens in the same universe as Loki's Kaithi (2019) with a handful of characters (plus references) being reprised from the same. Lokesh cleverly incorporates his trademarks - a truck chase, a shot featuring Biryani, a heavy action scene in a factory and a reuse of the Browning machine gun scene featured in 'Kaithi' (a segment featuring the same gun was seen in the recent 'KGF Chapter 2') to top it - into the screenplay that isn't fresh but is thoroughly entertaining. A high-voltage action scene set in the house of \"Vikram\" would be my takeaway; no one saw that coming!Technically, 'Vikram' is easily elevated by Girish Gangadharan's brilliant cinematography. Philomin Raj's cuts are fine, even when the film looks tad too long at 177 minutes. This is the fourth musical by Anirudh Ravichander in three months and his graph touches the sky as he surpasses himself - 'Vikram' gives your ears an extravaganza that is easily top-notch compared to 'Beast', 'KRK' or 'Don'.'Vikram' is a film where you have to find ample time, book a ticket(s) in a theatre with the best audio and video services and have a great time celebrating.

Vikram is here and my god it is worth your money. This is a reminder that Lokesh is one of the best Indian directors. I would love to say why this film is great and why some things were somewhat meh. Actually pretty less meh.The things I thought was very tiresome.You have to probably do some homework(not school homework) before stepping into this film as it has many callbacks to Kamal's and Lokesh's filmography. This isn't a bad thing but I just mentioned it as it is tiresome for some casual moviegoers to do homework for a film.The Best things.Anirudh's music is the best thing about the movie. His music especially Once upon a time and the Title track is really captivating. Pathala Pathala works as the best kuthu number. The Pablo Escobar song is my favourite among all. The cinematography by the national award winning- Girish Gangadharan is top notch. Some shots during the set pieces are breathtaking. Anbariv's stunts are great and maybe the best work done by them. The performances are great. Kamal Haasan is great as usual but it is during the action set pieces that he unleashes the beast inside him and makes us root and cheer for the character. VJS has an interesting character as it is written a little bad but he adds some nuances to his character in each frame that makes an ordinary sequence featuring the character interesting which makes his character a terrifying villain but least terrifying than that of Master. Fahad Faasil is the hero in the first half and the sharpness and agile body language of Amar is well portrayed. He speaks with his eyes as he does most of the time he matches up to a legend like Kamal Haasan. Eyes that speaks most which tells that he is one of the best actors in India and needs an award right now. Surya is just raw and great in his special appearance. I would just pray Agent Tina gets a spinoff show or movie. The last but not least it is a pakka Lokesh padam. He is the best. His world building is top notch and how he manages to trick us with some incoherent sequences in the first half and revealing that the incoherence also had some purpose later on. It is called clever filmmaking. It is worth the watch for Lokesh's filmmaking alone.If you love Lokesh's type of filmmaking and Kamal Haasan, Vikram is a must watch for every aspects or should I say everything.",

As and when you start to waver, or try to clasp the events that unfold, that s when these three legends attempt to give you the hang of it, until the fast pace settles down in an understandable track, in such a hypnotic way that gets you addicted and you cannot tear your eyes off them.This movie is a rapid racer script, sprinkled with intermittent goosebump moments. To ease off the high pressure, steam & tension, the light hearted humorous moments gives the audience, a much-needed break.There are so many shocking twists & implausible turns in this crime-drenched plot which brands \"Vikram\" so intriguing & electrifying to watch. I don't want to reveal anything because I felt that being one among the audience who thoroughly enjoyed the look, feel & make of this movie, selfishly desire that the person reading this should also experience that joy, as their very own to relish. I personally saw some people among the audiences, wherein their jaw literally dropped, or people covering their eyes/mouths to escape shock.The flabbergasted cinematography by Girish Gangadharan (myself a big fan of him) literally made the plot move swiftly with sundry startling directions that were shot so gorgeously, so mesmerizing, adding the picture-perfect colour to the bloated amount of grisliness. Thank you, sir, for manufacturing some blood-spattered gory scenes into dullness, because if I saw those in it's true light it's definitely going to be hard time forgetting it.Here s the punch:I felt that the cinematic barging violence was a bit too strong, bringing out the continuous repertoire of explosions (my heart burst), chases (my heart raced), gunfights, fire blasts (my eyes flamed in their light), screaming bullets (my ears were ringing), hyper-heroic acts, horrendous stunt scenes, made my head spin, dizzy with adrenaline, I was staring in disgust and had jerky moments with all the surprise attack bloodshed, fleshy bloody scenes which I don't want to see again, it would undeniably make my flesh crawl. I experienced a different type of horror and I feel \"The Ghost\" had done its job so well. I wouldn't say that the movie is devoid of it 's flaws, here and there you may feel inky bits of boredom, that's because it was too overwhelming for the mind to watch.Kamal Hassan: Long wait - 4 years, Mr. Nice Guy, after a long break, he s back in business! He who knows the tricks of the trade, knows what he wants, knows what to telecast, has flashed his flairs yet again with his \"Andavar\" act. Words fail me when I think of the hard work that he has put forth, considering his delicate aging body for the success of this movie. KH is fab, he's fickle, he's funny, he's sensitive, yet so unpredictably manly in everything that he does, moves his lips to talk, the movie 's got all of these tough-to-get emotions rolling.Vijay Sethupathi: I have never ever, looked down upon this man, his tremendously scaling high levels of acting skills which seems to have grown more abundantly like his heavy stature too. But the man really made up for his weight in such a way, that you wouldn't care much really. The audience and me fairly think that he would no longer shine as a hero because the villainous looks fit the terror scary bill, the anti-hero who readily shows no mercy, wicked looks suit him quite comfortably, am sure that these thoughts crossed the actor 's mind too.Fahadh Faasil: FA FA 's screen presence is quite emotionally remarkable, not to miss out on his plain clothes masquerading the cop that he really is, who dedicates joy in solving hazardous clandestine operations, whose only ambition is to keep feeding his virtuoso life pursuit of being an impossible genius cop.Narain: A fine actor in the making, who gave a decent, mature act. His fleeting screen moments were enough to subdue, in contrast to what he could easily pull off in the 2019 blockbuster \"Kaithi\".Anirudh Ravichander: The most celebrated music director of the recent times, never forgets to give his all, making it tall, his notes far rising more than the other 's beats. His \"Pathala Pathala\" song is literally not enough for the jig. His lilting background music, title song adds spice to the already hotter meal.Lokesh Kanagaraj: Fan-boy has made up his mind to prove himself with his dazzling writing, screenplay portraying the world-legend and has carved a niche in this multi-universe that he has created on his own within the cinema circle, he's in the limelight as always but with more brand-new expectations, higher than the skies, from now on, it's going to be a tough bloody fight, even more hard-hitting work for such a brilliant director. Hopefully, he lives up to being a trend-setter film-maker. He has set himself a trade-mark that's difficult to erase and hence I wish him good luck & congratulations for the glorious appreciation that he will continue to bask in for a few days now.God bless the whole cast, crew & team of Vikram Movie! Waiting to see more!Original Content by Ar Deepika Dhilip#Vikram.",

Lokesh Kanagaraj has handled this movie beautifully without any hiccups in screenplay or writing. In acting, all the actors play their part really well ! Especially the main characters !! Even though Vijay sethupathys acting is really good I felt he like he had the lesser amount of screen time in the main 3 characters but still packed a punch in every scene he got. Coming to music, DUDE its so good ! Anirudh killed this album with the variety of the themes. And also considering the humongous amount of movies has to work on Anirudh is a freaking genius. And also the cinematograph, I have no words. It looks really good and there's these fight scenes which are shot by robotic arms which looked very slick. I saw some public review which said Kamal Hassan didn't have enough screen time and stuff. But no the movie is balanced out perfectly sharing screen time. This movie is really well made and a must watch in the cinemas ! Hope everyone enjoys this movie as I did !!RATING : 8.7/10.",

The moment you feel now story line is created, a new event or character unsettles everything. Unnecessary references to characters or events of previous movies just reminds how good his direction used to be - viewers exclaims in hall - but it does not sustains.In Kaithi, suspense along with nice BGM at right time and events creates magic, but in Vikram - even beating an unarmed senior police officer has been tried to spice up with extravagant music.Director seems to highly influenced by Denzel Washington of Equalizer where he keeps watching at his hand watch - but in Vikram - don't know how Kamal Hasan's looking repeatedly at his hand watch relates to anything.Also, Mr. Lokesh Kanagraj, seems to be a fan of Dark Knight series so he has used \"mask man's\" voice to impress the viewers - but by the end of movie there is no mask and not any suspenseful voice.At the ending, as it is trend now a days with all movies and web series - it is said to be brain child by Ekta Kapoor - directors put lots of details for next installment, L. Kanagraj has also tried hard by adding entry of another Super Star of South industry and the whole team of Kaithi.No doubt people are brought to movie halls because of superb marketing.But, ye public hai, very soon public starts responding if they find the 'Gol Gappas' of the street vendor are no more have same tastes.",

Would like so see a film where the hero hits a bad guy and he doesn't go flying 20 feet \ud83d\ude05.Ok now to the positives! Lokesh proved once again he can direct a multi starrer flawlessly. All other directors should take notes. This time he gave Kamal, Fadah, and VJS all equal space. Kamal May not have a lot of dialogue in the first half of the film, but the second half more than makes up for it. Fadah did a great job in his role and VJS played yet another devious villain (even worse than in master). The first half of the film was all about diving into the story of the film. Lokesh introduces the story as a normal cop-goon film, then takes a turn at the interval. Kamal Hassan looked great for his age and showed that he could give an industry hit again. Anirudh continues to elevate his game with each film. The BGM and songs were all nice and suited the film amply. And finally the climax and intertwining of films! Surya emerges as the don leader \"Rolex.\" He comes to know that Vikram is the one that stole his drugs and weapons and puts a bounty on him. The same batch of drugs was referenced in kaithi. Looks like part 2 of Vikram will be surya vs kamal and karthi. Overall, good film that you need to stick with in the beginning, but then get your mind blown away in the end.",

So dont expect a Kamal Haasan movie.Positives: Story, actors, intro song, interval block and climax.Negatives: There are lags. Movie could have been littles short.Why to watch the movie:Excellent performances and connection with Kaithi:Kamal Haasan (We don't feel he is aged in intro song and action sequences. Especially in the climax shooting sequence, he is really fit and very convincing. However, missed the actor Kamal Haasan)Fahad: Neat and clean performance. He is simply superb and right choice for the role.Vijay Sethupathi: As usual, did his job very well. Excellent intro. But not very much different from his previous roles.AND the highlight of the movie is 'SURIYA'. JUST WATCH HIM AT THEATRE. OUT OF BOX PERFORMANCE.It is a commercial movie for a theatre experience. So dont watch it on mobile.",

All the agents in Vikram had the same attacking style, which honestly wasn't appealing.As a stand-alone movie, loved the BGM in most of the scenes. Personally Fahadh was superb. Liked Kalidas's portrayal as well. VJS's intro was good.Did not understand what VJS kept popping in his mouth, to get that hulk power. They deliberately kept him low key to increase surya's power. But VJS has had much better roles in multi-starrers.Finally, the VFX looked really amateur in some places surprisingly, and the baby getting CPR after 10-15 minutes was stupid.I wonder how much more gore will be there in the next movie, given that ppl loved this one.",

The screenplay written for the interval block is just superb it literally put everyone guessing.Later the interval there isn't much story or plot to unveil its solely depends upon the acting performance of Kamal Haasan, Vijay and Fahad and and cult screenplay of the captain Lokesh Kanagaraj.The climax sequences are so well shot and directed its just pure entertainer for the audience to experience. Lokesh Kanagaraj past movie \"Kaithi\" and its connections to this and to its UPCOMING VENTURES, the universe he is in making shows its vision towards cinema. Theaters blasted for the last sequence.The acting performance of Kamal Haasan sir the way he has portrayed the shade of that character and dialogue's are superb the action sequence he performed just nailed it there. Vijay Sethupati right from its entry itself the negative shade and his fear for the people and his fear from the top the chain are very well shown by him and that's also in few screens. Fahad faasil is the one who runs you through the story to hid and reveal things and eventually going through pain he nailed his role right from the first shot till the end.Action sequences are so well choreograph and brutal are just treat to watch and also not for the children to watch.The characterization else than leads are done well whether its on protagonist side or antagonist's. Few charters just looted the screen for some time.Few comedy punches put in-between landed well for the story.The romantic angle in Fahad characters life and the love between the Kamal Haasan and his grand child fits so well in all the chaos, and melts down smoothly.Its all and all A BLOCKBUSTER Well Presented by the the Director Lokesh Kanagaraj. Kamaal sir's trust in him proved by this film. His Exceptional writing of the screenplay. Keeps engaged till the end.The Climax! That Climax where he connected his past film Kaithi starrer Karthi, and introduced the negative charter yet loved by all who literally was a Icing on a cake for every Tamil film watcher.Yes for the upcoming films of Lokesh or his this universe to understand one must watch Kaithi first for the references coming in-between or later to understand the subplot.Kamal Haasan's charm is insane.",

Vikram is Indian cinema at its best.Vikram manages to keep the perfect blend of style and substance most the time. The first half of the movie runs as an investigative thriller building up the story while building up Kamal Haasan's character. Fahadh Faasil does a really good job alongside Vijay Sethupathi compensating for Kamal Haasan's lack of presence in the first half. The first half ends on a really high note even though the big twist is predictable.The second half goes all in on the action and thrills, constantly raising the stakes while managing a grounded and emotional angle. Kamal Haasan really shines in the second half except in the action sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj does the impossible by managing the heroism of a star actor and making the audience feel that things are still at stake. However, in my opinion, some parts of the third act of the movie could have been written better.Vikram is a fantastic movie. Despite some minor issues the movie can be enjoyed by any type of movie fans. Hat's off to Lokesh and Kamal Haasan. Waiting for the \"Lokeshverse\" to expand.",

Coming at the the performances all the characters were at their best, especially Kamal sir, Sethu Annan and Fahad Faasil. The cameo of Suriya is mind-blowing that smile he gives just takes you elsewhere. Story wise it's really good and a must watch to all those that like Action Thrillers! Music is spot on yet again Anirudh delivers Mass music that and this time it gets the justice unlike his last few films where Music was way better than the sequences. Finally, the film doesn't bore you even for a second and there are some really good elevation scenes, comedy scenes (yes they are here and are well placed) plus emotions. All-in-all, it's A Festival for all the fans of Kamal Sir and Action-Crime lovers!By the way, you shouldn't approach this film as a standalone film, if you think so then you are mistaken and might find this film to be average!

Every shot is worthy to see.I saw this film in the UK and the auditorium was full (3rd day of release) and it was an amazing experience to see everyone enjoying to see their favourite actors on screen. Especially when Suriya appeared for a few minutes, people were cheering loud. This also happened with the other actors as well.The other Indian film I've seen in cinema was \"Beast\" starring Thalapathy Vijay. Comparing these two films I've seen, Vikram wins obviously.

Believe me, you will not feel the movie is dragging. From the start till the end, the plot and the screenplay keeps you engaged. Characterization for all the lead actors Kamalhaasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahad Faasil, Chemban Vinod Jose, Narein and other supporting actors were well crafted and delivered flawlessly. Writers did a great job by giving equal screen spaces to the 3 lead actors.Kamal, VJS, FaFa - What a terrific performances!!! Kamal, as a senior, gave space to other co-actors to perform but when he starts performing, he tops the chart obviously that is why he's is fondly known as \"Ulaga Nayagan\" (Universal Hero). VJS and his tremendous characterization and mannerism is new and terrific. FaFa is the driving factor in this movie who takes us to the plot. He has slightly more screen space than the other two to be frank.Technically speaking, starting from music, bgm, sound design, cinematography, dialogues, screenplay, production design, all were top class. Stunt Choreography by AnbuAriv has a powerful influence. The way it was choreographed was never seen before in the industry. Simple yet powerful dance Choreography by Sandy made everyone look at him as a magician who recreated Kamal's signature dance steps.Direction has to be mentioned on a separate note coz it is fully evident that Lokesh Kanagaraj who is an ardent fan of the leading actor Kamalhaasan has made his mind very clear that he wants to see and show to the public his idol in a different level and he had put his blood and soul to it. The final product itself is the result of his hard work. The surprise elements placed in the movie and the links he had brought from his earlier movie Kaithi and Kamal's 1986 movie Vikram is a new thing to Tamil Cinema. We had seen many sequels and prequels, but this one is Universal.Cameo appearance by Kalidas Jayaram has a strong impact to the story. Another powerful Cameo by Actor Surya is a surprise element to this high octane thriller. Only a 3 - 4 minutes of his screen presence set the screens on fire.Overall, a must watch movie on theatres near you. You will watch this movie on a repeat mode.Vikram is definitely the savior of Tamil Cinema post pandemic where the previous theatre releases by other top actors did not perform well. Given the pressure by other Indian language movies, Vikram from Kollywood stands alone and gives back to all of them in style.",

He is proving himself as a man of cinema everytime he releases a film. Even though he had only 10% screen time in the first half, his presence is felt. And his intro in the intravel was simply awesome.Fahad fazil and Vijya sethupathi: Both actors were amazing and Fahad just ruled the first half by his fantabulous performances. He was so. Vijay sethupathi's role as Santhanam was similar to bhavani in master, but he aced the role with his raw and lethal body language and mannerism.Background score and songs: Anirudh is hitting back to back with his amazing score. Vikram had has 3 major scores and 2 songs. All were fantastic. Expectations for Anirudh's music is getting bigger.Story, screenplay, Camera works and Loki's direction: A good mark for a director is not only the story but also the screenplay. Vikram's screenplay was simply super. The strong screenplay and direction of Lokesh kanagaraj foreshadowed the rather predictable story. For example, most people can predict vikram is alive right after he stages his killing right in the beginning of the movie. The scene where he reveals his is still alive and kicking is a goosebump and whistle worthy scene.Overall vikram is one of the badass multistarrer ever made in indian cinema. Everyone did their best work. Also Suriya sir as Rolex and kaithi merger scene was just amazing. Now that we know what a 100% loki film looks like, just imagine thalapathy 67 in the same universe, which is also a 100%loki film.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",

            "content": "Indian cinema always clamors for a gripping, intelligent action movie and Mr. Kanagaraj delivers one here. After the success of movies like Kaithi, Master here is another mass entertainer from the director. The movie is an absolute treat to witness with a story that goes from hunting murderers of police all the way to uncover a conspiracy of evil policemen under the payroll of drug lords. Kamal haasan's acting is a sight to behold with his action sequence, dance and expressions and mannerism all taking centre stage in the movie. Fahad Fasil almost steals the show from Mr. Hasssan in his own movie with his brilliant portrayal of Black ops esque officer that tries to solve cases by using underhand tactics and going completely off book. With his ruthless demeanor and witty one liners he evolves with every role and has an unbeatable impact on the audience. Last but not the least, after his brilliant portrayal as a villain in master we are again treated to the absolute joy that is Vijay Sethupati. The actor of the masses brilliantly playing as the Drug Lord with three wives and huge family. With his spectacular entry my only gripe is unlike Master where he too had chirpy dialogues here Vijay is left to fend for himself in a movie with such solid performances from everyone. He nearly sails through because he is Vijay and his onscreen charisma and charm are unbeatable. The music by Anirudh is griping with metal riffs blowing as the action takes place on screen. The cinematography and editing of action is also noteworthy with the actions in tight spaces like a corner, corridor, stairs come off like a well-choreographed sequence of events that feel natural. There are a lot of decapitations in the film from the get go. Unlike Kaithi where the story was always on an upward trajectory between edge of the seat action and spaces to take a breather Vikram's screenplay has an up and down trajectory especially for the first half of the film. The second half is when all hell breaks loose and we are treated to delightfully choreographed action sequences right out of the Hollywood movies. Mr. Kanagaraj saves the best surprise for last where he connects Kaithi to Vikram and brings out the big bad drug lord as Surya. He looks ferocious and acts ruthless and will be a challenge to overcome for kamal hassan, fahad fasil and karthi in the next movie.",

Even though it didn't made enough collection in North belt area , South belt was enough to make it superhit. Somedays the overseas box office collection was more than the collections in India which shows that this movie is a blockbuster. This movie creator/producer/team didn't do so much promotion in the Northbelt region and even didn't got much screens in North, if it had done more promotion and got more screens than I am sure this movie which have collected 450cr INR , would have easily surpassed 500cr INR, may have even done more . Hope this movie would become more famous by the time it's second part will be released , as many north Indians will see it in Ott(Disney+ Hotstar) and I'm sure they would love this film and watch it's second part .This movie has already done a record in ott as it has been watched by many people, Iam waiting for its second part so eagerly and I'm sure it's second part will be a superhit and I missed one thing , that is the Vikram director the Legend Lokesh Kanagaraj , is also directing Tahlapathy Vijay's 67th Movie , and if he adds this movie to LCU(Lokesh Cinematic Universe) that Kaithi-Vikram-Thalapathy 67 , then I am sure this Universe will be the Top Cima Universe in India .

            "content": "This movie tries and fails to leverage the well made Kaithi (2019). It has a hodgepodge of characters, subplots and over the top action. The movie focuses on impressing only through slow motion effects and flamboyance of big name actors. Vikram is a poorly written movie that runs too long at 3 hours. The saving grace of the first half of the movie is Vijay Sethupathi's character - Sandhanam and Fahad Fazil's character - Amar. But for those two characters the movie is a failed attempt at covering the story of undercover agents and criminals. Skip this to save time.",

            "content": "Vikram is very good as an action showcase.Story is good. It is relatable and lively filled with emotions and a bit of social awareness. Where second half unfolds the story and drives it toward the end, its first half is more engaging.All the actors gave a brilliant performance and perfectly suited the role. Most suitable is Fahadh, whose character Amar has probably the best arc in the movie. He can be considered second protagonist in the movie. While the main protagonist Vikram also has a definable story, the movie puts more focus on stardom of Kamal Hassan and gives him some swaggy slow motion sequences and gunfight amid the realistic fights, which is not bad, if one knows the legend of Kamal. The colour scheme, environment, BACKGROUND SCORE and prevalence of majority of night sequences perfectly delivers the theme of struggle against the crime& corruption and vigilant action.The antagonist, being an underdog, is less impactful, but not the performance of Setupathy. But it may prove good for its sequels, yes. The suspense is weak as it is predictable but the part that involves the unfolding of mystery is never boring because it gives build-up to all three characters simultaneously.Overall, Vikram will entertain you in terms of action, story and story arc of its mammoth characters.",

No logic behind the action scene.kamal Hasan does not need the plot,the plot needs him and it is the main motive of director. The director tries to develop three different plots at the same time but he failed to do it properly. By the way agent Tina's action scene and some action scenes are good to watch.do not waste your precious 3 hours to watch this average and over hyped movie.the movie is for those who likes only action not story plot realistic characters.they only need reckless action scenes where the hero is not human type.",

Shocking scene in each part of the whole movie.in my opinion the director have big brain. How a common man could be converted into a person like black squad may be your best part .the last fighting scence was seriously one of my best experience ever.watching this entire movie with 1060p is even better because ofs its bfx effects .the overall story is by the way very good. But, in some parts I fells like over or no logic. Like at the end how vikram can be able to think that his grandson will be breath after 10 minutes?even through you are a genius you can not say exactly in that situation.18+scene also included in it so you can not watch with family members it will be negative impact on your little sister or brothers.",

And i am 18 my name is also Arun Kumar Vikram . The way the character introduction was perfect. Because there are many characters but no lag though out the movie.The unmasking scenes were perfectly balanced between protoganist and antoganist. The movie was actually connected to the vikram(1986) and kaithi(2019). The movie really tells about the untold agents of our country and the political game behind it. The movie deals with drugs and related stuffs. Thank you hopefully enjoy the movie with your friends and family.",
