            "content": "I have seen a lot of movies in my time, made in a lot of different styles from different genres, from all around the world. I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after \"RRR.\"This movie is so much. Its \"much\"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \"RRR,\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \"RRR.\"Grade: A+",

            "content": "I bet you'd never think the mash-up the heavy-handed Rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of Crouching Tiger would work especially, while mixing in several musical numbers. Those who think that would be wrong. This movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness. Even with a 3-hour runtime, I was engrossed. It was a great story with thorough character development. A young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean British government who is controlling the people of Malli, presumably in India. This small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back. But the British government also has an Indian soldier who is equally as skilled; both of which dwarf all other soldiers as you'll see in the spectacular opening scene. As the two skilled fighters clash, will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for. This movie blew me away. I've never seen special effects quite like this before. There were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters. This movie was produced with smart editing, cinematography and choreography. This is a modern must see.",

A tightrope walk between complete silliness & beautiful sincerity, it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore: insane action, enveloping dialogue, sprawling yet intimate storytelling, elaborate dancing (yep!). Admittedly, the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared, but it's hard to deny the bravura movie-making, daring you to not to have fun.",

This movie is a freaken masterpiece, combines some extraordinary drama, stunning stunts and action, great photography and absolutely beautiful music. Given that this is a Bollywood movie, you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes, an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting won't exactly be Oscar worthy. But none of it made me not enjoy this movie. The time passed by very easily and I ended up having a really great time.The eye candy that is Ram Charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular. That is one ridiculously handsome man, I have to say ;P.",

I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film. But also the first scene where Ram Charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well. Overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action, comedy, romance, dancing and great storytelling.",

            "review_title": "The best superhero movie in years",
            "content": "I have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly, because it's not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently. But I can say that for large-scale, big-budget action movies, this is how you do it right. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good. I complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot, and so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters is all I could criticise it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime.",

It's everything Marvel should have been.This movie is about 2 men, super human, some suspension of belief needs to be had. View it as a super hero movie and it delivers.Plot: It's about 2 men; a hero and the anti hero. One has duty, one has family.It's an action movie, think what Avengers Civil War, Batman vs Superman should have been. In modern American movies, the overuse of CGI makes the movies look cheap. RRR has CGI and some places it does look a little cheap, but for a modern big budget film, it delivers.I have to give it between a 9 and 10. My expectations were low, but the AMAZING actions scenes were filmed very well, the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well done.Highly recommended and a must see.",

            "review_title": "SS Rajamouli Delivers A Power Packed Action Entertainer Once Again, Made Only For Big Screen !!!",
            "content": "The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fianc\u00e9 Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.",

            "content": "It strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet, whenever I venture to the studios of India, and its array of languages, innovations and stories, the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive - and quite often spectacular. This is one such film, a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more. Read the reviews of others if you want to know the story, but take it from me, if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire, this is for you. On a par with anything you may have come across in the past, and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you, which it surely will - irresistible.",

            "content": "Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi \"here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO\" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of \"f the Brits\" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it's totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career! (If only Aamir Khan was here, 5 stars easy).",

            "content": "If Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what S. S. Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film's two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the \"main hero\". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts. This is what cinema exists for, and you don't need to think too much before booking your tickets.",

It's nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action. But more than the great camera work and fantastic music (this movie sounds tremendous), RRR knows how to setup a story. From the very beginning, screentime is being used to setup payoffs later.I can see the violence being an issue for some (though, RRR is not nearly as gory as many films, but it can feel brutal at times--enough that I can't really call this a family film).One of the best films I've seen.

            "content": "RRR is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year. It's been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful Tollywood films of all time. My question is why?I'm not familiar at all with Tollywood/Bollywood movies. This was the first one I've seen all the way through. But prior to watching RRR, I was familiar with all of the Bollywood clich\u00e9s and have seen numerous infamous clips on YouTube. They're all very over the top with their presentation and acting, they're all very long, and they all include several dance/musical numbers. But I figured since this was the first Tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie, something that stood out and there really isn't.As I was watching RRR I thought to myself, what if this was an American film and it featured the same story, the same action scenes, and the same length? I would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated, too tonally inconsistent, having bad CGI effects, terrible pacing, underdeveloped romantic subplots, and one-dimensional villains. But I guess since this is a Tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine? Do they add to the charm of this film? I don't know but I'm honestly low-key baffled by the reception that RRR is getting.And I'm also baffled by how this Tollywood film looks just like every other Indian action film that has come out for the past several years. Seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other Indian blockbusters?Here are a few positives I can give this film. There is some nice direction and cinematography, both of the lead actors have good chemistry, some of the action scenes are fun (some are also completely stupid) and sometimes the score is good (and sometimes it's not and very random). Clearly, Indian blockbuster films are just not for me, I'll acknowledge that. Cinema is subjective, so to the people who genuinely love this movie, I'm happy for you, but I still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and I still think it's easily the most overrated film to come out this year, by a lot.",

But the two factors combined really puts largest movie producing country in the world behind all the other countries.Coming back to RRR, everything in this movie is way over the top and two protagonist are mightier than superheroes. Even Captain America will give in if barely given food for two weeks but our hero barely loses a muscle and he is not just hungry but wounded as well. Other protagonist doesn't even squeeze his eyebrows when whipped by barbed whip and doesn't flinch releasing wild animals in a party when there can be women and children present. The emotions are so basic and solution so convenient. Most Englishmen seen in the movie do not have a shred of decency and are de facto villains. Movie that is so colorful all the characters are either black or white.

The film is three hours long, but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story. The highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads. The instant rapport and harmony between Ram and Bheem is inspiring, which makes some of the later moments so poignant.As a whole, RRR is over-the-top and big, but also subtle and real. In one moment I would be grinning ear to ear, in the next I was crying, and in the next I was gasping with excitement. Though there were elements I didn't fully understand, I can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and I am anxious to give it another watch.Note: If watching at home, I would recommend watching this film in two or three parts.

There is no questioning this film's technical achievements, which are many. The CGI could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film. This begins with a girl in India being kidnapped by a British governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that, hundreds, if not thousands, die. Throw all logic out the window with this one. Everything in this film is over-the-top. The action, the story, the characters, the violence, even the music. It is beautiful to look at, no doubt, but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly, though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch, but turn off your brain before viewing. The actors put a lot into this, especially the two leads, but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are. Cecille B. DeMille would be envious.",

            "content": "RRR (2022) :\nMovie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with \"Saaho\" and \"Radhe Shyam\". Let's just accept the fact that a film like \"Bahubali : The Conclusion\" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what \"mass cinema\" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while \"Naacho Naacho,\" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. \"Dosti\" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and \"Komuram Bheemudo\" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear \"Raamam Raaghavam\" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed \"Big-Screen Experience\" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and \"The Lion King\" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*",

However, the storyline is super weak. Jr NTR's connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire. Ram's motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the British to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare. Lots of sequences in the movie also doesn't make sense, like Jr NTR spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals, transport them to the city, feed them for months and then unleash them on the British army? PLEASE! That was so funny. Then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker? I mean, c'mon Rajamouli. Bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals. Here, the visuals are mediocre, story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe. The actors have done well though. Good chemistry and required machismo. Especially Ram Charan. Hopefully, we get such funds/resources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story.",

Of the two main actors, one is pretty good but spends too much time posing for action posters, and the other is blank-faced throughout. Of the secondary characters, two women are pretty decent actors, and a few others with bit roles are okay. But none of the British antagonists seem to be actual actors at all - more like expats who happen to live and work in the area and were used just because they were 'white'.Mostly, so much happens that is cheesy and ridiculous, that it's simply not that good a movie. I enjoyed some of the cultural elements, and think it's a positive thing that it gives more exposure to the way the history of British colonialism is viewed in many nations.

The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called \"pan-Indian\" label.",

            "content": "The Bollywood style of filmmaking has, arguably, become a distinct genre all its own, characterized by long, visually dazzling movies filled with action sequences on steroids, hyper-energized music video segments (regardless if relevant to the story), and glamorously designed costumes, hair and makeup. It's definitely an acquired taste and eminently commercial, but it's not exactly something one could characterize as epic, groundbreaking cinema. Which is why I'm stunned by all of the attention and awards season buzz that's being showered on this over-the-top offering, one that's fairly typical of releases in this genre. In this hypothetical \"what if\" tale about a fictitious meeting between a pair of Indian freedom fighters who struggled against brutal British colonial rule (and who never met in real life), writer-director S. S. Rajamouli takes viewers on a whirlwind action-adventure saga that's preposterous, predictable, clich\u00c3\u00a9d, at times juvenile, and, above all, exhausting by the time one reaches the end of its 3+-hour runtime. The trite dialogue, corny narrative, cheesy CGI effects (particularly the film's wild animals) and monodimensional characters (most notably the big bad Brits who come across more like caricatures than villains) are all laughable, almost as much as the film's fight sequences, which play like scenes from the \"John Wick\" and \"Matrix\" franchises with a dash of martial arts flicks thrown in for good measure. In fact, were it not for the seemingly incessant runtime, this might qualify as one of those good \"bad\" offerings for a group movie night, though the film becomes tiresome about an hour in and can't adequately sustain that sense of high camp for more than 180 minutes. In its defense, the picture's choreography in the musical sequences is commendable (if at times it's like watching a protracted aerobics class), and the costumes, art direction and set design are all noteworthy (save, of course, for a shattered marble railing in one scene that looks like the Styrofoam from which it appears to have been made). Given all of the foregoing, however, I'm truly perplexed why this release has been singled out from the other films in this genre as the beneficiary of such generous awards season recognition, perhaps other than the fact that it has been a huge box office hit worldwide, which may well have something to do with that. But is that milestone enough to drive the ample bestowing of such accolades? Remember, popcorn may qualify as a great snack, but it certainly does not a meal make.",

This is catered towards the simple minded audiences. How Rajamouli managed to rope in reputed Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson is beyond me. As for Ajay Devgun, looks like the director grabbed him right off the sets of Tanhaji but he did have a decent cameo; careful don't blink you might miss Alia in the movie. Liberal use of cheap CGI, in fact I have seen better CGI in made for TV movies. The whole premise of this 3 hour movie unravels around the kidnapping of a tribal child which I found weak definitely not in the league of Bahubali by a long shot. If you're still curious what all the fuss is about, have a look. If you want to save your money, I suggest waiting till it shows up on your TV.",

            "content": "Movie could have beeen good but it fails many ways in storyThe biggest letdown was the story, second half, and some bits of misalignment of how the story is framed.The story as in, they took both real-life characters and just didn't genuinely tell their life story or freedom struggle but it was more like, \"Oh these two are characters exists who you can check it online, and we used one's character to show saving the tribal girl, and another to avenge the father's death more in the pretext of stockpiling the weapons to wage war against brits\" that's it.This can't be called a good story. I would give it 1 or 2 just for the story, not even 7. I mean after the first attack at the party, the Brit leader could have easily shot the girl to settle things. But he goes on punishing the Bheema who was caught, which seems illogical if you think of it. Brits would have killed both girl and him back then. They often just want to kill as many people without any mercy, which is a fact. This didn't align with the genuine story. Think of Sardar Uddham, they showed they were merciless and hardly cared about kids or anyone if they wanted to shoot, they just did it. Just like Nazis. So it kind of didn't give needed liking from the start.Second half: The issue was, there is no setup of who Ajay was in the first place or his wife or those village army people he was training, and the one who was often seen with Ram to help him with his goals to get near weapons. I mean when they introduce Ram's character, they show him fighting with so many people to get one guy. The ferocity in which it's shown to fight all there just to get that guy, he could have simply killed the brits killed as they were short numbered and got the whole people's support charging them up to revolt and seeking their help to hide his identity and later can get the weapons. Why I'm saying this is, he does the same to Bheem and that time Bhim sings and makes every people raked up. It's still the same, isn't it?And this makes Ram believe in Bheem's ability to lead as he could be more force, while he had a similar opportunity at the start freely given. Both these two situations don't equate to the necessary logic of fighting against brits when brits were so cornered.. And both times Brit nowhere had any stronger points to create havoc and the only thing they held was the girl, whom they could have easily killed in reality.Framing of the story: I felt they should have started with Ajay being the older guy with young son Ram both fighting and it would have helped the second half making more thrilling effect.Overall it's a decent movie, won't say good or best, but just a one-time popcorn masala watch. Even Alia, Shreya, Ajay, and Tamil actor were so underutilized. Their existence too was pointless in a way. It could have been a best-made film if they genuinely tried to tell the real-life story of the characters even if wanted to go over the top sure like Sai Ra Narasimha Reddy's style.But what stood out and truly helped the movie was the performance of both Jnr NTR and Ramcharan, their bromance is the only thing which saved the movie-watching experience, I feel. It's not the story, it's their acting, a few good visuals. That's it.",

It all gets way too much and spans for way too long doing it.I can only guess that the majority of newly added 10* starred reviews are from people who hate the British (fair) or westerners who've never seen a tollywood/Telugu film before and just watched the Hindi-dub on Netflix (most likely) jumping on the bandwagon.For Tollywood fans and Tamil/Telugu speakers this movie is a great upgrade for what they're normally used to, but everyone else is hyping this film up to something it's not.",

            "content": "After a delay of almost 2 years, SS Rajamouli's latest magnum opus is finally here. A film that needs to be watched on the big screen to be appreciated for the effort gone into making it. Rajamouli knows his audience really well and the thunderous response that RRR is receiving is proof of that.RRR follows a familiar template; one that is common to all action films. Two ripped action heroes burst into the screen ridding on expensive set pieces. They meet and their bromance develops but later they realise that they were meant to stop each other. But a few scenes later, they reconcile and join forces. Apply this to the pre-independence era or 100 years later; the result is the same.Rajamouli is a filmmaker, who lies squarely in between Bhansali & Gowarikar. He goes big with all the grandeur but the plot doesn't match up to all the grandeur. The film stars Ram Charan as Alluri Sitarama Raju (a Telugu revolutionary) & Jr NTR plays Komaram Bheem (revolutionary leader from the Gond tribes). RRR is an entirely fictional story: \"what if the two revolutionaries had met in real life\". I loved NTR's performance the most and the bromance between the leads in the first half. But the second half leaves you disappointed with the usual heavy flying objects and humans. Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Shriya Saran, Olivia Morris, Alison Doody, Rahul Ramakrishna co-starPersonally, I liked RRR more than the two part Bahubali. Bahubali was stretched into two films for no reason & the film was ultimately a big bore. But with RRR, we get a more entertaining and well-paced plot with better performances, high-octane set pieces and foot tapping songs.RRR has a pulsating and highly entertaining first half (more grounded in terms of set pieces as well). But post-interval, it starts to drag to such an extent that even the bow wielding Ram Charan & the bike flipping NTR Jr. Can't save it.",

The close up shots, the well made CGI all took this movie up some notches.Though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti British fetish. The commercial elements was seen everywhere but I guess that was intentional for mass audiences.It was great to experience it in 3D. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance.",

However, I gotta give it to RRR for making it actually fun and exciting.Horrendous CGI aside, the dance scenes were super dope, especially that dance battle. Me and my boy actually wanted to give the dance a try. It won't be that good, but the point is that the actors were damn entertaining and amazing executing those moves.The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining.The story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle part. I was bored for a good chunk, waiting for more action scenes. The backstories didn't really add much to the present plot, even though they provided some more fun action. And of course, I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters, as I just wanted this movie to be all about the over-the-top action.Overall, it's a highly entertaining movie that I had a great time even though there's still many problems with it. 7.5/10.",

A global sensation that is much hyped and successful in getting high ratings in many online movie review and rating platforms.When I watched the film in theatre, I felt goosebumps covering all over my skin. The experience felt indescribably great. But still it seems the movie isn't a great one.Visual Effects and Direction are all top-notch, one of the best in Indian Commercial Cinema. But something that is really necessary for a film to be good is a well-written screenplay, and that's what the film lacks horribly. The story is very weak and shallow that the director made all the aesthetic dependent on the breathtaking visual effects, larger-than-life protagonists and over-the-top action scenes.The action scenes are all well-shot and pulsating, and the defiance of physics doesn't have to be taken into consideration.Also at the same time, the most significant problem of the film lies here too. At the end of the film, it seemed like the whole movie was made only to be a gallery for action scenes. The exaggerated action scenes, even though they are good to watch, doesn't have a good story to be attached with. The story is too weak that it cant even be considered a story.Two guys form a friendship, later on splits apart and forms the friendship once again, and fights for their aim together. If I go for a better detailing it will end up in spoilers. The two lead characters are also resembled with historical and mythological characters, but even that wasn't given any proper writing. The lack of depths in characters and weak conflicts are the main problems that could be seen in the screenplay.It's a movie on a budget of 550 crores, but the story is not something that satisfy spending on that scale. And it's an SS Rajamouli film, the magnificence of his previous films like Baahubali is explicitly missing in RRR mainly due to the apparent lack of quality in the screenplay.Whatever it is, the film is still a watchable one. The visual effects and action scenes does the job of making the viewer stay focused on the screen till the end. But still, those VFX stunts are all just instant gratification, not something of good artistic value.",

            "content": "RRR review :The one movie which came in my mind after watching Rajamouli's three hour plus extravaganza is the late Manmohan Desai's Mard (1985). Like Desai's last hit, RRR is all about fighting against British who are depicted here as blood sucking vampires, no less! In fact, one British General's wife demands more blood and gore as she witnesses the public flogging of a lead actor. Oofff!!By the way, the British are not just mere murderers but also randomly pick up innocent children from their village for a pound or two. The entire three hour screenplay is dedicated to bringing this child back from their evil clutches. Woah!!Unlike his previous Bahubali (2015), Rajamouli has chosen a flimsy plot this time and though he infuses his trademark dazzle and grandeur, the end result is nowhere close to his erstwhile blockbuster. Yup, we get many breathtaking visuals and superbly choreographed action setpieces but RRR just doesn't hold on the whole. In one scene, we see NTR Jr. Holding a vintage motorcycle and then throwing it like a frisbee on his opponent. Oh, and we blame poor John Abraham in Bollywood for doing the same!!Of the cast, Junior NTR and Ram Charan are both brilliant and their onscreen camaraderie reminded me of Dharam-Jeetendra in Desai's another hit Dharam Veer (1977). Thats the thing with RRR...it makes you nostalgic of all those Bollywood excesses of yore. The times when we applauded the hero bashing up a few thousands single handedly (Ram Charan's intro for example) or taming a tiger with his bare hands (NTR's great grand entry). Growwlll! This is a typical vintage masala flick presented on a spectacular scale in 3D with some four hundred crores worth of investment. Offo!!Not that I am against all yesteryear masala entertainers but in today's world, a four hundred crores magnum opus which can only afford to bring back nostalgia of those classic entertainers then made with significant budget constraints cannot be wholeheartedly appreciated. Please!!Bollywood stars Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt appear in cameos just to make the film saleable in the Hindi belt. Devgn gets two scenes. Alia gets three. There is zero value add from these two!! The British actors are so caricaturish that perhaps, even animation would work fine in place of humans; I kid you not!!On the positive, the production values are top notch, the VFX is reasonably impressive (first hour specially) and the climactic transformation of Ram Charan in to Lord Ram's avatar is an interesting twist which drew loud whistles in the half empty Paradise Cinema, Mahim I visited first day first show. Sadly, the rest of the movie was all deja vu!!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

For the budget, I was expecting much better CGI than Bahubali, but it was just as bad. BB was first such big movie, so the poor CGI was ignored by most. But here, the makers have no excuse as they have spent a ton of money and it has been nearly 6-7 years since BB, so technology has advanced as well. Even a simple fort, crowds, or some bird-view shots of the ground look cheesy. Possibly, the makers spent all the money on marketing and forgot about the product.Overall, it's an average movie.

Lets go in order as there is a lot to cover in this 3 hour film. First lets start which the fact that its 3 hours long, as a surprise to when I did my research of this film I found out that it was going to be nearly 4 hours long originally, now I will go over why cutting the movies down to 3 hours was a good move later but that's just a piece of information it would be good to know. Lets begin with the storyline, to say in simple words its boring, usually in these types of movies there is some sort of twist or turn that keeps things interesting, but not this one. The story is extremely linear and there is a good chance you could predict the whole movies by watching the first 30 minutes. Not to mention most the story flashbacks and the characters motives are revealed in the first half of the movie ,this means there was no reason to even watch the second half because we know what happened already. This is something that I think is pretty dumb because if you are going to make a 3 hour long movie you need to keep the audience engaged and revealing most the stuff in the first half is doing the exact opposite of that. If we are looking at the general storyline its pretty bland and the action mostly saves the large amount of loopholes and illogical scenes. Next lets talk characters, this was a pretty big mess. So just by watching the movies its obvious that Ram Charan's character had a lot more effort put into it than Jr NTRs character. This is pretty obvious when they go into their flashbacks and motives, also when they are in emotional scenes. Ram Charan seemed more motivated to his cause than Jr NTR seemed to his. Over all Jr NTRs character could have used some work. On a side note there were character like Alia Bhatt and Samurthrakani who posed no significance and were practically useless in this movies, I would have rather preferred that there were less significant actors in their roles because they barely got screen time and it was disappointing to the select audience that are fans and had come to watch the movies for them. Ok now lets talk about the logic and loopholes. Now I can't go over all of them because I would be here all day. Now getting past the Physical logicality of this movies has to be done because in pretty much every scenes there is no regard to the physical world of things and that is evident when he jump across 3 barrels in the first scene. Lets talk storyline logic, so one thing that is really stupid is that there is no regard to the period language and attitude. The British speak modern day English and it really takes away the whole period era vibes. Also this is more of a nitpick but the uniforms and ranks of the officer are incorrect and this shows that there wasn't much effort put into these parts. Now I'm only going to go over one more loophole as there is simply too many. So in Ram's flashback scene it is shows that the British was sent by the government to arrest the militia leader and break the militia up, a bunch of people died and the rest escaped, then later in the movies it is shown that the British government sent a letter to Seetha who is part of the still active militia, now if they knew her address why didn't they just send people to go arrest them and detain them, they are still a active militia and the British government already tried once to capture them and failed so wouldn't they try to capture them again if they knew where they were. So those are the main problems, some side issues include the fact that the 2 main characters basically killed a bunch of innocent people, now some of the British soldiers were bad people but not all of them, in the scenes where they kill multiple soldiers they can't all be bad people ,they are just fighting for their country. Now the main characters get away with this and they feel no guilt at all as if they are taking more lives of the innocent than saving. There is more to talk about and I may extend my review later but in the conclusion you should still go watch this movies in the theaters because the movies was originally said to release in 2020 and the director and crew have gone through a lot to produce this movie after jumping through lots of hurdles, its evident that SS Rajamouli put passion in to this and that is always appreciated, so turn off your brain and watch the movie and you will enjoy it.",

            "review_title": "The best movie of 2022; unrelentingly spectacular",
            "content": "I talked about this film at great length with my brother and father at the screening we attended -- that screening being at my father's new house with the worthy home theater set. The word \"cheesy\" came up, and whether this film is truly befitting of that term or if it simply doesn't care how cheesy you find it. Is it even a bad word?In any case, the new Indian epic RRR is, to put it mildly, a most remarkable film. A spectacle. A spectacle of the sort that, as one Letterboxd user noted, Hollywood has all but forgotten. Shifting between or mixing such genres as historical drama, action, mystery, (b)romantic comedy, and Tollywood musical, it never ceases to fire on all cylinders, is never once boring despite its 3-hour runtime, and is ultimately (in spite of being unapologetically crazy and going so over-the-top in its action set-pieces that it exits the Earth stratosphere) a deeply sincere, earnest, even inspiring film. Yes, I understand how weird this sounds if you've only seen the trailers and TikTok memes, but please do as I did with the movie and stay with me.A contemporary Hollywood production might've lampshaded the silliness of it all (so as to not alienate any normies), \u00e0 la Spider-Man's mockery of the name Doctor Octopus in his most recent sequel. But because the world of RRR takes itself seriously and the work as such is ultimately genuine with its characters and story, it is simultaneously funnier and more touching than anything Hollywood has put forth in decades.Directed by S. S. Rajamouli, RRR is essentially a historical (or perhaps folkloric) fan-fic, imagining the revolutionary 19th-century figures Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem (played passionately by Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) as buddy superheroes and drawing additional inspiration from Sanskrit scripture. Alay Devgn and Alia Bhatt play vital supporting roles. On the side of the British Crown, whom the director isn't afraid to depict as the most gloriously cartoonish of cartoonish villains, we see Ray Stevenson as Governor Scott Buxton and Alison Doody as his sadomasochist wife. Olivia Morris plays one of the \"good ones\" and becomes Bheem's love interest; a Love at First Sight sequence makes this as clear as visual media conceivably could.The unbridled passion isn't just in the characters, or their story of kinship, betrayal, and uproar (emphasis on \"roar\"), but extends to the technical level. Like I said, no matter which genre RRR momentarily finds itself in (musical, romance, elemental Fantasy, you name it), it always goes harder than it has any right to; the cinematography, editing, sound design, fighting choreography, and production design are constantly on fire -- sometimes literally. ('Tis no surprise that this is India's costliest film production to date.) The VFX and title graphics maintain the same energy throughout, often looking like something out of Mortal Kombat.Also electrifying is the music, M. M. Keeravani's thunderous score as well as the memorable and stirring production numbers, ranging from a loveable, flawlessly coordinated dance routine to a scene where a flogged freedom fighter sings through the anguish and rouses his people to action. Unlike many Bollywood joints, RRR's song numbers meaningfully exist in the film's universe and impact its story.Last but not least, there is a method to the madness when it comes to the screenplay: things that seem like throwaway gags or zany action bits will make a pivotal, triumphant return at a later stage. There may also be symbolic foreshadowing in these moments. One critic noted the use of the Indian flag -- and how it switches hands between the two leads -- during the otherwise bonkers \"bridge sequence\".My one complaint about the movie is barely a complaint about the picture itself. It concerns the dubbing. I've been told it is standard Tollywood practice to dub over the dialogue and never record any sound during photography -- or at least not use that audio for the final cut because only ADR creates the desired booming sound. This was somewhat noticeable with the English-speaking characters, but the problem is that the most readily available, maybe \"official\" version of the movie is, for the rest of the runtime, in Hindi.Alas, all of the non-English speakers were filmed speaking Telugu and, yeah, one can tell. I'm reminded of the official release of Werckmeister Harmonies, which is in Hungarian and will often be mistaken for the \"wrong\" one by cinephiles who search for it because the lead actor spoke his native German during production. But now I'm really stretching to find something -- anything -- to dislike about this.I'm hoping RRR will be this year's Parasite -- that is, a movie that red-pills an inordinate amount of people on the fact that there exists a whole world of cinema outside the stale Hollywood bubble. Indeed, even if I've described the film in such a way that it sounds too outlandish for some, the truth is that the story and characterizations as such are largely accessible. When I describe RRR as \"the best of all worlds\" (to quote my brother), I'm not just referring to the genre mixture; it's an accessible, ultra-fun adventure on one hand, and a daringly unconventional piece of art on the other (outside of all the bonkers-ness I've mentioned, it isn't shy to put its title screen 40 minutes in, \u00e0 la Gaspar No\u00e9's Climax).Like Everything Everywhere All At Once (another \"unusually funny yet unusually serious\" work that floored a great number of people who named it the most intense cinematic experience they'd had in ages, which I'm more prepared to say about this one), RRR is a film of contradictions:It is more hilarious yet also more poignant than any other movie I've seen this year. It doesn't give a f-ck if anyone finds it too ridiculous, yet is deeply devoted to its vision and craft. It is utterly over-the-top, yet probably does justice to the plight of its subject, more so than a vanilla historical drama might've done. It is one of the best movies I've watched in recent memory, where I completely understand if some walk away thinking it's one of the worsts.",

Pretty much cartoon style action adventure with incredible shots and well matched opponents.The cinematography is great, the story is not that unique, but the delivery is Bollywood on Bruce Willis of the 90's steroids. The actors are strong as they deliver an overall the top performance, and the music is interesting - perfect at times and too much at other times and like everything else, way over the top, as is the acting, to the point of comical often, but still worth it if only for the sheer nerve of it all! Of course it is as ridiculous as any war film is, since war is utterly absurd, but that is what it is. No sillier than any Rambo movie though.This film will absolutely and completely point out the abject evil of colonialism for sure, and the lostness of those who turn against their own, but that is a universal truth being told again and again in books, plays and films for centuries. It also speaks to the subterfuge of the double agent and the struggles they face. There's a lot going on in this film, but determination is the key to this story.Some of the brutality goes on too long, but apparently India is a brutal country. The cruelty with which powermonging monsters work to keep and exact that power is often astounding. Revolution is a powerful thing, and more often than not needed. This is apparent in this film. It is a tribute film to revolutionaries who fought to freedom under colonialism though I don't recognize most of the people at the end that they seem to be honoring. Still, good to know.It is well worth seeing if you like action. There is a combination of everything in this film. It is worth it for the sheer physicality of the movie if nothing else. These actors are no joke as action heroes go, and Bheem is India's McGiver! The stunts are off the chain!

It is predictable when it comes to the story but also the good and bad guys in this. I mean the bad guys are so over the top it might hurt.So why is my rating so good you may ask? It is because the movie is quite the looker! The visuals is as awesome as it can be. The stunts and the CGI work - many times involving animals too. You can tell the animals are fake (the foreword including the not wanting to offend anyone was actually not necessary, but I guess they wanted to be safe, not to hurt anyones feelings), but it doesn't matter. Because it still looks awesome. And there are plenty of scenes involving animals where you literally will go \"wow\" .. or \"whoa\" ... or whatever other noise you are making.Stunt/fight choreography is off the charts ... giving the main characters almost super human strength. Actually not almost, but certainly - also add \"abilities\" to it, that are just not realistic in any sense of that word. Su suspending ones disbelief is part of the deal - it is actually a must! Even if it may a bit too long for my liking too ...",

One of the things that makes it a choice of the moviegoers is the ability to connect with the audience, making it a mass entertainer with its Elements of what we call a masala movie going experience. Ajay Devgn left a mark, short lived but a pivotal role so I am glad he made his impact in the movie. Both the leads were great in their roles and I would choose Ramcharan if I had to pick one , partially because he had a better narrative and also his acting. The production team put their work on right note and as a whole the movie worked. This movie is better than other projects that the director has been part of, both in execution and overall production value. The movie connects mostly with the audience, making it an entertainer and a enjoyable experience. Unlike his previous movies, it has less dull moments and over the top acting performances, but putting them in the context and applied when necessary. A big shout to the composer and the score; it's a treat. So, the movie works on the most part, which makes it a entertainer and a movie package to be celebrated rather than reviewed and analyzed. Bottomline is it works and the right chords are put together in this movie :\nWhat did not work:\nIf I had chance, I would have worked on some technical aspect of the movie. Though better than previous movies, there were some room for improvements in editing and vfx team. Also, I would have been glad if the narratives had strong command, even more strong reasoning and motivations that guide the missions of the characters. Not saying, it's not there, but subtexts and sub layers would have made it better.Final verdict: it's a better Rajamuli project, and he has improved as a filmmaker. It does deserve a theatrical watch.",

            "content": "An extravagantly epic project in Indian cinema can only be done by a few and Rajamouli comfortably tops the list. Rajamouli knows to infuse cinematic brilliance amidst his huge larger-than-life, over-the-top storytelling. The visual glamour which he presents in his films is thoroughly satisfying and pleasing to watch.RRR is a film dipped in extreme tropes of commercialism, and still, there is a sense of realism in the characters and the events he presents throughout the film. The characters in the film are driven by typical human desires, what I mean to say you could realize every person's motive behind their actions which doesn't seem over the top rather it's how they execute their motives to achieve them is.The action set pieces are constructed extremely well, though that doesn't deny the fact that they are not logical, still, the build-up of every action sequence is infused with adrenaline rush and jaw-dropping visual splendor. The visual mastery of Rajamouli is instrumental in the epic sequences.Amidst all the visual extravaganza, there lies a simple storyline that is well balanced in three parallel screenplays. The fact that the story moves conventionally, not taking any absurd twists and turns to invoke a shock works because the nature of the film is thoroughly simplistic.The characters of Ram Charan and NTR mix well to form an exciting bromance story to screen. Both of them are fueled by opposite motivations, and that contrast adds more to their chemistry. NTR and Ram Charan of them were splendid in their roles and Rajamouli's script seems tailor-made for them.The film surely loses points in the comic scenes and takes down the watching experience a bit, but that doesn't last very long. The third act loses integrity and believability, although the visual brilliance has not left the film not for a single moment there too.The antagonists are strictly one-dimensional, though adding layers to their character was not necessary. The melodrama Rajamouli invokes in the film sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.The scenes of both the introductions of NTR and Ram charan were splendidly constructed and executed, both scenes deserve special mention.In an epic film of the highest proportions, Rajamouli delivers what he is expected. The indelible cinematic quality of a mass film is quite rare to achieve and Rajamouli has done that quite well.",

I saw the little Netflix reel with the tiger and thought, \"That's kind of awesome, but I don't think that movie is for me.\" But then this movie gets nominated for best foreign language film at the golden globes and I hear there's outrage that India would've won the Oscar if they'd submitted this as their submission. Then I see that this movie is mentioned on almost every single \"Best of 2022\" list of the year. Then the Critics Choice nominate it for best picture. It's pretty rare when normal internet movie folks and critics alike share a mutual love for a movie. Let alone an action movie. So I finally decided to watch it.It took me about 20-30 minutes to turn the logical part of my brain off and enjoy the spectacle. Once \"Naatu Naatu\" hit, it was over. I was on board and in love with this movie.I pitch this movie to people by saying, \"It's like a mix of golden age Hollywood/musical movies, 80's action movies, 90's war movies, and classic buddy movies into one gigantic film.\" By the sounds of it, you'd think this movie would be a tonal disaster. It is not. In fact, I think this is one of the most tonally balanced movies of the year. It also juggles the time nicely. I never once got bored watching this movie, and I watched it AT HOME! It is so hard to keep my attention at home, but this movie somehow achieved that.Definitely recommend this movie. It's a fun time and it will leave you smiling.",

Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..\nCinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it\n2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..\nI give 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece.",

            "content": "What can I say about RRR? On one level, it's preposterous, ridiculous, and just plain stupid. However, it is also very entertaining. The near-capacity audience that I saw it with laughed all the way through it. It's an Indian movie and has most of the elements that make movies big hits in India: songs and dances (often popping up in the strangest situations), lots of martial arts scenes, violence and bloodshed attached to basically simplistic stories with innocent good guys and truly evil bad guys. Since the story takes place during the British Raj, it's the British who are the villains and the poor Indian villagers who are the victims. The story starts when a group of British aristocrats decide to take a little native girl who sings prettily away from her village and bring her to live in their household to entertain their guests. Her family does not want her to leave. The British throw a few coins at them and take the child anyway, (knocking the mother in the head during the process). The villagers are determined to get the girl back; the British are determined to show these \"brown trash\" who's boss. There are two attractive young men fighting on opposite sides in this struggle. They don't know that they are on opposite sides and swear fast friendship. You can only imagine the havoc that is wreaked when the truth is revealed to them, as both of them have superhuman strength. Their fights are elaborate and spectacular, no doubt inspired by the battles between Rama and the demons in THE RAMAYANA. Out of bullets? Just pick up your motorcycle and beat your opponent to death with it. The two guys are also great dancers (thanks to the aid of CGI). It all ends happily despite all the carnage. It's fun, but it's also long-more than 3 hours with an intermission. This film was awarded the New York Film Critics Award for Best Director. My question is: where does film direction end, and computer programming begin? The whole film looks like a violent video game. The good guys are pure of heart and look it. The bad Brits are an unattractive lot (fat and hairy for the most part); the head villainess looks remarkably like Jocelyn Wildenstein! RRR is entertaining, but I felt a little guilty about spending more than three hours viewing it. Would I recommend it? Only with an audience to laugh along with you.",

Told with kinetic flair and riding on restless momentum, this 3-hour long larger-than-life epic extravaganza packs a gripping plot, interesting character dynamics & charismatic leads to go along with its explosive action spectacle and is entertaining throughout.Written & directed by S. S. Rajamouli, the premise setup is neat and characters introductions are striking enough to stand out and the film only gets bigger, bolder & better as plot progresses. Rajamouli aims for maximalist entertainment here and makes his intentions clear during the first action segment only but what's more impressive is him making sure that the story fundamentals are covered before going all-in on the elaborate set pieces.Its 182 mins runtime never becomes a bother, thanks to its consistent narration & smooth flow. While the romance subplot & musical numbers are uncalled for, they are finely intertwined into the storyline. The action is ludicrous & CGI is cartoonish and yet what Rajamouli was going for with his imagination makes them work. The story rides on the bromance between its two leads and both the actors contribute with strong individual inputs while also delivering as a duo.Overall, RRR is a resounding & reverberating ride that blends history & mythology into one rip-roaring & action-packed cinematic offering that's as roisterous & ravishing as it is reductive & ridiculous at times. While it's easy to get swept away by its overwhelming rapture, flamboyant appeal & invigorating quality, the film does a fab job of juggling its narrative priorities with entertainment obligations and rises, roars & revolts enough to soar above the sea of mindless blockbusters.",

All those mainstream movie lovers, where are you at? Come and take a look, you got the peak of commercial cinema here, and that's not even an exaggeration! With scintillating imageries, stupendous sets, and a phenomenally mastered composition (one of the best sound designs my ears have experienced); Rajamouli's 'brainchild' is cut above the rest.Now I know some of you may come up with some objections regarding the film's quite outrageous, and melodramatic approach, while you are right from your viewpoint, the movie does have some of those ridiculous, over-the-top stints, yet, the apt guidance from Rajamouli and his innate sense of world-building more than make up for the notable peculiarities. I would go as far as to say, his style of presentation makes the entire set-up believable and almost convinces us with the very notion that these characters (Ram & Bheem) are superhuman\nand they indeed possess superhuman strengths.Their amazing performances make their case even stronger. Both Ram Charan and Jr. NTR were exceptionally good in their respective roles. Their camaraderie, their alliance, the bromance, and the chemistry between them are what sealed the deal for me. While Jr. NTR does what he does best, and he's honestly great at it but it's rather Ram Charan who mesmerizes. Speaking for myself, this is his best work to date. There are some well-touted cameo appearances from Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt as well. While the former had been given a meaningful part to play, the latter endured less importance and even lesser screen presence. That's probably my only complaint to Rajamouli for not taking advantage of Alia's highly regarded acting prowess. In other respects, he outdid himself once again!",

The dramatic scenes are effective, and you can feel the pain the characters go through throughout the movie.There are dance battles and/or only regular dance numbers that are well done, you can admire the dance choreography because of how fast they move to the music. The British in the movie is clearly shown as evil and brutal when going up against people from India, I thought this was a way for us to root for the main characters but also know what it was like being attacked by them.RRR (2022) is a movie I highly recommend that has great action, dance numbers, choreography, acting, and good music.

The story is very strong, with full of Indian movies masala elements, set in pre-independence era 1920s around Delhi.Overall I thought Ram Charan steal the show, but people will forget his role as when I think of the best moments mostly I recall is of Jr. NTR's be it remembering the name of Jenny or attacking the British Palace- my best ever screen scene in Indian movie frame, the interaction with Seeta- Alia Bhatt when he finds out Rama's reality all belongs to JrNTR. But the Ram Charan's character is better written so BOTH are equally good. Another solid performance from Ajay Devgan as freedom fighter and interesting he training arms to his people without real arms. Both the ladies Alia Bhatt and Olivia Morris done very good justice in their respective role.You need to watch this movie in the Theater and should not wait for digital release as you will enjoy the movie in much larger canvass especially the Climax portion of the movie, the early part when both Rama and Bheem meets and saves the child at the river or the scene I already mentioned when Bheem attacks the British Palace in a truck.The story penned by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad is very strong and have all the elements that we see in Indian movie since our childhood. Its Once again hats off to the Director SS Rajamouli for making this movie- every frame is a masterpiece of its own.But Too long, and somewhat predictable story with missing family, revenge, suffering, fighting back, good vs evils, Ramayana elements... again done in a very unique and enjoyable way.

When the men meet, not knowing each other's purpose, they become friends, but friendship inevitably turns to violence in order for them to complete their missions.With impossibly strong heroes who can withstand intense pain and brutality, outrageous action sequences that make the Fast & Furious films seem realistic by comparison, a total absence of historical accuracy, more slow motion than a dozen John Woo movies, a whole menagerie of unconvincing CGI animals, and ridiculously vile villains, this is a film that requires the viewer to suspend disbelief and just go with the flow. If you can do that, then the film should prove thoroughly entertaining for the duration (over three hours): it's directed with panache by S. S. Rajamouli, the cinematography is stunning, the pace is brisk, the fight scenes are bone-crushingly violent, and while patently ridiculous, the story is engaging.8/10.

It's a fun movie to watch but for me a one time watch only.When a films stand out points become the CGI or VFX and overshadow the story, screenplay, acting and dialogues then it stops being a watchable experience and transcends into the ridiculous.However when these effects are canned with no sense of the real then the final result is purely a reckless attempt at movie making.This for me is the crux of the matter with RRR. A film maker with a hefty budget, around \u00a375 million, from what I can gather, is unable to use the modern techniques available to him to make action sequences that are rational as well as being riveting. To me it is nothing short of lazy pre-production thinking.Instead of making the action larger than life a good film maker would spend time on creating slightly smaller action packed scenes that not only carried realism but also managed to convey the message to the audience.As an example the introduction scene for Ram could easily have been watered down to give it some rationality and at the same time inform the audience the lengths this character would go to impress his superiors.Cut scenes added at the last minute to further the story again signals at poor planning from the makers, such as Bheems British love interest sharing a map of the prison compound with Bheem seemingly out of nowhere. Who & how did someone get the message to her?The actress that played Sita, portrayed as an ordinary villager, seemed to look a million dollars each time with immaculate clothing, hair, makeup etc when all the other villagers were shown wearing peasants attire.Too many inconsistencies like this ruined the movie for me.",

Right from the start, there's so many beautiful frames and extremely well done shots/animation. Somehow every scene kept improving upon the next and halfway through you get immune to their super human strength. The sheer thought that went behind some of the scenes is just amazing.Couple of scenes in the middle and end (without spoilers) were just so brilliantly shot! The fight scenes are akin to Marvel's and I'm definitely in awe. I know I would definitely watch this again and recommend it to all.",

AJAY DEVGN, ALIA BHATT lend good support for the limited screen time they have.The story has been written keeping CHARAN's character RAM in mind as he explodes into all the different shades of his character and does complete justice to them.Overall, RRR has a fabulous first half and a slightly underwhelming and stretchy, but thoroughly engaging second half. If you are a fan of either of the stars, watching RRR is a no brainer decision. In case, you are not, the grandeur, larger than life making makes it a sure shot watch.This one is worth the wait and will surely hit the box office numbers out of the park.PS: Wait till the end credits for a cameo by RAJAMOULI.",

I don't know how a person maintains same muscle after not eating for 2 weeks. If they have any tricks, i want to know it.The most depressing part is villains are portrayed as complete villains. There is no perspective from their side. This is like a 19th century movie where whatever protagonist does is right, and villains are always wrong.If 2 people can destroy a entire British battalion and can defeat 1000 protesters, then why didn't we get independence in 1912.

            "content": "Hey, Streamers! Word of mouth is a powerful tool in marketing a movie. I have been hearing about this epic, 3-hour action flick from India for the past few months. I heard that it was a spectacle full of high octane action sequences, musical performances and more that had to be seen to be believed. While I couldn't catch this one in the theater, Netflix has added RRR to its service. Here's how it goes.Yes, RRR is an epic, action movie about two men on a collision course with the British Empire in India. There is Bheem, who sets out to rescue Malli, a young girl from his tribe who was kidnapped by the British governor and his wicked wife. Then, there is Rama, an Indian police officer working for the British army. Bheem is fierce and ruthless, cunning and singularly focused on his goal to save Malli. Rama is equally fierce and ruthless and set on protecting the British government. As Bheem and Rama meet and become unlikely friends, secrets and hidden agendas lead to more than they both bargained for in their relationship and lead to the simmering revolutions against the British Empire.Despite its 3-hour run time, RRR is relentless. There are some lulls when the movie is setting up its plot, but it doesn't dwell much in exposition. Believe me, you may need a moment to breathe in between these action sequences. The film moves from action sequence to musical number and back. There are crazy visual effects and boundless energy coming from the screen through the camera movements and the actors.Actually, words cannot explain what this movie is really like. You just have to see it to believe it.RRR is a must-see movie. Sure, it's long, but don't let the runtime deter you. There is enough energy and action to fill the screen from beginning to end. It is surprising and worth the time spent. Grab a big box of popcorn and settle in for butt kicking and dancing and action in RRR.",

SS Rajamouli takes all the time in the world to let his characters get fleshed out, but every scene comes with its share of minimal-to-maximal levels of excitement and intrigue. The set-pieces are cranked all the way up, and shot in the most inventive ways possible. Rajamouli's writing is never the twisty kind, and many of the plot beats are predictable especially when you have two powerhouses (NTR Jr. And Ram Charan) in the lead, though he renders it an air of acceptability.Yeah, many filmmakers have taken cinematic liberties to alter the course of history before (Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained immediately come to mind). Yet, when someone with the imaginative capability of Rajamouli attempts it in Indian cinema, you're sure to get a product that lives up to its hype. I wasn't exactly wowed by the mythological attributes and the in-your-face imagery that swerves towards a particular kind of politics. That being said, I was easily able to look past the physics-defying stunts and over-the-top nature of the climactic set-piece as the film ultimately focuses on the fundamental notions of friendship, revolution, and freedom.P. S - It's amazing how Rajamouli even pulled off a nice little rom-com in between all the bombastic stunts.",

That is \"Why on earth would someone shame our gods, our culture and our history\".To start off my review I would like you all to know this film is highly historically inaccurate and is also imaginary. Imaginary in a childish way.Why I say that? Because of the storytelling and cinematography. They're absurd! They've promised to bring back the magic of Indian Cinema on screen but instead they've took the cringe to whole another level.They've screwed physics on another level this time, much worse then Bahubali 1 and 2 part combined. For instance they've made a bike look like its nothing but a light stick.They've screwed with biology too, they've made a tiger look bigger than Liger and Panthera Leo, and a fox as almost as bigger as a modern day rhino.Coming to the scenes/montages of this films they're sometimes so fast paced and sometimes you will feel like how can I forward this?For instance the opening shot is so irritatingly fast that a you will still process it until you see the Jr. NTR.They don't explain how time is going in this movie which is very very bad story telling and illogical. A story teller even if he's telling a story he must be honest to his story and respect nature of time at least.The bond between NTR and Ram Charan almost feels like Homo Romance (#Pride) trust me they've done it horribly wrong.Now coming to the part that pisses me the most. That is really not respecting my country and Hindu god.Now when you see Ram he becomes Lord Rama in last part of the movie which irritates me more than enough because Lord Rama is god and not a ghost to posses him (if we think really deeply, you will get my point here).And this is not a respectful tribute to my country's history as its not honest in all the possible ways. You see India is a country that has been through a lot! That have given birth to many many freedom fighters that didn't had the luxury to run away from the punishments of British.They've escaped Britishers multiple times which makes Brits incompetent and stupid, which they were not. They were really horrible back in the days. They didn't show how racism was they just made party videos and showcased unrealistic patriotism throughout the film honestly.Coming to point many honest and patriotic people will relate to. India a country that has documented history older than word \"History\" itself. We have so many extra ordinary real life stories to tell and make the new generation know that what people have really done for freedom!!There are stories of so many kings who disobeyed British empire, fought bravely till last soldiers. Freedom fighters whose voice was crushed before they could speak. Humanitarians whose decisions made us who we are today (For example Mr. Jamsetji Tata\nand so many more) so many many more stories so many legends so many honest and true stories which both actors could relate and play.Almost everyone performed exceptionally well! However I just hope bollywood could get into a new direction and use its talent honestly. They're only making cringe movies making our audiences taste bad and putting history to shame.This movie is hilarious and makes no logical sense. If this kind of budget was used to produce Indie films OMG they'd had done more research than Mr SS Rajamaouli and his entire team would have ever done and come across with some exceptionally well movies in this genre.I still wish we have more movies based on colonial age because people need to be educated for this time.I hope you will get my point. This movie is absurd but watch it and decide for yourself. You may like it too.",

The last thing I expected to see after watching the first part of the movie was musical scenes, but damn was this a pretty impressive musical. The music and the dancing was mesmerizing from start to finish. But, RRR isn't a musical. RRR is one of if not the greatest action movies to ever be created. There were bodies flying through the air, motorcycles on fire, and some of Earth's deadliest animals fighting alongside the main characters. Everything about this movie was epic.Admittedly, I was confused for a decent part of this film when it came to the story. Between the flashbacks and the motives of the characters, I had a hard time following what was going on. All I knew was that I was watching some of the coolest cinematography and fight sequences of any movie I've ever seen. Although not it's strongest feature, the plot was interesting and was packed with a lot of twists and turns. I'm for sure going to have to rewatch to pick up on some of the smaller, more detailed things I missed out on, but it was overall pretty compelling. That was so awesome!",

I would have rated this movie a 7 until they broke the mood n atmosphere with their silly dances.To imagine how ridiculous many Indian films can get...imagine if watching a war movie and both sides are fighting n then suddenly they drop their weapons n starts dancing it out in a dance battle lol, thats what u get from films from Bollywood.I even tried watchin an Indian Zombie movie n same thing happened, everyone just breaks the 4th wall n starts dancing like a musical.The last Indian Film I will ever watch.",

And I say it both ways, for better and for worse, because obviously the filmmakers chose this concept over many other things, they chose to surprise the viewer with action sequences taken from the imaginary movie buff, where you just want to see fights, blood, sweat, bullets, explosions and if it's shown in slow motion, all the better. The film achieves its goal, of that there is no doubt. There are action scenes that I have never seen in any other movie and I was quite entertained. The bad thing is that all this bet on the spectacular sacrifices many technical aspects that I am sure that the friends of India are capable of doing without any problem. This film has gross errors in editing, sound editing, continuity and a long etcetera, just to favor the visual spectacle present in most of the film. The performances are aimed at its essence, falling all the time into exaggeration. The script is generic, predictable and sometimes boring. Finally, the length of the film is simply too long. It doesn't hold up for a movie of this genre.Overall, I was entertained and had a lot of fun with the overdose of action, but the glitches are an impossible distraction to ignore.",

Cartoonish villainy from the British colonists probably being the most egregious, but that romance between the lead and nice white lady is woof, tough to sit through.If you're one who enjoys camp, this is one to check out.

            "content": "Okay, so I almost NEVER leave reviews for movies, but I just finished watching this on Netflix, and could not figure out how to leave a review there, other than to give it a 2-thumbs up (which I did wholeheartedly), but I enjoyed this movie to such a degree that I literally went looking for a site/any site online that would allow me to leave a review, and so here I am. First off, I know that very many people might be deterred by 1) the fact that this is a foreign Hindi film with subtitles (I get it; I'm not a fan of subtitles either), and 2) the fact that it was over 3 hours long. But all I can think now is what a tragedy it would be to miss out on all this goodness just because one is too lazy to read some subtitles or not inclined to sit for 3 hours to watch this masterpiece. I mean, seriously... think about it. We waste 3 hours doing nonsense -- walking somebody's mall, indulging in surfacey nonsense talk on our cellphones, watching mindless reality shows on t.v. If we can do any of that, we should most definitely be able to spend time absorbing this cinematic masterpiece. RRR has every single thing a human mind and soul yearns for -- an amazing story with plot twists and turns that leave you reeling and that keep you riveted. It has the kind of action that leaves you speechless. I saw some comments about the action being over-the-top, but who cares? I'm sure neither the director nor producers swore on a stack of bibles that they were telling a factual, historical tale, so give me over-the-top. For all the Negative Nancies and Negative Nathans going on about over-the-top action, do you say the same thing when Vin Diesel/Dom jumps off a 40-storied building in his 1970 Dodge Charger in Fast & Furious and lives to tell the tale? I didn't think so, and that's equally over-the-top, so shut the hell up. This film moved me in more ways than I can even begin to express, and unlike some of the reviewers who seem to want to tell the entire story in their review (spoilers and all; which I absolutely hate), I'll simply say that if you're up for a piece of cinematic magic and want to come alive watching a movie like you've probably never done before, then stream and hit PLAY!

Ram's entry scene in the trailer as alluri sita rama raju was pretty amazing and triumphatic but the actual scene was just disappointing asf since they changed the background score.Now coming to what the movie was all about , \"The Action\" I remember watching bahubali 2' s final sequence and couldn't stop sighing throughout the whole sequence even though I wasn't a movie geek but it was just bad but alright, the movie wasn't about the action but while watching RRR, I must say that I was sighing almost throughout the action sequences because they were just terrible! Emphasis on terrible\nyou can ignore logic in action movies but man this movie is unbearablly bad, the action sequences were straight out of a 2000s rajnikanth movie\nI can't believe this trash is collecting so much money all over the world.It's kind of sinking the image of the quality of indian cinema possess!Over the past three-four years, we've got a lot of masterpieces from Bollywood, tollywood anf mollywood but RRR is the proof that we as a audience Haven't really changed our tastes in movies.I hate how people are defending this movie against the constructive criticism it has been receiving. Many say to ignore logic completely but why the exception just because the movie has been made by a particular director?A movie is a movie afterall, we should start judging a movie on the basis of how good it is and not on the basis of cast, directors etc.It was a disappointing experience and frustrating too.",

The movie has very well-choreographed action sequences but lacks the required strong storyline. Director S. S. Rajamouli successfully delivered the mass entertainer once again. He beautifully intertwines two elements of matter 'fire and water' in the form of Rama and Bheem.Writer K. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the man behind Baahubali, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and Manikarnika has given an ordinary story this time. The co-writer S. S. Rajamouli couldn't manage to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one. But he knows how to engage its audience and he has done his job. The introduction scenes for both the lead actors, intermission point, and climax were whistle-worthy.Jr NTR delivers a brilliant and emotional performance. Ram Charan gave an excellent performance, his character has many variations which he showcases impressively. They both look terrific in the action scenes. Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn are making their debut in Telugu films. While Ajay Devgn got a well-written cameo but Alia's character could've been done with better writing. Alia Bhatt and Shriya Saran have nothing to offer here. Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody are effective as the antagonists. Olivia Morris, Edward Sonnenblick, and all other supporting casts play their parts well.The first half of RRR is a package of emotion, humour, and action. Jr NTR and Ram Charan's dancing and the choreography in 'Naacho Naacho' song deserve applause. NTR manages to bring a few laughs when he tries to befriend Olivia Morris. The screenplay in the second half is a bit slow, some scenes seem unnecessary and they were added just to increase the runtime. There was a large room for editing in the film. VFX and the cinematography were top-notch. The music and the background score were enthralling.RRR Movie Rating:\nDirection 3.5/5\nActing 3.5/5\nAction 4.5/5\nStory 3/5\nScreenplay 3/5Do not wait for its OTT release, this movie is meant for big screens and it should be watched in cinemas.",

It feels like the audience is living in the British Raj era. But, the slow story and clich\u00e9 actions ruin it.So, RRR is watchable and fun too. But lot of hero worship, over-the-top actions, and lame dance steps (especially the climax song Ettera Jenda in Telugu & Sholay in Hindi), is cringe and childish.

In India, the film would easily be an 8 or 9. Indian critics will love it. I enjoyed the film from beginning to end, and tried to attribute the obvious flaws in the film to Indian nationalism. However, most people outside of India really do not understand the history of Indian nationalism (see Gandhi, the film). Yes, the British were immoral, exploitive, and cruel colonialists; however, no picture of the English colonial period is simply black and white. Every pancake has two sides.Gandhi used passive resistance to overcome the British. In this film, the protagonists use various levels of brute force and physical rebellion. The film is obviously over the top and a satire to those in the West, but many in India would not see it as over the top or a satire. To each his own. The cinematography of RRR is spectacular; probably the front runner for the Oscar in that category. And the screenplay is devilishly clever. Thankfully, there is little Bollywood action (as in musical numbers that accompany most ambitious Indian films). Good Indian films (like The Life of Pi and Three Idiots) do not use Bollywood numbers as a crutch to gain Indian audiences; they use good writing and direction, instead. This film is in that tradition, with good writing and direction, in addition to the spectacular cinematography. Enjoy the action sequences and character development plot. Once again, I would give this film an 8 or 9, if it were for Indian distribution alone. But the film is too good to limit to India. The story of an apparent British lackey versus a traditional Indian rebel is strong enough to hold up the film, even without the political overtones.",

            "content": "Like almost every Rajamouli's movie there is almost one high octane part that is very hard to criticize. He generally does this pretty strategically, either before the 1st half or immeiditely after the 2nd half. In this movie it is the flogging of Jr. NTR and the subtle relecutance by Ram, add to that the excellent back ground score, lyrics and the defiance shown by Jr. NTR (which was a lot more natural)..Also the glommy lighting to reflect the dark moment and Bheema's defiance, i was hooked for those 10 minutes.Take that scene out, the movie is underwhelming. I sincerly thought they were going to show some events from the lives of original historical figures, and how they sabotaged the colonial powers, and felt they could have taken some liberties with the timelines and come up with at cohesive story there are plenty of movies that did that. You need juvenlie mindset to think, that a lack of actual historical context can be compensated by quickly putting together an equally juvenile and corny (poster presentation of Indian freedom fighters) end credit scenes. A quick wikipedia search indiciates a blaring inaccuracy of history, i do not wish to argue with anyone who thinks otherwise,I think it is a project to elevate Jr. NTR and Ram Charan, nothing more.At the end of Shawshank Redemption you have a huge sense of gratification when the antagonist shoots himself. In RRR both the antagonists were huge let downs, especially the female actress who i think they no doubt fished out of some reject bucket. Their maliciousness was comical at best, their presence and their dialogues is a cause for rib tickling laughter. We get it, we get it ....the Colnel thinks the logistics of shipping a bullet is far more valuable than the life of an Indian, you have to have more reasons for the audience to despise the antagnoist.Until now The Dark Knight is the only movie i have seen where the intensity in a 15 minutes block never drops below 8/10, it always kept you on the edge of the seat. Unfortunately like every Rajamouli movie it has fluff for most part,assumiing his movies typicallly run between 150 to 180 minutes divided into blocks of 15/18 minutes there is just 1 block is like 10/10 then 2 blocks at best are 6/10 the remaining 7 fall between 1-5, Think about the RRR movie dispassionately there are may be 1 block (i mentioned above that was a 10), Ram introduction was not very unique Jr. NTR's intro was a litte bit unique but still over the top...the rest of the blocks were not something you have not seen before. The pre-intermission scene and the final fight were comical at best So there is nothing new Mr. Rajamouli have shown me to be stir my enthusiam.I was very young when i watched Rang De Basanti, that is a best example of how to represent history. After these years the analyzing a litte bit critically the characters at the end may have engaged in juvenile vigilatsim. However the actions they took at the end was not a huge leap in the story, you felt after playing the charecters they were subconciously inspiried and evolved over the movie time. It was not too over the top to think what they did at the end. RRR is meant to be a revolutionary movie, but i feel other than some mindless cheap thrill entertainment (cough Avengers) i do not think it will be lodged into people's heart for a long time, other than some misguided pride for Telugu Cinema.Some western commentators are saying thiat Hollywood misses RRR sort of film similar to the 80's however after evolving as a cinema goer, i now cannot watch 10 Commandments, Brave Heart, even Gladiator. They have to show heroism in a different way.As a Telugu person i was heartened to see the industry adopting a multistarer movies. Still they have a long way but is a good start. Bringing Ram Charan and Jr. NTR could have been considred a impossible task a decade ago that probably has to do with the trust they put in Mr. Rajamouli to capture Telugu audience, Kudos for 10 minute block post interval and the bringing the stars togeher are the only saving graces for this movie.Forgive my gramatical and spelling mistakes :).",

Ajay devgan plot is the only thing that belongs to what RRR actually is. British characters screen presence is good.Negatives: Poor story. Due to this, hardwork of the heroes and the emotions in scenes doesn't leave any impact. Music doesn't get into the head(naatu naatu is the first and last song/music that stays in mind when we remember about RRR which again is just for hype and not related to movie), biggest drawback is bgm. Scenes are not interesting and 3hr+ :0 (earliest show fans also got exhausted.) Poor vfx in some scenes and fights. Every few minutes heroes get their bones cracked and these are long long scenes of getting beaten for same old reason. Alia, Olivia and Shreya are for guest appearance. British characters had 30-40% of lines in the filmHeroes excelled , Director destroyed it.Movie is only for Hero's fans yet will have hard time about wether their hero got elevated or the other in each scene.As a neutral audience Ramcharan got good role/dialogues and the character itself is an elevation.Its mentioned as Fiction, else there is lot of flaws in the characters and is against the real freedom fighters ideology and life.Heroes get healed pretty soon and many more unnatural stuff . Some scenes are illogical which is common in all SSR movies but there is no magic in this movie to cover up.",

Rama Rao Jr.)Two real revolutionary fighters of 1920's India, Bheem and Raju (Ram Charan Teja), fictionally bond in friendship and battle against British colonialism. It's a long journey, over 3 hours, yet about as exciting and romantic as you could hope for in this time when Oscar contenders have strutted their stuff, and we are left with the B team.Well, not quite B in this case because RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt in the original title) has already won the Critics Choice Award for best foreign language film, and I predict it will be a nominee for Oscar as will its catchy dance tune, Naatu Naatu.For devotees of David Lean and Quentin Tarantino, to name just a few probable influences, Tollywood productions (RRR should be called \"Tollywood\" because of the Telugu different from the usual Bollywood Hindi), this epic flight is full of romance, deceit, exotic fighting (enjoy the surprise jungle-beast package for the Brits), and espionage involving the Empire and India. A more prosaic hunt for an abducted young Indian girl frames the story.The singing and dancing, common to these lavish productions, are accompanied by uncommonly charismatic actors who make the fantasy almost real with their charming performances. Part of RRR was filmed in the Ukraine, adding heft to the pride of country and anti-colonialism themes. Although the fighting is Crouching-Tiger good, the search for love, brotherhood, and family is most definitely acceptable in a melodramatic milieu.RRR is the best of international filmmaking and a feast of cinematic excellence all in the fastest 3 hours you'll ever see.\"He said that an Indian's Life is not worth a bullet.

Why Ram and Akhtar didn't dive into the river to save that child? Why did they have to go to such length when one of them could've rescued that kid (not drenched) by swimming? Though they did swim after saving the kid (soaking wet).2. After breaking into the royal palace and got caught by Ram, what happened to all those wild animals? I don't think it's wise to leave those wild animals unattended in a crowded area.3. Akhtar and Jenny couldn't communicate with eachother because of the language barrier, however before breaking Ram out of the solitary prison, Jenny explains Bheem about the layouts. How could he explain the situation to her and how can she understands and helps him with the same language barrier?4. Ram's makeover - yes, he was treated by Bheem after the prison break but how could he be wearing saffron 'dhoti'. Treating him is one thing but new clothes? How?5. Ajay Devgan' vision was to chase Britishers back to their country, however all the Ram and Bheem could do is destroy a mere building. Plot and climax doesn't align.Do watch at your own risk!",

The first part had more pizzazz for us, including a motorcycle and horse scene the ignites a fiery bromance. Helluva meet cute for brutes. And it's not just a bromance, it's a foe-mance too...or is it?The second half drags a little but does involve a massive fight scene, where the powers of stuntmen and cgi workers combine to deliver blow after blow. My kid is about to exit his teenage years, for younger viewers, I'd give pause on some of the gory glorification.For what it's worth, my colonial complexion comes with thick enough skin to not get hung up on the very very bad white folks. Aren't non-fiction \"news shows\" here in the US are far more troubling? I wonder if those shows and this movie share some funding from the NRA.That said, there is one scene involving a suicide bombing of sorts, and it definitely had me sneak a sideways glance at my son.

The two actors' performances was an equally integral part of the film. The emotion they poured into their roles were very inspiring to the rest of the global movie industry. The music and score were impressive as well. India was made a more interesting country because of this movie.",

Don't come into it with any expectations or preparation, I until this point had never seen an indian film and though I knew they were largely musical based, I had heard that this might be different. The characters were confusing, the special effects unbelievable, and the plot both ridiculous and entertaining. I loved the portrayal of the English as the villains, which of course was period accurate, and several scenes of racial tension that were immediately diffused by a dance number left a very entertaining and comedic watch.Don't take it too seriously.",

It also has amazing cinematography and a terrific soundtrack. The action scenes are so amazing and badass. The movie is paced so well, that I forgot it was even 3 hours!This is just a truly entertaining movie! I wish Hollywood movies were something even remotely as enjoyable as RRR! One of the main characters throws a tiger onto someone else and beats up people with a motorcycle! You would never see that in a western movie!",

            "content": "I've heard a lot of people say that this is a great movie, just with overexaggerated scenes. Indeed, there is a lot of hyperbole, but it doesn't help the film's case in my eyes.The movie gets credit for the amazing CGI; you can tell what scenes are 3D, especially with the animals, but it's a level of 3D quality unique in Indian movies. It also has amazing songs, although they often feel forced in the context of the movie. And there's the moving scenes of Malli's enslavement, which are a visual portrayal of just how twisted slavery is.But that's about it for the good points. It's really not as good of a movie as they say.The overdone scenes, like with blood dripping into Raju's eye, or the one where he manages to punch gaping holes into a wall, just felt so ridiculous. Hyperbole is not uncommon for Indian fight scenes, and fight scenes are not uncommon for Indian movies. But this movie takes the amount of violence to another level.And the entire story operates on conveniences. There were far too many contrivances to count, like Raju and Bheem's friendship suddenly just happening and substituting real character development with a song, the language barrier between Bheem and Jenny conveniently disappearing after the dance. Alia Bhatt is just there, and I didn't know why she was there until the scene where she says \"vande mataram,\" but that was the only scene where it made sense. The flat overacting, especially for the British characters, doesn't make up for any of this.And those are only minor grievances! The worst offense was how Raju was magically inspired by Bheem's singing while he was being flogged, and for the rest of the movie he just went \"okay, no more guns! Oh, but we can still fight and break people's bones and do murder. Nonviolence? What's that?\"The plot swings from contrivance to contrivance, and the messaging of \"eye-for-an-eye\" is appalling; isn't this the country of Mahatma Gandhi, who helped achieve India's independence through nonviolence?! In a section of the movie, there are scenes where a child is encouraged to use a gun! To kill!!! And it's practically glorified!!!!! The British characters were given lines with quite a lot of disgusting imagery, but nobody in this movie is not guilty of bloodthirst.I was also bothered by the severe representation issues. One of them was the extremely superficial characterizations of people solely based on their race/nationality (i.e. All the white people are cruel, all the Indians are perfect); although I'll let that slide because that makes sense for the premise of the movie. What's really shocking, though, is that even though Akhtar (Bheem's cover identity) was supposed to be Muslim, he participates in several Hindu rituals, even recalling \"Ram and Sita\" but never mentioning a single thing about Islam. The only characteristics of his Muslim act are that he has a cap and carries meat in one scene; it's so blatantly stereotypical.I'm very confident that the only reason this movie was so popular was due to the nationalistic appeal, same with The Kashmir Files (which was written by a director who had only directed flops up to that point, and which also has a nationalistic agenda) and Kantara (which depicts Lord Shiv condoning violence, what!!!). There's nothing wrong with national pride; but this movie is so flat, with such a flimsy plot, no nuance, and questionable themes, that it can hardly be justified.",

RRR is a visual marvel packed with some of the best use CGI effects in Indian Cinema especially during the battle scene with all the animals and the final battle between our two leads and the British Soldiers. Third, The performances. Jr. NTR and Ram Charan delivers some of the most incredible performances as Bheem and Raju respectively. And finally, the story. Even though it's another movie about freedom fighters struggling to put an end to the British Raj, the story in RRR feels so fresh and engaging that you can't help but get hooked up with it immediately. OOO and the Dance sequences and musical numbers. Well.......both Bollywood and Hollywood are comparatively nothing. Holy Cow!!!The Naccho Naccho sequence took my breath away and ever since I can't stop watching the whole scene again and again. Also the songs in this work extremely well with the story and are very meaningful unlike most of the Bollywood movies where the musical numbers don't contribute anything to the storyline.I'm soooooo proud of this movie and so happy and delighted to see it capturing the heart's of audiences across the globe and becoming the most watched Indian film on Netflix and one of the most successful Indian movies ever at the box office. RRR is a pure definition of brilliance in filmmaking. You just cannot miss this Masterpiece!!! 9.6/10As for RRR's Oscar chances.

            "content": "When British governor Scott Buxton kidnaps a young girl from her tribe, the guardian of the tribe, Komaran Bheem vows to rescue the girl from her captives. Bheem enters the British Raj, the colonization of an Indian subcontinent by the British to get in Buxton's stronghold and rescue the girl. Aware of Bheem's presence, Buxton offers a special reward for the officer who brings him in. A. Ram Raju, an Indian officer with a lot of strength and talent, volunteers for the job and is instructed to bring him in alive. In a turn of events, they meet each other and not knowing each other's true identities, they end up becoming best friends after rescuing a child from a falling train on fire.The best way to describe this movie is that RRR is an action movie epic. This movie is one of the most glorious pieces of entertainment I have seen in years despite its three-hour runtime. There is not a single minute in this movie that is boring. There is always something crazy happening in the story whether it is a crazy action scene, a fun moment in the bromance, a comedic scene, a dramatic scene or even a lively musical number. RRR is a complete package.First of all, I adore the two protagonists, Bheem and Raju. Both of them are awesome in their characterization and in skills. Bheem is a kindhearted man who wants to rescue Malli and take down the evil British Empire. Despite this, he never targets anyone innocent. He does a great job disguising himself and he overall incredibly likable and endearing, especially with his interactions with Jenny. Raju on the other hand is one of my favorite characters in a movie this year. He fights a whole mob with his a blunt weapon, he encourages his friend in a dance off, he has the best arc in the movie and he has an interesting backstory. Raju is a fantastic character to the point where I actively rooted for his survival throughout the film. The bromance between Bheem and Raju is wonderful as well. They are so wholesome together, you forget that they have opposite goals while you see them hang out. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan share some of the best chemistry I have seen in years. They act like best friends throughout the movie. The two leads make this movie a delight to watch.As for the rest of the characters, the British villains are quite despicable with Buxton and his wife being some of the most despicable people of the year. They are complex villains, but you want to see them go down in flames. Jenny is an interesting character. I thought she would be a twist villain who is only there to give the British Empire a good public face. Turns out, she is not really bad, just with bad people. I'm glad she ended up not being a villain, but I kind of wish she would have been a bigger character by the end. That is probably my only complaint in the entire film.The script is fantastic as well. The story engaged me from beginning to end between Raju's past, the friendship between Pheem and Raju, the conflict when they reveal themselves to each other and the adventure of the film. A great action movie has a great story and this movie is proof of that. It takes full advantage of its runtime to develop these characters and flesh out the themes and world of the movie. The tone is a perfect balance between lighthearted cheesiness and touching dark moments. When the movie gets cheesy, it is the fun cheese as this movie is hilarious with its humor and sequences. However, it pulls of its emotional moments well, including a torture scene that reminded me of Braveheart in some ways. The script packs a lot in one movie, but it delivers big time.The spectacle in this movie is out of this world. It puts many American blockbuster films to shame. This movie has at least three of my favorite set pieces of the year. The first infiltration of the stronghold, the rescue of the child at the train wreck and the insane climactic battle are all standout set pieces. Each one of them are not only a joy to watch, but they are creative in the way the stunts are performed and how the bad guys are taken out. The fights also show how Bheem represents water and how Raju represents fire, especially the one-on-one fight between the two. There is not a single action scene in this movie that is boring to watch. It is all so much fun. The sets and costumes are gorgeous as well. The cinematography is stunning as there are several jaw dropping shots and a couple solid takes. The only minor bad thing about the visuals are that some of CGI on the animals are not that great, but only when there is so much going on. The animals still look believable. I didn't question it at all except for maybe one or two scenes. The visuals in this movie are spectacular.Also, this movie has an awesome soundtrack. The musical score and main theme are great and fun to listen too, but this movie has some surprisingly robust musical numbers. The dance choreography is on point and so much fun to watch. It seems like every single person had a blast with this film.RRR is about as close to perfect as an action movie can get. This action epic proves that a good movie is never too long. Despite being three hours long, I did not once check my phone to see what time it was. This movie makes me want to watch more Bollywood films. I feel like I am missing out. This movie brought me so much joy that I almost want to watch again right after the first time. This movie is smart, creative, funny, heartwarming and bonkers in the best possible way. My only regret is that I did not see this movie when it was first released in theaters. For now, I will seek this film out on Blu-Ray as soon as I can.",

Rohit Shetty is a good examples of using over the top fight scenes and making it entertaining and also using the same slo-mo but he does it better in this movies than what they did in RRR. The fight scenes were so dull, I'd pick Rohits any day over this. Kinda disappointed in Rajmouli, since I loved action scenes in Baahubali.I wish the movie was a love story of ram and shyam, it would have made for a great twist than a regular cringey bromance angle. It's a bit too cringey and corny, unbelievable too. Some scenes were really good also but overall, the lack of sharper writing let's down the film.It's a decent watch if you're bored and have nothing else to watch.

            "content": "I was not a big fan. Maybe bcz I haven't seen bahubali yet. I know I know, what you feel, but truth is truth.I have seen Eega starring Sudeep, one of rajamouli's creative kick. It was really nice.And extremely new to our niche.I had no interest to watch RRR. Why? The title of this movie never sounded good for me. I thought it would be one of the visually treating yet unsatisfying story. I felt so. It elevated after seeing the trailer. Unrealistic action, weird British set, weird contrast play of British and Indians looking somewhat funny at dancing scene glimpses I saw, and strange friendship thing in middle of all these. I decided it's going to be a blunder. And even after rrr did 1000 crore, my mind was \"it's boring for sure. Just a mass movie, hyped by Rajamouli's status\".Well I saw the movie, wait till I disclose.I loved it.The starting scenes, the entry scenes till the first meet of ram and bheem seemed too unrealistic, mass audience blunder. But then I dont even understand how it caught my attention. I tried my best to avoid it. It caught. I had heard that rajamouli can keep PPL emotionally connected till the end of his movies. I said naaah, it's only for emotional geeks, not for non-emotionally connecting guy like me.But well the characters, the story line, the witty dialogues though familiar yet convincing bcz of the innocence of character's emotions that are portrayed. It was nice experience. It was nice to see me lost in its story line. The story is at its best. It is what that held me on my seat. Or else I would have got up very very soon. I don't cherish any action, over the top scenes. Useless.The story is extremely rooted, metaphoric, relatable. It takes very less time to make the characters your friends or villains, subconsciously it happens. And that is what rajamouli can do and plays with. The story never went predictable, no. The story line, its progress, plot are really fresh. There are reasons why a character does something. It holds for every action by every single character. Characters who are villains turn heroes. Building emotion is a great challenge and in middle of it, changing it quite often with the aspect of \"perspective issue\" is even harder, and for a 3 hr movie it's a lot. Many fail to build emotion for a single character even after the end card of the movie. But this movie does it best.Maybe there's some logic issue to some action scenes but not to the story line. No logic issues to the characters, their thinking process, aim, behaviour.Very artistic piece, even after being a commercial one.Why? Has extensive amount of good artistic shots, screenplay, beautiful story telling maintaining the suspense/holding breath moments. And mainlu: metaphors. The entanglement with Mahabharat and Ramayana is universal throughout. And the metaphor of water and fire. I thought it was just another useless metaphor by him to add to all these to make it different from just mahabharat-ramayan metaphors. But no. It was shown once, not twice, neither thrice, it was rather justified. I thought he would leave that water-fire thing in middle. It fascinated me how it is taken in every aspect, action and every scene in the movie. It is shown even in many unexpected situations where it blew my mind over holding on to something like this which PPL consider insignificant. Very well justified metaphorization. And yea, bheem is from suryavamsha but has water characters, ram is from Chandravamsha but has fire characters. Very nice contrast.Only thing concerning me: why so much straight forward violence, why not artistic violence or symbolic one?The answer was, that was one of the main supporting reasons for emotions to build up on the characters. Bcz we are seeing exactly what character is experiencing in second person view/ as if we saw it happening in reality in front. That is what makes rajamouli achieve extra emotion goodness, which is not possible/ not strong enough in case of symbolic violence portrayal.",

Put the sub-titles on to appreciate the songs even more since the words directly tie into the emotions of the moments on screen.The two main protagonists even though so difference in character and motivation...the one for revenge ...the other for love are so well matched when put together.You feel the pain so badly when \"betrayals\" occur...but are again elated when these two join up again...the unstoppable force and the immovable object acting as one.The final escape scene from the jail had us rolling on the floor with laughter.Some great special effects are also on show here.... I shudder to think what this production must have cost...I hope they made their investment back 10 fold.Give this show a miss if you are unable to suspend disbelief for 3 hours of great fun...or if you are averse to Alpha male toxicity. Only Knights in shining armour here. Great action and bro-mance for the males....lots of eye candy for the females.",

            "content": "Movie Review Time!By: Mason Klesel\nFilm: RRR (Rise Roar Revolt) 2022\nDirected By: S. S. Rajamouli\nWritten By: Vijayendra Prasad, Sai Madhav Burra, Madhan Karky, and Riya Mukerjee\nStarring: N. T. Rama Rao Jr. Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, et al...\nRating: 8.75 out of 10Truth be told, I personally have never watched an Indian film. Surprising I know. My film repertoire consists of American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean styles. Having said that, the 2022 movie RRR directed by S. S Rajamouli is my first foray into Indian cinema. I am familiar with the term Bollywood. But, that is about it. However, I was surprised to learn during my research of this project that RRR is considered to be a Tollywood piece. This is very important to note when talking about this film because there are massive language differences. Tollywood is primarily South Indian. Meaning that the languages are primarily Telugu, Tamilm Kannada, and Malayalam. Bollywood however uses Hindi, Punjabi, Haryanvi, and Bihari.We are not here to speak on the language differences or compare and contrast Tollywood and Bollywood. Let's speak on the film RRR. It is considered a fictional period piece set sometime during the 1920's when Britain was occupying India. The main premise is when a young village child is kidnapped away from her friends, family, and loved ones by the antagonist Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine. One of our main protagonists Komaram Bheem is the village protector and is tasked with not only finding the young girl Malli but bringing her back home safely. At the same time, our other protagonist Rama Raju is a deep cover British officer who joined and infiltrated their ranks from his village to find a way to acquire weapons and disperse them amongst revolutionaries to fight and rise up against the British threat. Through a freak accident both our main men risk life and limb to save a young boy from certain death and become best friends. However, little did they know that they were both on a fast track to collide with one another as their missions inadvertently clash. However, through different trials and tribulations, they are able to work together and accomplish both of their goals.Overall, the premise, plot, and pacing of this film is spaced out very well. It follows a fairly linear path and flows seamlessly. One thing of note is that roughly the first hour is cut into chapters much like a Quentin Taratino film. The way that this was presented was a stroke of genius and helped elevate the movie in regards to its story telling. Even though RRR boasts a three hour run time, it did not feel like it. The movie was able to transport me into their reality and allow me to leave my suspension of disbelief at the door. This is kind of what you have to do while watching this spectacle. Not to say that is a negative. It's just there are pretty absurd moments that happen in terms of story beats, action sequences, and choreography moments. For instance you have a the time where Rama Raju single handily quells a literal hoard of people and you also have the time where Bheem single handily takes down a feral tiger with his bare hands. Or how about the moment towards the climax of the movie where Bheem wields a freaking motorcycle with ONE HAND and uses it as a weapon!To say that RRR is an action packed smorgasbord is an understatement. The action and choreography sequences deviate away from traditional American cinema ideals and offer unique, entertaining, and stunning moments that you cannot help but to marvel at. There were multiple moments where I was shouting with glee and clapping with excitement. Sure there are minor strokes of borrowed elements from other film makers like John Wu. However, mostly everything else done offers a fresh take. To further heighten these bombastic sequences we have the soundtrack developed by M. M Keeravani. Whose original musical numbers truly were delights on the ears. Speaking of musical numbers, there were quite a few actual musical set pieces where characters sang and danced. While only one really detracted from the overall plot the others made sense and fit well within the universe.Others aspects of RRR that excelled were the visual effects, production quality, and the acting performances. Our two main characters gave very powerful and convincing performances. I found myself sympathizing with them on a deep personal level. Even the side characters did well. The only issues I had was the somewhat cartoony nature of the British opposition. I know that they are the antagonists and we are supposed to hate them. It is just their dialogue and movements were overdramatized and not believable. At the same time however, it wasn't so distracting that it can be construed as a serious negative mark against the movie. Through and through RRR felt like a cinematic epic and was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. There are few negative criticisms I can dish out. Overall, I highly recommend RRR if you like over the top action and drama. 100% is a must watch in my book. My rating? 8.75 out of 10!",

But rather this was more of a cartoonish depiction of a serious plot with forced heroism.For ex. One person single handedly taking down an entire enemy range is highly unrealistic in theory itself. But in the movie, it is presented in unbelievably unrealistic way. Like always, gravity was missing and even basic logic was out of the picture. What we see on the screen is two guys, like in god mode, crunching down enemies one after another like its a peace of cake. They can lift 200kg motorbike like nothing, jump 100mts, carry another person on the back and do backflips, front flips and insane acrobatic movements like the gravity and weight doesn't affect them at all. Enemies lack aim and commonsense. Apart from the main characters, everybody in the movie is dumb.Few things worth mentioning is the above average animation of animals shown in a fight scene and few other CGI elements which kind of worked good. The song Naattu was also interesting.Highly overrated.",

            "content": "Have u ever watched a movie that gave you the impression the director was trying to make the greatest movie of all time? S. S. Rajamouli didn't exactly succeed with that, and that's okay. His intention was possibly not as lofty but no less ambitious. He may have sought to simply make the most delightfully over-the-top movie you've seen.A girl is kidnapped from her village by a plastic-faced British devil woman. How she managed to get work done in the pre-botox era is anyone's guess. Then we cut to the scene of a small police compound being surrounded by thousands of CGI locals. It's a scenario on par with Zulu (1964) but on the scale of World War Z (2013). Whatever the case, it's a high-anxZiety situation where we meet one half of our hero team. Raju stands guard with precision poise in a sea of chaos. But when the hostile sh** hits the fan, his stoic default setting is disabled and he goes into crowd control mode. What follows is a THWACK-BASH-POW demonstration that he is a one man wrecking ball. But of course he is passed over for promotion for not being white enough. When he takes out his frustration on a punching bag, it looks like he's auditioning for the latest DLC character to join the Street Fighter selection screen. Move over Dhalsim! While Raju likely fulfills every Chuck Norris myth ever created, he is not the only mighty manimal in this country.We are introduced to Bheem as he is playing a game of crouching body hair, smacking tiger deep in the jungle. Bheem is fierce, but he has more of a cuddly Teddy-bare-chest vibe. This will be juxtaposed nicely with Raju's suave presence and tucked in shirt.These two cross paths when they pull off a coordinated acrobatic rescue using nothing but hand gestures and enthusiasm. It creates a bond that the soundtrack insists is historical. Whether these two will become the Lennon & McCartney of ass kicking, we don't know just yet. But it's quite possibly the cutest match-up in the subcontinent. Watch and giggle as Raju helps Bheem win over the apple of his eye by pulling a Mariokart tactic. Let's just say he nails it. Then it's a Bollywood dance off that will make you sweat just watching it. We haven't even hit the halfway mark yet.A cast of thousands, gravity-defying stunts and a CGI tiger. No, it's not Army of Dead. This is RRR. It's essentially a martial arts spectacle heavy on the inspirational grand-standing while simultaneously making you laugh. Whether the heart-tugging moments are sincere and cheesy or satirical and hilarious is not clear. But when Bheem lays siege to the villain's palace by delivering the zoo, you've likely already accepted that the theatrics and melodrama are part of the package. That's to say nothing of Raju doing pull-ups in a 4x3 sweatbox utilizing nothing but a sewer grate and national pride. Hell, there's even a bit of parkour stealth during a rescue mission.My only previous Indian epic viewing was Saaho (2019) and that 3 hour macho turd doesn't hold a candle to RRR. If you can stomach the running time and the sappy dramatics, you will be rewarded with a feast of action and maybe even a few tears.",

S. Rajamouli colourful three hour epic (which would probably be cut down to around 2 hours if you got rid of the slow-motion) has found so many fans across the globe.Working as both a soap opera drama, a rip roaring action flick that features some of the most memorable action scenes of any feature film over the past decade and importantly an enjoyable bromance adventure between N. T. Rama Rao Jr.'s determined villager Komaram Bheem and Ram Charan Teja's one man army officer Alluri Sitarama Raju, RRR is many things but at its core it's an effortlessly fun experience that should never be and was likely never looking to be taken seriously as Rajamouli goes all out in making sure his epic is a sensory experience in more ways than one.Filled with a rip-roaring soundtrack from M. M. Keeravani (try not to tap along), some memorable staging from cinematographer KK Senthil Kumar and the aforementioned action scenes directed by the brilliantly named King Solomon, RRR puts most big budget Hollywood affairs to shame with its unbridled enthusiasm and energy and even when the film gets bogged down in some less enjoyable moments that revolves mainly around Bheem's relationship with Olivia Morris's British Jennifer or some questionably crafted script work, RRR is never far away from another sequence that is likely to put a big smile on the viewer.Featuring a fully committed cast that is expertly lead by Rao Jr. And Teja, there's a good chance RRR isn't going to be suited to everyone's viewing preferences but if you jump on board for the wild ride, this is the perfect launch pad into the Bollywood scene with a film that is going to see Hollywood try and replicate its magic ingredients over the years to come.Final Say -Loud, brash, inventive and wildly fun, RRR is a fever dream of an epic that is hard to compare to anything else but should you be in the mood for something unashamedly fanciful and spectacle driven, RRR can't be beat.4 endlessly supplied quivers out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

            "content": "Rise Roar Revolt (RRR) may not be at par with Baahubali, as far as storytelling is concerned, but one can't deny that it is a visual spectacle that has set a new benchmark in Indian cinema. The first thing that I had noticed during the teasers of the film were the beautiful visuals, the camera was capturing everything to the minutest detail and the special effects were way better than what I had seen in any other Indian film. When you see the film, you realize that the filmmaker has not compromised anywhere as far as visuals are concerned, every single frame looks absolutely stunning. RRR engages you right from the beginning with a melodious as well as an unusual musical interlude, and by the time the title of the film appears on screen, you realize that it's been 40 minutes already! The way RRR unfolds, introducing the central plot and its main leads is very unique and creative. The introduction scene of Ram Charan was very good, but Jr. NTR's introduction gave me goosebumps, it was a breathtaking sequence. The background score during the chase sequence in Jr. NTR's introduction had my pulses racing, it was absolutely amazing. The tiger and the wolf shown in that scene looked very real, it's mind-boggling to see where we have reached as far as VFX is concerned. Baahubali was criticized for having poor VFX, especially towards the end, but you can't do that here.The appearance of the title card with that amazing background score, is the kind of moment where people often start clapping and shouting. Sung by Blaaze, that song increases your excitement level and fills your heart with happiness. It makes you realize that the director and writer have really put in a lot of effort to make this film an experience to remember. An extremely engaging and entertaining storyline, brilliant acting by Ram Charan and Jr. NTR, outstanding music by M. M. Keeravani, stunning visuals and VFX; one would assume that the director has possibly thrown everything towards the viewers from his box of wonders, but that wasn't true, Rajamouli had kept something hidden from everyone. The spectacular action sequence right before the interval left me awestruck and lit up my eyes, because I had never seen something like this before in my life in a movie. Indian cinema took a giant leap in that sequence, announcing to the world that we too have the vision and imagination to create something that would drop your jaws to the floor. That action sequence culminated an extremely strong first half, and it goes without saying that very few Indian films could boast of putting up a show like that.The second half of RRR is not as compelling as the first half, this is where the screenplay loses steam and the movie falls short of being called a masterpiece. Of course there are plenty of moments that have brilliance written all over them. The acting remains top quality, from Ram Charan as well as Jr. NTR, Jr. NTR is quite exceptional during his whipping sequence with the brilliant Komuram Bheemudo song playing in the background, the flashback sequence involving Ajay Devgan and Shriya Saran is quite impactful, their cameos are of short duration but both Ajay and Shriya have acted very well, the song 'Janani' hits you emotionally. The cameo of Alia Bhatt however, puts forth a question as to why was she selected for the role. Alia Bhatt made no impact at all in that five minute role. Perhaps the director should have expanded that role and given it to some other actress, like Tamannaah, the lead actress of his previous film. The action sequence where Ram and Bheem escape from the prison is very well choreographed and is quite entertaining to watch, even though it's quite difficult to believe that such an escape is even possible. The climax is where the film falters, the believability factor goes for a toss and you are left wondering as to how this is happening? Ram was severely injured after escaping from prison, he hadn't eaten for days, he was lying down in a semi-conscious state because of tiredness, and then all of a sudden he was shown fighting with full energy in a new wardrobe. Bullets were being fired from everywhere but not a single one touched him, how? How can you possibly compete with bullets flying from everywhere using a bow and an arrow? By the time you would load a new arrow, three bullets would have already pierced your heart!The finale of the movie feels weak, because the plot is not quite there and also the villains couldn't really make any kind of impact, they were given the bare minimum to do and they did that with the same expression on their face. One would expect the villains to be menacing and scary, the presence of whom would send a chill down your spine, but no such thing happened, the villains were like cardboard characters who could talk and walk. I don't know what made the casting team select such bad white actors for this film and why did the writer give the villains such a wafer thin storyline. The main storyline of the film was to find Malli and send her safely to her mother, and I was really happy when that happened, but the way just two individuals overpowered an entire police force, who were armed with all sorts of weapons, was a bit difficult to digest. I do realize that movies often portray heroes as superheroes, so one should keep that in mind while watching them, but some sort of plausibility has to be kept alive. Rajamouli has indicated that the character Ram turns into a magical figure that night, but that transition was not conveyed properly. Also, he did get hit by a bullet towards the end, so he wasn't exactly invincible, so how did he survive hundreds of bullets that got fired towards him from all directions that night?Despite the not so convincing climax and some plot holes, RRR remains a fantastic movie watching experience. Director S. S. Rajamouli and writer Vijayendra Prasad deserve to be praised for imagining something as epic as this. M. M. Keeravani needs to be mentioned because the outstanding music of this film has been composed by this genius musician. The movie has been created in a way that you just can't take your eyes off the screen, the screenplay is extremely engaging and fast paced, even the dance number 'Naatu Naatu' (choreographed by Prem Rakshith) has so much energy that you just don't want it to end. The visuals are so stunning, it makes you wonder as to why filmmakers travel abroad when our own India is so beautiful. RRR is not at the level of Baahubali, but S. S. Rajamouli has scaled new peaks with this film. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one hundred percent worthy of your time.",

            "content": "In all honesty this was my first movie coming from Indian territory, I went with an open mind and with some notions that Bollywood movies are usually over the top / ridiculously unrealistic action flicks and I was pleased at the end.I do want to stress out that you need to keep in mind that the plot is nothing too complex, on the contrary is a fairly straight forward story (although some twists surprised me), the way I can better classify it is an uplifting (taking aside the few violent scenes) adrenaline pumped action movie with outstanding soundtrack and some pretty cool fight scenes.I am not aware of the budget restrictions, it's fair to assume that it doesn't compare to the huge American productions, and in the CGI department that shows and I would say is the weakest point of the film, taking that aside is refreshing to see movies from around the world and grasp the cultural aspect that they depict.It's a fictional story about two real life Indian revolutionary figures and their fight against the oppressive British empire. It's a very long movie however it was somehow easy to consume, I didn't feel bored the scenes are well constructed and even though its a basic story you will find yourself entertained by it and waiting for the clich\u00c3\u00a9 moments, which was strangely pleasant.I don't know how much of the stunts the main actors actually do but regardless if it was them doing it or the stunt folks it's a sight to behold.All in all I am really glad to see all of this inclusion of foreign films during award season, its good that we are globalizing our exposure to different cultures and it's a good mechanism to become more aware of everyone's roots and it has the potential to bring us all closer together.",

The \"what kind of movie are we making?\" \"yes\" meme. This is a movie that has a bit of everything, from action, drama, a tiger fight, a man on shoulder shootout, music videos, romance. You won't leave this movie without feeling like you have just seen a movie with everything in it. It\u00c2\u00b4s been a while since I let my guard down and just had fun, this movie reminded me not everything has to be high art and tell a lifechanging story, sometimes movies are entertainment, and this movie is that pure entertainment. It reminds me of the golden age of action in Hollywood in the 80s, big men, big ideas, big scopes. While Hollywood no longer has the same punch when it comes to action magic in my opinion since it everything now has to be overly serious, this movie took it a step back and just had fun. Bollywood just has something about it and while I don't like everything it has to offer, it showed me the pure enjoyment you can have while watching movies.In a British colonialized India a little girl is bought from a village in a misunderstanding. Bheem sets out to find the girl again in the big city, meanwhile the military man Raju is set out to find and capture Bheem in order to become the highest rank in the military. The two people find each other and befriends each other, not knowing they are enemies. Their alliance is destined to be tested.Let\u00c2\u00b4s start out with a really strong aspect of the movie, it\u00c2\u00b4s incredible score and it\u00c2\u00b4s songs. I loved the songs in the movie and thought they fitted the themes. Even one song I really thought was out of place had an incredibly impactful conclusion that made it work. I know musicals are also a western phenomenon, but you have to get used to their being songs all the time here. But again so much energy and production is clearly brought into the songs and they are preformed amazingly. I totally get why Naatu Naatu is nominated that song is incredible and in the context of the movie even better. The score is also really well done and I loved motives like Raju\u00c2\u00b4s theme, it was so good and really made him sound intimidating. I also really liked the recontextualization of the friendship song between Bheem and Raju, it is reorchestrated many times doing the movie to give it new meanings and it worked so well.While a lot of things happens in this movie the story is rather simple. Bheem needs to find the little girl and Raju has to find out who his after which is Bheem. It\u00c2\u00b4s a well told simple story and as Rajus story is expanded upon during the movie, you start to see them both as well meaning people.But this movie is 3 hours long and really packs it\u00c2\u00b4s punches. First you have to sit through 2 minutes of logos btw, fair warning, but after that I goes wild. There are tiger fights, superhuman strength, insane stunts, an epic escape, gun fights, fist fights, horse and motorcycle stunts, insanely good singing and dancing choreography. There are genre aspects of romance, action, drama, musical, war. While it can sound like a lot, and it is, it feels like the movie's identity. It\u00c2\u00b4s supposed to be everything, and the balance works for the most part and keeps reinventing itself so it doesn't get stale or boring.The entire movie is carried by the two leads. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. As Bheem and Ram Charan as Raju. I think both did an outstanding performance and really managed to mix humor, bromance, action, seriousness, singing and dancing into all out performances. In the end I think Rama Rao Jr. Became my favorite, he also had to balance romance and managed both to pull of the cute and innocent acting while becoming this intimidating warrior when he had to. He also showed of his beautiful singing voice and his insane dance moves. Same could be said about Charan, he shows this amazing bromance side to him and I really believe the two leads friendship, Charans serious acting is so intimidating and he really brings that to the character. He also showed his insane dancing and singing skills. I loved the way that these two are seen as opposites that are supposed to learn from each other. They have the same vision but different approaches to it. Seeing them finally embrace each other is so epic and moving at the same time.The invadable fight is epic and the action in general is amazing. This is one of those hype movies where you cheer every time something happens. The movie earns this and I sat with a smile on my face whenever something incredible happened.The effects aren't good in this movie. The animals look terrible, and some action effects looked really bad. While they still impacted me as I was immersed in the movie, it was more the idea of what happened and not really the effect themselves that brought it to life.This is a really unserious movie that still had it\u00c2\u00b4s serious moments. The plot in Rajus village, and the underlying theme and thread of colonialism is scary and really brought out to the extreme in full display. This is a movie showing that India is free today and that the shadows of the past are still looming but feels defeated. These themes were well implemented and an easy way to created an impactful antagonist.With a movie with so much going on I have to take my hat of to the director. S. S. Rajamouli really balances everything so well and has created a movie that feels like it works even though it really shouldn't. There are so many images, scenes and elements that sticks out to me remembering back on the movie and making 3 hours fun from start to finish is an achievement on its own.I must admit that when the movie hit its second hour, I felt the length a bit. But then something happened that made me kickstart back up. This movie really has the ability to kickstart you whenever it\u00c2\u00b4s going down a bit.In general, this movie is not supposed to change your life or make deep cuts, it\u00c2\u00b4s supposed to make you laugh and cheer and that it does well. It captures the pure fun and entertainment you can have by watching a movie. It\u00c2\u00b4s been a while since I let a movie do that to me, but this one reawakened something pure in me that made me throw away the cynicism and just enjoy the ride.RRR is a blast from start to finish. It has a bit of everything and is one of the most epic things I\u00c2\u00b4ve seen in a while. Not only is it fun, it\u00c2\u00b4s also emotional and creates this pure form of entertainment that I have been missing for a while.Oscar predictions: So we can only judge this movie from the award it has been nominated for and that is the song \"Naatu Naatu\". First, I can\u00c2\u00b4t wait to see this song being performed at the Oscars. If they bring just half the energy, they brought for the movie it will be an amazing show. Sadly, I don't think this is going to win. When you have American stars like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Diana Warren and Mitski all on separate nominees I think the academy is going safe and not foreign. I haven't heard all the songs yet so maybe \"Naatu Naatu\" is the best but I don't know. The only one I have heard is the song from Black Panther and Everything Everywhere all at Once and I think personally that \"Naatu Naatu\" is better than bot, but I guess music is subjective.",

The drama, the action, the suspense, even the music numbers were perfect and intriguing. I honestly want a sequel to this, and soon.

It was fun, and the total lack of cynicism/sarcasm is a refreshing difference from Hollywood films. The aims and objectives of the characters are clear, and the story makes sense. It's overall well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, and most of all it is pretty fun.It's also an interesting take on the latter effects of India's colonisation by the british. This is a topic we in the west don't see too much of, and although RRR portrays it effectively, I almost felt as if it still was a bit under-done. The history of western colonialism is brutal, and that brutality has been largely overshadowed by the Nazis, Communists, and World War 2 in general. I would like to see more films explore the full impacts of it. RRR is a step in the right direction, at least.On the other hand, the end of RRR left me feeling a bit uneasy. It hero-worships a number of people, in a way that came across as strongly nationalist. It made the film feel as if it were commissioned by the government, rather than being a piece of art meant to stand on its own. I have no qualms about a people being proud of their history and heritage, particularly after a history of being colonised. At the same time, this display left me to wonder who or what was being left out. I don't know enough about the history of India and its peoples to be able to judge it effectively, but I was left uncomfortable by it.",

            "content": "I almost started this review by saying \"the most anticipated movie is finally..\" but then at this point of time almost every movie is because of what has happened in the last 2 odd years. I am both a big fan and also a big critic of SS Rajamouli's filmmaking. His grandeur is unmatchable but also at times there are some scenes in his movies which ruin the whole experience because of how unreal they are (for example tata sumo jump in Magadheera and human cannonball from Bahubali). With RRR Rajamouli probably creates a great balance between the emotional quotient and the extravaganza. RRR is one of its kind theatrical experience despite not such a great storyline.I really don't want to say anything about the plot, anyone who has seen a lot of movies can figure out the plot just from the trailer. It is clear that Rajamouli wants to establish the two great characters from the beginning and also wants to do it beautifully by bringing the elements \"Fire and Water\". He has done a very good job by not writing unnecessary characters for the sake of it. The movie is all about the two leading men and it does the justice. It goes without saying that the movie is technically brilliant, costume and set designs are pretty much on point and the camera work is exceptional.There are two great scenes in the movie involving each of the lead actors that make you gasp and when you walk out of the cinema hall you will be recalling those scenes frame by frame. There are also really over the top scenes, but you know what you signed up for when you are entering Rajamouli's fantasy world. To be honest, I wasn't really a fan of the song \"Naatu Naatu\" when it was released on YouTube, but Ram Charan-NTR's chemistry, the choreography and all the supporting dancers make it a mesmerizing watch. The other songs are also placed well in the movie and MM Keeravani does a commendable job with the background score especially when connecting the mythological elements to it.I personally feel that the movie is probably a bit too lengthy than it should have been. The narration is crisp in the first half, but in the second half it keeps running around in circles. There are some scenes which almost end like an episode of a TV series and it feels like the story would make a great mini-series. I also think that Rajamouli misses a great opportunity to add some mystery around Ram Charan's character which could have made for a great twist somewhere in the second half. The police station scene almost reminds you of the classic scene from 'Vikramarkudu' and the colour palette is similar as well. Ajay Devgn's character also could have had more build up to it, but I understand the compromise the director had to make for the running time. Ajay Devgn's perfect delivery of three simple English words makes an impactful watch.RRR is purely written around the two leading characters and both Jr NTR and RamCharan execute their roles to perfection. One can do nothing but applaud for all the efforts and commitment they have shown in the characters and their hard work is clearly evident be it the dance or the fight scenes. Ram Charan has probably put in his career's best performance and to see him in Ram Avatar is some experience in the theaters. Jr NTR is brilliant as well but the writing around his character lacks a bit of depth as compared to the other lead. The rest of the supporting characters have not so much to do and it is good to see that their roles aren't unnecessarily elongated. Although Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson makes for a good evil British officer, the movie suffers from a lack of strong antagonist as the storyline is about Indian freedom struggle. The British characters and accents are more authentic as opposed to other Indian movies but it is also due to the evolution of cinema in general.Everyone's heard of the phrase \"Actions speak louder than words\" and boy does Rajamouli make it clear with this epic cinematic adventure.",

How much it will work for you will depend on how wide your taste is and how open minded you are willing to be. If you do end up checking it out for yourself and are willing to stick with it to the end, I think there's a chance you'll be rewarded with a good time. What about me? I found it to be a fun story that was made with a lot of spirit. The two leads are great, with one of them given an awesome introduction that manages to set up the character with little use of dialogue. The story also involves universal themes that can help viewers identify with the characters. The runtime of the movie does become a bit of an issue though. This film is over three hours long and at points I did feel that. I did also feel that the structure could have been better and that there was better time management regarding certain scenes and revelations. When all is said and done, \"RRR\" is a recommendation from me if you are looking for something different or craving some over the top action (the third act delivers and with a good payoff). Final verdict: 8/10.",

My 2 cents on how to enjoy RRR: Watch it with other people around and turn on your fantasy goggles.OLD REVIEW (Watching it alone and tired):It is really hard to know what to make of this movie. I watched (part of it) because Patrick H Willems recommended it, but I think he might have fallen to the emotion of a movie theatre packed with Indian cinema fans.Not only I am not unfamiliar with Indian movies, but some of them are among my all time favorites: 3 Idiots and Dangal would be the top ones. However, RRR looks like a parody of Indian movies: Over the top but stupid action, very bad special effects, idiotic plot, extremely poor acting and caricature-level bad guys are rampant throughout the film.I hope the otherwise promising Indian film industry won't get lost in the adoration of its hardcore fans and continue providing us with the amazing stories the west klacks of.If you want to watch an over the top but a lot more enjoyable indian film, look no further than Makkhi (Eega), a joy to watch and laugh with/\u00bfat?",

Which isn't to say it's all good.On almost every level this is a monumental film, even if at times it's monumentally stupid. But OMG, it's fun! It's absurd, insane, fast-paced, incomprehensibly violent, ridiculous fun. The acting isn't great but the characters are. The dialogue is half-baked but the message is fully cooked. Good vs. Evil in an epic, derailed, absurd, visually stunning, three-hour thrill ride. It fails in many way, but it never fails to entertain, good or bad.

An Indian army officer jumps into a crowd of thousands of protesters in an attempt to arrest someone. He has a rock smashed on his head, sustains all manner of attack with sticks, punches etc but manages to maintain an igloo like space underneath all the people who jumped him. The army officer, contradicting all laws of physics, plausibility and good cinema is successful in capturing his man within a sea of 20,000 people.

After fast forwarding to catch other rare insightful attempts to raise the bar of world cinema I concluded this film not only wasted 15 minutes of my life but the TV used electricity and drained my remote of some battery power.Burn this film.

Many others pointed out that Rajamouli has clearly stated in the past that the film is a fictional account based on freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju (from the coastal Andhra region) and Komaram Bheem (from the Adilabad region). While Sitarama Raju was born around 1897, Komaram Bheem was born around 1900.\"There are gaps in the lives of these legendary freedom fighters that we don't know about ... It is through this fictional story that we'd like to show what could have happened in their lives and what would have happened if they met and bonded,\" Rajamouli had said at an event last year.A video introducing the other protagonist of the film, Ram Charan in the role of Alluri Sitarama Raju, was released earlier in March. Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion of 1922 against the British Raj's Madras Forest Act of 1882 that restricted the land rights of tribal people. The video showed Ram Charan wearing the uniform of a police officer, and people pointed out that there is no record of Alluri Sitarama Raju ever being a police officer either.Recently, responding to speculations about the film, the filmmakers wrote on Twitter that the two protagonists do not fight for independence in the film. \"#RRRMovie is entirely fictional and not at all a patriotic film,\" said an official tweet. The film's Twitter account calls it, \"A fictional tale of Indian revolutionaries in the 1920s.\"",

Even though you may look at some of the scenes as unrealistic, it was highly entertaining and fun to watch. I also love the fact that there was no f-bombs in this movie. These are the kind of rated r movies I like to watch and I wish society would produce more of. Just the right amount of violence and Gore to be realistic and zero to no profanity that wasn't needed.In today's world and at least in america, we can't get a single solid action movie that goes all the way without having a billion f-bombs. And I get it it's a culture thing. But sometimes I feel like there's just too much of it. Especially throwing sex into everything. It was nice that this movie had zero sex and zero nudity and nothing raunchy.I got bored watching pg-13's nowadays because they're they just look unrealistic. Somebody gets their throat slit like in uncharted and there's no blood anywhere. This movie was brutal and violent but in a good way that fits. None of it was over the top. Take the movie Django unchained for example. It's a good movie but there's a lot of f-bombs the blood is over the top and there's nudity. Still a good movie.

They first become friends, then there is a misunderstanding so they become enemies and finally they need a woman to bring them to senses so that they can become friends forever. BTW whilst going through their ups and downs in friendship they also defeat the British. Typical Indian STYLE.The story and acting were tolerable. Loved the action sequences. They also played with fire and water avatars, I am guessing it was inspired by \"The last Airbender\" by N Shyamalan. The sequence where NTR is being chased by a lion was thrilling. Ram Charan's action sequences are strong and heroic.Overall entertaining. Just a little too long. Tollywood has come a long way and Rajamouli is a gift to Indian cinema.",

Seing the good rating here makes me wonder how easy it is to put a movie on top of a list if you have me enough people in that category (from India). Sorry, but you need to be a little more self-critic.It's not because it's a 3h Indian movie from a famous director, that it's a good movie. Some decent actors of course. Some funny moments. Way too much impossible action scenes, but that is something we had to expect. The music was good I must admit.Decors and all, nice. But it does not save the rest.",

RRR was a movie which was over 3 hour long but I was immersed in it. The downside, according to many is unrealistic action sequences of this movie. I have seen 3 S. S. Rajamouli movies in total (Bahubali duology and RRR) like most people and what I understand is that this is his style of making action sequences. It IS unrealistic, but this is something that will over the years will age and will be known as his style. Just like Quentin Tarantino over exaggerated the amount of blood in Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill. It was unrealistic but it became a trademark for him. I strongly believe that over the years, we will see more of such instances in his projects and this will not stand out as alienated thing.Final verdict : It is a movie which rocked hollywood, certainly deserves a watch.",

I have a confession, I have never ever seen a Bollywood film before, after hearing about this film from two friends, who can have a very critical view of the movies they watch both praised the film, admittedly one of these guys is known to lie through his teeth at times when overly praising anything. That said I decided to watch the film RRR.What I witnessed wasn't what I expected at all, from the opening in which to my eyes was quite brutal, and then the wide expanse of a colour palate in each and every frame. You'll soon realise that the film is essentially a glorious technicolour propaganda movie for the Republic of India and the demise of the British Empire. It's a Tarantino movie, set to a Bollywood score, with the good against evil of a Leone western. The British being the cruel and sadistic bad guys, with the oppressed Indian's rising against their oppressors. It's takes the struggle of two friends on opposing sides of the imperialistic divide to finally realise and combine to fight their oppressors. It doesn't sound like much fun but it is.This is the Tarantino comparison, fights scenes are beautifully choreographed and although there is so much blood and gore it is very much in the style of comic books.I will now have to do reading about the background to the movie. I have already made a mental note that there is a Netflix cartoon about a little muscle bound Indian baby boy called, The Mighty Bheem this can't be a coincidence. I also believe it was also nominated for an Oscar, foreign language I guess. It's a great film, one I watched in one sitting, much to the chagrin of my good lady wife. 9/10 you don't get much better.",

The camera shots, direction is superb. There are scenes which you can't find in any Hollywood movie. Rajamauli Sir you just nailed it and keep doing this great and creative work.Now the 2 pillars of this movie, Ram Charan (The Fire) and Jr. NTR (The Water), they both did fantastic job. The entry of both of them are just unexpected and it's so amazing watch. No one can give that MASS entry to the lead actors. And energy both of them shown in NachoNacho song is so relaxing to watch.Action, direction, BGM everything was great. And at last Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan acted so well, even with small cameos they presented themselves so nicely.And yeah, it's not a one time watch movie & will surely plans to watch atleast 1 more time in multiplex.

            "review_title": "An Epic the Way They USED to Make 'EM.",
            "content": "The Good: I don't think an Indian film has quite captured the film nerd imagination quite the way RRR has and for good reason. This movie - touted as the team up between Telugu superstars Rama Chao Jr., Ram Charan and director S. S. Rajamouli - feels more like an epic from yesteryear than a conventional historical action epic.The action scenes - of which there are so much it honestly makes Hollywood blockbusters seem conservative in comparison - are so wild and varied. Every single one ups the ante and we get such a nice variety as well; from fantastic martial arts choreography, tense firefights, bombastic one on one fights, chaotic action set pieces (featuring tigers, lots of tigers), RRR has it all. These scenes are insane most of the time, but so much that it's hard not to have a huge smile on your face.Music plays an important role in most Indian cinema, and here I think it's done as tastefully as it could be. The music is excellent, but not intrusive. It serves a good purpose and is well integrated into the storyline. And hell, the Desi Naach song is a legitimate banger I can't get out of my head.I was also surprisingly sold on the friendship between Bheem (Rama Rao) and Raju (Charan), whom (let's admit) become \"best friends\" as quick as Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in Step Brothers. It's silly, but feels otherwordly at times, not a friendship, but a bond between two demigods destined to be in each other's lives. I think it works because of how fun the scene at the British party was; so much about their relationship is captured in this one scene.Speaking of the British, if anything really typifies the over the top nature of this film, it's how cartoonishly evil and moustache twirling they're depicted here. Not just oppressive, but gleefully oppressive. Not just wanted to instill fear in a conquered people, but thirsty for their blood and suffering. Not going to lie, it's a little weird. I'm not used to seeing any \"people group\" depicted in quite a way in American films, but if you think of this as more of a mythical Hindu epic than a (very loose) work of historical fiction, it makes more sense.The Bad: I think a lot of people give foreign films a pass sometimes, especially when they're coming from a country that viewer isn't familiar with, but as someone whose watched a lot of Indian films in my lifetime, I can say this: this movie is quite dumb at times. I know you're supposed to check your brain at the door and this is more emotive, mythical storytelling, but there were things that I couldn't help but bother me over the course of RRR.I also have to say, speaking of the British, it's immediately apparent within 5 minutes that none of these people are English. Their accents are laughably bad and honestly distracting (for an English speaker). Oddly, most of these actors are from the United Kingdom, but were mostly Irish or Northern Irish. (Perhaps they loved the opportunity to portray the British this way)There are also some issues with pacing and I wish the movie was cut down just a bit. Don't get me wrong, what's happening on screen is often incredible, but it did feel a bit one note after a while.The Ugly: RRR is a phenomenon for a reason. It's got everything - action, drama, romance, tragedy, music, comedy - it's probably the most purely cinematic experience you can get in 2022. It's also a testament to the South Indian film industry, long ignored in favour of Bollywood, but has now far exceeded India's former golden child. I genuinely look forward towards S. S. Rajamouli's stuff in the future. RRR is totally awesome.",

The scenes are fantastically composed on several levels the coloring the cgi the fullness of each scene the characters that are empathically engaging the sound and of course the music and the songs all with subtle tones from other big blockbusters. I even heard some Ga Ga rhythms in there and a big chunk of the soundtrack is inspired from Avatar 1. Speaking of Avatar 2 should have been like this. Three hrs on Avatar 2 was hell this was entertainment. Mr Cameron if you haven't seen it I really recommend you do.",

Personally, I did not like the film. Only plus points were Ram Charan, Ajay Devgan, okay but not great acting by Jr. NTR, nattu nattu song, some of the fight scenes between Jr. NTR and Ram Charan, and some of the CGIs - which would be only 10% of the total CGI scenes done in the film. I was so irritated that I was waiting for it to somehow end and it was very tough to sit through the whole movie. It is a wonder that almost everybody around the world are praising such a mediocre below average film.",

There are a lot of cool action, but every action scenes drives plot and story foward, nothing is there to just look cool. It is a 3h long movie and not one scene gets boring or to slow. Every song/dance is telling the story and progressing it. Every flashback and exposition is just given at the right moment not too soon not too early.I am not sure what else to say, maybe there are movies more serious, with stronger plot and or character development, but I've never have seen a movie where every cinematic technique in every scene is successfully used to tell the story.

            "content": "To be brutally honest, all the hype around RRR made me apprehensive whether SS Rajamouli can deliver. I went into the theatre expecting a letdown, as the hype prior to release was reaching stratospheric levels.I was happy to be proven wrong when I watched the movie. The movie is a fictionalized tale of Alluri Seetharam Raju and Komaram Bheem, who though never met led potent revolutions in the early part of 20th century.The movie starts with a gut wrenching scene of the Governor and his wife visiting Adilabad for a hunting expedition. During that expedition, a tribal girl catches the attention of the governors wife (played by Allison Daddy) who is adept at skin paintings. She wishes to take the girl to their palace as a showpiece and the Governor willingly obliges. A few coins are thrown at the parents of the girl and she is whisked away. The tribals protest and obstruct the cavalry but they are brutally dealt with.This is where the audience is introduced to two parallel storylines. In the first storyline, Ramaraju (aka Ram Charan) is a police officer and is blindly siding with the monstrous actions of British to achieve a hidden agenda. In another storyline, Komaram Bheem (aka Jr NTR) is venturing into forests collecting wild animals like wolves and tigers. He is also masquerading as a mechanic at a garage in Delhi. His reason for presence is to get the girl kidnapped by the Governor back to her family.The story of these two characters then collides, they become great friends but are forced to go apart when their agendas collide. It would be a travesty to reveal anything more about the story.The storyline is thin, agreed ... but, the way the story is narrated on screen and intertwined with emotions makes it apart. This is exactly where Rajamouli delivers. While the visual spectacle is a given, it never loses track of emotions. That's exactly what makes this movie a potent entertainment experience. For e.g. The interval scene at the party is a visual delight but it also effectively packs the pain and frustration of losing the child to an oppressive government. The scene involving the climax fight is a visual delight but the fight has as much emotion behind it as action.Lots of directors can make visual spectacles but where they usually fail is the emotional quotient. Look at big budget disasters like Thugs of Hindustan, Kalank, 83 ...I would not like to say much on audio visual elements like sound, lighting, special effects because it is a given that they will be world class within the budget constraints. I would recommend this movie to any cinema lover. Just go blind and give in yourself to the experience.",

Jr. NTR, Ravi Teja, Both were fantastic, and you cannot imagine any other actors could have been better. Jr. NTR's emotions was the charm of the movie,Ravi Teja's acting was the blast of the movie.

Indian cinema, on the other hand, tells physics and logical storytelling to sod off.This is a world where a one-man army with the strength of 20 men can take on a rioting crowd with many aggressors, where a man can take down and trap a tiger with sheer strength and will that defies impossible odds, and where dance numbers and storybeats appear without any rational as to why they are happening.

            "content": "'RRR' is an historical action epic from Indian director S. S. Rajamouli who wrote the screenplay as well. This guy is kind of like James Cameron and Peter Jackson rolled into one. He is pretty much at the peak of Telugu language Indian films. 'RRR' is the most expensive Indian film to date. It stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan as real life Indian revolutionaries Khomaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju. The film was oft delayed in both production and release due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but finally hit theaters in March of 2022, and was met with both positive reviews and financial success.It is 1920 in British India and they are truly the evil empire exemplified by a fairly casual abduction of a young girl from a small village by a harsh administrator and his equally depraved wife. The tribe's guardian Bheem chases after in an effort to find and rescue the girl. Meanwhile we meet Raju who ,while native, is an ambitious officer in the British army. After an impressive display against a mob he is enlisted to help ferret out this protector who has come to the city for the girl when they get wind that a champion has been dispatched to retrieve her. Randomly Bheem and Raju meet saving a boy and become best friends which sets up a clearly interesting dynamic as Bheem conducts his hunt for the girl Malli in secret and equally in secret Raju is looking for Bheem although he is unaware that is who he hunts. There are more twists and turns in the this three hour epic culminating in an intense and satisfying climax.While I don't shy away from any international cinema I have really never delved Indian/Bollywood/Tollywood cinema in any form or fashion. 'RRR' is more than accessible from a story standpoint, as well as being easy to find and watch as it is on Netflix. This landed on my radar after I saw a USA Today article in June of 2022 that called 'RRR' the best film of the year so far. It is certainly something else. It does have some of the song and dance elements although it is not so much that you would really even consider it a musical. The action here is some highly stylized, over the top action hero insanity. None of what Bheem and Raju do or endure can be considered grounded in reality. They both become larger than life and it is very enjoyable to see their stories develop and then come crashing together. It is also interesting that both appear to be alpha male action stars so you know that while they start with an intense bromance they will have to have have some static being on very opposite sides at the outset of the film. The action here is intense and off the wall fun. The plot hooks you in and in makes the film not feel anything like its three hour run time. I am not sure I would label it the best of the year, but this is quite good, and is a solid entry film for anyone wanting branch out and sample some big budget action fare from other lands.Eric's Grade: B+",

So you need to settle down with your popcorn, take off your shoes/ slippers, send your grey cells on a holiday and enjoy watching the movie. (Seeing this over the top gravity defying action prompted one of the reviewers to ask if SS Rajmouli had failed in Physics !)\nThe plot is a fictitious one about two legendary revolutionaries who fought against British colonialists in 1920s and how their friendship stood the test of the tough times and the tumultuous events. But the movie's central focus is not only on the story but on the massive scale of its picturisation which is designed to dazzle and mesmerize you with one grand scene following another. There are extended scenes of fights between the natives and the Brits. There are aerial shots of mobs in huge numbers, you have wild animals let loose on the British soldiers, a burning motorcycle hurled into a building, buildings on fire etc. There are a couple of astounding climaxes since a plot having such a wide canvas cannot have just one. To balance the high decibel action, there is also an adequate amount of sentiment and melodrama in some scenes. Among the two protagonists, one is called Ram ( Ram Charan)and his fiance is Sita ( Alia Bhatt). The other main character is Bheem ( NTR JR ). Rajmouli sir is back at doing what he does best. This man does everything on a grand scale and easily goes overboard doing it. He is a visionary among film makers. Both NTR JR and Ram Charan have put all their energy into their acting and will no doubt immensely please their fans. Ajay Devgn and Shraddha Kapoor have small though impressive roles. Interesting to see them playing Telugu characters.",

The energy of this film is what makes this a must see from 2022 in my eyes. The performances and characters from N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan are great. They both have some great chemistry together and do a great job at developing their characters. S. S. Rajamouli's direction is really fun and so much better than his directing on Bahubali. The action is some of the most insane I've seen put to film ever. It's something that's hard to describe and is better being seen by your own eyes. You won't be disappointed though. It also has probably my favorite dance scene ever put to film as well. I honestly can't think of anything that tops it. When the film isn't action oriented or doing something fun then it can really drag. There's a 30-40 minute portion of the film that really drags on and on. Some of the performances here aren't exactly amazing also like from Alison Doody. If you want a really fun action and character oriented movie to watch with friends or on your own then I would highly recommend checking this out.",

From that messaging standpoint its certainly not a good movie.On the pure entertainment side: the two main characters are fun (mr moustache, and the little bearded village dude) and the friendship vs. Tension between the two heroes with the double (triple) undercover identities is interesting across the film. The \"bromance\" and dance scenes are somewhat ridiculous, and the absurdly unrealistic action scenes and special effects are fun and fairly well made.Overall the film is a bit too long: starts of well and then at some point loses pace, randomly introducing new characters halfway through the film.. so after hour #2 a slight touch of boredom started to kick in.In summary: ok entertainment with some good attempts at epic scenes, but unpalatably nationalistic.",

Very melodious, and some tracks were thrilling!Gets emotionally attached to the audience! Screenplay is greatly done!Great VFX! Very nicely done and feels very realistic, cinemaphotography\nand visualization would have been tough.Hats off to the whole team!Didn't become as much good as I expected it to be, seriously I was hooked in for it, but It seriously! Honestly! Did not deliver what it promised! The trailer and the hype which is always built by everyone for a Rajamouli film was on another level, SS Rajamouli is very good director but what his speciality is, he shows something which is out of the world, his films are not fully fantasy based but, give the vibes of that genre.The Acting and the action scenes:- listen I won't straight away bash them but honestly did not like Rajamouli integrating them here, not necessary at all, in Bahubali series he was clear, great action scenes! (lifted from hollywood) were there, and yes seriously they were good.But here they are over the top! And defy physics, biology.Acting: Ram Charan did a great job, unlike his other roles, he felt very confident here and lived his role, JR Ntr in some scenes was weak, some of his expressions were childlike (while getting angry or sad) I don't how his part was messed up, because he is the one who is experienced than Ram Charan, why so? I still don't understand because he is a serious actor if we look at his other films.NO PROPER STORYLINE!STORY IS:\nLOST, SAVE, REVOLT\nBAM!I mean seriously? How could this be the story of a period drama film based on freedom fighters? Ok if it is fictional but this went away from bullseye!Rajamouli has given 4 Period Drama films back to back, this is not what his old films were like , he is experimenting but this would start getting boring if he makes one more with similar tone and use of similar musical instruments and notes in his films! He must deliver a different film now.Thanks for reading!",

This was a great movie for its storyline for its action sequences for it's dancing and it's music track. I will admit I didn't want to go much further than 30 minutes in, but stick with this movie and it will give you a whole other perspective on what an action film can look like from a different nation. Those who want to pick on the plot flaws and the unrealistic details should go watch American hero movies and tell me that the super powers and their amazing healing ability are innately some American movie trope that can't be used by others. I didn't quite get the timing and flashbacks but it all made sense by the end. My only issue was that Rahj Started the movie has some bad ass who could take on a whole mob of thousands by himself but then seemed to be somewhat human for most of the movie and then came back as the bad ass in the last 30 minutes. Overall i'd tell anyone to watch this movie For a few hours of enlightenment of another cultures movie scene and to just enjoy some breathtaking cinematography.",

Fists go flying, cars and buildings explode, there's motorcycle stunts, a one-vs-hundred brawl, and even a big melee involving tigers, leopards, and wolves.The set-pieces are grandly absurd but showcase Rajamouli's eye for big budget spectacle. Hollywood needs to take a few cues from this guy.It does clock at a mammoth three hours but the friendship between the two protagonists keeps things watchable when there's no fights going on. There's even a big dance battle just to lighten the mood that's a lot of fun.Special mention to Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody hamming it up as the villains.

It's over three hours and so dull and predictable that I thought there was hardly any point in wasting any more of my precious time.I don't even know where to start. Probably with the culture shock. I tried to watch an Indian series once and couldn't do it because of the bad acting, but I realised now, it's probably not bad acting, it's just Indian acting and it is supposed to be that way. It reminds me a bit how acting in European films has been during the silent era. It's not very subtle and doesn't leave room for any ambiguity. Also the various stereotypes of heroes, villains and innocents are so old fashioned, it becomes unintentionally funny at times. I guess the Brits did some bad stuff, while they were over there, but this narrativ where every Brit is a sadistic and brutal moron whereas all Indians are brave and noble beings is laid on a bit thick. Turkish films are like that as well. To me it seems aimed an an audience who like their world to be very, very simple indeed.Also, and I say that as an editor, I found it clumsily edited. The overuse of slo-mo aside, to me there is no flow in the cut. Static frames are cut way too quick and movement very rarely picks up from where it was left off in the take before, thus even the carefully choreographed actions scenes seem eerily wooden. And they drag on forever.This is probably another specific Indian trait, seeng that 3 hour movies are totally common over there, but I found the pacing excruciatingly slow, because you always know what is going to happen next and you just sit there waiting for it to be over until you can't take it anymore.So much stuff here seems to be done just for the sake of it, regardless if it propels the story forward or not. The imagery is far to clean and you never have the feeling you are in India at the beginning of the last century. Instead you feel like you are in an endless propaganda commercial of 2022.

The story is based on possiblity of a friendship between 2 freedom fighters (losely inspired from the freedom fighters Alluri Sitaram Raju and Komaram Bheem who haven't met) and the philosophical concept of Fire & Water has been used as well.Each one of the two protagonists have their own beliefs and missions. How they team up forms the rest of the story.The Good:1. Storyline & Narration (Mr. S. S. R. has done a great job as always)2. Production Values - Not saying it is the best, but I could give this an 8/10 at least! Really, this aspect of filmmaking has been given importance.3. Acting (especially the main lead star cast - Jr. NTR & RC and also, more importantly, Ray Stevenson and also the actress who played the wife of Gen. Scott)The Bad:1. Some weird action scenes (not actually \"bad,\" but it rather felt like a comedy in a serious movie) - could've reduced these kinds of slo mo weird action scenes like that (in)famous scene of Jr. NTR and the bullet bike (won't reveal more because this is a spoiler free review!;-)2. Cringey moves and sounds in credits song (Songs weren't \"very good\" except Dosti; They pass the test, and got recognised for their originality, but that's it. Songs don't feel like you can listen a hundred times)Final Verdict: 3.5/5RRR is mesmerizing and takes you to the world of colonial India, thanks to commendable storytelling, direction, and production values. The acting of the lead star cast has justified their roles.The background score is good (except at some places), and the songs are good as well. There are some weird goofy action scenes. Except that, it's an excellent movie for a one-time watch.RRR ticks all the right boxes, and (almost) every aspect of the film (barely) crosses the line (from the standpoint of International films) which makes it a really good film but NOT any \"brilliant piece of ART\"",

Granted Telugu is my mother tongue so call me biased--but I lived in the US for almost 20 years including a stint in California making indie films. All of which to say I am a film guy and this is an exceptional piece of filmmaking, regardless of where you're from.Now for the plot details that get things going: During the British Raj in India, a young Gond tribal girl named Malli is taken by the local Brit powers-that-be and hence a Gond tribal warrior named Bhim vows to get her back. In order to do so, he goes incognito in Delhi sheltered by a local Muslim family. Simultaneously, for reasons that will become clear later, an up-and-coming native in the British Indian army (Raju) is out to impress his British superiors by almost single-handedly booking a rioter amidst a veritable mob in a breathtaking action sequence. (That sequence is one of several throughout the movie that simply ups the ante on your received sense of how much stuff a film scene could carry.) Turns out both these men are fighting the British in their own way--and the movie is about how their paths ultimately converge.Tell you what, give it 30 min and most likely you wouldn't be able to stop even if you wanted to.

I have mostly ignored Indian movies because I find them ridiculous, but, this one is irrefutable. If a movie is so entertaining, I believe, we should invent a new genre for a movie like this and within the parameters of that genre all the ridiculousness and exaggeration of their action sequences and melodrama should be fully acceptable.",

            "content": "Do not read any further, just do yourself a favor and watch the movie in your nearest Cinema Hall.RRR: A movie about 2 circumstantial friends, working their way for opposing mission. As their backstory unfolds, their friendship transcends further and working in unison for the greater good. The movie lead by NTR Jr. (Bhim) and Ram Charan (Sitarama aka Ram) with great supporting roles from Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt and Samuthirakani.From the trailers, we ought to know that we are getting into a Baahubali-style grandeur, coupled with sans-logic fights. That is the only limitation that your brain needs to adjust and enjoy this well-directed marvel. Am sure this is something we have seen many movies from top actors in south in so-called action movies. So, it is easier to expect and move on.This movie follows the traditional way of story telling and creates a premise which is rather memorable. This is a commendable effort from the director in this age of filming, where everything is fast forward in the name of modernization of film editing. The explanation of each \"R\" of the movie is very crisp and punchy that you buy into the characters Bhim and Ram. Needless to mention; they will occupy 85% of screen space and you completely back who you are rooting for and for what reason.NTR Jr and Ram Charan already have a huge fan base and their lineage is just bigger than the Tollywood cinema itself. Despite this, the effort put in by both the actors and their physical transformation to look slick on their roles is commendable. That is what gives a true grit to the movie and gives us a commitment to immerse ourselves in the character and walk alongside them in their quest for success.The second half does slow down, and it is fair that way, as the first half has just been just a colossal rampage of information and due spectacle of brilliances from the actors. To maintain that pace is surely not needed and when we deep dive into the backstory of how things were, you will feel the justification behind Ram Charan and why he is reacting the way he is reacting in the movie. You buy into it very easily.You don't have to understand Bhim and his motto, his rescue mission is a testimonial to the fact how clans prioritize others than self and how they are willing to throw anything and everything to save lives. Although annexation was at full swing in the British rule, the movie takes focuses on human trafficking and the emotions that run along with it.Sometimes, this movie did show glimpses of Captain America, Civil War. Not in the superhero characteristics, but whose side the audience will sway based on the circumstances and if you haven't swayed between Ram and Bhim then you are soul deprived \ud83d\ude0a.Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt, Samuthirakani have justified their screen time and delivered the message where needed. Kudos on director to use them in right place at the right time. Normally in such movies, songs would drag the pace down, not here though. The songs are equally adrenaline rushed as the movie itself. Dance movements were just breathtaking, especially \"Nattu Kuthu\". You will involuntarily be dancing from your seats, its too good..\nAlthough it would have been better off without one Sad song.Surely every movie has flaws, and this is no exception, but the question is can you look past them? Yes absolutely. Can you enjoy the movie even with them? 100%.RRR just Roars!!",

I am sure most of you might have already watched this mega actioner set in the British era, but I would still like to give my views on this. I know many film fans and critics loath Manoj Kumar's mega hit-Kranti(which I anyway love) for being loud, over the top and showing Britishers as brute animals, I want to point out that RRR goes further and is really very loud and melodramatic as far as treatment is concerned. It also is in the mould of great Telugu films wherein canvas is very important. I found traces of Kranti and even other 80s Mard, Desh Premee, Sarfarosh(Jeetendra one which itself was a remake of NTRs Telugu film) of course on a much bigger canvas. In spite of shortcomings and going a bit haywire here and there, RRR still delivers a SOLID punch. Rajamoulis's penchant for showing action makes RRR one of the best action films in India. Both Ram Charan and NTR Jr. Nail their roles perfectly. Ajay Devgan is great in his cameo but I didn't like Alia Bhatt. Overall a full-on enjoyable grand actioner, though I would say I preferred Bahbulai-1 and 2 over it!",

I wasn't expecting another magnum opus, but I was expecting a gripping story, replete with incredible screenplay, clever action sequences and a fair share of twists and turns in the plot. RRR fails to deliver on all counts.I don't even know where to begin. Rajamouli takes too much time introducing the protagonists - the Fire and the Water analogies are meaningless and poorly concocted. One cannot but help wonder if all that wasted time in the movie could not have been used to develop a more interesting plot. The protagonists themselves are so bad in every respect that I can't even remember their character names in the movie. Compare that to the like Kattappa and Bhalla and Sivakami in Bahubali or even the relentless Fly in Naan Eee, and you soon run out of leeway. There is a weak attempt at justifying underdeveloped ideologies for the two main archetypes in the movie, and it is so poorly developed that it fails to hit the spot.The plot meanders along aimlessly from one boring scene to another, with random characters weaving in and out like caricatures in a bad comic book. There is a scene where NTR gets to take a crack at a cop who unnecessarily roughs him up in an earlier sequence. Knowing Rajamouli, I was expecting more impact in that scene, but it was so predictable and poorly delivered, that it failed to leave any impression whatsoever.There is an even weaker attempt in the movie at rekindling a romance, which goes nowhere - neither is it interesting, nor is it likeable. And the flashbacks are pathetic attempts to justify pointless ideologies that they are only a distraction in the movie, and best forgotten sooner rather than later. Characters like Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt have been thoroughly wasted, as are Shriya Sarin and Samuthrakani.The music is ok, and the cinematography is ok, but the most important ingredient in any movie, the lowest common denominator, so to speak, is the story and the plot, and as hard as he has tried to piece something together in RRR, Rajamouli has failed miserably.In sum, I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie. I hope the director finds his way again, and makes a compelling comeback in his next flick.Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "I agree this is not Baahubali. There are numerous holes and logical errors in the story. And the super-human strength is much lesser acceptable as the characters belong to a time around 70 years ago, rather than about 1000 years ago. But the movie still delivers what it promises. There are numerous exotic and creative fight scenes and there is also a heart clenching emotional drama. It's a very stylish movie actually, and if you like such movies, you might even love it. Just don't compare it to Baahubali. Masterpieces like Baahubali are delivered once in several decades.Let me clarify something. This movie is not about freedom fighting against British Empire. Although this concept is present in the story, the central theme is about two people's interactions. They are both extremely strong and powerful. Sometimes they are friends and sometimes they are enemies. Very good fighting scenes are created involving them, either when they are friends or enemies. This is the entire focus of the movie. Although at times I felt this concept could have been explored far better, and the movie could have improved, I still can't say it's a bad movie. Rating of 8 stars seems reasonably to me, as there are currently way too many pretty bad Indian movies are rated even above 8. This movie is surely far better than those.",

And while I'm someone that typically hates musicals (no judgement on those who love them!) the parts of this that fell into that genre, were fabulous. Found myself almost overwhelmed with pleasure and excitement at points - and cried at the most unlikely point, just because a tonne of dopamine was hitting my system and I was in awe of what humans can imagine, create, and pack into this movie.

            "content": "This movie directed by SS Rajamouli is a blockbuster. It is an absolute treat to watch.Plus Points:\nThere are an unlimited amount of highs in this movie. The highs are on a different level and comparable to Hollywood level and marvel level movies.Emotionally we get connected a lot in these highs too. For me the interval scene and the komaram bheemuda song scene were the most hard hitting.SS Rajamouli also shows his genius writing in this movie. He didn't leave clich\u00e9 moments just to move the story. There is one scene where Rahul Ramakrishna uses a snake to try to kill ram charan by making a sound with a twig, and it clearly shows rajamouli's creativity in the screenplay.Minus Points:\nThere are some parts in the second half where it is slightly dull. For me personally, the flashback portion was kind of dull and felt elongated. It could've been delivered better but other than that everything else felt seamless in the story and screenplay.Overall:\nThis is an out and out Rajamouli Action Movie! For action lovers this will be rated as a blockbuster but for people that only come for the story and overall feel could rate it as a hit!Did Rajamouli manage to balance both the heros, Ntr and Ram Charan?Although, it revolves around both of them mostly equally, if you would have to classify one of them as the main character then it would be ram charan because of his character arc. Ram charan has an internal conflict and a turning point in the movie whereas Ntr's character is more plain and goes by the same level throughout the film. Due to this we feel as if ram charan's character is more complete and as if we know more about him.Me, being an ntr fan I was slightly disappointed to see this. I wanted to see more variation, more character, and a more dominant personality for him. I cannot blame this on Rajamouli. He did his absolute best to do justice to the script but I still wish there was a little more to ntr.Is this better than SS Rajamouli's previous movie bahubali the conclusion? Well, this is a very opinionated question. If you are an action lover and crave for intense and powerful scenes then you would like RRR more. If you watch movies for their stories and the overall feel of it then you would like bahubali 2 more.Personally, I liked Bahubali better. I felt like I connected with the characters more and that the story line was more complete.So Should You Watch it in the Theater?Unless you are an action hater, this is definitely a movie you MUST WATCH in the THATER!",

The Dances are extraordinary.Dont know why Rajamouli had cast Alia Bhatt not much screen space and role it's like taking Bunrah in your cricket team and not giving him bowling.The music seems to be same as Bahubali songs.After watching Bahubali 1 & 2 I was expecting Dir. Raja Mouli will be a challenge to Dir Spielberg and will be taking Indian Cinema to next level in World stage.I was expecting a far better creation from Rajamouli.The movie is good apart from lacking logic and conviction.

It was a bit confusing and incomprehensible to me at the beginning, even though I was watching the movie with translated subtitles, as it went on, I became more interested, until I couldn't put the movie down. The story is good. The actors are very good. The special effects are flawless. The music is great, the dances are very, very beautiful and captivating. The story line and rhythm of the film is suitable. This is one of those movies that you can sit down and watch again. Some moments of the dances are very original and I searched for its repetition on YouTube. I recommend watching this movie to any friend. It has good memorable moments. It is quite clear that in terms of Indian cinema, the film was very expensive and I have never seen such a production from Bollywood. I don't know if I could have given a score of 9 out of 10, it would have been better or not.",

            "review_title": "RRR - A jaw dropping patriotic fest",
            "content": "RRR (Hindi Version)A SPECTACLE is something exhibited to view as unusual, notable, or entertaining\nespecially : an eye-catching or dramatic public display. As per the dictionary, this is the meaning of the word.To me, right now, a spectacle means RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt / Roudram Ranam Rudhiram). Tempted to the max with the publicity posters, teasers, trailers, interviews and what not...as well as SS Rajamouli's previous blockbusters like Chatrapathi, Vikramarkudu, Magadheera, Eega, Bahubali 1 & 2, I had boarded the hype bandwagon along with others. While sitting in the dark, in Screen 1, the biggest of the lot, in Novo Cinemas, Ibn Batuta Mall, Dubai, I awaited with a lot of anxiety to witness Rajamouli's caged beauty of a movie! But even after watching countless number of movies of all genres and many languages, I still wasn't ready for what he unleashed onto the screen! The hype was real! RRR lived upto it and more! It's a kind of Magnum Opus that could be pulled off by Rajamouli only! That too with a budget of 550 Crores!Usually being an immensely patient man, I showed no signs of that when booking a ticket for the movie. Yes, I wanted to watch the Telugu version, for which I would have to read the English subtitles (and miss few scenes here and there!). But due to the fact that both the Telugu and Tamil versions were releasing only a day later, I booked for the Hindi version which came out on 24th here. And I have no problem in understanding Hindi. Now I didn't just blindly take that decision and I did do my homework. I found out that both \"Ram Charan\" and \"Junior NTR\" had dubbed in their own voices for the Hindi version. That convinced me that my decision to watch the Hindi version was right. All I wanted was the two heroes to belt out dialogues in their own deep strong voices. Great! Settled! Nothing else mattered as I knew that Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt would obviously dub in their own voices for this version and I already really enjoyed the songs in Hindi as well.In RRR, Ram Charan and Jr NTR play revolutionaries Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, respectively. In real life, they were two tribal leaders & revolutionaries who had put up a tough resistance against the British. They lived around the same time period from 1897 to 1940 in Andhra Pradesh. Both of them were killed in different years and it is not known for sure if they did actually meet each other, though they both might have known about the other's existence and freedom struggle. Rajamouli begins the movie in chapters - the story, the fire, the water. Thus giving us the film's context and introducing it's heroes Bheem (NTR) and Ram (Ram Charan), where Ram, the angry young Officer is like Fire and Bheem, the innocent Gond tribal, is like Water. What happens when fire and water collide? Is one consumed by the other or can they co-exist? You have to watch the movie to know about that!It's a fictional story, a patriotic saga, set in British India (Delhi) of the 1920s. The movie is epic. It has mythological connections (With Ramayana and Mahabharata), it's got superhero genre and scale of action and finally it is also about patriotism, love and brotherhood. The bromance between Ram and Bheem is so beautifully depicted that we root for both of them. We want them to win, we get heartbroken when they part ways, we desperately want them to reunite and return for the mind boggling finale war!The first half is excellent. Every scene exuded grandeur. After the initial story is established, incredible introductions are given to both protagonists. That itself is a sight to behold. A scene around 20 mins before the interval (Interval block as they say) is where you as an audience goes... What the...! And then witness with an open mouth, the unbelievable visuals and actions on screen! Oh my God, did that scene make me jolt in my seat and sit upright! I read that this specific scene was shot in a span of 65 nights, costing 75 lakhs a day! I mean, wow...just wow!!! I don't think there has been such an interval block ever in Indian cinema. The mesmerizing second half has more drama, establishing and clearing certain questions the viewers would have and thus introducing Ajay Devgn's character as well as Alia Bhatt's. Hence the pacing changes for a bit but even that doesn't give the audience a dull moment. The 3 hours and 2 minute runtime feels like a 1 hour and 90 minutes. I never felt that the movie is being unnecessarily stretched out. Ajay had an extended cameo and he was solid in his performance. Alia as Ramaraju's fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Sita, did well as always but she had very less screen time and I was disappointed for that. Rajamouli did say that these two actors are playing cameos. But the way they used her in promotions, you think she would have a meatier role and extended screen time! You get to see Shriya Saran after a long time, as Ajay's wife. Again she too has very less screen time. But she did well too with what was given to her. A few others in the cast is , Thor and Punisher: War Zone star Ray Stevenson as a tyrant British military general Scott, with Alison Doody of A View to a Kill and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, as his wife. Ray was pretty fierce in his character but I still felt like he did not do a good job. Alison Doody was quite over the top. Being a seasoned actress, I guess it's the lines given to her that made her ham a lot! There is also Olivia Morris who plays Jennifer who has affections for Komaran Bheem. She actually gave a pretty good performance and is pleasing to the eyes as well. The Brits are mostly shown as violent, unsympathetic and hateful people barring Olivia. Which reminded me of Rachel Shelley in Lagaan. The finale is mind boggling, to say the least. This movie is a visual treat to the max.All said and done, I have to talk about the elephant in the room. The larger than life characterizations and super human strength the two protagonists have.You can look at this in two ways. The traditional outlook that they are mere human beings and then question the director's choice of unbelievable and over the top action scene visualisations, protagonists getting hurt, rising up again without any effect of their previous wounds and so on...! This is nuts, funny, I can't buy this...would go the comments! But then I say you are watching the wrong movie and you do not know anything about Rajamouli's school of movie making. Now if you know about Rajamouli's filmography, you will actually applaud at his audacity to make super humans out of two very real freedom fighters, thus giving them a wider appeal and recognition amongst the ignorant movie goers and masses who probably never even knew of these two revolutionaries except maybe the history buffs and people hailing from Andhra Pradesh. I never knew or read about these two freedom fighters until now. Once you agree to this, then you are in for the roller coaster ride! Full on! The suspension of disbelief will still be there but it's not going to matter with the immense adrenaline pumping from the characters' veins to yours!Brace Yourself for Ram & Bheem....these words in the film's trailers are actually preparing you for this power packed unstoppable spectacle, that has awesome cinematography (camera work is astounding), unbelievable crowd scenes, pretty good CGI (Scenes with the Tiger, wolf and certain other ones), great sound effects and massive, beautiful set design and some super talented actors with superlative performances. Rajamouli, once again succeeds in creating an out and out commercial movie oozing with drama, action, comedy, superb songs and dance. And this time, Patriotism as well.The story is by Rajamouli's father K. V. Vijayendra Prasad. You might be surprised to know that K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was the writer for both Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Manikarnika as well. A well written screenplay makes for smooth viewing without any lag. Veteran Editor A. Sreekar Prasad excels in giving us a fast paced movie. Music by M. M. Keeravani is melodious and foot tapping. BGM again by him lifted the movie and it's dramatic and action sequences to another level altogether! The song 'Nacho Nacho' is sung by Vishal Mishra and Rahul Sipligunj. The song is choreographed by Prem Rakshith. This song sequence is a treat for the eyes and ears. A dance off with the Brits was just awesome and it was a showcase for the tremendous ability Ram Charan and Junior NTR has in dancing. Their agility, synchronization....outstanding! The friendship song was sweet! 90s kids will remember a popular Bollywood \"M. M. Keeravani / M. M Kreem\" song from a Mahesh Bhatt movie called Criminal (remake of Harrison Ford's \"The Fugitive\")\nTu Mile Dil Khile.... Which I think was sung by Kumar Sanu and Kerala's very own Chitra. The initial music and female vocals of that song were \"inspired\" from Age of Loneliness by Enigma. That's another matter altogether! It still was damn good!VFX for the most part was very good. There are one or two scenes where you really know the CGI wasn't that great but for a fraction of what is spent in Hollywood (even with such a big budget) I'll say it's fine! They had SRK's Red Chillies Vfx as well as others behind it. Hence the superior quality! Slow motion was used well and at the right moments!Not taking away anything from Junior NTR, but Ram Charan got the meatier role here, I feel. They both were really very good in their performances and transformations. There was a lot of blood and gore, even stylized versions of bloodshed and all. Kids would be better off watching the movie with their Parents.Whether you are fans of Ram Charan and Junior NTR or not, do not miss this visual treat. It's a Rajamouli epic and I congratulate him for his vision and conviction in bringing this to life. No easy feat! Enjoy!",

Only VFX used for animals should be more refined. Also, this is a south Indian movie so need to neglect some excessive action scenes. They should have easily given lead heroine role to someone else. There is no need of Alia Bhatt for this role as she has very less acting scope in this movie. Acting done by both lead heroes is phenomenal including their dance steps.

The main characters, played well by Jr. NTR & Ram Charan, have been inspired from lives of two real heroes from Telangana & Andhra - Komaram Bheem & Sitarama Raju.While I watched the movie in Hindi, but having stayed in the south for so long, I can imagine the reactions this movie in Telugu/Tamil would have generated in the theatres. These kind of films are made to be watched & enjoyed in Cinemas with friends & family. The visuals, background score (Keeravani sir again) and cinematography were excellent. The over-the-top action sequences, again like Baahubali, are the highlights of the movie.However, at around 3hrs, it was a bit of stretch (unlike the 2 Baahubali movies), and I did catch myself looking elsewhere in the theatre & at my phone at times. I guess it is because Rajamouli is a story teller and often incorporates a lot of ideas from history & mythology.Nonetheless, an Indian movie worth watching on big screens is a huge respite to those who have been film-starved these past 2 years, with good action & direction.",

It's an absolute masterpiece in terms of storytelling, music, action, and climax; what more can one expect from movies?The movie never disengages, it will keep you absorbed the whole time. The way elements of Fire & Water are represented and portrayed as co-actors nature is amazing.The cinematography is a treat to the eyes.The music scores serve their purpose and fit perfectly with every scene. You cannot complain of excess of anything. Everything is so measured and so beautiful.However, It is 3hour long so can be tiring for some but not for me as epic storytelling requires time and you as an audience would have been complaining if it was cut short.I only gave it a 9 because some creative action scenes are way unrealistic but I am not complaining. The whole movie is so good that it can be forgiven but after giving us many blockbusters like Eega, Bahubali series, it is expected from the director to up his action scenes game.And CGI in some of the scenes is a bit janky but that is only due to financial constraints.Hey, I liked it and I know you will too, it hasn't got universal acclaim for no reason.

The CGI, VFX and cinematography were Marvel level to be honest, with gorgeous set designs and lot of attention to details.

Everyone by default walks inside movie hall with the mindset of movie to be Stupendous and that's the power and success of Rajamouli . RM never misses to ensure seeding that BIG PICTURE thought in everyone's mind even before his movie release . He has a clear and flawless plan on how to target and spend producers every single penny and return them with huge profits. Back to the movie , only our expectations were sky high but not Rajamouli's . Be it the screenplay, storyline or the visuals everything were pretty ordinary and sometimes overkill. CGI in many places especially in the first half were so unreal and not in par with Baahubali . In particular to the animals recreated through CGI. The performance of both RamCharan and Jr. NTR were remarkable and they were the biggest strength of the movie . Agreed that they are muscled but can't agree that they can fight against 1000s single handedly and come alive . Too much overdoing in many of the scenes including stunts that were beyond exaggeration . .The first half of the movie was full of unbelievable things and probably RM thought we would accept anything and everything when it's from him . That way it's time for him to do away with such thoughts . Naatu Naatu song was completely power packed and good choice of actors to play as English . Olivia as Jenny performed so well and same is the case with the actors as Scott and Mrs Scott. The second half of the movie was terrific and definitely on fire. Hardly any stupid CGI, excellent work by Art directors . The stunt scenes were really enjoyable and the pace of the second part was making us forget the flaws in the first half . Short and sweet contribution by Ajay Devgan , Shriya Saran, Aaliyah Bhatt, Samuthrakani and many more . Great 3D work in some of the scenes , must note . The music and BGM by Keeravani reminded lot on Bahubali . That way even certain scenes and instances in the movie were having lots of shade of Baahubali . May be Rajamouli was running short of creativity. Another couple of movies this way , he might get lost in the crowd. The hype was directly proportional to the cost of the movie . RRR is a mix of bad and good like that of my review. It is more of a fantasy than reality with a must watch second half. Overall RRR the movie Rumbles, Rises and Roars !",

Very poor direction, and stretched the movie for no reason.Movie started with a bang with Ram's excellent performance obeying orders to arrest a man standing among 1000 of mobs, but then it got weaker and weaker. The fights, scenes, actions and events just defy physics and obvious-ism.This movie MAKES NO SENSE.If you are someone who follows the Movies like Antim or Radhey, you will probably like this movie because it is just fighting without any logic or requirements. But If you are someone who likes good movies, with a good storyline, and excellent direction, please don't go watch this.

There was not one dull moment throughout. But few scenes were too violent for me to watch especially the public whipping of Tarak. First half fully I was rooting for Tarak.

Starring Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn ,Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris and others. As the title suggests RRR- Rise Roar Revolt, each and every elements are present with its after affects. When greater the cast, higher the responsibilities and SSR gave importance to each and every characters. Even the cameos were very well designed and were perfectly suited to the actors. When it comes to a multistarrer, several films failed to impress the audience. Whereas RRR has successfully achieved in registering this in audience's mind. The movie is worth waiting for 4 years. And Can say that the hype is real.Coming to the storySet in the late 20s , the duo Komaram Bheem (NTR) , Rama Raju (Ram Charan) are on their own paths. The way they meet each other ,which later created a bond of friendship between them were well shot . What guided to the confrontations / clashes between them is the sequence which I won't tell as it'll become a spoiler. And what made them together to fight against the blood seeker ,British empire is the plot . This movie completely depends on the 'whip the thew ' theory. Director SS Rajamouli brilliantly portrayed The duo's characters. Ram Charan as fire and NTR as water. SSR showcased them in a way we wanted to/ we expected to . They just nailed their roles. The cameos too have a great, significant role .AnalysisRRR is a film with the content that hits hard and deep, with well conducted scenes and rocking as well as emotional bgms that will make you feel emotional and raise your anger .Brilliant acting by the actors\nExcellent direction BY SSR\nProduction values are at its best\nTop notch cinematography by Senthil\nKumar\nStunning vis-a-vis related songs by MM\nKeeravani\nAmazing VFX\nThe fight scenes are very well shot. It'll\nmake you glued tobthe screens\nhard hitting dialogues esp ' Thokkukuntu\npovale' ( should surge forward)\n'kumbhastalani baddalakodadam' (let's hunt\ndown the lion) such will definitely motivate\nyou .The interval bang is the biggest highlight.Alluri Seeta RamaRaju character portrayed\nby charan with that ramam raghavam song\nis the boon\nClimax contains deep meaning , and can be fulfilled by few people\nEmotional ride with awestruck execution.Positives\nAs described above\nNaatu Naatu songNegatives\nPredictable screenplay\nOver dramatic scenes\nEven after whipping the thew , he remains\nstill , which is the trademark of SSR.More importance to character 'Bheem' in\nthe ramam raghavam song which was\nactually designed for Ram Charan.That's it..... Nothing else to find in this section.Verdict\nTypes of Theatres doesn't matter when the content is lit. You'll definitely shout during the scenes to express your excitement towards it. No matter what .This is truly a Goosebumps factory, some elements will definitely make you emotional, be it, anger / sorrow, which will throttle your aggression .Literally speaking , in this 3 hrs 6 mins duration, not even a single minute you'll feel bored (My pov). It is an excavation of elevations. Dig it,you'll find an awestruck visuals with elevations and it repeats . Saying it again , the king of storyteller , who has never seen the face of failure and will never, yet delivered another masterpiece . Shouldn't be compared with Bahubali series watch it as RRR you'll enjoy it for sure. #Must Watch.",

Though the story is not as strong as Bahubali but what really gave this movie life is the emotional bonding between the two protagonists that is sure to pull you inHIGHLIGHTS- The entry scenes. Rajamouli has created the top 2 entrances in Indian film industry in one movie\nRam charan's entry stands tall. The way he handled so many people and making it look realistic and how he shows us what ram charan truly is in scene\nNTR's opening- that damn ripped body and ntr's expressions and the use of cgi by mouli sir is too good and also the setting\nTHE SETS- you can see the huge darn sets making them look authentic and aesthetic at the same time\nTHE SONGS- each song is a gem in its own reference portraying and elevating the scene to higher emotional bounds and the one which stands out is of course naatu naatu . The choreographer did the job of his life time. The coordination and the mass . Just too good\nAnd my second favourite scene after ram charan's entry is the interval bang- DAMN VFX AND NTR's entry. THE HUGE SCALE FIGHTS OMG JUST A FEAST\nMediocre- though some character standout in the movie other than leads like ram's uncle, malli, Scott or Jenny the main cameos of Ajay Devgan and Aalia were weak and not so captivating\nThe story is not so great but is enough to keep us engaged\nUNDERWHELMING ASPECTS-\nThe last 20 mins- though there were some great sequences like the lead's reunion ram charan's portrayal of Rama and the blast of the governed building which were very well executed, the Vfx and the prison break scenes made me cringe\nThe bridge scene though is a nice scene the under water running was a drag\nSometimes the Vfx made it look cartoonish\nBUT STILL ACTION SCENES IN INDIA LIKE NEVER BEFORE, entertaining acting and dances\nAND RAM CHARAN'S ENTRY IS A BENCH MARK I DONT THINK WILL BE SURPASSED FOR A LONG TIME\nA TRUE BIG SCREEN EXPERIENCE.",

These things are very well written but by the end it didn't last an inpression. And the movie is too long as well\nSo i would have loved it if the movie ended after bhin escapibg and a spoiler scene of ram in jail and bhim meeting sita.. Another 1hr30min long movie couldve been adapted of that last 20min scene.That's my only concern. Still the movie is great. But Bahubali 2 is still better....",

Rajamouli is a clown who uses CG and VFX to make unrealistic actions which pulls you out of the movie and it looks comedy then.2) No realism except at some portion.3) Quick wrapup with unreal twists such as ram wife came suddenly and met bheema to tell the back story, likewise.As rajamouli has 30% profit stake in the movie. He went to each and every platform to promote the movie which is ridiculous as after making such movie , going like beggar to get the promotion. Really worst thing he did like a keech. He just sticks his nose everywhere. Worst director..totally worst.Overally, the movie can be seen because of the story and lead roles acting but be ready to have some fake CG things and fake actions in between. Rest, the story will keep you most of the time except the portion where fake unrealistic actions or CG things come.P. S.

Bonkers.# Joyride most of the time. Just dont expect to much.Negative parts# Story get boring and stupid around the middle.# Stuntmen/filler extras behind the fighting scenes acts super stupid, many times they are just running across the screen doing absolutely nothing at all. Some of them also look really tired after a few runs.# Stupid officers, giving stupid orders.# To many stupid 10 reviews on this site.# Its far from perfect and has alot of wierd writing and dialogue.If you forget that this is a movie for a while and just imagine it as a rollercoaster of action... then its really enyoyable and fun ride.",

The writer also took issue with the promotion of outdated and toxic societal systems, specifically the caste system, through the portrayal of characters.

Not that i didn't have fun watching, but the politics was so obvious that it took me out of the campy enjoyment.A tale we'll told but not one that I share many values with. The dance battle with the white guys being put to shame was a highlite. The slow mo animal release at the big party was iconic and I haven't see such longing gazed between two male characters since I canceled my Menatplay account.

The idea that they both befriended their enemy due to being two powerful eccentric men doesn't feel forced. The onscreen chemistry between actors is fantastic. The ending is a surprise, to learn that the plan with the tiger (from 2 hours ago by that point) was to be used to disrupt a British party, and that the other character was not a bad person all along. It's how a twist ending should be. I am on my third watch-through of this movie and am just as interested as the first time.

That really reminded the freedom struggle, fighting spirit of Indians and slavery awareness. Literature like poetry played a major role in freedom struggle and it is perfectly combined in this movie. This is the best scene of bheem for me but Rama raju didnt get equal scene in this . But dont know why people said Rama raju character dominated! Both the characters had their own Strengths.I thought Bheem hunting the wild animals only to eat but pre Interval scene brought huge surprise.Last song about our freedom fighters is superrr ending :)Ramaraju preferring helping bheem's aim than the word he gave to his father is really good point because his father's indirect aim is freedom.Sacrificing scenes by friends around Interval scenesMinus:\nDuring Naatu naatu song, Britisher said their variety of dances but both heroes shown them mass dance: Is there nothing in Indian dances other than mass dance? Kuchipudi,Bharathnatyam,Kathakali and almost each classical dance per two states on average. This could be the movie that rehype our traditional dances.During mid of the movie, should say too much of action scene or less dialogues scene. An important communication is missing between the friends. But may be there could be no story if face to face dialogue scene happen.The point of being a police under british rule is irrelevant and also the aim of Ramaraju is also looked needless stuff. Guns, Rifles, and culverin are not only Weapons. Stones were sharpened to use as weapon those days. At climax we saw bow and arrow which was highly used as weapon in out puranas. Mace was also a weapon but dont why rajamouli wants to highlights guns as only weapon.Few of Goosebumps Climax fight scenes already displayed in trailer makes me predictable about climax scenes and not much surprising the way they faced challenges at that points.Rajamouli showed the brutality of British rulers,police or bullying britishers that time but the revenge didnt look that satisfying even at climax. Should have been scenes were Rulers were scared. Few scenes like Indians terrorizing Britishers could have been satisfying.",

            "content": "Grand scale production, highly curated screenplay, and adrenaline rush editing; possibly the best mass entertainer of the year. Director S. S. Rajamouli's signature slow-motion cut swiftly takes the audience on an adventurous journey for three hours with the movie promising to live up to the hype.Direction: Rajamouli is one of those Indian directors who presents simplistic elements of the story with a creative and intriguing scale of production. With RRR, the director also showcases what it is like to experience a fictional story based on real characters. It is to be noted that both leading characters, played by Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr., never really crossed paths in Indian history. But the scale of imagination and fictional elements that are presented in RRR will definitely make the audience emotional; especially if you are familiar with Indian history.Screenplay: The film was delayed several times and took almost five years to successfully make it to the big screen. Curation of every scene with minute details and well-integrated continuity is something that will amaze you about RRR. Unlike Rajamouli's previous Bhahubali films, RRR minimises the use of over the top action scenes and instead focuses on the emotional elements of the characters. While the movie is three hours long, Rajamouli and the team managed successfully to make the audience enjoy every bit of the film.Cinematography: The amount of workflow that has gone into RRR's light settings, set design, and creation is unimaginable. As an avid still photographer, who has worked on a few regional films in the past, I can say that it is a lifetime opportunity for a cinematographer to work on such grand-scale projects. K. K. Senthil Kumar's cinematography does make RRR special with the use of a large-format ARRI Alexa LF camera and prime lenses. Every action scene, conversation, and character close-ups really make it feel real with Kumar's highly evolved cinematography. Kumar has been a long time associate of Rajamouli and has previously worked with him on several films including Chatrapati, Baahubali: The Beginning, and Baahubali: The Conclusion.",

This film deserves multiple Oscar nominations.If Inglorious Basterds, Lagaan and John Wick had a baby this would be it. This is my favorite movie of 2022 and yes it's even better than Everything, Everywhere All at Once which I loved.It's a story that navigates the lines of friendship, family and duty like I've never experienced before. The story seems like something composed by Shakespeare, but without the tragedy.Although the film is half english/hindi I didn't even realize I was reading subtitles through most of the film. I was drawn so deep into the characters, their stories and their love for each other I was glued to the screen.My only complaint and why I score a 9/10 is the sound. It didn't feel like I was getting the actual dialogue and characters voices were being dubbed although I did watch it in the original audio.",

S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British RajFull action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..\nCinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it\n2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..\nI give 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece.",

The crafty, creative carver that SS Rajamouli is, armed with trusted lieutenants, takes his time and never fails to impress. RRR is not just a mass entertainer, but suffice to say that in depressing times, it remains one of the few positive points to feel proud as a Telugu guy and a film fan. The grandiose visual spectacle, the cinematography and the taking, the slow build-up backed by adrenaline pumping music, the Ramayana epic theme - all hallmarks of the director are extremely impressive. Ram Charan and Jr NTR stand out in their respective defining roles - iconic, flawless. The ensemble cast also dished out their best. A jam-packed theatre on a week day with crying babies, shouting fans and deeply immersed audience - for once it harked back to pre-covid times. I'd certainly watch the film again!",

My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi \"here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO\" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of \"f the Brits\" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it's totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career! (If only Aamir Khan was here, 5 stars easy).",

Action choreography - Again better than anything i have seen in an Indian Epic movies. It is also the biggest strength of the movie. Action so grandiose that it's gonna thrill you and fill you with cheer. 4- Music- Again absolutely brilliant - It's the music that sets the tone and atmosphere of the movie before the whole scene really kicks in.

In hindsight, I'm glad I did but I realize that you must suspend all belief about what makes sense in life or in movies and just accept what you're seeing, not judging. Just follow the story. There will be time to assess what you experienced once its over. And that's where I'm at now.The film is schlocky, jerky, fast pace and entertaining all at once. It probably is too long - - there are definite slow spots throughout, and there is gratuitous violence to the point it almost seems comical, (well it actually is comical in many scenes now that I think about it), and I guess that's the point on some level. In the end, this isn't a story that carries a strong message of morality, (after all one of the key goals achieved here is to return home with enough guns to kill all the British who have taken over their country.), No, this is just a good old fashion blood bath.",

            "content": "I have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because it's not comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently. But I can say that this is how you do it right for large-scale, big-budget action movies. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses them well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three-hour runtime flies by is that the action is so good. I complain a lot about lackluster action in modern action movies, so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters are all I could criticize it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three-hour runtime.",

He was away from his homeland for many years like Rama, who has a fiance named Sita. A girl who has been in the center point like in Ramayana and the British Palace is signified as Lanka. And the parting away of Rama and Sita and the long waiting for Sita beautifully blended into the storyline. Apart from that, we can literally see Ramcharan wearing a Kesari Dhoti and firing arrows like Lord Rama. The picturization of that scene is whistling-worthy.Character Bheem: On the other hand, Bheem is signified as one of the Pandavas (5 Brothers in Mahabharat), Bheema. He has immense strength and can fight with a tiger and lift a motorbike with his hand. He also acted as a messenger between Ram and Sita just like Hanuman but again if you remember both Bheema and Hanuman are sons of Vayu (The God of Wind).",

Ram and bheem's friendship is not only endearing but the memorable one . It's hard to not feel for them. The Nattu Nattu sequence is one of the most enjoyable dance sequence ever. The Background music is phenomenal . MM keeravani elevates the proceedings with his pulse pounding score . All the Rasas flows seamlessly into each other. At the end I just craved for more .",

Big Stars like Ramcharan, NTR Jr. & Alia (Alia to some extent only) who delivered solid performances.2. Great story-telling & relevance to pre-independence era.3.

Alia bhat's performance is average and can be said the role was not required either. Ajay Devgan's bold voice is thrilling though.

Rajamouli once again proves that he is a master at showcasing emotions. The way he designed, adapted, and executed the period drama is stunning. The box office numbers in Telugu will speak for itself and barring a slightly slow pace in the second half and dull episode of Ajay Devgan, RRR has everything to become a blockbuster at the box office and is a film that should be watched only on the big screen.",

Luckily it has garnered a lot of attention and it was easier to suggest to watch after being nominated for an Oscar. It really does live up to the hype and there's a reason top directors are raving about it. It is Bollywood in its technical sense, but it is so much more with its over the top action and one of the greatest bromances of the ages. Since it is in essence a bollywood film it is fairly long at just over 3hr, there are several musical numbers (all of which we enjoyed thoroughly and still singing a day after), and there's some unnecessary exposition that can get into trope territory, but nothing atrocious or that stands out from the rest of the over the top almost campy vibe. It may not be perfect for all audiences but I think most will enjoy it. When my wife and I started it we were worried about making it through the run time, but we were surprised how interesting and fun the whole movie was. There were several times that I thought I was watching the best scene and it just kept getting better all the way through. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a fun epic to get lost in. And if u can't make it through in one sitting there is a good stopping place around the half way mark.9.1/10.",

I logged off at work early in the evening, made myself two bowls of popcorn at home and streamed RRR on my laptop, completely detaching myself from the outside world because I was in much need of a break. At first, I thought I would get bored since the movie was more than three hours long but the way it captivates the attention of the audience, you won't feel that the film was stretched.The best part I liked about the film was the unpredictability. There are a lot of twists in the plot; someone you think is a bad person might end up being a good person. The movie had a good storyline and was brilliantly portrayed on screen. After all, it's a SS Rajamouli film and having watched Bahubali, I knew I won't be disappointed watching RRR.The best part of Rajamouli's films is that the main characters play a role larger than life. Set in pre-independent India, the movie revolves around two young men, each with their own motive to fight again the British meets each other, and become the best of friends till one of them reveals their secrets and gets betrayed. The film takes a sharp turn after that and some more secrets are revealed; you would basically need to watch it for yourself to understand the plot twists.While giving the movie all the credits where it is due, at some parts, I feel that it was over-dramatic. For example, a venomous snake bites one of the main heroes, Rama and it is said that he would die in 24 hours because there are no known antidotes. A man from the same village gives the antidote to Rama just the next minute and in less than five minutes, he becomes fit and is ready to fight. In another scene, Bheema receives whiplash for conspiring against the British Government and he is seen bleeding and exhausted from the beatings but the next moment, the scars vanish and he is fit again. The way the main characters magically recover from any injury within a few minutes is something really funny but I guess that's how movies work!",

Before the movie started I was so sleepy yet when it's finished I was totally awake. Every minute of the 3h deserves appreciation. I will definitely watch it twice!!!I like the background stories of the two guys - In Chinese we always call a country as \"country\" + \"family\" - and it was the thing here. When a country is in trouble, nobody can be sheltered - each household need to fight for the country.As a country once invaded by others, so many things made me cry for many times when watching. At one moment I was expecting the whole Indian to attack the british gov together, holding the whole scene to the next stage but ended up with them two to get all things done. It's over Marvel in a very positive meaning - Marvel is human pretend to be superman, they're supermen in the shells of human beings.Well done!!! And I regretted so much that I couldn't see the team in person last week in the theater!!! Wait for you guys in next master piece!!",

It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose.

Finally Indian cinema is looking back at its cultural roots for new inspirations rather than looking at West.

I was luck to watch the movie in Telugu to witness senseless narration where the protagonist raging non-Telugu speaking bystanders with Telugu folk songs.The movie was dominated with loud sound and unnecessary actions (I understand, if there is nothing else to show, use VFX as safety).The worst part is the music. For a movie of a scale like this, why can't SS Rajamouli look beyond archaic M. M Keeravani, seriously? The music was as disappointing as in #Bhahubali. I mean, have to ever heard anyone playing/listening to Bhabubali (now RRR) songs in a party, family gathering, or an individual chilling out in a park? I pay to get entertained, the production house keeping the money in-house ain't gonna cut it (for context: Keeravani and Rajamouli are cousins). The only song, 'Natu Natu' got popular because of Ram and NTR's dance. Just imagine this song without that dance! Bad, really bad.Ram Charan met the expectations as an under performer. Although, I must say, Jr. NTR was phenomenal. Perhaps the savior for the movie.SS Rajamouli is certainly a better movie director than a lot of others in the Telugu cinema industry. But, by no stretch a great one. Box-office collection does not bonify once talent. I would say, Trivikram and Sukumar are 'technically' more talented.#RRRMovie sheer disappointment.",

They kept their heart/soul & blood for the characters. The rest of the team were okay for their roles.Let's talk abt the story, I (my point of view) somewhere felt the story is been VERY THIN / DILUTED compared to the star cast. As we all know it's really hard for SSR on balancing the best actors from the industry, and as they are not only actors but the representatives of two big families. Still, the captain balanced the characters RAM/BHEEM, they both dominated the Story and stole the show. BGM/DOP/FIGHTs are excellence.RAM opening fight/BHEEM intro scene & TIGER fight/Pre Interval/ Pre Climax / Ram transformation to ALLURI / BHEEM innocence / Emotions through out the film are main assets.Story is a little back drop as said, both RC & NTR dominated the complete story.VFX is really good. Visuals are outstanding, SSR is next level.Verdict: 4/5\nCan watch twice for their hard work. Repeated audience are guaranteed for RRR.Final word:\nSSR films are slow poison, it will hit the bulls eye for sure.",

            "content": "The long wait has ended with the release of SS Rajamouli' magnum opus 'RRR' . Not only has it surged the value for multiplex' stocks, but has also managed to mint coins with ease. Though in the first few hours of its release there has been a fruitless effort by , perhaps North Indian losers or perhaps jobless pricks I reckon. The movie is set in pre - Independence era of British Raj in India and revolves around Komaram Bheem from Adilabad and Alluri Sita Rama Raju from Visakhapatnam agency area.The story begins with a little girl of gond tribe who's forcefully snatched from her tribal parents who are naive and unaware of the ways of Evil British Empire. On the other hand A. Rama Raju , working in the imperial police force strives to prove his loyalty to the empire. But why? That forms the crux of the story. There's not a scene you'd want to miss. Every frame has been crafted with utmost care and love for art , be it the 1920s New Delhi , the costumes or the vibe of colonial era as a whole. Little touch of humour that has been added does the job well without making it seem like an awkward retrofit as in the case of Radheshyam. The humour episode does a really good job in aiding the story. Portrayal of a naive yet determined Komaram Bheem by NTR is impeccable. I doubt if you could stop yourself from, atleast tapping your foot during NAATU NAATU song. Such is the music and choreography-- Electrifying!! If bromance had to have a synonym it would be bromance of Rama Raju and Bheem . Those who brag about Chandler and Joe from friends, it's time your so called \" bromance\" leave the Dias. When things seem cool in the first half, you shall witness a mind-blowing interval face off between the duo, the VFX are too notch. This scene would clarify why there was a tiger in the trailer. Like every other SS Rajamouli' film , here you'll be left with a gripping interval sequence.Post interval, the film gets a step higher. Oh how could I forget such brilliant performance by Ram Charan who was once ridiculed as ' wooden face '. In most of the scenes, it was his eyes that acted and oh boy! They would make you cry. He delivered his best to project the moral dilemma experienced in punishing his own friend and the realisation which , at a later stage causes a metamorphosis. Though some self proclaimed critics have cried about less screen time for Alia ( RamaRaju's love interest ) and Ajay Devgan, I'd gracefully show them a finger to assure how worthless their opinions are. Rajamouli has reached a new level of perfection when it comes to paying attention to minute details, be it the use of light and shadowsl as an aid in story telling , symbolism in the second & bits of first half and using elements of nature to set the theme for a character or a scene in general. Well this bit is something that Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki have been known for, so far, but now I take pride in saying SS Rajamouli has made his own mark in this sphere. His method of story telling is beyond impressive and way beyond any Indian director could ever get close to. The climax is a complete theatre experience and here, my fellow men and women, SSR has put all his talent, skill to glue audience to the screens. One can't help but rejoice with tears of pride, happiness crawling down their cheeks as Rama Raju in his full attire, guerrilla gear and Bheem take down the British troops in a sequence that will leave you at the edge of the seats. Background score is a big add on, & every track fits the situation. As mentioned previously, SSR has upgraded his game. One could fall short of words to review this film any further. A humble request to those watching it in theaters -- sit back for the post credits scene.PS: SS Rajamouli is the king, torch bearer of Indian Cinema. And if there's any self proclaimed king kha.... Errr , stay put kid!!",

The CGI was very good in some places but looked weak in some places like in case of animals. But this can be totally ignored as the story is too good to you even noticing those small details.The bgm of the movie is my favourite.This movie lengths nearly 3hour but you didn't even for a single moment feel bored the cinematography and screenplay is just so engaging.And the best you can enjoy this Mass entertainer with your family without any worries.\ud83d\udd25\nFrom me its highly recommend.",

But under a budget of 150 Cr. It was appreciable, it was also the time of COVID so it's understandable)\n*Defies Physics (See I know it's the case in most of the movies, I thought of not even considering it but one or two scenes just made me think 'How's this even possible?'\n*Quick Health recovery (When Ram gets bit by snake Bheem uses 'jadibuti' for his quick recovery also when he was injured severely by British but one scene which completely made no sense to me was when Bheem was brutalised in public, it was shown to us in such a brutal manner that it seemed he could barely stand but it's seen that the very next day when he was to be prosecuted he gets completely recover and is able to fight the British with complete ease, this didn't make even a bit of sense to me.)That's it folks.

Secondly, I would like to highlight the amazing choreography that was shown throughout the entire movie, from the first second I felt each and every hit they received and it felt so gosh darn real! For example, when General Scott leaped out of the car and took that last-second shot to flip the car was incredible and will go down in history as the greatest piece of cinematography EVER!!I'd also like to point out the INSANE CGI that went into this production every animal that I saw on screen looked so realistic and they felt so real. I would like to add the fact that this has inspired me to join the World of Warcraft club and I finally have the confidence to take a step into the real world to face my fears head-on.I enjoyed this more than Fortnite Chapter 3.",

Shot composition was too good which is one aspect I always appreciate in SSR movies. The use of the foreground in the earlier frames of this spectacle subtly taught us about the environment we are being transported to. Cinematography by Senthil truly blew my mind, the use of rack focuses was very unique in a minimal way. To emphasize SSRs vision, Senthil grasped the landscapes of the rural, industrial, and british raj settings of historical India using establishing shots and aerial views innovatively. The team did great work during post-production (color correction) as the warm hue that glazed the screen made everything feel that much more Indian. CGI might be my own gripe but considering the budget every penny was used effectively. Regardless, SSR knows how to immerse us into the emotional baggage of the storytelling, making us forget we are looking at CG elements altogether. An example of SSR and Senthils collaborative eye for detail was the precision of the dust after Ram beats his punching bag, ensuring the specular highlights glared off of the environment (Ram, punching bag and every spec of dust) making us feel the weight of Ram's punches.",

            "content": "Alluri Sita Ramaraju n Khomuram Bheem were simple but PERFECT! Our Ram Charan Tej and Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao lived up to their namesakes and gone even beyond. They gave performances of a lifetime! Tarak anna portrayed the emotion-packed Bheem and his innocent eyes with such heft. Charan anna depicted rage, superiority and resilience with immense nuance. Both complement each other beautifully but for some reason that 0.00000001 edge, I feel like Ram took. This is coming from an unbiased standpoint since I'm an NTR fan first and an RC fan second BUT Ram Charan has scaled in such a way he deserves that praise. He has come a long way and improved like crazy. There is a certain nuance to his acting that can't be beat. NTR as usual delivered perfectly without missing a SINGLE beat.Overall, the themes of the film (such as Brotherhood, Persistence and Hope) were consistent and very human, rendering the emotional connect that much more real. Finally, the Hindu Mythology parallels and symbolisms were seamlessly embedded in RRR, enhancing the nativity of OUR Alluri Sita Ramaraju n Khomuram Bheem revolution.10/5 speaking as a fan and 4.8/5 speaking critically and unbiased. Jakkannas vision and effort deserves all the praise. Exceeded my expectations!",

Which is not case with bollywood, they always manage to find ways to hurt sentiments and promoting Islamic agenda with every movie, web series or ads.You can't find a boring moment in over 3 hour length movie , even after finishing you crave for more, that's I'm sure fulfill by it's sequal. In acting Ram Charan & NT Rama rao gives their till date best performance. Ajay Devgan create deep impact on full movie with his short role. Alia has nothing substantial to do in movie, also looks misfit for serious roles. Ray Stevenson looks impressive as Scott. Mark Bennington always do justice for his role.Every frame is so big that it should be watch only on big screen. Actions of the film are over the top at par with Bahubali.I suggest it's a must watch with family.",

They've done a fantastic job in bringing the characters of Ram and Bheem on screen. Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt are in a brief but meaningful role and they've delivered their part nicely. Music and bgm are absolutely fantastic. Songs have been written in a very meaningful way and each of them elevates specific sequences and tells us more about the story, characters and the emotions portrayed throughout the movie.

From the opening credits I was riveted by the color, the speed, and the audacity of the special effects. Slow motion never looked so good. The main characters are larger than life, as bullet proof as Superman, and never stop moving. Bad guys are dispatched in greater numbers than any John Wick movie but in more ways than you can imagine. John Wick may have killed three bad guys with a pencil but the two heroes in RRR blew up a 100,000 sq. Ft. Building with a motor cycle and an arrow. Beautifully filmed, the movie builds to a glorious gut wrenching ending battle that would make any American blockbuster hide their head in shame. Its 3 hour and 5 minute length allows the plot to unfold slowly and deliberately but it never dragged. This Indian drama is an artistic masterpiece.

            "content": "While the Bheem-Malli thread is Rhapsodic, Rama Raju is Resilient in his underplayed character and with the master story-teller #Rajamouli at the helm, the final output is Riveting...#NTR gets into the skin of his character as usual.. while he is innocent in his camaraderie with Ram Charan and his scenes with Olivia Morris in the first half, he's ferocious in his introduction scene as well as his confrontation scenes with Ram Charan in the later parts...#RamCharan gets an opportunity to showcase variations in his role and the way he holds all the intense emotions in his eyes until he unleashes himself in the captivating climax is spell binding.. it's not an easy task to match the magnanimity of NTR on screen and Rajamouli manages to balance both lead actors.. after all, he has played a key role in their successful careers and he extracts their best yet again..I wasn't quite impressed with the audio songs earlier but their presentation on screen was stupendous... as it is always the case with Rajamouli's films, the seasoned musician #Keeravani's BGM is the soul of #RRR...Komaram Bheemudo song is a testimony of NTR's acting prowess and it's among the best episodes of the movie apart from the first 15 min, the interval block and the climax portion...Cinematography by Senthil, Production design by Sibu Cyril, action choreography by Solomon - all technicians deserve an applause for their outstanding work..Every time one thinks #Rajamouli has already delivered his best, he continues to better his unparalleled work... being an epitome of perfection in the world of cinema, he delivers a winner at the box-office yet again...#RRR is the pride of India cinema and the Telugu audience must celebrate it instead of debating as to which of the two lead actors got larger screen space, whose role was better and so on...It's a must watch for all movie lovers cutting across the linguistic borders and genres... my rating is 4.5/5.",

It's refreshing to know there is still thought-provoking cinema being produced out there that doesn't rely on sex or extensive crude humor to sell. What a powerful tale the director weaves, and only more powerful the more you learn of the religious history surrounding the protagonists. Surprisingly for its length, neither time did the movie ever feel like it dragged, but it will tug at your heart strings every time. Amazing acting and choreography, an intense and uniquely vibrant soundtrack, protagonists with some complexity and a great script to work with, endearing and captivating motifs, seemingly mostly consistent set design for the era, and plenty of raw action with splashes of romance! If there's one movie that deserves a big stage and a huge set of speakers, it's RRR! This may become one of top 10 favorite movies of all time!!!",

S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British RajFull action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..\nCinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it\n2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..\nI give 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece\n1204 people found this helpful.",

I loved the acting, the story, the friendship dynamic, the cast, the diversity, and seriously, I could go on. I'm guessing that the people who rated this low did so for one of three reasons: not enough romance, \"basic\" storyline, or they just wanna be different. Contrary to popular belief, I kinda liked that the focus of the story was not on romance, and in my opinion, that's what made this movie stand out from the rest. Just to clarify: there is romance, it's just not the main focus of the movie. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but trust me, if you're kinda bored, and you wanna check out a movie with an interesting plot, action with a sprinkle of romance, and with an amazing cast, you most likely won't be disappointed.Edit : The reason I didn't give RRR a 10/10 is simply because the pacing seemed a bit slow at times.

Sometimes extra effects also not really making sense and does not look real. In a nutshell, movie is good to watch but not a memorable movie.I would have given 10 stars if they would have made a movie with little less extra effects and more towards story and acting.

The dramatic slowmotion, sing & dances, you'll find it everywhere especially the slowmo BUT SOMEHOW the RRR team manage to change every 'bad' stereotypical because i couldn't find any unnecessary slowmo, but I found a lot of breathtaking scene & plot instead! I missed lots of details by checking my phone for few second so i don't recommend it \ud83d\ude02 it's worth your 3h5mins i swear!It's just the dubbing that happened to not match the mouth movement that bothers me a bit (i searched and found that it was dubbed on several dialect? Maybe because of that but Cmiiw)I'm happy to say RRR is one of my favorite movie of the year!",

The movie depicts the emotional connect of a father and son (Ram and his father), friendship, romance between Ram and Situ which are in fact Hindu dieties in India married to each other. Excellent action sequences - one where Ram plots Bheem and Malli's escape the fight scenes are a delight to watch. Each actor even the support actors acted beautifully.
