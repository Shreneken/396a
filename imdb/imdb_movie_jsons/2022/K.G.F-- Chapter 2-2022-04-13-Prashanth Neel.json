            "content": "\"Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet.\" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.",

Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie. Better I recommend them to watch love story/ Family Sentiment movies rather than Action Movies like KGF Chapter 2.Ps: The spoiler is Achyuth Kumar, who played the role of Gurupandian is the main Antagonist, not Sanjay Dutt.",

            "review_title": "An improvement over the original in the technical aspects, but not the writing! [+53%]",
            "content": "K. G. F: Chapter 2 is a film that purely runs on technical finesse. There are impressively staged set-pieces, sophisticated production design, a pan-Indian (and possibly international) plot setup, and thumping background score. But the writing, something that didn't work for me in Chapter 1, is still very superficial. In Chapter 2, Rocky (Yash, with commanding screen presence) is no longer an underdog. He has already achieved legendary levels of notoriety with his deeds, even attracting the attention of the nation's Prime Minister. Prashanth Neel is great at crafting mass moments one after the other, in quick succession. The film, as a whole, is a carefully designed collection of mass moments - with frequent interludes of mother-son sentiment and a drab romance.In my review for Chapter 1, I'd hoped to see Srinidhi Shetty get at least a decent arc but alas, it's even worse than the first. Not only is she deemed mere entertainment for the protagonist, her only task in the film is to say the three magical words to the guy who's been holding her captive (Stockholm Syndrome max?). Okay, I get it. My bad to even think she'd have anything worthwhile to do in the film other than \"spoilers: die while pregnant\". The mother-son flashbacks are as weird as they can get - she whines and delivers a whole massy sermon to hospital personnel when her son is battling for life. I couldn't even buy the reason for Rocky's excessive greed - it's an attempt at painting him grey alright, but it's not written well. Neel shouldn't ever attempt family dramas or rom-coms. Like, ever.Sanjay Dutt's Adheera has got the look for sure, but the nature of his character is so utterly generic that he fails to rise above Chapter 1's Garuda. Raveena Tandon's PM Ramika Sen should have been the film's trump card, but the whole angle around her is played in the safest possible manner, giving Rocky a few more instances of elevation. The mass film tropes are scattered all over the place. But if you need a filmmaker to inventively visualize your action, Neel is the man you should call. Maybe, he can make a full-blown actioner (where the core focus is just on the action) without the build-ups, the monologues, or the exaggerated sentiments. I'd definitely buy a ticket to that film!",

            "review_title": "KGF - Chapter 2 is The Super-Duper Blockbuster Movie of 2022 !!!",
            "content": "KGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.",

The dialogues are great once again, Performances from Yash, Sanjay Dutt & Raveena Tandon were superb. Great Cinematography & Music that evokes the emotions. The romantic angle is better in this one & the great emotional bond of Mother & Son is once again central to the plot. But there are big issues in screenplay & editing. Instead of the streamlined story of the first film, this one stretches in so many directions & it becomes really tough to keep up with it. A lot of scenes abruptly end & I expected the ending to be much more powerful. A great effort but ultimately falls short of expectations.",

It's the kind of ego massaging movies he relies on. Back to the movie. Unlike Bahubali I did not connect with this movie primarily because the Hindi dubbing and dialogues was of low quality. The sephia look made the movie drab. Sanjay Dutt borrowed his look from the Vikings tv series and had moments of Agneepath's Kancha Cheena in him. Raveena Tandon as PM was decent, I feel Vidya Balan would have been better. Yash in the main role, didn't have to over extend himself in the department of acting or expression cause all throughout it was the same with minute variations. Cockiness made relating with the character difficult. So if you an impressionable person this movie might appeal to your senses, as for me I dont understand what all the hullabaloo is about.",

            "review_title": "The perfect mass masala superstar vehicle!",
            "content": "OMG. What did I just watch! KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film's success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.We rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic \"Garuda\" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda's vengeful uncle \"Adheera\" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India \"Ravika\" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash's sheer swag and star power.The void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as \"Vanaram\", Harish Rai as \"Khasim\", Achyuth Kumar as \"Guru Pandian\" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky \"office assistant\". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai's love interest \"Reena\", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.Prashant Neel's ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai's childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.Prashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash's natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer's strengths. While Neel uses Dutt's eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India's Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.And what can I say about Yash that hasn't been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of \"Sulthana\" to the emotionally wrought \"Thannane\".\"KGF Chapter 2\" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like \"Pushpa (2021)\" and \"RRR (2022)\" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don't forget to catch the post-credits scene!",

It's bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it's nothing but an Action Junky's dream come true.Regardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn't fully sold on it.Halt the hate train and just let me clarify...I have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as \"Adheera\". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.Now when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don't get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it's just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.For Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It's her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she's fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.Looking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don't get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!I'm telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it's truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense.",

            "content": "Finally decided to watch the second part after all the hype even after finding first part to be just average. Thought the director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong it's worse now.The movie starts with the entry of our Rocking Star Yash with a BGM and they Forgotted to off that BGM throught the film. BGM plays on throughout the whole movie yeah it's good but after one points it's just unbearable and can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is a BGM. Then the film proceeds to have 20 more entry scenes of Yash till the end of the movie. Everyone comes praises Rocky then disappear oh gosh. The second half bores you in place of being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously don't care about. The romance seems very forced just to make Rocky Bhai furious enough to kill Adheera.The action sequences are just as poorly edited as the first part the most awkward is the car chase scene where it continuously blacks out for no reason dude show it clearly it's a action movie after all. The action in other parts is also medicore and again fast paced with many cuts. The supporting actors are there just for the sake of it. Sanjay Dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time and no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by Rocky Bhai easily. Raveena is decent in her role but again not much importance given to her . Plus the movie is filled with many absurd scenes which don't make any sense.Overall the second part is even worse than first and only cinematography can't save a bad film infact i founded the first part to have better colours and better frames than this. How are people calling this mess a masterpiece is beyond my understanding. It's just too much to take. Chapter 3 is also coming which I'm not even tiny bit interested about after this movie's experience.",

            "content": "I am from South India and I am used to a lot of so-called 'mass commercial' movies which have a ton of illogical heroism and gravity-defying fights which I really hate. The thing that set apart KGF 1 from those sorts of movies was the fact that the movie made sense and it did not really feel out of the world.I cannot say the same with KGF 2. It was so disappointing. The movie is nothing but hero worship throughout the span of the movie.Some scenes of this movie did not make any sense at all, they assumed that the viewers are of low IQ and not able to reason whatever they show in the movie.Some scenes like the hero using a helicopter as a fan for the heroine were so cringe! (BTW, who in the world dries pappad in front of a Bungalow!). Then there was this scene when the villain asks the doctor retrieving bullets from his body to keep a metal piece in his body to feel the pain! Bruh!The hero worship even goes to the baby hero! There is a scene towards the end of the movie when the hero's mom takes a baby hero to a hospital with pneumonia. The doctor instructs her to take the child to a better hospital in the city, to which she responds with some heroic dialogue as if it is a super baby! It was so cringy.The heroine character is useless in this movie. Just for the sake of the tradition of Indian movies that there should be a heroine! There is no use for her in the storyline at all, both in KGF 1 and 2! When the villain killed her, I was actually glad that I do not have to see her cringe scenes again!After the villain is killed in the movie, the hero's enemy is the Government of India. They made it look like India is some third-world country with a clownish military! Beyond this point, the hero himself was acting more like a terrorist and I really would have felt better if he was killed! Because he was led by nothing but selfishness to keep the so-called 'promise' he gave to his late mom! He becomes akin to the villain of KGF 1. He does not care about the people who work under him and constantly pushes them to dig more and more gold!There is a scene where the mentor of the hero questions him about the purpose of what he is doing and how he is any different from Garuda. (KGF 1 villain). The response from the hero is something lame inline of the promise he has to keep and for that he will do whatever it takes! All of a sudden, everyone's mind is changed and they are Ok with whatever he is doing!Some other things which I noted are that everyone has a gun in the movie unless and until there is a fight with the hero. In that case, they will come running with some knives and axes! And the hero conveniently takes one of them and stabs everyone else to death!The BGM used in this movie was nowhere near KGF 1 and I never felt any goosebumps! BGM was not cleverly used in this movie.The much-discussed black screens during some shots also felt really weird!Whatsoever, the movie has grossed some 1000 Crores or more and it shows how a movie does not have to be really good or logical to be a blockbuster. It only has to please the majority. These sorts of movies are generally meant for the low IQ audience and children who doesn't question the logic behind the scenes and the storyline. And it has worked.Whoever sharing any opinions against this movie are being canceled here in India and being called an anti-national!",

Raveena Tandon is another factor to watch put for because her stern character was hell of a surprising delight. Coming to mass scenes, although most of them did not land well for me..Rocky's entry, return etc where top notch scenes which are not to be missed.Length is the biggest factor that drags the movie back.

            "content": "Huge fan of Chapter 1, which had much more direct plot and gave Rocky a good character arc, while still making him appear like a very cunning, gray character. Chapter 2 has a fast-paced screenplay too, but it collapses under the weight of all the characters and story that has to be packed in. Rocky doesn't have very much room to grow as a character and is overall just a vessel to deliver elevation scenes. However, in Chapter 2 the elevation scenes don't land nearly as well as the movie lacks the emotional depth of the first. When the screenplay is shifting from place to place quickly and rushing through plot points, there is not much room to setup stakes and emotional payoff, which is this film rings hollower than Chapter 1. Chapter 1's first half is basically how all of Chapter 2 plays out, except the novelty of style and new characters from Chapter 1 is gone since Chapter 2 is the sequel.This movie has 3 very powerful villains on paper, but Adheera and Inayat Khalil are underwhelming on screen. Ramika Sen is a good adversary to Rocky, but comes a bit too late in the story. Even though Garuda never met or fought Rocky in Chapter 1, he was mounted as a much scarier villains than the antagonists in Chapter 2.Also, surprisingly KGF 2 is light on action, especially in the first half, as Rocky is not fighting as much anymore. That being said, the scale of the action, the cinematography and overall stakes are better in Chapter 2. The ending if somewhat predictable, but it is nice that the narrators of Chapter 2 add more mystery to the how real Rocky's mythos is, which makes Chapter 2 a little more interesting in that regard.Chapter 1 built a great platform for Chapter 2, but Chapter 2 does not concern itself with delivering on the massive hype for its 3 villains, further developing Rocky's character or raising the emotional stakes. Chapter 2 is instead more of a machine that connects cool set pieces, which are working wonders with mass audiences, but are underwhelming to audiences that connected more deeply with Chapter 1. KGF 2 is better than a fair share of movies, and its success worldwide is also commendable. I just wish it was better.",

            "content": "My ears are still ringing after sitting through 168 minutes of extremely loud & jarring background score. But I must admit the sequel to the ultra-stylish KGF is far better than its predecessor. And we all how bad sequels usually turn out to be. To be honest, I didn't like the first movie even one bit. But Chapter 2, I didn't mind sitting through.Chapter 2 picks up right after the events of Chapter 1. Rocky is now the undisputed king of KGF. But this position comes with its share of enemies and that include the Viking inspired, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt); Prime Minister, Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) among others.KGF has its downsides. First and foremost is the jarring BGM, which literally numbs you for a while post-movie. Then comes the poor shooting skills: despite all the arms training, Rocky's men cannot hit a\ntarget. Adheera is standing front and centre; all his men get shot but Adheera gets shot once on his shoulder (a beautifully shot scene nevertheless). Rocky also sets up the biggest fan for his lady love - using helicopter blades.But Chapter 2 is better in terms of its pacing. After all the setup done in the first, the sequel makes more sense. The stakes are higher, the action set pieces are more extravagant. The 19-year old editor, Ujwal Kulkarni does a very good job. Rocking Star, Yash is as flamboyant as ever. Raveena R Tandon & Sanjay Dutt are good. Prakash Raj replaces Anant Nag as the narrator (maybe they wanted a bigger star in this role). Female lead Srinidhi Shetty doesn't have much to do & her Stockholm Syndrome track doesn't bode too well.Chapter 2 may cause irreversible damage to your ear drums but it is definitely a step up from the first. The final sequence on the ship seemed a bit anticlimactic and the announcement of Chapter 3 was totally unnecessary (better if they end on a high) but go for it if you love mass-y films. Rocking Star Yash's 8 years of hardwork and beard maintenance has paid off.P. S. Find a theatre that is running the Kannada (original version) with Subtitles. Watching it in another language won't give you the full experience.",

The movie is bigger, better and interesting, and even more engaging that the first chapter. The lead characters are commendable in their role. Sanjay Dhatt and Raveena were well introduced in their roles, added the needed spice and interest in the movie. It's amazing that a movie with this budget could hold the scale and execution in such a believable and engaging story. The narrative is well written , characters well acted, well edited, scored, mixed and produced. The movie with the budget could pull a production and execution makes a case study for the film makers as to how to execute and narrate the story. And for that matter director deserves the praise for keeping all the departments well balanced in their respective roles as a film makers. I am sure the film makers across are watching the movie with an awe and an opportunity to research how to make a movie with the scale, execution, acting and overall making of the movie. We have been hearing about a young and bright editor of the movie . I am sure everyone has an eye on him after this movie. The movie excites and eagers us for the next chapter of the great combo of Yash and Prashant's next venture, and we can say the movie is a benchmark and path breaker for the Indian movie industry to learn what can be achieved with the right vision and execution as the movie has rare dull moments but lots of punchlines and treats that keeps the jaws dropping for most parts of the movie\nWhat did not work:\nVery few scenes come to my head as what can and needs to be changed in this movie, making it better than the first chapter. Maybe the love song could have been shortened like other songs but hey who am I to say since the movie works overall for the most part which is quiet rare. So, even with plot holes, if any, movie works big time for the viewers to enjoy the ride.Final verdict: highly recommended.",

            "content": "The ambition of the movie KGF is kind of like its lead character Rocky Bhai which is to conquer whatever is possible. Chapter 1 not only made sure Kannada movie industry on the map, but also led to the start of filmmakers taking pan India releases seriously. This was just because of the sheer quality of dubbing, right partnerships and promotion efforts while releasing in other languages. Finally, when KGF Chapter 2 is hitting the screens 3.5 years after its predecessor the cinema lovers across India also across some parts of the world have embraced it with love. KGF is complex and detailed filmmaking at its best for a gangster action drama. Director Prashant Neel's attention to detail is what makes it stand out from the rest of action/drama movies. With only 3 films under his belt in the last 8 years, it looks like he has already established his brand of filmmaking.While the first part showed us the rise of Rocky bhai after dethroning Garuda in KGF, the plot of the second part is slightly more complex and political. Chapter 2's narration is almost like a biopic of an actual gangster (or should I say monster :P). The movie keeps you hooked frame by frame and almost makes you feel a part of the world of KGF. Cinematography, art direction and the background score elevate almost every scene to a different level. Adheera's introduction scene involving his entry into Rocky's territory starts literally by \"burning bridges\". This is just a sample of many cleverly executed scenes throughout the movie.The dark sepia kind of tone with barely any colourful visuals perfectly suits director's narrative. The action sequences have been executed and edited more like art and haven't gone unnecessarily over the top. One of the fight scenes which is barely relevant to the plot still makes for a great watch just because of the background narration and the camerawork. The dialogue writing continues to impress, and it is one of the best I have seen in Kannada cinema in my lifetime. The songs may seem like almost a continuation of part 1 music, but the visual treatment of them makes you hum and cheer along. There is a brilliant mini recreation of part 1 in the song 'Toofan' and it is probably one of the best example of Neel's genius execution.The KGF franchise has focused a lot on each and individual characters. Irrespective of how big/small the role is almost each of them gets a narration and introduction of their own. This turns out to be both a blessing and a curse, especially in this movie. The character arc for some roles turns out to be slightly abrupt, but I guess it is the sacrifice director must make for the optimal running time. This does not affect Rocky Bhai's character and the evolution from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 is handled seamlessly. Yash's dialogue delivery as Rocky will forever be a trademark of its own. Almost every line of Rocky bhai's character is a punch dialogue and Yash delivers them all in style without seeming to be jarring. He brings shades of Al Pacino from Scarface at times. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera has a great screen presence as an antagonist but somehow his character lacks a strong conflict with the lead and a detailed backstory to establish his purpose better. Srinidhi Shetty does get a longer screen time and she does more than a decent job with very few lines. Her character towards the end turns out to be a bit too mainstream and I believe that was planned by the director keeping a certain section of the audience in mind. Prashant Neel has very cleverly handled Raveena Tandon's dubbing and has not tried to force her lip sync in Kannada. This also serves the purpose of her being in Delhi as the Prime Minister. All other supporting characters contribute their bit to movie's elevating moments. Harish Rai as Chacha is a very well written old school supporting character and hats off to the director for creating a right mix of veteran and new age Kannada movie actors.KGF Chapter 2 is more than just a mass entertainer. It is the perfect artistic execution of the story of a movie and credit has to be given to all its departments. It is an event to witness in one's lifetime and if you are a Kannadiga, you'd be walking out of the theatre beaming with pride.",

            "content": "HONEST REVIEW FROM A NOT A FAN OF YASH!Just like KGF 1, KGF 2 is also extremely over the top so if you were a fan of KGF before , then only choose this film. Just don't go watch KGF 2 just because of the hype and stuff, watch KGF 1 first..see if you liked it then go for 2nd part as this film caters mostly to young audience and die hard fans of masala films.KGF 2 can be easily excused for its over the top nature solely because of some terrific performances and interesting story telling. It is exactly the same storytelling like KGF 1 but director Neel takes it one step above. It is this interesting storytelling that held my attention in part 1 and even now in part 2.The BGM is just earthquake inducing ..it's extremely loud but it's so electrifying that it elevates any scene where Yash would be present. I personally enjoyed the BGM. Dialogues are again those typical chest thumping ones from what you expect from South India. But they are hard hitting and good to hear. Especially from Yash's mother.Filled with tons of whistle/clap worthy scenes be it Yash or Sanju baba both have got some terrific dialogues that induce whistles.Performances. Everyone has done a fantastic job be it the lead or the side actors .Cinematography and setting of this film is just top class. Definitely you can feel the green screen background at places but whats in front of that green screen is just mesmerizing. Rustic and raw looking . The mines are so well set that grayish tone and everything gives that rustic look. Highly impressed.Climax battle is a treat. All hell break loose. That final battle felt like I was watching some battle from some kingdom film where two kings from two kingdoms are fighting. Absolute treat for masala lovers. Fires coming out as Adheera and Rocky proceed to clash is just extraordinary to watch. Full value for money scene.Negatives - a section no 10/10 reviewer would tell you but I'll highlight them. 1. Stretched ending 2. Some hilarious fight sequences. I am not a die hard fan of any south film so when I see such action, it definitely looks super exciting but at the same time definitely makes me laugh at least once. 3. An absolute not needed romantic song in the 2nd half that Unnecessarily increases the length of the film further which already is stretched at the end. 4. In 1st half there is a car chase sequence (that imo looked exactly like the one from the climax of Race 3 lol) . The way it is shot, in start-stop manner , didnt like it. Would have enjoyed a full sequence rather than that start-stop fashion . Also, wait, wait. There is a scene at the very last related to Rocky it looked exactly inspired from James Bond : no time to die ending sequence.Overall, if you are a die hard masala film fan or even if you loved KGF 1, then you cannot miss KGF 2. You pay 200rs or 1700rs for the most expensive cinema, you will feel totally satisfied.PS - I don't glorify/ celebrate films like these.",

This movie does not even come close to the cinematic experience I had in RRR.I found this movie very midiocore.I actually liked the first kgf than this one because in the second half of the first movie we actually see Rocky's character growth. But the reason I didn't connect with him here because I found his character very problematic in this movie. And I tell you why, In last movie he killed main villain Garuda and became hero of all the people who was exploited in gold mines by garuda. But in this movie he does the same he even put the guns in the hands of children for his own benifit. He was misogynist. He kidnapped main female lead and treated like she has no free will whatsoever. With all those flaws this movie constantly glorifying him. This entire movie felt like \"Aarti\" of Rocky Bhai. The biggest missed opportunity in this is movie is that not once we see his self conflict or regret for his actions. I would have liked in the movie if he'd have realised that in pursuit of being the wealthiest person he lost his ways. That's what I liked in first movie he came to kill someone in mines but later his mission becomes the impedance of exploited people in mines. This movie takes total 180 turn to what they established in first movie. Editing of this really bad there cut in every one second you won't know who's punching whom. I have heard so much praise for sunjay Dutt's character in this movie but it was disappointing too, his character was very one dimension he comes at the beginning shows how badass he is and than get his asskicked by Rocky and later comes in the end just to get killed by Rocky. There was not depth to his character they wasted all the build up for his character. I know I have very unpopular opinion for this movie and your opinion can be different than mine.",

Has been the most awaited movie of 2022 so much that two Bollywood biggies chose to defer their releases to avoid a box office clash. Salaam Rocky bhai!!Chapter two is total MASS...a film hell bent on providing entertainment with clear focus on the machismo of its two warring superstars - Rocking Star Yash and Sanjay Dutt. In fact, the movie can be called a montage of action sequences erupting one after another even as logic and sanity take a clear backseat. Ahem!!No exaggeration doston but the racy narrative has nothing new to offer at plot level. We saw a daredevil underdog (Yash as Rocky bhai) become the undisputed king of KGF in Chapter ek. Here, he grows his empire while tackling a larger foe Adheera (Sanju Baba) and later taking on the State itself when the PM (still mast mast Raveena Tandon) isn't too happy with his meteoric rise.The acting department is first rate and both Yash and Sanju set the screen on fire whenever they face off. Raveena Tandon is a revelation and creates a mighty impression even though she appears only in the film's second half. Srinidhi Shetty doesn't get much scope but looks gorgeous in certain scenes.Admittedly, Chapter Two is a heavy watch with every inconsequential character mouthing hero wala punchlines. The treatment is over the top in each and every scene and the loud jarring background score doesn't stop even one minute from start to end. Also, the narrative gets confusing atleast initially with all those cuts to a grim Prakash Raj explaining the story. Quite unnecessary, all that!! Surprisingly, no Nora or Jacqueline pop up for an item number this time - something the front benchers may miss!!Finally, K. G. F. 2 rests on Yash's able shoulders and he doesn't disappoint one bit. In all probability, the film will end up riding the present South Cinema wave bracing the country with films like Pushpa (2021) and RRR (2022) trouncing the so called big ticket Bollywood endeavors. Having said that, this one isn't something to sing hosannas about. It is a clear case of 'high on swag but woefully low on substance' type cinema.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

There is no continuity. There is no development of the storyline between the two except the most cringeworthy lines he says to her in both the first and second movie.The way he treats her reminds you of the robot gone \"rogue\" in the Rajnikanth movie 'Enthiran (Robot)' where the robot thinks it's okay to kidnap Aishwarya Rai and force her to fall in love which is not how love works. But here the guy kidnaps her and she eventually falls in love with him all of a sudden despite the events that occurred where he behaved like the Robot that has no human emotions with flawed logic.When he kidnaps her and she suddenly falls in love it's reminds you of Stockholm Syndrome!And this same flawed guy who's basically an eve teaser type goon who doesn't know what consent means and who kidnaps women is glorified as a hero and maybe even god like status which makes no sense. Is this what the makers want the kids and men in society to think is right?One of the worst of movies I have ever watched in a theatre. Not to mention the sound effects are so unnecessary and probably used to evoke emotions in the audience when they can't through acting, storyline and dialogues that make no sense.There is no concept of subtlety here. The same old South Indian movie which has no logic or respect for gravity and physics and glorifies a man who's basically a sexist kidnapper and a killer who's so greedy for money and just does everything without introspection and consent is glorified into a literal demi god status.This is the type of movie you get when people with flawed values and a non-introspective closed mindset are given a lot of money to make a movie! Avoid this movie at all costs!",

The scene transitions are just randomly done while a dialogue is going I'm the background! And those cringy dialogues! Who even talks like that!Every character is so one dimensional. It's like their only purpose is to hype the protagonist. Most of the people feel like NPCs in a game. They only exist to act surprised whenever somebody says something, or Rocky makes an appearance. Again, how many times do you need to hype your main character!The direction is abysmal. He doesn't know how to tell a story. None of the actors do anything worth mentioning. Rocky just has the same facial expression throughout the whole film. All he does is deliver those cringy dialogues and kill people with a swag. A really poorly written, and wrongly glorified character.The story doesn't make any sense at all. So much heavy plot armour. I don't mind mindless over the top action scenes, in fact, I love them. But the plot needs to have some coherence! Most things that happen make absolutely no sense, but they happen because they need to, for plot progression.The only good thing I can say about this movie, is that, it's a mass entertainer, and it does entertain. But for that the audience needs to shut down their brain, or else, they will realise what a garbage this is. Also, it has decent cinematography. Would have appreciated the score, if it wasn't getting loud every other scene only to create hype.This movie just increased my admiration for Rajamouli, who has shown that you can create mass entertainers without sacrificing the filmmaking process, or your creativity. Neel is just an amateur who was given loads of money to create trash like this, and he'll be given more, because the Indian audience devours this trash.Hugely disappointed.

The feeling you get after watching this movie cannot be evoked just by the story, script, bgm, epic scale, spectacle, gorgeous cinematography, humor, actors, or emotional scenes. They all are necessary, but more importantly they also have to blend well. KGF-2 blends them all so well that it lingers around for a long time with you. The impact is so deep that you can't watch any other movie for a few days. And that's what compels you to watch KGF-2 again and again, until you overdo it.That's my review, that's my way of saying that KGF-2 is not a movie, but an emotion, just like KGF-1.Some may not connect to KGFs at emotional level. I feel bad for them because then KGFs would look to them like a string of flashy/humorous/emotional scenes in an epic backdrop involving a complex war for the throne and gold. They would find it to be a good movie (based on technical aspects, story, and other parameters), but not a great movie and definitely can't understand those of us who call it an emotion.",

Well arrival is such an understatement for this movie, it shreds the box office like anything you have previously seen on a big screen. I have never seen fans so anxious and crazy about a movie since Avengers finale and I have got to tell you that this is the most overwhelming movie experience I have had of any Indian Movie in cinemas ever period. People were literally shouting and cheering even before the Big title showed on the screen and it definitely marks the greatest entrance of a character in a movie. Not to mention I went to the last show possible in the theatre near me and I wasn't expecting it to be houseful at midnight but God am I glad to be wrong.What I really liked about this movie over RRR recently is the inclusion of Bollywood actors ( Sanju Baba and Raveena Tandon) in pivotal roles which I felt were shoehorned in the RRR Movie but are of paramount importance here and leave their mark in style.The charm and magnetic presence of rocking star Yash is undeniable and the swag \ud83d\ude0e with He carries this character can't be replaced with anyone else helming this iconic role.I was amazed to see how they pulled of such visuals and set pieces with a budget of mere 100 crore (although you do see some noticable VFX or cuts in production here and now).The best thing I really appreciate about this movie is the fact that it is a sequel and a quintessential in that regard. It's been so long since I have seen a sequel that completely overshadows its predecessor with such a novelty and surpasses all the expectations. While Raving about this I might add this this one is not without it's setbacks (although minor) which do not bring down movie much but sure could be enhanced in the 3rd installment with some addition to the budget constraints.The editing still feels a bit choppy but not as jarring to look at when compared to it's predecessor where it was hard to comprehend what's going on the screen no matter how hard you try. The BGM here is loud again ( not for the faint hearted) but appropriate to the story and only adds to the screenplay. The romantic angle feels forced and could have been avoided but I do understand that this one is Emotion centric at core so they had to include that and it does pay off in the end when the showdown between the two nutheads begin.Well I got in it for the story telling perspective and not for the action sequences but I do want to confess that some action sequences are so well choreographed that you will be left in awe especially the Kashnikov scene (you will understand when it comes). The story here is less Messier and more linear than the first one makes the backbone of this monstercoaster of a ride.Do watch in theatres with biggest crowd possible (you will thank me later).Magnum Opus of Kannada movie Industry indeed.VERDICT: 4.5/5.",

BGM is TOO LOUD, I mean way too LOUD. Even during normal conversation of characters, BGM is unnecessarily loud and fast. Seriously what's wrong with music directors of this movie.

You can connect with each and every character in the movie including extras, you can feel pain/fear in their face. It is a mixture of emotions and action. Treat for action lovers. Casting is good.Cons:\nBackground music is good, but sometimes you feel BGM is overpowering dialogue especially in first half. Some of the fights could have been avoided. They could used Sanjay's presence a lil more. Couldn't feel chemistry between Reena and Rocky.Overall KGF 2 is worth watching and of course there is a surprise at the end!",

They still don't consider gravity as a natural force and disagree with its existence in this universe which resulted in same, typical unimpressive wire works we see on indian films these days. The climax fight also was too superficial and unreal. It felt forced to me as a viewer and I couldn't connect with the movie at all.As for the positives, the CGI of the minefield worked really well and looked convincing.

The cinematography of this film is something that will be talked about for years and act as a reference for the upcoming generation of aspiring filmmakers. The BGM is very energetic and will keep you hooked to the screen for the entire timeThe core emotion of the film which is the bond between the MOTHER and SON is beautifully blended with the action-packed storyline and it never feels out of place or unnecessary and has a great impact on the decisions taken by the main character ROCKY.The first half of the film focuses on Rocky and the developments he witnessed in his life after the conclusion of chapter 1 and the relationship that he builds with the people of KGF. The song 'TOOFAN' will surely give you goosebumps and it also very smartly retells the events which unfold in the FIRST Chapter.The second half is full of twists and turns and will keep you on the edge of your seats.AND the CLIMAX of this film is VISUALLY STUNNING and of PEAK PERFECTION.The entire cast including YASH, SANJAY DUTT, SRINIDHI SHETTY, and others did a fabulous job and gave full justice to their characters but among them all, RAVEENA TANDON with limited screentime gave her career-best performance and stood out in the character of RAMIKA SEN.

            "review_title": "Chapter 1 was a masterpiece! This one is bad.",
            "content": "I normally don't write Spoiler reviews. But it's truly frustrating that so many people are rating this movie 10/10. While the movie doesn't deserve higher than an average of 6.K. G. F. Chapter 1 was one of the best movies of Indian Cinema. It had a strong script that built the character of Rocky as well as utilized him smartly. Direction was artistic. Scenes of several different times and locations were showed in continuous slides with dialogues from different people intermingled to deliver the message in a very exotic way. Instead of telling the story linear and chronologically, it had done that dynamically with scenes at places that made those exciting as well as fun to watch. That was indeed 10/10. I've watched it 7 times.This second part, however, seems poor imitation of its own first part. Immensely huge population is rating it high because of the hype created and the wait for two additional years for this movie. And for that they're deeply feeling the Charisma of Rocky, which the movie has delivered well. But the truth is, many things that made the first chapter great are entirely missing here. Director have failed to use the same artistic style appropriately, and in fact, most of the movie is told chronologically. Not that it's a bad thing, because most movies have chronological story-telling. But due to this the story of this second chapter became more important. And sadly, the script of this chapter is extremely poor. Numerous actions and character reactions felt absurd and unrealistic. Several character motivations were destroyed by extended details.Rocky's romance chemistry is also made extremely weaker, even though lot more time is spent on this compared to the first chapter. In previous chapter it was established that Reena had already fallen in love with Rocky. And all Rocky needed to do is ask her to go with him, as she could have become a target for hurting Rocky. Hence, her life could be in danger outside KGF. She would surely not have denied, and in fact, would have went with him happily. Doing that would have also brought him Rajendar Desai as his alliance, which would have helped him greatly. But what he did here is kidnap Reena and keep her in KGF forcefully, which resulted in her loss of her love and respect for him. What most people don't understand, the positive feelings she later felt could be due to Stockholm Syndrome, which many victims of Kidnapping suffer with. Hence, whatever romance later showed between them that resulted in Reena's pregnancy was not because of her true affection for him but because of her desire to be loved by her Kidnapper.All the villains in the movie are used poorly. Adheera's character is given scary getup and personality, but he's shown an idiot. Twice he doesn't kill Rocky at the best opportunities. First he doesn't kill with the punchline that he wants the people to see their beloved die in their hands, which could be achieved even with Rocky's dead body. Slaves of KGF were always extremely scared of Adheera, and with Rocky's death their morale to oppose him could be crushed easily. They would have surrendered as soon as Adheera would have reached KGF with his army. Then, even after learning his mistake, and waiting for two years, he doesn't kill Rocky with the sniper rifle when he made surprise attack to KGF. Instead he kills Reena. Even though he could have killed Reena after killing Rocky. Typical brainless villain!Ramika's character was also wasted big time. She delivered some very good punch-line dialogues in the movie, but she was also showed as an idiot politician who somehow became the PM of India. Why the hell would she want to bomb the entire KGF? She had sent the Indian army there. She could have brought control over those fields and continued mining gold for the government. Being a politician she should have figured out a proper way to avoid release of the connection of his party members' connections to Rocky's business, rather than destroying a gold mine. Someone can say most of the gold was already taken out by Rocky. But Ramika did not have this knowledge.In Chapter 1 there were several characters who delivered dramatic impact, but in a realistic way. There was a mad man who talked rubbish and told stories, but those stories had connections to the heroism of Rocky. There were also two elderly men who worked as leaders/elders/supervisors of the slaves of KGF. There were also other characters from the slaves, like the ones who died for saving Rocky. Presence of these characters connected the viewers with the slaves of KGF. In chapter 2, all these characters were removed. A mother and son were brought forth for some dramatic impact, but they delivered those in completely unrealistic and absurd way, and brought literally no difference to the essence of the story or viewers' connections to KGF or their slaves (workers now).Kamal, Rajendra Desai, Virat (and his companion, which isn't clear what happened to him), were wasted, even though they were built character (in Chapter 1) and their deaths could be handled dramatically. Instead, drama was brought to the killing of Shetty, which was never truly important for the viewers.It was told that Guru Pandian and Andrews had now accepted and joined Rocky's business. But the details of their business operations were not provided, and no connection was built with them. Hence, when the betrayals of either of them were showed, we feel literally nothing. In fact, the timing of Guru Pandian's betrayal revelation was supposed to shock us. But we didn't feel anything. Just a smile that we all expected by the trailer that the scene was about Rocky's attack to Ramika Sen, but it was not.I think all these things were done intentionally by the director and writers. They wanted to focus on Rocky's charisma only. And in that regard they surely succeed. But the thing is, chapter 1 had also done that with a proper script and exciting story.Now let's come to the biggest upset. It's the ending. In my eyes this is the worst possible ending the writers could have come up with. Ok, KGF was destroyed. So what? Rocky wanted to become the richest man on earth to fulfill his promise to his dying mother. Technically, he had no attachment to the land of KGF. He was only interested in the gold underneath the lands. And he had already grabbed most or all of it. Now he is on a ship full of that gold. He probably has more gold than most governments in the world. What should be his action now? There are many things he can actually do. He can go to a poor country and make a deal with them, and by offering some or half of his gold, he can grab heavy power in that country. He can also purchase several islands, hire an impressive mercenary army, and live like a King for the rest of his life, and die at the age of 80 as the richest man on earth. But what he does here? He goes directly to the Indian Navy, and also tells them he's coming to them, so that they can kill him. Why is he in so much hurry to die in presence of his gold? Probably he doesn't have confidence that he would be able to keep his gold for the rest of his life. And he doesn't want to die without his gold. Duh!Only reason I'm even giving this chapter 3 stars instead of 1 is because Rocky's charisma delivered good impact at several places in the movie, which were fun to watch, along with some creative dialogues from him as well as Ramika Sen. But overall it is the biggest opportunity lost in the History of Indian Cinema. I know this movie would still do business, because Indian's are more diverted towards brainless charisma type movies, rather than the realism of the stories. But the thing is, this movie could have done far far better with the same concept. All needed to be done was to put forth same effort they had done for writing the script of this chapter as they did for chapter 1. And this could have become a movie much like Baahubali Conclusion, and even better. At the moment people are feeling passion for this movie, but later on they would realize all that I'm saying. And they would realize they were made fools by the creators of this movie.",

No one will question that?2. A mother would want his son a criminal, and all should praise it as \"great\"?3. One would want the whole world under him and all sould praise for that great moto?4. One would call his lover as a piece of entertainment and no regretting on that is needed to be expressed by him?5. One would keep thousands of people as slaves including the kids and all of them would still think him as a God and they have to protect him by giving their lives?6. All should celebrate one's country wide Rowdyism and call him as Hero?7. Violence is a piece of celebration if that is done by the so called hero?8. Smuggling is the praise worthy if is done by our hero?9. One should praise this as a master piece and should watch it with their family for it's great morals of it's stroy?10. One should keep celebrating such movies and keep these great morals in his life and spread it?",

At the end we should not mention these films as Bollywood movie or Tollywood or sandalwood and Kollywood rather we should name them as an Indian film and that will prove us among other nations. And KGF did that.More than a Commercial film KGF stands unique from that tag. Yash the rockstar rocked by his performance. His presence in each and every frame gives an energy to the audience watching the film. All cast performed well especially Raveena, Sanjay Dutt and prakash Raj proved that they were legends.I can't able to mention a specific department that gave their work best, all the departments did a great job. Whole movie was a treat to the audience. Rocky was the best written character in Indian cinema.Really a greatest work from the director. The director handled the emotion really well.

            "review_title": "It's a mixed bag. There is definitely a lot to like in this but overall it's not as good as the first part.",
            "content": "The first half of KGF Chapter 2 feels like a continuation of the first film; the story of your favourite character' ascent continues; Yash continues to dominate everyone, his swag sweeps everyone off their feet with rip roaring music playing in the background. Everything seemed fine till the second half, where just like our lead character Rocky, the movie too loses direction and doesn't really know what to do next and where to go from here. KGF Chapter 2 is a mixed bag, unlike the first part. There is definitely a lot to like in this, a number of scenes will hit you hard but overall it's not as good as the first part.WHAT'S GOOD :1. KGF Chapter 2 once again takes you on a ride that is high on adrenaline and packed with goosebumps. The movie wastes no time in getting you back to the Kolar Gold Fields and gets you hooked right away with some stylish sequences powered by Ravi Basrur's electrifying background music. As a fan of KGF, you get everything that you could have asked for in the first hour of the film.2. The music continues to be the backbone of the film. When the song 'Toofan' explodes on screen, once again the movie makes you feel like a King who is ready to conquer the world. That one song is so powerful and impactful, as a viewer you feel like entering KGF and start dancing with Rocky and his friends. Outstanding work done by composer Ravi Basrur once again! Rest of the songs are also nice but would have been really enjoyable if they hadn't messed with the audio.3. Yash is the star of this show. As long as he is on screen, you have faith that something great will most certainly happen. His swag and charisma is unmatched by any other actor right now; his screen presence is that of an out an out superstar.4. The scene where Reena informs Rocky about her pregnancy has been done in a very creative way. Now this kind of situation has been written in movies a thousand times before and almost every time it's announced in the same manner; it's almost always a generic scene with no real artistic merit involved; but in KGF the way Reena informs Rocky about their child was something I had never seen before; powered by the beautiful background score of Ravi Basrur, that scene hit me hard emotionally because of Rocky's attachment to his mother. That was a very well written scene.5. The action sequences in this film are not as many as the first film, but every single one of them has been choreographed in an extremely stylish manner. Usually I am not a fan of action scenes, because they are all the same and boring and are used mostly to fill in the time; but KGF is different from the rest. Be it the car chase in the first half, or the Kalashnikov showdown with Adheera and his gang or the ultimate battle between Adheera and Rocky; every single one of them makes you sit up and watch because of how amazing they are.6. Raveena Tandon looked pretty solid as the Prime Minister. She looked like a more powerful opponent than Adheera. The movie took a political turn but didn't engage in a lot of political battle. The director kept it to a bare minimum and Rocky just decided to stay out of her path because she was a woman, and strong women are supposed to be worshipped? That argument felt rather strange, because by saying that he pretty much hung his boots. So, what was the point of this second part? I wish the director gave more meat to Ramika Sen's character and included a sub plot of the mind games played between Rocky and Ramika. Rocky is not just muscle power, he is also a sharp witted man; his battle with Ramika could have made for an interesting watch. Ramika going all out with Indian army to finish off Rocky was a bit too much, because it killed the scope for anything else to happen apart from KGF's downfall.7. The cinematography is as brilliant as the first part. The colour palette of KGF is very different from what we usually see in movies but it looks extremely beautiful. The portrayal of mining seems realistic, there is coal and dust everywhere, it's not a cosmetic world. The hard work of the art direction team has brought believability to the world of KGF.WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD :1. In order to create a bigger impact, the volume of the music has been kept very high and the sound has been distorted. It was a very bad idea, because the same music that received high praise in the first half of the film now became a nuisance. There was absolutely no need of it, the music was fine as it is, it was good enough to excite the viewers, but now it was just irritating to the ears. There was no need for this over the top approach.2. After the second half, the movie loses a sense of direction, just like Rocky. Rocky wanted to climb up the ladder and become the biggest player of the game, which he becomes but then he doesn't really know where to stop or where to go from there; which seems odd because Rocky may not be playing by the rules of the book, but he never comes across as stupid or suicidal. He always understood the struggles of poor people, and after reaching KGF he was completely transformed. The painful existence of people deeply affected him and he even risked his own life just to save a blind old man. So how did he turn into a crazy maniac who cared about nothing but gold, even more than human life? That whole concept of Rocky going after infinite amount of gold just because he promised his mother didn't come across as very convincing or interesting.3. Courage and stupidity are not the same. Rocky is a strong man, we know that but he's not a superman, so why would he go into Adheera's den to fight alone without a gun? He could have easily got himself killed and it would have been such a lame and foolish death for a visionary like him. It was a simple case of writers going for something over the top. This is what happens when you indulge into too much chest thumping; you stop using your brain. Also, when every member of Adheera's gang had a gun, why were they running with it towards Rocky to hit him instead of firing at him? Were they under some kind of spell that made them see their guns as iron rods?4. Till the first half, the movie was quite enjoyable but as soon as the political battle began, it turned into a generic gangster film that had nothing extraordinary to offer. Rocky walking with a swag and people getting scared of him can be equated with the icing of the cake, but it can never act as a substitute for the actual cake; that will always remain a compelling screenplay, which went missing in the second half of the film.5. Srinidhi Shetty had nothing much to do apart from looking gorgeous in every single frame. Her equation with Rocky was also a little unclear. Towards the end of the first film it was quite clear that she was aware of Rocky being alive, was proud of him and had developed feelings for him; but in the second part their relationship almost started from a scratch. Did the director forget that Reena had fallen in love with Rocky in the first part itself ?6. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera looks menacing but doesn't do much in the film. His role is also more like an extended cameo. For the most part, Adheera remains confined to the background nursing the wounds inflicted on his body and his ego by Rocky. Now that doesn't sound like a powerful villain. What made me laugh was Adheera shouting and roaring, after his gang's showdown with team Rocky powered by Kalashnikov's; was he expecting some kind of fire to come out of his mouth ? Also, how did Adheera manage to walk through fire? Was he a Targaryen ? Going unnecessarily over the top was a key problem with this film.7. I can understand that perhaps Rocky lost all interest in his life after his final showdown with Adheera, he had no one in his life; but wouldn't it have been better if he had distributed the gold among the people who had dedicated their life, sweat, blood and tears in working day in and day out to dig for all that gold? Why not do something for them ? What did they get out of it ? He promised his mother that he would get all the gold for her, he didn't promise to throw it all in the ocean. Unless there is more to it, and director Prashant Neel has some explanation for it that he wishes to answer in some future film, it's safe to say that it wasn't really a wise move to throw it all away under the water.8. The children in the first film were almost the narrators of the events taking place in KGF, and all of them acted really well. In this film, none of them are there and their role has been reduced to a bare minimum.9. This part doesn't have the emotional depth that the first part had. The first part was not just mindless action, there was a well layered storyline about an underdog rising the ranks to become the biggest player of the game, we were all rooting for this character and felt the deep connection that he had with his mother. The first part did a good job of depicting that emotional storyline, but the second part just couldn't connect to the viewers on an emotional level.",

Don't go into this movie expecting a lot of depth but instead for the emotional highs and the adrenaline rush. That adrenaline rush barely drops anywhere in the film, kudos to Prashant Neel, Ravi Basrur and other technicians for being able to do that.As Rocky, Yash just owns the character and it's hard to see anyone else in those shoes. Great performance for the scope of the film. Sanjay Dutt was good as Adheera and he performed well but Adheera's character could have been better written, the confrontation scenes between Adheera and Rocky leave a little more being desired from the audience. The two having the other fallen and giving one another a second chance comes off as too clear of cinematic liberty and after the second confrontation, Adheera doesn't seem as powerful maybe they could have use other action pieces with different characters instead of early confrontations where they almost kill each other and let the other go. The main big bad and the show stealer in my opinion was Raveena Tandon as Ramika Sen. Those confrontation between Rocky and her and the power plays made by Rocky were the main highlights of the film. The ending is another highlight and may be one of the best endings in a massy film. The power moves from Rocky and the showcase of how he maintains his power and uses the power in KGF make KGF Chapter 2 a delight. Prakash Raj as Anant Nag's son was a good entry and provided a different look at the story.Overall a movie with great elevations and an adrenaline rush. Don't think too much and don't go picking apart the story for depth and all bc u would be disappointed, the movie intends to give u an exhilarating experience and delivers on that note with some minor inconsistencies here and there.",

            "content": "The opening scene is energy-filled and displays fast-paced flashbacks just like Chapter 1. When Prakash Raj gears up to narrate the legend of Rocky's KGF - the most secretive part of the post-independence history of India, you can't help but admire Prashant Neel's direction. But after 5-10 minutes, you realize this is no more than a mere mass masala formula filmRocky is both shown as ruthless and merciful, depending on the requirements of the scene. That's a good idea, but like the media, critics pointed out that the Stockholm Syndrome of the miners paired with that same old mother sentiment becomes clich\u00e9 and cringe. Rocky (who is treated like \u00dcbermensch in KGF) is just reduced to just delivering elevation scenes.The scenes focus on showing Mr. Rocky's swag more than his legacy of the KGF Empire. For example, some useless people enter and challenge Rocky, and he \"shows his power\" (the gun scene from the trailer/teaser comes here), and these are useless for the story of Kgf. It becomes a play of power, each person trying to assert his power by waging wars on each other. So, it doesn't let the story develop. They could've touched upon International Mafia-like how they had promised but didn't satisfy at all with that part. But I'll excuse this at least.The songs suck and so does the comedy. Either make an impactful song or don't keep even one. The BGM is loud, and everywhere, there's bgm! Even if someone coughs, they are ready to play some bgm!As for the production values, it is quite impressive what they've done on a relatively much lower budget as compared to other Pan-Indian films. Unless you're keen-eyed, you'll find the VFX quite realistic (especially when they show crowds of miners);\nThe cinematography is commendable. Watch in IMAX or on Dolby Atmos. Trust me, the experience is worth it!The only issue was that scenes (especially car chases) abruptly went dark (due to the childish style of editing)Aspects like costume design and choosing color palette have been taken care of very wellApart from the sound mixing, the camera work was annoying. During the final battle between Rocky and Adheera, the camera is shakey, and the scenes are too fast to grasp what is going on. You just wait to see who survives (and since you know who survives you just wait for the mess to get over!);Yash's acting is good; he's a self-made actor who has given his best to the KGF series. The storytelling and production values make this movie watchable.Long story short, this is not as good as Chapter 1 but certain scenes are good (revealing them would be a spoiler) and the production values & cinematography are excellent, I can't help but agree Prashant Neel has very well managed to do justice to KGF Chapter 1 and the separate fan base it had, and I hope his upcoming projects impress us \ud83d\udc4d",

            "content": "The golden piece we all deserve!KGF Chapter 1, released in 2018 was a turning point for the entire Kannada film industry as it is relatively small compared to other major industries in India. KGF Chapter 1 made on a relatively minuscule budget had many heads turning towards the film. It became the highest-grossing movie in the history of the Kannada film industry. Since then, KGF has been a major topic for the fans of Indian cinema and even to factions of world cinema. Part one was an impressive, classy commercial Indian film with aspects of history blended with fiction and over the top action. Although I am not necessarily a fan of commercial Indian cinema, director Prashanth Neel was very clear from the beginning and stuck true to the genre throughout. This made KGF Chapter 1 stand out among many other commercial movies I knew that this was going to be something special.The release of KGF Chapter 2 was highly anticipated after that cliffhanger in part one. The teasers and trailers of Chapter 2 were literally showing the audience that they were pushing beyond the boundaries of Indian cinema to appeal to world cinema. Prashanth Neel used his technicalities to maximum effect and produced an Indian film like never before, that too from the Kannada film industry! Chapter 2 was a technical marvel and a commercial masterpiece. The film that every Indian cinema fan would have been yearning for many years. It's no doubt that KGF has breached 130 million USD global box office mark in a jiffy as this film is simply stunning to look at from every possible angle. Prashanth Neel trusted one thing, his script, and it did wonders, this is not a review as I clearly loved the film.Thank you to everyone who spared their brilliance behind the film. Special mentions has to go to Yash, the hero of in movie and the film itself and the Hombale Films for making this film a living reality for the world. A big hat off to all of you.

            "review_title": "My 10 points why this movie is an average one",
            "content": "I wish to share my frank assessment of KGF 2. Sincerity be told, I am not a major fan of movies where a single hero defeats a sizable band of baddies. This is not only not conceivable, but it also inevitably leads to absurd combat scenes, defying gravity action sequences, and more. So don't count on me to praise you without question like a little kid. KGF 2 doesn't contribute anything new to the tale beyond what the first Chapter did. However, the timing and execution of the film were generally quite interesting. That doesn't mean there weren't any awkward scenes, tiresome frames, etc.The movie's shortcomings are listed below. Although this film had the potential to set a standard for subsequent action films, it fell short on a number of fronts.1. No other characters' personalities were explored in the story; it was all about Rocky.2. Rocky's goal or pledge to his mother was unquestionably supported by the public. In other words, they lacked a life of their own and relied entirely on the existence of Rocky. It might be true for a select few of his close friends, but not for 1.5 million.3. Some action sequences changed abruptly, with several dark screens in between; this was unnecessary, and it was actually painful to watch them.4. Who uses helicopters for cooling, and it doesn't look cool as well. Perhaps he might have served her with his own hands, which would have added romance and significance to the scene.5. It was excessive to hold the bridge while it was on fire and Dutt was holding it until the final car passed. The bridge was a hanging type made of wood, but everything else was cutting edge.6. Rocky was so rude towards his father because he was careless towards his mother. Is it sufficient justification to degrade his father? To justify such scene, they should have portrayed domestic abuse or anything from his father towards his mother.7. While other guys engaged in gunfights, one man consistently engaged in hand combat with hundreds of men. He had nobody to shoot at with a gun.8. What caused the girl to take care of Rocky after being abducted and transported to Dutt. Rocky pursued her, alone, of course, killing everyone in his path. He was defeated, but the events that followed didn't make sense, such as how the girl came to care about him even though he treated her quite roughly.9. Rocky didn't show any other emotion beside an angry and a macho mode, and people are calling it an acting. I'm sorry, but with just one set of emotions, you can't compare it to the standards set by performers like Kamal Hasan, Mohanlal, Amitabh, Dilip Kumar, and others who have mastered a variety of emotions. His acting is by no means masterful.10. Despite the fact that the villains carried guns and appeared in large numbers, they were occasionally depicted terrified even if Rocky was not carrying anything.I like the fast-paced narration at parts, but I will be unable to watch it again. Instead, even this time, I repeatedly skipped forward, completing the 2.5-hour film in just 1.5 hours.I could have rated it 5/10 but since kids were so much into it, they put their logic aside and overlooked all the shortcoming for entertainment. Therefore, to balance out I am rating it 1, which I totally disagree. Maybe, the viewers were treated like an entertainment by the director, actors, etc. Like how the girl was an entertainment for Rocky. Anyways, this movie is good in parts but doesn't deserve more than 8*. Yash was good if we only talk about one emotion. All the credit goes to the team for making this movie somewhat fast paced and entertaining.",

Overall a good movie... a hero oriented mass movie. I like the way of narration & story connecting to the sequence. Prashant Neel has a unique way of story telling hatsoff to his direction and Yash acting is fabulous, he carries an attitude look n style throughout the movie. Cinematography is awesome BGM looks overloaded sometimes it overlaps & irritating but editing was really bad compared to KGF1 fight & chasing scenes were worstly edited. All characters in the movie were up to the mark but Sanjay Dutt was literally unwanted to this movie Adheera character could have been done by some other actors from south who is famous for villain character like Jagapathi Babu or any other actor. Sanjay Dutt couldn't connect to the story, just his looks n style were good as a villain.Go without any expectation... you will definitely like the movie.Don't miss the twist in the end & initial narration of Prakash Raj its interconnected.

            "content": "Hailing from Bangalore, I always wondered why Kannada movies with a rich heritage never struck gold at the Indian box office. It was far more subdued than other South Indian film industries. KGF 1 and now KGF 2 have changed all that. It is therefore a matter of immense pride for me personally to see Kannada movies doing so well.I watched the movie at the global premiere in UAE ... the 1150pm show, even though the next day was a working day. But, not once did I regret going to a movie at such an inappropriate time. The movie was all I expected and much more. It had a great storyline that remained true to the central theme of Rocky having a motive. Every action emanates from that and which is exactly why you constantly empathize with his character, even though his villainy was obnoxious at times. That is the strength of the writing, as you viewed the character just like the way the director aspired. This for me was the biggest strength of the movie.The movie continues from where KGF1 left. All the aspirers to throne of Narachi are stunned into silence when Rocky replaces Garuda at the helm of affairs. So, to get him down, they connect with Adhira, the uncle of Garuda. The fight then is between Adhira and Rocky. You see many points where it looks like Rocky is going down to Adhira but he always has a plan up his sleeve. The culmination of that fight forms the crux of the movie.Prashant Neel has done an amazing job with his writing and direction. Every frame looks like a masterpiece and the dark muted tones makes the movie a visual delight. Some of the frames are simply out of this world. The casting is picture perfect including Adhira, Ramika and others. It seems they selected themselves for this role. I would recommend this movie to every cinema lover.The climax is a killer and after the Kattappa Bahubali saga, this is indeed a break point to cherish. I hope the makers of KGF have a plan up their sleeve.",

The screenplay was tight for the 2.50 hrs film. Editing was tight and amazing. No lags. Cinematography was brilliant.Music... is the master. It elevates you up and gives goosebumps every time.Yash is really the Rocking star. His looks and style are awesome. Action sequences are taken to the next level.Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon and Srinidhi Shetty were engaging in their own roles. Other cast also did their parts well.This movie is to be enjoyed in theatres. Don't miss the chance! Brilliantly made.",

            "content": "After the assassination of garuda, Andrews,desai, guru pandian and kamal are shocked to see that rocky has also killed its successor virat and taken the rule of KGF. Rocky rehabilitates the slaves and creates his own army. He also kidnaps reena and makes her stay with him. Meanwhile, adheera returns to reclaim kgf and also ramika sen becomes the prime minister and swears to destroy kgf. How rocky deals with these new enemies and what happens to him in the end forms kgf chapter 2.What I loved in kgf chapter 1 was rocky bhai's \"if you are bad, I am your dad\" attitude which was in full swing during its first half. Wheras in the second half that was missing and also rocky didn't have much dialogues in it. But in chapter 2 his that attitude is at its peak. The attitude along with some elevation scenes gave me a blast at the theatre. My favorite scene is the Kalashnikov one. Paisa vasool scene. Ravi basrur's music and bgm is the backbone of the film. Sulthana song picturization was a feast at theatre.Coming to performances, YASH, YASH, YASH! You were rocking. The whole movie, he was wearing only suit and he looked so dashing in it. What a charisma! What a screen presence! Truly a star material. Since his release from jail in 2016, none of the films done by sanjay dutt could mark his comeback. But after watching kgf chapter 2, we can finally say that baba is back. He was very good.Raveena tandon also got a very powerful role as ramika sen. Srinidhi shetty was fine. Prakash raj replaces anant nag as the narrator and did his job well. Another character I loved was vanaram who was a cruel villain in chapter 1 but transforms here as the kattappa of kgf.What didn't work for me in the film was rocky vs adheera fight. I know that it was shot when sanjay dutt was sick and he bravely returned to do them on his own but the makers decided to make the choreography as safe as possible considering dutt's health instead of being a brutal one. Also adheera shoots rocky but not killing him was a biggest mistake from a character point. Also the last act follows the traditional route of a gangster film by showing the downfall of the hero. Here its where the film dips where even the flashback of the mother scene(like chapter 1 climax) doesn't give an impact. But the mid credit scene once again lifts the film's spirit.On the whole, kgf chapter 2 is bigger and better than chapter 1 where we get one of the best antihero of Indian cinema rocky bhai and hats off to prasanth neel's ambitious vision which will take Indian cinema to the next level.",

And it fulfils its role extremely well, with dizzying action sequences made only better by the frantic camera movement, and dialogues that have just as much power as Rocky's hammer.Aside from the mass, the plot itself is quite tragic. We see a man who only knows how to hold the accelerator, and who refuses to press the brake pedal. His demise is inevitable. The ending of his story very much depicts this tragedy, albeit incredibly stylishly shot.The music is hauntingly iconic as usual. One thing I didn't particularly like was the set piece before the interval, where the screen kept on suddenly turning black. It puts a strain on the eyes to watch. This blockbuster tale was made on a budget of a mere \u00a310 million (a small amount compared to the average hollywood film). Watch it for what it is (a masala movie) not for artistic quality.",

It took me 3.5 years to watch KGF 1 and that was a huge miss but this time I ensured not to make the same mistake and I did KGF2 in about 48hrs of release and I feel superbly happy . I repeat , the directors vision, control on the story and the screenplay, everything was at its best . Ravi Basrur, never heard before KGF and can never forget post either, brilliant music may it be songs or BGM. His contribution brought in so much life to the movie . Bhuvan Gowdaf for excellent cinematography, it was a different and amazing world altogether. And there was this whole load of actors including Sanjay Dutt, Raveena , Prakashraj, Srinidhi , Easwari Rao weaving this wonderful movie with a solid needle called Yash . Undoubtedly he pulls out his life's finest performance here and without missing even a inch he perfectly fits to the character . He's Super Smart and Sema Fit . I bet , none but him could have done this role any better . Salam Rocky Bhai. This is not just a movie but an experience. Loved every bit of it . Huge respect to director Prashanth Neel , words can't just say the kind of work he has put in . Class apart . I would say, The real BEAST of this season is ROCKY. Overall KGF, King of Great Films.Note : Dont miss the scenes post credits at end of movie.",

Mad Max meets Scarface? Yes! The story is predictable and formulaic, it is really Robin Hood with a Kalashnikov. The dialogues are almost witty but not really so. It meanders in a confused manner through its own plot. Even then the film has its undeniable moments of glory. A spark of brilliance is there somewhere in this film, but hidden beneath layers and layers of VFX! Despite everything certain images, sounds and scenes get strongly etched in one's mind, one does end up rooting for the protagonist's journey. I watched it once and enjoyed it while it lasted.

There is absolutely no doubt that he single handedly drives the movie.Sanjay dutt, Raveena are proficient.The biggest complaint I have is that there is no soul in the movie (barring the last minutes of Rocky bhai's mother and her story) you cant say that the emotion is underlying..Every second scene is of elevation; That actually makes me believe in my earlier opinion of the story having no soul. You dont need to have elevation every minute when the story has soul.BGM is real ear bleed.Cinematography was not that great too.KGF 2 may have earned more than the first part but its just because if pure hype and well deservingly Yash's swag. For me, KGF > KGF 2PS: Best kannada cinema in recent times has to be \"Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vaahana\".",

            "content": "K. G. F: Chapter 2 was directed by Prashanth Neel and stars once again Yash as Rocky Bhai, the new kingpin of Kolar Gold Fields (also known as K. G. F.). Srinidhi Shetty, Archana Jois, Malavika Avinash, Ayyappa P. Sharma, Harish Rai and Dinesh Mangaluru reprise their roles from the first chapter, while Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Saran Sakthi, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj are the new cast members in this sequel. Chapter 2 is definitely a step-up, compared to the last installment. It's bigger and better, and the production value and action sequences have vastly improved. K. G. F: Chapter 2 is, without a doubt, a commercial film, but the difference between this movie and other Indian commercial films is that the movie relies heavily on the script. The film is 2 hours and 48 minutes long, and it doesn't waste any single frame during the entire runtime. There isn't one unnecessary scene that feels it doesn't belong in the script. Kudos to the producer, Vijay Kiragandur for understanding and sharing Prashanth Neal's vision, for appreciating this bold script and for letting Neel execute the film exactly how he wanted.Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is probably the best one I've seen in the past few years, when it comes to Indian cinema. It's evident that the crew has invested a lot in production values and set designs by just looking at the cinematography and see how detailed every frame is implemented. Every single frame is jaw-dropping and astoundingly gorgeous, and the visual effects are undoubtedly on point. Ujwal Kulkarni also deserves to be praised for editing the film as smoothly as possible and for keeping the movie thrilling and engaging from start to end. The amazing score and soundtrack by Ravi Basrur elevates the movie to a whole another level. It captures the emotions the characters go through, creates tension and increases the excitement level beautifully. The action sequences handled by Anbariv are astonishing and beyond what you could've ever imagined. It's also worth to mention that the action sequences rely heavily on practical effects, and the fact that they are in the same range as Hollywood films, such as Fast & Furious, Die Hard and Mad Max: Fury Road is refreshing to watch.All the cast members have delivered powerhouse performances. Yash proves once again that he is the man of the show. His dialogue delivery and the way he perform the fight choreography are magnificent. Like I mentioned in my previous reviews, it's very important that the antagonist is equally as strong as the protagonist both mentally and physically to keep the film engaging. The way Prashanth Neel has structured and developed the character Adheera is excellent. Sanjay Dutt was absolutely the perfect choice for this role, and he knocked it out of the park with style. Raveena Tandon, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj were also brilliant in their respective roles as Prime Minister Ramika Sen, Farman's mother and Vijayendra Ingalagi. Archana Jois, who portrayed Rocky's mother, Shanthamma, may have very little screen time compared to the rest of the cast, but she has surely delivered a phenomenal performance. Srinidhi Shetty, who portrayed Rocky's love interest, Reena Desai, definitely has a lot more to do in this film, compared to Chapter 1, and she has also delivered a neat performance.Overall, K. G. F: Chapter 2 can easily be considered as one of the best action films India has ever produced, mainly for its technical finesse, strong dialogues, exceptional cinematography and brilliant performances. Don't miss it in the theaters.",

(Not mentioned due to spoiler)\nMusic:\nThere is nothing new about the music. As usual, it is extraordinary. Best viewed in Dolby atmos.Screenplay& Direction:\nEven though there are many violent scenes and some unrealistic scenes, they contain a good emotion in them.Probably this would be one of the best movies of the decade. This review is not based on heroic elevations. A story is said to be well executed only when we feel the complete essence in it. KGF series did it in a marvelous way. The movie hasn't been dramatized too much like other high budget commercial movies but it contained a deep felt emotion.",

He doesnt show any aggression even in chapter1 and is wise character was really good and perfectly suited .Confusion cleared how Adheera is alive and it was as interesting as possible.Dubai scene of Inayath and Rocky was intelligent from director . And also getting new weapons from him too . Perfectly synced scene these all are without any deviation in story. Dialogue scene when Rocky kills adheera henchmen and revealing of the weapons was really brilliant like a revenge.Director displayed a creative side of Rocky too. The way he changed KGF infrastructure was shown at a perfect timing.Screenplay and bgm syncing was unique and exciting during car chase scene when Reena was captured.Twists of the movie are really unique. Happy to see modern age movies getting modern twists. Also corrupt politicians scene in front of PM was good beginning of rivalry.A Unique location for a climax too. Also concluded kgf birth is rocky's birth . As well as kgf's end is rocky's end.Every suspense characters from chapter 1 was logically continued in chapter 2.Minus:\nFew scenes looked like old movie scenes like herione getting captured, Hero spending his life not as a citizen of country because a promise, Because of a promise of a kid ,U cannot live selfishly.Rocky and Adheera's fight too looked bit routine. Chapter 1's last fight was masterpiece actually. Looked like adheera's character ended bit hurry without any planning attacks.'INSPIRATION of Rocky' scenes deserve more hype than people 'SCARED of Adheera'. Few one man army Adheera scenes could have been better but director cared on duration so fine. Only one piece of location were Rocky's army and Adheera's fight so even that looked bit dissappointing as he could cover other locations of Modern KGF infrastructure.",

            "content": "Just as I hoped that my 2nd viewing backed by a proper sound system(& less fussy audience), could possibly make me love the world of #KGF more than my 1st distorted viewing, it actually did a bigger turnaround for me. With proper scope to hear the dialogues clearly, and by getting the BGM's effect as intended, just as Rocky says, it inflicted \"Collateral damage\" this time around! \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4aDamn!! How could #PrashanthNeel do this time and again!!!\ud83d\udd25 You're a monster my Man, you are the one! An asset to #KannadaCinema & #IndianCinema. Take a bow before anything is told.As I always tend to lay emphasis on a directors' work to be largely responsible for an appealing movie, & deservedly so, I am left STUNNED, for the 2nd time running, in as many chapters of KGF! Because an equal or even bigger asset is none other than our #RockingStar #Annthamma YASH.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\nDespite trying to play down the contribution of an actor to the overall quality of any film, I took Yash too for granted, knowing a star actor always gives a great performance at max & nothing more than that. But this guy makes me go bonkers again over an actor's performance matching/ ascending the brilliance of a director!! What aura #Yash carries around him, his work, or his personal life! That blitzkrieg of a performance, with all of that swagger, attitude, unmatchable charm, impeccable mannerisms, flawless dialogue sense, and thereby carving a niche' at acting which has been his childhood dream! He dreamt of being a superstar, but HE NOW IS ENROUTE TO BE THE BIGGEST SUPERSTAR OF INDIA! Make no mistake.. There might be many capable, I doubt if there are many AS DETERMINED. The guy has not acted like Rocky, it's just Rocky being Rocky in front of camera too.Elated as I re-write my #KGFReview, I want to address the so called over the top stuff first, because now, I get the most of it, and if not I would not have loved the movie as much!Nitpicked issues from FDFS viewing:\n1. Reena's initial behaviour in the entry sequence, and Rocky attaching a cringe label to her. This started the beginning of the spoil sport for me earlier, which made me switch off my thinking hat and look down on all further such possible loose pointers. It still is an issue to digest, unless, we look at it as a deliberate move by Rocky to begin the onslaught, starting with the guy who gets triggered by this!!2. Vanaram hunting sequence (the good will). It's actually an insane & cool way to win over, by committing himself, by going ALL IN, because that guy was CRUCIAL! Now, visualize what Rocky did again, is it that cringy!!?\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n3. Adheera's \"cringe entry swag, the bridge\". Hold it there, may not be too convincing but hey, did you now probably get why he's out there with the Ragnar Lothbrok attire? Isn't that why Adheera's guy smirks at \"the situation\" and makes way for Adheera to get in? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4a\n4. \"The chase\" is something that even the director could back up with any reasoning. Poor let down.5. The \"Offer closes soon\" cringe. If you watched what Rocky planned before making the business offer, and what transpired onto the guy who's at the receiving end who was unwilling to join hands, that's a genius Rocky moment right there. Damn, the vacation he planned!! That writing and execution! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0e (top it with the Kalashnikov put to use right after the Interval, the vacation was a real masterstroke). What I thought was cringe, is a work of geniusness! \ud83d\udc4a\n6. Adheera giving up the opportunity is backed by himself, not too credible, but yeah kinda makes half sense. And Rocky doing the reverse favour was actually not digestible. But hey, he is ROCKY, he wants to return the favour exactly, no? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0d Kinda digestible.7. Cut to climax, the cringe with Reena's situation and the impending danger, Rocky is actually fully focused on the TASK he is set to achieve, and he knows that if they made in roads from that direction, it's coming to an end.. So he doesn't react emotionally, but sets out to tell the people to evacuate and ask them to be \"Ready\". Moreover, in his mind when he knows hiw it will end, he doesn't want to do much about the situation than to exercise his ultimate PLAN!8. THE ULTIMATE PLAN: Remember the dialogues the mother and the son exchange in the trailer while she puts him asleep? We only comfortably focus on what Rocky says to his mom there, right!?? \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\n9. That Crazy sounding end credits song and BGM!! *EVERYONE IS A GANGSTER, UNTIL YOU SEE THE MONSTER*\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Cant wait to have the song in my playlist and ringtone!!In my first viewing I couldn't hear it well, and that mix up of all languages, kinda added to my frustration then. But boy, when I heard it the 2nd time, whatta song and what a BGM that follows (same BGM used during ROCKY's ultimate Air handling of Kalashnikov near Varka)!! SHOUT IT OUT.. THIS, IS, KGF....\ud83d\udd25\n9. I take my word back on both Ravi Basrur and Neel. One soothing song is good, but a bit off the track of the movie and has Hindi, so had put me off earlier. But RANA RANA RANADHEERA gets better like fine wine, and gives you a raging high , and Banda banda aaya aaya (everybody's a gangster theme) leaves you on the verge of insanity to end the show off.10. Chapter 3 hint Post credits!Pheww! This mad man Prashanth Neel's response to all the euphoria about Hollywood n stuff. Missed this the 1st time, as the song had put me off., ironically..\nWhy am I saying Hollywood!? Well observe it yourselves, that accent, that teaser he gave by adding that \"Hollywood entity\".. Man, I wanted KGF 2 to end all this while when crazy fans wanted chapter 3. After watching this teaser, bring the heck on you MONSTER! Cant wait for the Hollywood level flick you have accepted to make \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\n11. Dialogues! Denser dialogues in Chapter 2, even Guru Pandian's dialogue in the beginning about the King cobra.. And those Rocky's dialogues with both tinges of Swag and comic sense.

If not, she just a normal looking human being like everyone.Similarly this brutally crude, appealingly exhilarating, superabundant entertainer can only be savored on Big Screen.Cinema is where the 24 commanding art forms come together into an invincibly aggregated energy and we as Humans are bound to behold the beauty: The KGF Chapter 2.We can't teach a monkey to ponder & dissect the facets of a multilayered piece of art even if we dedicate our whole lives in training it. Of all things bestowed on the so-called \"supremely heavenly entities\" Human Beings, the ability to cognize, analyze & comprehend an art form is the apex of all. Imbibing art, appreciating the art form glorifies the Human existence and maintains the balance between sanity & insanity of Life.KGF Chapter 2 is barely an integral chapter in the history of Indian Cinema. It's a frickin' textbook on commercial condiments of art-imbuing Cinema. It's something bigger than you, me, and us and above us.It's the redemption of endangering big screen phenomenon called CINEMA. This is CINEMA. It's inspiring, loud, taut, larger-than-life, rooted, astonishing, wild, inspiring & joyous.I am completely steeped in the notion that the maker Prashant Neel who throttled this carnival is an alien and until he himself persuades me into believing he's not I am going to firmly stick to that assertion.If you are a human and resist watching films like this you are not worth being a HUMAN. I'm sorry! But this is how it is. Cinema is not just an entertainer. CINEMA is art. Cinema is giving Life. Cinema is eternal, Cinema is responsibility, and Cinema is an experience with no replacement.Cinema is larger than life. Beyond! Period. If you say otherwise fight & win me (that's impossible)\nThis is not a review. It's a thank you note to the Cinema makers, of the cinema KGF, & by the Cinema admirer.Bala (ScreenWriter)",

Execution & the way director has present the KGF story is just brilliant. It's 2 hrs 48 mins long movie but the screenplay is so fast paced that no one can imagine how this time has passed. Performance of all the actors and supporting cast has just nailed it. YASH is not a star HE IS THE REAL MONSTER when it comes to acting and his presence in the movie and so as SANJAY DUTT.BGM & ACTION SEQUENCES are just too damn good that it can't be ignored. Specially the climax is just too good. Wait for the post credit scene and see the surprise for yourself.

He isn't terrifying neither does he do something really impactful. Sanju bhaiya just looks uninterested in most of his scenes. Perhaps could have gotten a more terrifying looking actor instead of just roping a big name from Bollywood?However, the music score is spot on and all the actors pull off their characters undeniably well.

Too much overdramatic that I tried to bear but it's over load BGM made me think to run away from theatre. Every scene starts with very loud BGM that I want to ask the director why??? Have some mercy on viewers. But I even more shocking that people are appreciating the movie by giving shoutouts and whistle. Every background artist behind the main leads doing overacting and over melodramatic acting that I didn't connect with. Emotional scene are full with loud BGM. I never seen anyone doing this. Instead of making us emotional I find it funny. One more aspect for not liking the movie is story telling . It too fast pace. There is a entry after entry of main leads with loud BGM throughout the film. There is scene in the movie where adhera hold the bridge with one hand and multiple jeeps are passing through it. There are many scenes of Yash which shows him a superhuman or video game character. Who will do this in real life. And one more drawback action scenes are closely shooted only there upper body is taken which resulted in less detail.In my conclusion the movie is over hyped it lags in content and acting may be the reason. Acting is average. Only appreciable thing is looks of the main leads to appeal the masses. If you doesn't want headache like me avoid the movie in theatre. You can wait for its OTT release. If you are going to watch it by seeing it's ratings please read my review and you will avoid your unbearable headache and dissing sound after the movie.",

Yash as Rocky is beyond appreciation...like No other, Never seen such Grace, aura of some actor. Finest Action star till date in India. Expressions king at the time of Emotional, Romantic scenes. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera is cruel. You will hate him throughout as villian, that is talent of a good actor. His Finest performance till date. Raveena Tandon as PM is Amazing, great talent she is. Definitely knows what Expressions are required at which time. Never seen an actress playing PM so effortlessly. Srinidhi shetty as Reena is Beautiful and really Good actress. But is this enough?. Throughout the film, I pretty much felt that what's her role in the film?, who wrote her role...because it looks like she is just showpiece Beautiful girl who tries to engage in every possible place she can. Director even didn't tried to justify her presence. She is great talent but her Role in film reminds me of Bollywood actress playing sidekick in Kumar, Khan films...Rest, Every supporting Cast is best in their parts.*DIRECTION: Prashant Really did very fine job. His direction is effective. One after other Marvellous frames. Biggest up in direction is Running 2 or 3 events at one time. It keeps us looking up on the screen only. Action scenes are Directed like never before.The flawless CINEMATOGRAPHY, EDITING are Biggest ups.*SCREENPLAY & DIALOGUES: Very Engaging Screenplay. As mentioned, Audience keep hooked as effectively directed scenes runs continuously on screen and we don't find it Boring anytime. Dialogues have big hand in making this special. Credit goes to makers who took Hindi dubbing seriously and written dialogues so properly. Manytimes Dialogues along with Superb BGM give chills.*MUSIC: Conditional and Quality Songs. Amazingly written with proper BGM makes them giving Goosebumps. Even the Romantic song Mehbooba Ignited the emotions to extreme. After very long, some original and fantastic soundtrack.# FINAL VERDICT: When A Hardworking Cast and Crew are dedicated to make a Really class and Masterpiece film, then all of them comes at same pace of Excellence. This is what happened here. Definitely a Must watch!",

Although this cook up is not an unknown one. Several movies have already come in the past with the same concept. Nothing new here about the script. But when we put it against a mine backdrop, the dusty look, dark and shady backdrops; with lighting wherever necessary, it is this that brings out the usual story and gives it a flavour.I can give six for only this ingenious idea of filming it out of a mine setup and nice camera work and vfx to back it out. There is nothing else that is new here. A typical Indian movie with mother sentiment, copy content from here and there, put in raw masculinitiy, etc.In this 2nd chapter especially, it was more of how the protaganist fights his enemies to retain his gained empire; I would recommend here to check out Vada Chennai movie of Dhanush directed by Vetrimaaran. The director could have learnt a few lessons from there. He did bring in the guns which was influenced by Kaithi movie by Lokesh Kanagaraj but the scene felt like he wanted to force the gun there. Shoot a police station and no one is dead. Felt like too much Telugu influence also crept in. I would have been glad if the director was influenced by Malayalam or Tamil movies but Telugu movies are going to make an already larger than life story become too much extravagant;\nBringing in Sanjay Dutt did the trick with the north indian audience but not sure why he was brought in; like most of the other people who were constantly talking to each other; Instead of spending time with the already useless characters present in the movie, the government also was made the villain. Only the CIA was not in picture. May be for the next version.All big movies are coming up with good VFX but a lot of people are ignorant that its the VFX that is making them like the movie;\nThe director should learn the art of subte story telling and should keep game of thrones like inspired characters away and focus on the script.Have nothing to say about Yash; hearing his name first time but he did his bit in what was asked of him;\nFemale objectification should be avoided and raw masuculinity should be controlled; Lots of lessons to be learnt here; Hope the next version is better;",

It's completely a Rocky Bhai's show , his characterisation and mannerism was pure lit . Mass action sequence , dialogues and buildup were just awesome as part 1 . Yash as Rocky Bhai gave terrific performance . Sanjay Dutt as Adheera was stunning in look , but his characterisation was not that much impressive as I thought . Raveena Tandon done her job well . Prashanth Neel way of handling commercial cinema is quite unique . First half was well made , screenplay was engaging , especially interval block . Second half was also good , but lagged in few places . This time mother sentiment quite didn't worked . Technically movie was great comparing to it's previous part , especially music and cinematography was mind blowing . Overall a well made sequel , please don't miss it to watch it on big screen .( but still KGF 1 second half >>>>>>>>> )",

The VFX, I don't know which production did the majority works on it and how it got approved, felt armature, or may be the seer lack of making it good as the general audience isn't going to care anyway. The edit is bad like period, sometimes it shakes so much for random reason gave me a headache.The story I don't know mothers like \"El Chapo\" mother who wants their son to be criminal, and somehow that's all it takes for him to be the biggest criminal. \"Mothers love\". I mean why don't make a superhero film if the hero is going to be super anyway.None the less this is more like a typical South Indian movie with less logic, more action, cringe dialogues at slow motion & BGM to make them sound cool.Interestingly that's all it takes to make a successful movie in India and people will go all gaga over it.",

It doesn't contain any brilliant sequences and nothing out of the box. Too much bgm and It's not emotional. Colour grading has more blacks, greys and oranges to get that classic look. People who like the actor Yash will also like the movie because of his good screen presence. It's more like fan based movie and it's watchable. This is my opinion.",

Even though Prakash did a fair job as the new narrator, I still wanted Anantha nag sir as the narrator.. (his expressions and the hold on language pronounciation is far better)Direction - This movie is an example of what a great and creative director Prashanth Neel is, he is a next generation director who can take Sandalwood into more of an Original PAN India hub, his excellency in directing this masterpiece and meeting the audience expectations after this much hype is unrealistic, he is a true creator.",

            "content": "Prashanth Neel returns as writer-director in KGF: Chapter 2, starring Yash as the gold-hearted gangster named Rocky. But first, a recap. The first chapter was a Deewar-like story of a young boy coming to Bombay and becoming a famous gangster. And then, he is sent to Karnataka, where he becomes even more famous: he becomes the messiah of the people of a secret mining town called KGF. We met Rocky's enemies like Shetty bhai in Bombay and Inayat Khalil in Dubai. We met the Indian Prime Minister, a woman whose face was never revealed, a woman who spoke of unleashing the army on Rocky while signing the death warrant of the man she considered \"the biggest criminal in India.\"But the film began with a television anchor played by Malavika Avinash. She listens to the KGF story as told by a senior journalist, played by Ananth Nag - and that is the same framing device Prashanth uses in the sequel as well. There's just one change. The narrator now is Prakash Raj, who plays the Ananth Nag character's son. I did not realise this while watching Chapter 1, but these conversations provide two things: a breather between the hectically paced events, and they are also a small bit of spoon-feeding for the audience, because the story is so deep and dense. No, let me correct that. The story is fairly uncomplicated. It's the narrative that's deep and dense. And we'll come to this later.So what does Chapter Two have in store for Rocky? He still cares for his people, who worship him. But he wants them to mine for gold day and night. \"The work should not stop,\" he says. Why? I'll just tell you that it has to do with a mother and a bedtime story she tells her son. Watch the first scene carefully, because this makes the closing images so powerful, so mythical. And between this beginning and this ending, we get a film that works at two levels. One, we get a huge action spectacle with very inventive set pieces, superbly shot by Bhuvan Gowda in dark tones that indicate that we are watching a darker sequel. And two, we get a style-filled masala movie, filled with whistle-worthy dialogue and scene after scene with twists and surprises for the audience.In Chapter Two, Rocky has two new enemies: the Prime Minister, whose face is finally revealed and is played by Raveena Tandon, and a Viking-style brute named played by a terrific Sanjay Dutt. His entry scene on a burning bridge is one of the film's many epic highlights. In fact, every bit of this film is epic: Yash is epic and wonderfully larger-than-life, the dialogs are epic, Ravi Basrur's score is epic, and the action is epic, especially a car chase that keeps cutting to a black screen - but that is why I wished for some quiet, intimate moments between Rocky and his love interest, played by Srinidhi Shetty. We get an epic moment involving a helicopter, but we get no real idea about their relationship. Their great romance - if it is that - does not register at all. The second issue I had with the film was that the unmasking of the criminal mastermind was done too hastily.But that apart, I had no complaints, and we can now talk about the narrative being deep and dense. In Chapter One, the combination of the fast cutting and slow motion created a stylised effect. We get some of that in Chapter Two as well, but Prashanth really pushes himself as a screenwriter and he also pushes his editor Ujwal Kulkarni - to the extent that every sequence plays like the legendary baptism stretch from the first Godfather. The visuals come at us very fast, but this is not just the usual quick cutting for an attention-deficit audience. This is carefully planned stylisation. Take the scene where the Raveena Tandon character is sworn in as Prime Minister. She reads out a line or two. And then we see her elsewhere, barking orders to sack the Home Minister. And then, we are back at the swearing-in ceremony. So there is a sense of playing with time. We see her in the present. We cut to her actions in the future. And we return to the present. And there is also a sense of playing with geography, because these two events are happening in two different locations.This happens again and again. We have a no-confidence motion playing out in the Parliament. Simultaneously, we see a shootout. Rocky's wife has a bad dream. We move to a major action set piece, after which we return to the bad dream being narrated. This closing part of this narration is one of the few genuinely emotional moments in KGF: Chapter Two, along with the opening and closing imagery. But I didn't mind. The action and the masala flavour and the precision of the cuts are fantastic, and even if the story arc feels familiar, the denseness from the screenplay/editing makes it all seem new. Chapter Two improves on its predecessor: it is an epic times two.",

I spoke about Yash/Rocky's on screen presence, how he dominated every frame he was in, how he was a force of nature onto himself. I spoke about the amazing director who was able to put together such a fine series of films. I even spoke about the incredible outfits and songs and music.K. G. F Chapter 2 is a beautiful and fitting close to the series. Unless K. G. F Chapter 3 is coming, in which case it was an amazing center of the series.K. G. F Chapter 2 definitely gives us a much better romance to look forward to. In chapter 1 I called it weird, as I was unsure 99% of the time, if Reena liked him or loved him or was being forced by him. Yet in chapter 2 we see her learning about him, loving him and in the end marrying him. All I've got to say to that is he is one hellava lucky man. Reena and Rocky, they seem made for one another and while Rocky's mum set him out on his path. Reena is the only one now who can temper his anger and pull him back before he goes to far. She is crucial to the path he takes and the actions that he takes along it. (Did I mention that she is drop dead gorgeous? Like seriously Srinhidi Shetty is absolutely stunning!)Before this review gets any longer let's end it here and now by saying simply, Chapter 2 has it all: To die for Romance, powerful storyline, amazing cast, top-notch acting, amazing visuals, sfx and vfx.All that was required to turn this movie into a massive success. 10/10 from me!",

That was my last movie in theatre and after a year I went to theatre Cineplex, Keonjhar to watch it's 2nd installment. Ha ha so basically my last 2 movies in theatres are KGF 1 & 2 .Now coming into the main review. Rocky bhai continued his journey where he left in the first part and this time he is not a Local don of Mumbai region,he is now the Lord of KGF. Everyone Loves him, everyone prays for him because he set everyone free from cruel ruler and he is the new king of that KGF. So the acting performance of Yash is no doubt above then excellence. Actually lots of credits goes to Cameraman and VFX team especially the editor for showing Yash's action sequence with BGM in different different angles. Absolutely loved it. The performance of Adheera (Sanjay Dutt) and Raveena Tandon was also very good. The casting director and the makeup artist made perfect replica of Vikings and Indira Gandhi respectively with their characters. BGM and Music of this KGF 2 will chill your spine. I will say Just Go and watch with your family. It's completely OKEY to watch this film with family because it doesn't have any kind of adult content in it, violence are also perfectly blended in it, kudos to Prashant Nill, the director of this movie.I can't talk much about this movie because I have enjoyed it so so much and not a single point to cut it's ratings, well you have to leave your logic in your home otherwise you will feel how the hell physics works here ha ha (Jokes apart) 10 Out of 10 Stars from my side.",

The script and the dialogues are all whistle worthy however there are so many plotholes.And the love angle is filled with how not to show romance 101 . Take an example of how he calls her \"entertainment\". How she waits for him hungry in the table etc etc. I can understand the protagonist comes from slum so his behavior and etiquette will not be feminist. But in my opinion there are lot of scenes which could be avoided. Srineedhi on top of that has given confusing expressions throughout the movie.

Yash does a really good job with his swag and also carries action scenes amazingly well, Srinidhi shetty here gets a lengthier role compared to the 1st part and she also does well especially in the climax scene with her emotions, Raveena tandon also makes her presence felt and she as well does a good job with her expressions and bossy attitude, Sanjay dutt ws extra ordinary as the main antagonist adheera and he does a really commendable performance. The action of the film is vry well directed and structured, wat i didn't like was the story had no vry intriguing depth that can justify the film in overall. Nevertheless despite some flaws KGF 2 is a great one time watch action thriller film, I rate it 7/10 starz.",

            "content": "Positive points first:-First, in start of the movie, there is some little bit COMEDY which i liked it.Second, the background music (BGM) of the movie is so amazing, but it becomes so loud sometimes which feels irritating.Third, in terms of ACTING, the actor & actresses performed very well except some. Specially, Yash who performed as rocky bhai, his acting was so realistic and cool.Fourth, the CINEMATOGRAPHY of the movie was beyond my imagination. I like the way, how they played with LIGHTS to make the frame more amazing.Fifth, the STORY is also quite good. I appreciate that it is different from the usual concept of action movies. I mean, most of the movies showed the journey of powerless guy who later become the hero of that particular industry, like kgf 1. But its second part is different from it. However, i wanted to watch more politics in this movie of capturing the KGF.Sixth, this point doesn't matter so much, but, seriously i like the COSTUMES of rocky bhai. They supported his character.Seventh, as i wrote in the title, the ATTITUDE of the gangster is so cool. In short, from acting, character development, costumes to the attitude- rocky bhai rocks in each field. I mean rocky/yash is the lifeline of this movie.Eighth, personally, i don't like the love angle of the movie, but still the impact of the DEATH hits and well plotted.Ninth, the SETS are also amazing according to the movie.Now, let's talk about some NEGATIVE points :-First, why they INTENSIFIES each and every dialogue. It is so dramatic and annoying. Even they intensifies the small situations of no need with the help of loud BGM.Second, personally, i objects the statement- \"you are my entertainment\". I know, that they doesn't have any wrong intention, but still on an individual level, i found this statement wrong.Third, the ACTION SCENES, they cross the limits of the reality. They are so illogical, but they are intense and entertaining.Fourth, in the car chase scene, the screen starts blinking on and off continuously. I don't know that it is the mistake of my video player or of their cinematography. But it is annoying.Fifth, the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT of the movie is average, or may be below average.Sixth, as i said earlier, that the LOVE between two main characters is not so Impactful or entertaining.Seventh, this point is so important, because in most of the action movies, the villians are the main source of intense fights. But in this movie, the VILLIAN performed not so good. They disappointed me.",

            "content": "After so much hype around the movie, I had watched it in a full packed theatre with great sound system and found myself closing my ears for the loud unnecessary background score. The movie had black out cuts during a car chase sequence and I was surprised, didn't understand a thing that why on earth anyone will edit a car chase in that manner lost my patience there. Throughout the movie I saw only elevations about the protagonist, people come praise him and leave one scene after other. I had a lot of expectation from the movie I really wanted this to be a well written one. But the story lacks emotions I felt no connection towards any character in the movie. The cinematographer had only close shots he didn't capture things well. The camera movements will cause eye ache during Adheera and Rocky fight one on one right after Reena's death. I can go on and on and on with the flaws in the movie but I am wondering how people have become blinded and support this kind of a movie which didn't have any field excelled at any level. Apart from Ananth Nag in the whole of KGF franchise I have not seen a single actor perform well. Yash was all about walking, throwing punch dialogues, I didn't see him act at all. He had a straight face. The villain was weak and for god sake the costume that rocky wears during his meet with prime minister of India is the costume of Allu Arjun in ala vaikuntapuramulo. Atleast they could have changed the Color. It's totally overrated and doesn't deserve what it is enjoying now. Hope Prashanth Neel will atleast give a good movie in his next.",

It might have the so-called spices that makes up a summer blockbuster but the screenplay is quite immaterial, hardly written with thought and care, and even to a point predictable. And Raveena Tandon does the finest in the acting department while the others only scream and yell - if only that could be called acting?! Yash does fine in getting the commanding presence required of his messiah plus gangster plus monster image in Rocky but his style and panache does get in the way of actual emoting.

F: Chapter 2\" is a thrilling action film that is sure to entertain fans of the genre.",

The film succeeded in portraying Adheera as a fearsome character (at the beginning) but his fearful presence was degraded after he just casually shot Rocky (who was all alone) from the comfort of his army being around him. Rocky then took his revenge by doing the same which then fueled their final battle which was an utter disaster mainly due to poor choreography, visuals and a scene transition every second.What a big disappointment for a movie awaited for 4 years!",

He uses guns along with swords to fight which seems ridiculous.The heroine is reduced to a showpiece and has no role whatsoever. In the police station scene, the hero shoots mindlessly and everyone watches him without slightest resistance/defence.The good things are the cinematography (never seen before in any Kannada movie) and acting performance by Raveena.Loud and unnecessary BGM haunts you throughout the movie.

That's what he did in the Movie, placing goosebumps scenes at every 5 minutes on his screenplay. Rocky is larger than life character.. No he's more than that so it's not easy to convince the audience that whatever he does but Neel convincingly delivered it. He created a dark World called KGF and pulled the audience into it to see the Action adventure of Rocky. People love rebellious stories but here Rocky was not completely a Rebel but people in kgf see him as the one, that's also the main reason audience loving this movie.Yash has the dynamic screen presence as Rocky. His attitude and actions were the big plus to pull down this Mega character. But Ravi Basrur is the real monster here, he Rocked the every scene of the movie. But same like kgf 1 i didn't like the editing style of Neel, it's giving headache. The other technical aspects were amazing to watch in big screen. With this budget they pulled off a stunning quality of making in many Points.Now the things that I didn't like was Neel has the ability to pull off the commercial scenes with high octane moments but at the same time he's not concentrating on the logics and the loopholes in the Screenplay. Because of people enjoying the High octane scenes they're forgetting/forgiving the logicless writing, but how long can he survive like that coz at a point people become fatigue by watching same repeated stuffs, so he must concentrate on his writing. He got the superb core story involving a mother son relationship and a Place like hell that dying for a Saviour and the Saviour becoming a National issue.. with this kind of story I expected a super solid screenplay from Neel but a disappointment for me. So personally I felt as an average commercial Movie with Adrenaline rising moments.Overall KGF is a crowd puller.. definitely a treat for Action movie lovers. A perfect masala entertainer.",

That's why some ppl say 'there is no plot in the movie', 'leave your brain in your house', etc.I watched it twice on an OTT platform. The subplots are seamlessly connected together - and subtext provided :) - like, the CBI clock not working, and later on, Raghavan correcting it. Also, the PM's strategy changes after Rocky's 1st interaction with her, and then after he kills Guru Pandian.There is nothing confusing or illogical (like Inception, Matrix) or trivial (needless comedy and songs). The narration is fast, that's all. The only annoying thing for me was that I had to change the volume for fights and dialogues. But the BGM is so good that I forgot about it.I had read about illogical fight scenes and Rocky's assaults on the parliament and police station. When I saw those scenes, I also saw our hypocrisy - we accept Superman and Spiderman flying in the air and jumping between buildings, or the 3 Idiots hero-turned-midwife delivering a baby - but Rocky cannot fight multiple ppl. I will convince you guys - his mother gave him the superpower, okay? Think that, and we are good to go :).Two 'pleasant' surprises in the film - (1) Raveena Tandon's acting is excellent. I hope she gets more such roles. Rocky worships Kali but a Kali-like Prime Minister baits him in the end.Side note - Some called his 'Entertainment' dialogue as sexist, but did not notice that it is a woman who brought him down in the end.(2) There is no preachy idealism and pretensions of doing good to society - Greed is good :).Rocky is Yash. Rocky is you and me - a human being shaped by their circumstances. And even though the director does not want to give a social message - ironic - there are many things to learn from Rocky's story, many more than from Inception, Matrix, Superman and Spiderman... Salaam, KGF team !Update - May 21: Hindi version review. I saw twice in Kannada. Not one moment was boring, again :).Sanjay Dutt appears clumsy in the Kannada version but his original voice makes him convincing.With her original voice, Raveena Tandon gives me 'Smitha Patil' vibes :).

            "content": "= No SPOILER, nothing. Only talking vaguely and giving my own opinion without any mirch masala. =Let me be honest and tell you the problems. Lol\n---\nFirst thing first, I enjoyed the movie. :D\nNow regarding problems and Over the top actions sequences and many egocentric decisions took place throughout the movie. Even the fact that life of a boy was decided by his mother,even though i won't argue, but still it felt a bit forced, but i know, it's not bad, kinda swayed the whole vibe for me as such things only take place when we think about villains = as in cruel treacherous villains, you know what i mean, right. As we always say, see his past is the reason for him being like that =\nBut for Rocky i have a different feeling. He is more like a Antagonist but not a villain. It's like he has that vibe and the aura. He is like a person you wanna cheer for. So i was always thinking of him as MC. But now i think he is, Anti-Hero kinda being. Which is also my favourite genre btw.---\nOver the top actions could be a bit problematic, but they made it such a fast show of actions that it didn't really bother me. I get that from the first action scene, They are not trying to show me how well he fight.They are just trying to set the tone and Let people's imagination run wild. Which IMO is a very good way to avoid OTT Action and at the same time having a similar impact, if nothing less.---\nSo TBH not much of a problem anywhere.Latest movies released like,\nRRR and BEAST.ALL have problem with logic and actions were so illogical and let's say done with idiocy that i was kinda sad. But still, they all did one thing.Giving us anime style fight scenes which you can enjoy with popcorn.But still by the end i has this complaint in my mind. Like, why do this? Why your knee suddenly become allright that you can jump run, while just a min. Ago you can't even walk. How can broken knee just become allright, when soldiers specifically break them and didn't even gave you enough food and so on. SO it was so much, that finally i stopped my brain like\nIt's ENOUGH, just stop. See this as you are seeing anime.That's it.OTT Action was much less in BEAST. But still, fighting with sword against soldiers who are fighting with AK-47, and so on. Was so stupid. That again i stopped my brain.---\nBUT in KGF Part 2 and even in part 1. They didn't give that much of a vibe of OTT ACtion going on. Which i loved. So i must say, I love their execution.That's it.Believe me, don't go for spoilers.It's a great movie.And they made it a fast movie, with blood pumping all around. Adrenaline and everything will just burst. Didn't get bored even for a sec.I got to see Rocky bhai rise, his fall, even him being egoist and even changing toward this greedy and bad person, and also see how his people tried to bring him back to his previous Rocky, only to get things worse as his enemies attack. And he lost everything. And again he rises.And as we all know, as a criminal rocky will eventually die. So no suspense in that. But still his journey was worth seeing.",

            "content": "To sum up in a line - \"Has to do with the craze, hype, expectation, strategy, pulse of the audience and the PRODUCTION QUALITY\"To untie the strings of the rope,1. EXPECTATION WAS KING\nExpectation is what made us sit in the cinema hall for a whole 3 hours for this movie.2. WOW PRODUCTION QUALITYCongrats, there is a promising production banner that is fit to build and raise movies as brands, bringing up awaiting films by promising story tellers. Producer is doing Hollywood level fiction movie crazy stuff with really viable money. He has achieved a grand production quality with comparatively less money. A 100 crore budget is killer value.3. STORY STRENGTH WAS... BADYes it made 1000 crores, but wait till I untie it. It's a great business success. In terms of story continuation, this is one of the good blunders that script writers can offer the intellect audience....The How...\nPrashanth Neel who had built a great justifiable story line for kgf 1, now has broken its value. He has broken the legs on which kgf 1 actually stood strong on. The character whom people loved, has made way into things which it shouldn't be doing.ACTUALLY THE PROMISE WAS BROKEN.The moral way of upbringing by mom, his situations, situations at the mine, his mentality had nothing to do with him when he was a ruler.No mother will be proud of a kid who goes and becomes the sultan of a place to do the same cruelty which the mother experienced in her life.His mom never said him to be cruel and careless to make more struggling mothers like her.WORST CHARACTER JUSTIFICATION\nRocky rules the same way as Garuda, no respect or kindness at the lives of the thousands, including kids, the slavery\ncontinues but at HIGHER PACE.The human values are not concerned, but tragically the human values itself built this character in the first part. PPL initially connected with this character due to qualities of natural hunger, kind moments and helping poor people understand their self esteem. But they are destroyed mindlessly in this sequel. These leave the character worst justified at the end, making blunder with a good character.4. PULSE OF AUDIENCE IS CAUGHTEven Garuda was powerful in kgf 1, but PPL didn't connect with him to raise voice for him. But they connected with rocky character bcz of certain good elements shown at instances in kgf 1.Now when Rocky does bad things like garuda now, the audience shout, whistle, bcz they know from kgf 1 that he is the hero of this film. Their job is just to support the leads. It's called CONVINCED MENTALITY.Prasant knows this and understands just what a major chunk needs. He said he cares about the business of the cinema more, so maybe he kept the story plot aside, as he knew that PPL would go crazy with non-stop action scenes playing one after another, which was enough for him.5. UNNECESSARY STORY ELEMENTSAdhera. He was only here to create craze, more craze. To add some more unrealistic or uninteresting old school fight scenes. Even if you take the character Adheera away, the story runs very well and even the cinema. Bcz, his part just enters at random times, when the hero has no other obstacles to handle. He comes irregularly. He seems kind of Hit and Run. His intentions though were told, did not catch the minds very much. He seemed like a goonda or a supari killer attacking a famous person.And the Scene of Mastermind Reveal behind all the KGF incidents. The worst. Many didn't even notice it coming and the scene slipped in seconds leaving many not even to notice it. Many who saw the movie don't even remember this scene.6. I LOVED IT MOMENTS\nAnd hey buddy, I love the climax. And even some scenes specific. Well created. Climax stands out, bcz it does connect deeply with the emotions of the audience. The promise uttering in the background, him drowning, every gold biscuit diving turning, and his tremendous idea to take all gold from anybody's hold, I liked it. Especially the idea that he promised his mother to give her all the gold and now he is going to his mother ( ocean/earth/water is even a mother ) and how he presents it to her metaphorically, director's cap effort.7. THE REAL HEROES\nGrading, VFX, cinematography is really an elevation and in reality is the real jaw dropping point to many international audiences. The DOP department has grown in skill. The Viking shots, the action sequence shooting, the car chasing scenes, the backgrounds. Art department needs hats off, it has crossed its limits.8. MUSIC, BGM, CRAZE\nBGM? Great, but wait... It has to do with the past. KGF CHAPTER 1.Ravi Basrur could have flowed innovative sounds, variant tones, different pitches, different joner sounds. There's a monotony that's similar to sharp roaring stretched to 3 hours. The bgm of kgf 2 is mostly a better produced version of its preceding one. No changes, it seemed just loudened, tweaked with extra bass and noise. No memorable songs. Remixes of ch.1 are played.9. REALLY WHERE IT WENT WRONGThe first part was almost PLOT DRIVEN and yea even Character driven as I told you before, but suddenly the next part of the sequel turned out to be extreme masala mass Paisa vasool action compilation, and no interesting story. This is what threw the intellect audience's breaths down.10. WAS IT REALLY INTENSE?It was fast enough to make the audience confused. Many things didn't happen, but it happened very fast and quickly, enough for audience to say \"INTENSE\"\nReviewer Kairam Vaashi said that when he was watching the movie, he pondered over the cars and thought, \"Did These Skoda Cars exist at those times?\" and shared that he felt this, though he had seen the same cars in chapter 1, he didn't feel this question while watching that car in chapter 1. This shows another dimension where it went wrong. In such an intense no eye-blink kind of fast pace movies, if you can notice and ponder such details like what was written on the gun, car model etc, i.e if you can materialize the set even along with connecting with the pace and story, then it says the emptiness/predictable nature of the scenes going on that makes room for such thinking time. Only one thing that could have filled it was an intense story line that matches the pace of the movie.Not all fast moving movies are intense.",

But after you get done watching this masterpiece, you will have no choice but to appreciate the director Prashanth Neel's work as even though the film had quite a simple story, the presentation is what made it remarkable. Either being the moral of the story that circumstances of life turning a good guy into a bad guy or a mother's eternal love, one will only indulge and cherish the essence the movie carried during one's watch time.",

KGF both movies are no doubt best action movies in indian cinema with list of bahubali and RRR, but Prashant neel need to learn from rajamauli on how to conclude a movie. It appears Director is under a lot of pressure of expectation. A story must make it forward naturally but here it has forced to reach a end and to cover all character. Although this movie has already made a history. I have analysed this movie on different aspects.1. Story: Chapter 2 is full of loopholes and forced narration. Although this story has a connection to common man but it not truely explain why a mother want his son to become most powerful man on earth but not tell any ethics ?..He just want to be powerful with no ethics and he is hero of the movie.2. Direction: Very confused and reaching nowhere till end occur in a forced way. Many scenes are appeared without logic and this shows director is very confused with respect to expectation from first part.(7/10)3. Acting: All actors have done justice to their roles but this film does not provide character justification and importance, such as Adheera. Director should give more depth to these characters but he misses.(7/10)4. Action: Full on best part of movie(10/10).5. Music & Background score: Songs are average and not good. Basrur disappoint this time. Songs from first part are better.(5/10)Although background score is good. (9/10)6. Editing: Could be more better and it is not smooth as chapter 1. (6/10)Hence overall rating is 7/10 and chapter 2 is disappoinment w.r.t first chapter. Still it is shining star of kanada and indian film industry.",

            "content": "\"Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet.\" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.",

As per the papers, it is not operational because of \"environmental concerns\". But let me ask you a question - does any country or company cares for environment if they actually find a gold mine? Forget gold - In India there are illegal mines for much cheaper things like coal and soil. Do you really think they would stop mining gold?With this movie, at least try to see what is actually happening behind the closed mines of KGFs. Is it actually closed, or is someone's illegally mining over there?",

            "content": "If KGF is going to be remembered for anything 100 years from now, it will be for the work of Ravi Basrur and Bhuvan Gowda. The background score and cinematography are better than those of every other Indian movie and are integral parts of what make it so impactful with the masses.Coming to acting,\nYash has been superb, his broken English is really fun. It is rare to see method acting in a massy movie so what Yash has done here is unique, he just lived through Rocky and not many people might be knowing that he has written his own dialogues in this. Also, credits to Sachin Gole for being the voice of Rocky in the Hindi version.Sanjay Dutt as Adheera has that frightening presence on the screen, his Vikings look, the fear he has among the people in KGF makes for a perfect antagonist to counter Rocky. He has changed his voice to deliver the dialogues which again makes his character more impactful.The costume designers have to be appreciated for the look of the 2 most important characters which increases their effect tenfold on the screen.Raveena Tandon as the authoritarian Prime Minister Ramika Sen has more of a grounded approach,with only the dialogue-delivery to show her acting prowess, which was much necessary because 2 other main characters have those larger than life roles. Having played the romantic interest to hero all her life, for the first time she got a character with substance and did more than enough to leave a lasting impression.Action scenes were a bit below expectations... mainly that car chase was very poorly executed. They went for frequent blackouts with editing and not for a long shot which looks natural and is pleasing to the eyes. Similarly in the last fight of Rocky-Adheera, they have focussed more on the hits and punches rather than making it look natural with a continuous take.But this scene of Kalashnikov stood out above all others and will be in my mind for a long time. Its setting, followed by the violence dialogue from Rocky made it a sequence you would pay for.The love story was cringey and problematic, and absence of Reena's character would not have made a difference to the otherwise gripping storyline.You will find people absolutely hating this movie, mainly here on Quora, and calling it a brainless mass entertainer even without watching it but with Prashant Neel at the helm of affairs, KGF is far from being something like that. You find good use of foreshadowing and symbolism assisting the storyline which massy movies usually don't have. Even props like Rocky's hammer, Adheera's sword, the caution board come into play in narrating the past or showcasing the victory of a character. The reaction takes with extras have an important part in helping us connect with the emotions of the people inside the screen, something Rajamouli used to good effect in Bahubali. In addition to that,\nThe set pieces used in Rocky and Adheera's entry scene, the play depicting events of Chapter 1 in the song Toofan, the Kali Puja in the song Sulthan look marvellous.The dark sepia tone perfectly suits the crime world of 70s-80s, the movie is set in.When we compare it with movies like Bahubali or RRR we need to understand that the makers of KGF are quite inexperienced, i.e., Prashant Neel had directed just one movie before KGF and hardly anybody outside Karnataka knew about Yash before it... There were very high expectations with the sequel as well so the audience could have easily got disappointed but even after approaching this large audience, getting massive succes in Chapter 1, Neel stayed true to his filmography and came out with flying colours.Rating: 8/10.",

Right through K. G. F: Chapter 2, I couldn't help but imagine what it must have been like for Prashant Neel to watch The Godfather for the first time. More than the whole film, I'd love to ask him someday about the impact its climax left him with as he watched it in what I imagine to be an old theatre, wherever he grew up. Like the iconic theatre scene in Cinema Paradiso, this moment must have been Prashanth's big life-altering moment, his metamorphosis where he not only discovered the magic of movies but also the concept of \"mass\" before it became a thing. Without sounding too dramatic, something must have clicked in him because there's no one here who thinks in intercuts like this man.",

This type of movie can be only experienced in big screen and big sound. What a screenplay and direction. I can't imagine how this film is made. Big popular commercial Bollywood directors and producers can only wish they could make such film. Yash is macho no 1, looking forward for more. But credit goes to Prasanth Neel sir, Thanks for making a True Indian film with indian actors. This movie proved that a director with vision, story writer and screenplay play major role crafting every single character, scene and experience making a good film. Being fan of Sanjay Dutt, director executed Sanjay's best performance to date. Bollywood stop remaking south indian films and take the credit worldwide, bring your own content creativity, put some decent effort in your art. South indian movies Full Jhakas guru.P. S. And 5 more stars for not including Nora Fatehi item song, would have killed the desi vibe.",

            "content": "KGF - CHAPTER 2 Hindi is the story of a man who faces new challenges after successfully taking over an empire. Rocky kills Garuda (Ramachandra Raju) in the Kolar Gold Fields, aka, KGF, and takes charge, much to the annoyance of Guru Pandian (Achyuth Kumar), Andrews (B S Avinash), Rajendra Desai (Lakki Lakshman). They had expected to rule KGF and take over its immense wealth. However, Rocky, with the help of the slaves who consider him a messiah, usurps the throne. He even kills Virat (Vinay Bidappa), brother of Garuda and the heir apparent to the KGF throne. Rocky however spares Vanaram (Ayyappa P Sharma), the commander of the army at KGF. Vanaram, angry at first, joins Rocky and trains young kids who become the new guards of the territory. Rocky discovers that there are several unexcavated mines in the area and he orders the men to start extracting gold from these places. The idea is to discover as much gold as possible in the shortest possible time. Meanwhile, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt), brother of Suryavardhan, the founder of KGF, was presumed dead. However, he is alive and arrives at KGF for revenge and to claim ownership. He smartly gets Rocky out of KGF and shoots him. He allows Rocky to survive so that the word is spread in KGF that the terrifying Adheera is here. Rocky recuperates but realizes that no one is able to move out of KGF as Adheera's men have surrounded the mines. Meanwhile, Shetty (Dinesh Mangaluru), Rocky's ex-boss in Bombay, has tied up with fellow gangsters across West and South India, and plans to act against Rocky. They are also dealing with Inayat Khalil (Balakrishna), a dreaded gangster from Dubai. How Rocky fights all these elements forms the rest of the film. Prashanth Neel's story is excellent and pays a nice tribute to the angry-young-man and gangster films of Amitabh Bachchan of the 70s and 80s. Prashanth Neel's screenplay is highly captivating. Despite such a vast storyline and so many characters, his writing flows smoothly. Also, he is aware that audiences expect a lot of massy stuff from KGF - CHAPTER and in this regard, he makes fans very happy as he has peppered the narrative with plenty of clapworthy scenes. The Hindi dialogues are very powerful and further enhance the commercial appeal of the film. A few scenes work big time just due to the acidic one-liners..",

F : Chapter 2 review : Stunning Action Packed Drama.My rating : 5/5\nPerformances :\nYash is just outstanding with his terrific performance and unleashes his amazing screen presence throughout the movie. Yash continued from where he left in KGF 1. He carried himself with the same intensity and energy. He looked stylish, raw, and rugged and costumes suited his swag and mannerisms. He showed variations in his expressions turning brutal, ruthless, and menacing at one time and humane, and emotional at other times.Srinidhi Shetty got a limited screen presence just like her role in the first part. However, she did full justice to her emoting well.Sanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Though the scenes featuring Yash and Sanjay Dutt are powerfully written, Sanjay Dutt's age showed up on the screen bringing down the intensity levels.Raveena Tandon looked intense as a powerful politician who meant business while dealing with the anti-social elements.Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer performed well and Prakash Raj did justice to her role.Technical values :\nPrashant Neel drove everyone crazy with the hero elevation with mass elements in KGF1 which turned him into a national celebrity. All eyes are on him as to how he will come up in the KGF2. Prashant Neel dispelled all the doubts right from the start to the finish. He filled the entire film with heavy-duty action scenes which knocked the living daylights out of the viewers. The standout stunts included Yash's introduction, the action sequence before the interval and scenes that come up after the interval, and the heavy-duty climax. The stunt choreography is sensational. In order to elevate the heroism of Yash, he even showed Sanjay Dutt in an even more powerful manner. The way he ends the character of Rocky is also impressive. KGF 2 has so many factors that will relate to the masses as Neel takes us to the world of KGF and entertains you completely.Music by Ravi Basrur is a backbone for the film as the re-recording breathes life to the film and all the elevation scenes on Rocky. Audio-wise, the film has all situational songs and is passable on screen.Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is top-notch as he presented the film superbly with his framing. The lighting setup created to showcase the dark shades in the movie is impressive.Anbariv action choreography is Marvelous.Dialogues are intense and production values are grand.Highlights :\nYash Excellent performance\nElevations of Heroism\nTerrific Action Stunts\nCinematography and Bgm\nRich production valuesOverall : Terrific Monster.488 people found this helpful.",

People who follow KGF from Part 1 have a huge expectation for this sequel and Director didn't disappoint the fans in Chapter 2. Quite a lot of detailing went into the script to bring out the true essence of KGF from Chapter one.Prashanth Neel will surely join the list of top directors in India. He deserves all praise and applause for his great work in the film. The storyline is quite simple but the way it was written and narrated makes the film stand out from other commercial films. The inclusion of Adheera and Ramika Sen adds value to the script.In my opinion, KGF Chapter 2 is one of the best commercial films made in Non-Linear format. The film travels back and forth with some interesting twists and turns to unfold the remaining story. Prasanth Neel outlined and sketched all the vital characters with a purpose. The theme of KGF is to glorify the heroic acts of Rocky Bhai but at the same time, each build-up sequence is carefully coined with emotional value. The audience erupts in theatres for all game-changing moments.Yash again proves that he is the best in business to perform a powerful role like Rocky. His screen presence with a rugged beard look and fearless attitude is precise for the build-up scenes. The introduction scene of Rocky in Chapter 2 is a treat to watch. The climax encounter with Adheera gives an adrenaline rush to the audience. There are quite a lot of goosebumps moments in the film and the best among all is the Police Station gunshot scene.Srinidhi Shetty plays a less impactful female lead but towards the end, she performed well to an extent. Sanjay Dutta as Adheera gets a stunning introduction but his role was sidelined in the middle portion of the film as Raveena share the screen as Ramika Sen. All the supporting characters are connected well in the plot. Prakash Raj takes the role of Anant Nag as narrator but it was not engaging as it was in Chapter one.",

Prashanth Neel and Yash have handled the movie like the precious gold of KGF itself. Not just Yash but every characters played their part in this film disregarding the recurring or new faces in the film, especially Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon whose character came with high expectations.

In my view, KGF Chapter 2 could not meet my expectations which was set high by KGF Chapter 1.The Chapter 1 was filled with too much stories compacted in short period of time. It had got war, power, politics, diplomacy, emotions and everything else to make a movie great. But the Chapter 2 is unable to include everything in a balanced way. No doubt that there are great fight scenes with some rare cinematography ever witnessed in indian cinema. But story wise, it is too weak.The character development isn't also in par with KGF Chapter 1. The portrayal of villainous characters are so weak that they only seem strong in their getup and armor. There is no diplomatic play between the characters. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera looks dangerous but the movie portrayed him in a weak way. There's no mind game. They just fight and and the only stronger wins. Other villains like Rajendar Desai, Shetty and Andrew who were portrayed great in Chapter 1 died of nothing. Also Adheera isn't someone who was shown to be like a diplomatic and strong character. Disappointed.This movie is great if you are a fan of Yash and someone who likes fights, guns, slow motions, styles and cinematography. But other than that everything seems forced inside a movie to grab the attention of the audience (which failed in my case). The movie could have been great and better that Chapter 1.Maybe the writer was unable to discern what made people like KGF Chapter 1. I will not go the theatre to watch the Chapter 3 with such weak story.",

F chapter 2 are - 1) Best ever entry scene that audience were excited about. 2) Rocking star Yash's dialogues are so soul touching because his dialogues can used everywhere. 3) Each and every character fit in his/her role. 4) Never seen before Sanjay dutt look and performance even same for Raveena Tandon. 5) Srinidhi Shetty, she is a latest crush for everyone. 6) Music and Songs gives us goosebumps. 7) Everybody wanted that movie shouldn't have any end. 8) Everybody eagerly waiting for 3rd chapter like me. 9) That struggling Yash(Rocky) is so motivational for every youth. 10) Hats off to the director and producer.",

It's a story narrated over continuously overlapping action visuals. I should say that the direction, camerawork and editing is excellent. It is on par with 300 and Sin City. The whole direction and medium used to narrate the story is superb and flows smoothly. Usually I get headaches in action movies, but this was well integrated without overpowering you. Its a must watch in a theater. The visuals on a big screen are great. If you understand the origin language - Kannada, you will enjoy the literary dialogue better, but subtitles are fair enough. When I first encountered the trailer I started comparing it with Gangs of Wasseypur. The reason was there it was story started with coal mines and here Gold mines were mentioned. After watching the movie however I got to know K. G. F. To be a kind of different movie. A movie based on a hero (or a villain). The story is a classic portrayal of waging wars against their oppressors. Few scenes made me draw comparisons to Aayirathil Oruvan & Mad Max Fury Road. The BGM along with the freeze frame action sequences worked out well.",

Where the first part of the story ended, the second part takes it to the top. It is very difficult to take the story of any film to another part and above, but the director has done wonders.When it came to acting, Yash broke all limits in playing the role of a gangster. His style of walking, sitting style, manner of talking, body language and his fight scenes have immortalized him in the role of gangster. Sanjay Dutt looked great in the character of the villain. Rest of the actors have done their respective roles. The cinematography is at the level of the best films in the world. The background music has brought life to every scene of the film. After years, such background music has been heard.To be honest, I have no words to praise this film. Just this film forced me to write. Please do watch this movie.",

Next day I went for KGF-2.I reached theater 30 mins before movie time ...These 30 min were very Hard...I wanted to break open the Entrance and wanted the movie to start at the earliest...\nOnce the movie started I sat like I was giving an exam and nothing goes unnoticed on the screen...\nConcentarion level during movie was beyond imagination...\nAnd then came Rocking * Yash ...Once in your life time Movies like KGF are made..N througout your life you wont stop prasing the movie..That is KGF for me....\nI missed the Post Credit scene so I will watch the movie again...\nEverything is excellent but after Games of Thrones ,KGF2 is the movie whose ending I hate and wished had a alternate ending as Rocky is Rocky ..

If you can put all your rationality aside and be ready to watch a 168 minutes trailer, then you really gonna enjoy it.I liked its prior part for its unique story which tells the story of the people living under slavery and as a commercial, it was important to visualize something that the mass can engage with. And the story and characters circling around the protagonist are common. But when every single move or incident is happening no matter what and dumping random scenes and villains just to prove Yash hyper SWAG is totally useless exaggeration.1)a stretched ending, 2) repetitive scenes, 3)some hilarious fight sequences which were ridiculously long, 4)avoidable plot holes, 5)poor visual effects- overall I didn't enjoy it that much. Sanjay Dutt did not justify the character at all. The car chase sequence was worst edited. The way it was shot, in a start-stop manner, didn't like. The movie was made to be thrilling but believe me, it's absolutely inappropriate in a political context, I would rather watch and enjoy the same type of story in a Viking movie where the fight is the main essence. The movie was made to portray an invincible human without any logical superpower except for blessings from his mother and absolute luck and some motivation from 20years back. The story went downhill for proving Yash the monster or Savior or whatever you say rather than not focusing on the story.Now please don't ask about the Kabir Singh Hyper masculinity effect in this movie, rather just wonder about why Ganesh Gaithonde didn't have muscle like Rocky bhai.",

The direction of prasanth neel and it's also open the doors for them to become international.The action sequences of the movie was awesome (not extra just only how much which needed) it's vfx & overall movie colour tone is also done we'll.Conclusion,\nWhy you need to watch this movie is just simply there is no need but whenever you ask anyone who watched the movie is also recommends you because he's just can't explain you the whole with just the help of words. So you need to experience it itself.After this movie Yash also become a Brand Rocking Star Yash as Rocky Bhai. I hope he would mantain because it's easy to become but very hard to maintain before him so many actors achieved it but very less able to keep it till end.That's all now go watch movies rate over it where you reading this review.",

Loved the way how being a gangster film, it never overshadows a mother's struggles which powered Rocky's life and the lengths he'd go to keep the promise he made to his beloved mother.Absolutely annihilating experience. Rocking Star Yash is a literal Monster and director Mr. Prashanth Neel is a Freaking Beast. This is the only film I watched twice in theaters on consecutive days because I couldn't get enough of it just once. Raveena Tondon has made such a blockbuster comeback not because of KGF but because of her solid performance as PM Ramika Sen and Sanjay Dutt looked like he'd rip you in half if he ever wants to. Terrifying. Srinidhi Shetty did a good job but didn't have much to do in the film which was a little bummer because she was shown to be a badass in KGF Chapter 1.Still can hear those vocals in my ears, making me shake with thrill and giving goosebumps, Mr. Ravi Basrur has nailed the art of decorating every scene with his beautiful music.Long story short, I love KGF, Chapter 1 & Chapter 2. One of the Greatest Film Franchises EVER in India. Many films would come and go in future but nothing will hit me as hard as KGF films did. These Films are Historical.",

The protagonist though unreal resembles a multiverse where a common pneumoniac kid destined to die, can grow up to be an inhuman but still bleed driven by a weakness( his humane side )which propels him to save some if not all. Loads of review online discuss about an over the top story, and I agree but my question to them is, why do you watch a movie? To forget your present, sometimes to remember the past, and sometimes to look for the future. Why can't there be a movie which talks about a resembling past (the ravina tondon performance did remind me of our own Iron Lady with all her shortcomings), a motivation less covid stricken present (where every one is confined to their own dark deep mines) and a selfless future (where your being is in commensalism with others). But just forget about all my bull sh**, watch the movie with a lovely sound track, on a Dolby sound, forget about the in-consequentialness of life, and remember the incapabilities of a father to create another Rocky (pun intended). You will get it when you watch the first half. Thanks.",

I am noticing this from the first one. The dialogues in this movie are way to impactful than needed for a commercial film or that we have seen in a commercial film for a long time. Kudos to the writing team. The entire trailer was just dialogues and still it gave so much about the characters. It was incredible!I have never felt content and satisfied after watching a trailer. Gosh.What a magnanimous dialogue \ud83d\udd25\nSurely this movie is going to break all records of physics.Action, BGM, cinematography, editing Everything is done so precisely that you'll forget to notice the Acting \ud83d\udd25\nI'm gonna book the whole theatre so I can save the audience from this torment \ud83d\ude0d Destruction at box office including cinema halls \ud83d\udcaf\nNow as you are praising the editing and the dope visuals you might think the budget became huge... in fact for an Indian film the budget is big, not huge. The budget of KGF chapter 1 was approx. US$ 10.6 million, but for the chapter 2 it is just 25% of increase from prequel's budget, i.e., approx. US$ 13.3 million, which is a very low budget for any Hollywood film to make a KGF range of film.With that much budget also to make such an impactful and visual spectacle film... can be done only out of an maverick vision and hardcore passion and determination.",

With a screenplay that was all over the place, characters getting introduced at a pace faster than a meteoroid's crash, and a story that picked up only post-interval, I was a bit lost too early on in the film. It was only Yash's introduction scene and his superlative performance that I thoroughly enjoyed. Also read: Prashanth Neel on KGF 3: 'If people love it, we could continue the franchise'",

Sanjay Dutt's 'Adheera', Raveena Tandon's 'Ramika Sen' and Srinidhi Shetty's 'Reena' deserve applause. But the most favourite character was Rocky's Mother ( Shanthama) played by 'Archana Jois'.\ud83d\udc4c\nAll the songs and their placement was lit. Especially 'Thoofan', the song itself gavs goosebumps. All the characters who was given enough space and delivers good performances.

The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.",

            "content": "A prior thing i want to tell you before i write the review :I am a college student and a hostelier , i was having some work in college but i left that in mid just to come back home and watch this movie . My friends in college says South Indian movies is all about illogical action scenes , no story , i told them before leaving , we have already proved you with Bahubali and many more . I reached home & asked my friends from hometown to come with me for the movie , they showed no interest & urged me to watch Zero , fortunately the only theatre in my hometown is showing KGF movie . So , i went to watch it alone & it's better to go alone than going with friends & getting their negative words for the movie while watching .Analysis :Only one line for the movie \" Once in millennia\" From the screenplay to the dialogues , the movie was commendable .Before the intervalFirst half is full of action . The entry scene of Yash is amazing . Yash is doing role of character \" Rocky\" . The child actor has done his role at its best . In first half , lot of characters are introduced , you have to remember each and every actor as they have their role further in movie . The first half is story instigator with mind blowing action scenes . A small love story of Yash , and you know that any love story in South India is incomplete without action and same you will get here . In first half what i adored the most , the goosebump giving scene is the last scene before interval . I will not tell you what was that , just go and watch , and i hope you will love too ............................INTERVAL.......................Was too much hungry , as i skipped my breakfast and lunch to come to home from college and without taking any rest , i ran to watch the movie , so bought some chips , cold drink . After interval , some favourite ads of my friends again came.....................................................................The second halfThe real story began in the second part of movie. I personally like second half more than the first. The second half is what makes me the die hard fan of this movie. Again a lot of dialogues , that song showing mother love for her child Rocky completely caught attention. I am waiting for the movie songs to release especially that \"Sultan\" song. The tremendous work of Yash , his superb acting skills , all are beyond imagination. The terminating part of movie is unexpected and left curiousity in the minds of audience. I think the movie ended at a phenomenal stage, if you will not watch Chapter 2 that's also good , because the Chapter 1 despite leaving some suspense , can say it to be complete. But the story doesn't end here. The movie is elongated for the second chapter of the movie .For screenplay : 4.5/5For direction : 4/5For dialogues : 4/5Overall rating : 4/5Review for the movie : A Simple line \" Going to watch this movie again \"Yes , this movie put a smile on everyone's face and made everyone's day . As , I already said i love the CHAPTER 1 and second part perhaps not required but i also want this movie not to end here , eagerly waiting for the CHAPTER 2You can hate South Indian movies , but you can't ignore the emerging Yash and KGF . Zero movie is not running well , it's expected that KGF will get more screens , of Zero also .Edit : Some people are comparing Bahubali with KGF by saying KGF is not even near to position where Bahubali is but on being opposite to their reviews , I like KGF more than \"Bahubali - The beginning \" . It's truth that KGF will be criticized and people are criticizing it too. But what can we say, it's their views.EDIT 2 : Watched the movie for the second time , still same curiosity.",

He carried himself with the same intensity and energy. He looked stylish, raw, and rugged and costumes suited his swag and mannerisms. He showed variations in his expressions turning brutal, ruthless, and menacing at one time and humane, and emotional at other times.Srinidhi Shetty got a limited screen presence just like her role in the first part. However, she did full justice to her emoting well.Sanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Though the scenes featuring Yash and Sanjay Dutt are powerfully written, Sanjay Dutt's age showed up on the screen bringing down the intensity levels.Raveena Tandon looked intense as a powerful politician who meant business while dealing with the anti-social elements.Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer performed well and Prakash Raj did justice to her role.",

Sanjay Dutt matches him in presence. Prakash Raj is nuanced as the narrator of the film. Raveena Tandon is impressive and you will wonder why she did not get such roles in her prime. From Rocky Bhai gaining sole control over Narachi to how he makes one quick escape to return stronger, it is one helluva ride. The visuals will linger in your memory for a long time. The team has shot at JSW sites, which gives KGF 2 the canvas of brown, grey and black. Ravi Basrur's scintillating BGM lifts up the sequences and you cannot help but stay transfixed to the screen. Another star of the film is cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda. The aesthetic of KGF 2 is a lot like Mad Max: Fury Road. Prashanth Neel who is part of the writing team ensures scenes loaded with dry humour and witty dialogues. With references to nepotism and secularism, KGF 2 taps into the modern milieu.",

I don't blame RRR, their setup were great, but in budget Of 90cr this movie is a gem!There is no much chemistry shown between male and female lead roles, but I assume that was the aim of the movie, it was more of gangster movie than romantic entertainer!Coming to dialogues! This was best I enjoyed, every dialogue was written carefully, and well executed!Negative role by Sanju Baba, he did his best! The cruelty was well portrayed!The action sequences are good and worth watching! All variants of action sequences are shot, martial, lethal weapons, car stunts and fights, traditional weapons and etc! So the full efforts were put on action sequences!My hearty congrats to the KGF2 making team, they made a paisa wasool movie!",

Another plus point of this movie which makes it better than other action movies are the realistic elements. The story feels real, the action scenes are practical, the set pieces are real and so are the Emotions that this movie conveys.

However, for the rest of us Indians, Indian cinema offers an entirely new experience.Just one word: \"Masterpiece.\"",

This movie is definitely not for you.Now for people who love ENTERTAINMENT at its purest form without restrictions, this movie is going to give you the best and only leave you hungry for more. I have seen many people complain about the jeeps jumping up when Yash shoots the chain gun (No Spoiler - Already shown in trailer) but think about it for a second, does it really matter when you are lost in the glory of the screenplay, the visuals and awesome BGM which accompanies it. Yash a.k.a Rocky's attitude, his style and way he delivers his dialogues are unmatchable. Most people again complain that movie is full of Build-up scenes/dialogues. But again none of it matters when thats what the mass audience actually paid for. Again for people complaining \"how one person can kill so many\" or question logic , I dont think we ever questioned Keanu in John Wick or Stallone in Rambo or Arnold in Commando... did we? I dont atleast want to be biased or be harsh on our own people.This certainly is not just a movie for us Kannadigas but a festival, a success we all like to celebrate whether we are fans of one actor or other. It really is a proud moment today that people all over India and the world are comparing Prashanth Neels work to the likes of S. S. Rajamouli's Baahubali.Whether you love him or hate him there is no denying the fact that Yash is the man because of whom Kannada movie industry has broken/set all kinds of records today and has taken our industry to the greatest heights.Arrreyyyy dont think too much yaar. Just go and enjoy the movie in your nearest cinema hall while it is still there.P. S. - For people who want to watch this movie - Please watch K. G. F 1 in Amazon Prime before watching this so that you can get the best experience of Chapter 2.",

And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.",

            "content": "The plot of this film connects with its predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see K. G. F: Chapter 1.The night after detailing the events in K. G. F: Chapter 1, Anand Ingalagi suffers a stroke and his son Vijayendra takes over for K. G. F: Chapter 2. Rocky kills heir apparent Virat and takes charge as the kingpin of Kolar Gold Fields (K. G. F), keeping Reena hostage to ensure the cooperation of Guru Pandian, Andrews and Rajendra Desai, and kills Kamal when he protests. He issues orders to start work in eight hidden mines. Exasperated with K. G. F, some central ministers plan a no-confidence motion against the DYSS-supported government to bring Ramika Sen in power. Meanwhile, Adheera resurfaces and kills all guards at an outpost. In a ruse to bring Rocky outside K. G. F, Andrews kills Desai to lure Reena outside, and John captures Reena. Adheera shoots Rocky but spares his life, while his men roadblock all gold exports from K. G. F.Meanwhile, Shetty ties up with other subordinates of Andrews across the Western Coast and exterminates Rocky's allies. A recuperated Rocky along with Reena visits Dubai to deal in gold with Inayat Khalil, but Khalil had joined forces with Shetty. Rocky's aides kill Shetty's associates and recaptures the Western Coast, and Khalil deals with Rocky and sells him AK-47s. Rocky and his gang gravely wound Adheera and kill his henchmen with their newly acquired weapons. Meanwhile, Rocky's henchmen threaten the ministers against the vote and the no-confidence motion fails. Rocky kills Shetty, gaining control over Bombay. Pandian warns Rocky of Sen's rising stature but he disregards him. Reena develops feelings for Rocky.Three years later in 1981, Ramika Sen wins the Indian general elections and becomes Prime Minister. After CBI officer Kanneganti Raghavan briefs her about the situation in K. G. F, she closes all state borders and authorises him to raid Rocky's warehouses. A young Ingalagi is caught spying by Rocky's henchmen, but Rocky is impressed by his integrity. The CBI find nothing in their raids save for a 400 gram-gold bar. Rocky retrieves it from a police station and singlehandedly brings the place down with a DShK.Rocky stops all exports from K. G. F and starts hoarding gold. Andrews requests Adheera to kill Rocky. Rocky's aides trace his biological father, a drunkard who abandoned his family, and Rocky anoints the unaware man caretaker of his mother's newly shifted grave. He also gets married to Reena. Rocky meets with Sen and hands her a file exposing his involvement in money laundering but she cannot consider it as almost all her party members were complicit in the corruption.Adheera obtains information about a secret passage to K. G. F and informs Andrews. Adheera, Andrews, Daya, John and their gang attack K. G. F with Khalil's armada. Just as Reena announces her pregnancy to Rocky, Adheera fatally snipes her. In the ensuing clash, Rocky's army kill Andrews and Daya, while Rocky kills John and Adheera. Rocky and his henchmen disrupt Sen's resignation speech at the Parliament and kill Pandian. Pandian had staged the attack on Garuda for which Adheera was framed, and informed Adheera of Garuda's attack priorly. He was also the one who showed Adheera the secret passage, goaded Andrews into hiring Rocky, staged the no-confidence motion drama in Delhi and persuaded Shetty to join forces with Khalil just to gain Rocky's trust.Sen issues a death warrant against Rocky and enforces the Indian Army. Rocky evacuates K. G. F and leaves on a ship with his cache of gold. He signals the Navy to his location but refuses to surrender. Sen issues orders to bomb K. G. F and his ship. Rocky is killed and drowns in the ocean along with the gold, which stays lost till date. Before leaving, Rocky had formed a new colony for all K. G. F workers. A young Ingalagi decides to write a book on Rocky. In a mid-credits scene, three months post-Rocky's death, a CIA official hands over a file listing Rocky's crimes in United States and 16 other nations between 1978-1981 to Ramika Sen. In the present day, the peon of the television news channel finds the final draft of K. G. F: Chapter 3.",

Answer is, it gives us an amazing dose of action packed sequences, heavy dialogues, protagonists hustle and all this packed with a beautifully written solid story arch which explains that why our antihero acts in a particular way.But when we see these movies we see alot of things put in as fillers which doesn't have much to do with story arch but have been placed just to make the movie a little more interesting and entertaining. Well that's not true with K. G. F 2. It serves as a well written well executed project which holds you to your seats and you just don't want to miss even a second in the journey. Amazing performances, great action sequences, and the touch of mother's love brings every thing to a solid conclusion. You might think that the ending could have been the other way around, but I think what happens does full justice to the role of our anti-hero Rocky.I just hope we get to see yash performing again as Rocky.

There was no subtitles to compensate that.I would suggest the movie watchers to go and watch the movie in original language which is in Kannada or wait for the OTT release in Amazon Prime.

And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.166 out of 214 found this helpfulsriramthestranger14 April 2022\n9/10\nGoosebumps overloaded!!The screenplay, cuts and sound effects deserves a standing ovation. There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie. There is hardly any sugarcoating to the criminal angle of Rocky, and it is more of a man with a promise to fulfill. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a honest 'masala movie'!!",

That was a new level of brutality. When it comes to violence, Adheera was scary in first half, but as soon as Rocky Bhai upgraded his brutality level, things changed drastically. Even that machine gun scene at the police station, that fear was too level. He has that tall, muscular build, with a massive private army equipped with Kalashnikov and machine guns.

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nKGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.",

            "content": "The people who fell in love with the first chapter, I can safely say that they are in for an absolute delight. It's bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it's nothing but an Action Junky's dream come true.Regardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn't fully sold on it.Halt the hate train and just let me clarify...I have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as \"Adheera\". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.Now when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don't get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it's just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.For Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It's her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she's fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.Looking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don't get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!I'm telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it's truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense.",

The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. With electrifying cinematography, a phenomenal background score by Ravi Basrur, and beautifully crafted action set pieces, KGF 2 in its true sense is a Monster-piece.

There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief and that is the success of this movie.

Mother's emotions was the highlighted part of KGF.

It felt rushed, lacked depth, and filled with gimmicky action scenes. The movie was so loud that it made me numb and at times had to close my ears.In KGF1, Rocky's acts were justified as he had a motive to set free the slaves by taking down Garuda. In KGF2, all the fights feel pointless as the motive is not clear or they're not justified enough.Now it has a huge box office collections, not sure how they are going to approach KGF3.

            "content": "An ode to Indian cinema.We have all been there with gargantuan scripts, experienced the grandeur with epic films like Baahubali ; whereas KGF revels as a relatively modern day gangster flick.Cinema being a multidimensional medium provides an immersive experience. KGF does that to the seeker. Its immersive ability takes the audience to a zenith that pretty much most of Indian cinema has only dreamt of. The movie besides its bells and whistles , is a benchmark to the technical abilities of cinematic prowess.The script is an high octane filled drama that sweeps ones feet as a Scarface saga. As a movie it is a feast and a festival like none other.As the main character, Rocky (Actor Yash) is the king who literally sways us with his swag like Rajnikanth and bloodshot demeanor of angry young man Amitabh. As Rocky Bhai , given his voracious appetite to control the gold empire, Yash is menacingly an unstoppable juggernaut. His ambitions are madly bolstered by a riveting screenplay, monstrous visuals and a background score that seamlessly lends to the cause.Except for a few movies, Bollywood with its utterly decrepit scripts could never do justice to the talent of Sanjay Dutt. KGF unearths Sanju Baba's volcanic persona with its Magnum opus. We get to witness his full potential and also get to assuage those Vikings/epic drama characters through him.Raveena Tandon with her notable presence gives a stellar performance. She has very few scenes but they speak volumes of her ability.Not to mention all the other key figures from the mother (Archana Jois) to actress Srinidhi to everyone else. The mother character is pivotal as it tethers to the emotional connect in this movie and Archana Jois bares her soul. Srinidhi illusively embodies the arm candy in a certain measure yet she is magnificent and marks us with her presence .At the climax, the face off scenes between Yash and Sanju are just high octane moments. This movie is a visual feast that gets supplemented with a mesmerized background score.As a viewer the movie is an answer to ones prayers, the longing to derive perennial entertainment. Overall this is the Indian Avengers moment of its kind, our very own super hero universe. Personally speaking, Yash is not only going to lord this universe but Prashant Neel sets the bar very high for Indian cinema.",

So was KGF-1, but it was a good presentation and entertainer.Also to the critics of machoism, the film is shown to be a old story that is being narrated. It's the old Indian machoism that's displayed.Chapter 1 had some very good silence for the villains which made their performance powerful.Proper placement of powerful music added the charm to chapter 1.Over-all the chapter 2 is not at par with chapter 1.",

            "review_title": "Perfect",
            "content": "I've watched the Hindi-dubbed version and found it to be PERFECT!To the logical mind, the movie just won't make any sense. But if you accept the fact that Prashanth Neel has created a universe where characters are driven by emotions and that they take actions based on the demand of the situations they're in, you're in for a ride. You'll then realise that everything and everyone are in sync with their roles in this universe.The film revolves around Rocky and his objective of fulfilling his dead mom's last wish of dying rich and powerful. He doesn't care how it happens-such is his love for his mother that he doesn't mind bending the rules and going against the law of the land to realise his goal. In that sense, he's flawed and an anti-hero, and that's what makes him so interesting and intriguing. I daresay he's one of the best-written characters in the history of Indian cinema. He's multifaceted, complex, twisted, and brilliantly layered. He's also extremely foresighted. It's as if Rocky was a distinct person that finally got projected onto the screen!Speaking of Yash's performance, Yash is Rocky. The guy embodies Rocky to the extent that nobody else can play him. It'd be difficult to see anyone but Yash as this iconic character. I hope he sweeps all the Best Actor awards for his work.Sanjay Dutt as Adheera is scary and menacing, and I wish he had more screen time. But then, if the story demands only so much of his presence, it's fine by me.Raveena Tandon as PM Ramika Sen has delivered her career-best performance. I really can't wait to see her again in KGF: Chapter 3!Everyone else has done their job equally well.The love-angle issue that many are pointing out could have been resolved by giving more dialogue to Srinidhi's Reena, but I guess the makers didn't feel much need for it, as they trusted the actor to emote those parts. Personally, I felt she conveyed her inner emotions well, and if you get a good sense of how Prashanth Neel's unique universe works, you'd understand Reena's actions and motivations better.The direction and screenplay are top-notch. There's so much going on in the film that I totally got my money's worth! Each scene has been crafted with perfection and precision. Staying true to its title, the film ensures the most amount of empathy for the people of KGF rather than for Rocky alone. It's when he does something for these people that we feel the empathy for him. It's when he doesn't forget about them in his quest that we feel something for him. At least that's what I felt.The cinematography is fantastic, and the BGM is goosebump-inducing. The editing, with those black cuts, suited the film's mood and tone. The set design is out of this world, and as for the VFX, I wonder whether it was even there because everything looked so real! Everything in the film has been dialed up to the highest notch, and rightly so, given the film's genre, setting, and scale. Anything under, and the film would have failed to impress.Overall, KGF: Chapter 2 is a must-have big-screen experience. I'm looking forward to catching it again on both the big and small screen. The movie has such a haunting quality to it that it makes me want to revisit it again and again. The Nanare Naro Nare Nare Na lullaby is especially mesmerising.Watch it, and allow your subconscious to unpack the movie in the hours and days after. There are so many symbolisms, metaphors, and connections at play that I was simply amazed. I could see how each and every moment in the film has a context to it and how the movie has several hidden connections with Chapter 1 that aren't too obvious immediately. At the same time, if you're someone who insists on political correctness in books, films, etc., you'd have a hard time digesting this stuff. I'm no fan of PC, and I detest the word, \"practical,\" so I could enjoy this film undeterred.I highly recommend KGF: Chapter 2. Not merely as a movie, but as a distinct experience that is rare to find in Indian cinema.",

Some might feel senseless action and flying cars which do not obey the laws of physics. This movie is not for the hypercritical. This movie has a very unique factor which is the strength of this film, which is the entertainment factor. Go to this movie leaving your physics book at home to watch fantastic visuals and very quirky conflict-ions which you might not get to see in any other genre. The strong points of this movie are Cinematography, BGM, and over the top dialogues. It is hyper dramatic and loud. But that is the style of this movie . It is more like a graphic novel made with real life action setting. Definitely go and watch this movie with your gang to have a ball , chill out, experience the bloody, cool and over the top action film like you enjoy a DWAYNE JOHNSON film. Don't try to make sense of it's quirkiness. That is the point of the movie .",
