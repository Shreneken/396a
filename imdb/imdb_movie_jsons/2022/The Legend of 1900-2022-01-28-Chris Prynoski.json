            "content": "First, I think it should be a fair warning that this show is for mature audience. It has lots of violence and swearing. If you are uncertain, watch the 1st episode and see if that's your cup of tea.I found the show very entertaining on multiple levels. It has great story, humor, live and strong characters and excellent voice acting. Maybe that's because the main actors are actually voicing their own characters that they played on the 1st season of Critical Role. They created the characters so they know them inside out.I found the story to be progressing too fast. Maybe I am used to the Critical Role show and watching them trying to decide what to do for hours. In the show, all happens within minutes.The story and atmosphere are also both very dark so far. A lot darker than I had anticipated. I was expecting some parts of the show to be like that but I also expected to see some of the beautiful places of Tal'Dorei. So far, no dice (pun intended). I am hoping they will balance things out in the future.Nonetheless, can't wait for the next episodes.",

At the moment, I'm only on Episode 3 of the first campaign but the reason I'm not in deeper is because...well, the series is hours long and I can't be at my computer all that time.Regardless, I am happy that I don't have to be 100% familiar with the series' lore to know what's what. At least I know who the main good guys are, who the cast is and when the fun begins. I am so happy that the fans helped make this possible through the Kickstarter all those years ago.I only hope we'll get more from this than just the two seasons Amazon ordered.(Side Note: I also wish for the day Fantasy High from Dimension20 and CollegeHumor might be able to follow in CR's footsteps and get their own animated show, even if it is just online)",

Has character building. The animation is awesome. The theme song is really nice. Got elements of humour in it. There are obviously elements to relate to here and there despite being fantasy. You really tear up on few scenes since they are so powerful. You can connect to the characters. This is one of the best series I have ever watched. This never feels kiddish at all. Well, one due to swearing, seems natural. It is exactly how adults would react if such situations arise and they have such powers.They won't just go and sacrifice their lives.If you are thinking I am fake praising just watch few episodes.

It's a bit rushed and force and we don't get much time to care about any of the characters or process what's going on.Character development is bad for almost all the characters. Vax and Keyleth go from never talking to one another to instantly being in love. It comes out of nowhere and has no time to grow at all. The only character who has half decent development is Percy. Everyone else is a bore. Pike is another one who comes out of left field. Her development happens way too quickly and we never get a chance to know her first.The humor is mostly terrible. I don't mind potty jokes or cussing at all. I LOVE South Park, and that's a show that does crude humor right. But it seems like Vox Machina's creators think that saying the F word randomly = funny, and that *any* sexual reference = funny. 90% of the time the jokes are just forced and lame. Cussing for the sake of cussing isn't funny, it's just bad writing.Overall I finished this, so it wasn't awful, but I was never pulled into it at any point.",

The first two episodes are a pre-stream arc that we've only heard about, and now we finally get to see it. This arc gives Vax and the other members their first lesson which is... no matter who you are, ALWAYS do the right thing. It saves livesthe ending of the second episode introduces one of, if not, my favorite arc of campaign 1 in introducing the Briarwoods. Here, i love that matt is voicing Sylas, it was the only way to do it!Overall i think the voice acting is fantastic, and there is nothing to complain about because nobody knows these characters as well as the voice actors. They played them for years before creating this show!WARNING: this show is more than rated R and has soooooooooo many adult themes and actions as in language (F words mostly), violence and gore, and nudity (as of right now, a short oral sex scene in the first episode that lasts about 15 seconds. Boobs, buttocks, and a slight glimpse at a man's testicles is seen)...this is exactly what i wanted (minus the sex and nudity)",

Sexy, rowdy, and evoking genuine investment in the characters through their onscreen cameraderie, banter and slowly unfolding respective backstories. Absolutely gorgeously animated, easily the top tier of current Western fare, stunningly choreographed and unsurprisingly voiced to absolute pergection, this show represents the true joy of imagination and escapism while roleplaying. It might be the one small hurdle to a mainstream public as some beats might not always feel the most natural, but it doubles the enjoyment for those of us who are familiar with these voices and how the game works with the layer of meta in which it blankets the show.I can't imagine how the immense crowd of backers must feel, watching their dream come to life and seeing that every single cent was well-spent. I hope this opens the door for more grassroots animation projects.Right now I have the difficult balancing act of ravenously waiting for the next batch of episodes while also not wanting the show to ever get closer to an endpoint. Here's hoping its success will ensure many more seasons to come.",

It has that baseline crude humour which has made Rick and Morty a hit and given it a cult following.The Legend of Vox Machina ('Vox Machina') provides more of that same crude humour. There aren't any high brow, think about it for a minute before it becomes funny, jokes in here. They smack you in the face like a full diaper, pick it back up and hit you again with it.The storey of Vox Machina centres around a band of misfit adventurers that have very little going for them, who are drafted to kill a monster destroying the kingdom/realm. Are they up to the task? Probably not! However, they give it their best, and... Yeah, I'm not going to spoil it for you.You're going to have to watch the show for that. Sorry.I quite liked the animation of Vox Machina, which isn't as over the top when compared to most Japanese Anime, and isn't crude like a lot of animation done in the past 10-15 years. It's high quality, well coloured and varied.The voice acting is very good. I don't know many of the actors here, but you can tell they're getting into their characters, trying to make you believe in the story, the world and their animated lives.On a final note, Amazon have only dropped 3 episodes so far. Hopefully the show retains the current level of humour, animation and voice quality and the story progresses nicely. I'm looking forward to more.If you're one of those people who is a little high strung, is easily offended and gets annoyed when someone farts in your general direction. Don't watch this. You're not going to enjoy it. If you like Rick and Morty, The Boys or Invincible, then this is likely to be something you'll enjoy as well.",

Violence, blood, dirty jokes, swear words and not holding back with \"adult stuff\"! This is not for kids and that is exactly what i wanted!I hope a lot of people outside this bubble give it a shot, it is really an really good series and the idea behind all of this are people that dont have profit in their mind, they really CARE and LOVE DND and the story/characters they have created over the years!

If you have played Dungeons & Dragons (like me) you will have tons of fun recognizing spells, actions, monsters, and how unhinged the collective stotytelling can get, as well as how dramatic and emotional it suddenly can turn. The characters are flawed but compelling, which makes me look forward to how they are going to evolve together. They have distinct personalities that mesh well with each other and cause for fun interactions, which is only emphasized by the cast being close friends in real life.It has definitely earned it's R-rating (so be mindful if that is a turn-off for you!) but for me it's delightfully vulgar because it really capture the spirit of roleplaying at a table with close friends in a high fantasy setting.

It's not a perfect show by any means, but with some character work and an excellent finale, \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" proves itself to be worthwhile show, despite some of its rough patches. A good watch if it's what you are into.",

They weren't bad (except Scanlan), but they didn't feel like real characters. The source material feels like a podcast (it is) with real people who talk and have conversation. I thought the 7 main characters were were more caricatures of the people they were based on.Season 2 fixes that and is great. The plot slows down and has arcs for all of them to shine. The action is just as good (with better CGI) and there's more of it. I thought they were going to squeeze this part of the story into one season but it appears to be taking up at least half of the next season. I thought they were going to cut an arc that Scanlan went through but they executed on it well added depth to him.Anyway Season 2 is like Season 1 with deeper characters.",

Then there are those who seek to turn every session into The Lord of the Rings.Some of the best times I ever had as a TTRPGer were when my friends and I just goofed around and had fun in game. Vox Machina screams of people doing just that, much as the Critical Role campaign it comes from.Most of the negative comments seem to be from what I'll politely refer to as \"The Puritanical Brigade\" outraged by the language and humour and the notion that there might be sex in an animated show.It was never marketed as anything other than an adult-oriented show. The trailers did not shy away from showing either language, humour or gore. Yet it seems to come as a complete surprise to some people that these things are present throughout each episode.Now, in the past I have decried crass humour and the like. But that was in shows that were never meant to contain them in the first place, like the awful Shannara Chronicles for example. Vox Machina, by contrast, never offered the \"Lord of the Rings\" as the model to judge it on. It is, and always was, a bunch of friends having fun playing a role-playing game, along with all the banter, interactions and humour that come with that territory.As for the show as a show? Well the animation feels a little rough in places, but it has a style that reminds of the 80's quite strongly. It is perfectly fine, though I'd be happier if they added a few more frames here and there when the action heats up.It is impossible to fault the voice acting either, since the original voice actors from Critical Role are reprising their roles here. If they don't know how their own characters should be, then who would?Story-wise it's a familiarly simple TTRPG, session-based affair with no real surprises as to who is good and who is evil. It's not anything ground-breaking, but it is serviceable and let's be honest... you're watching more for the characters than the plot.Overall, I'm finding it fun and entertaining, much like those TTRPG sessions of old. Now all I need to do is get a T-shirt with \"I played D&D before it was cool\" on it and I'll be set!SUMMARY: Harmless roleplaying fun aimed at grown-ass adults, not ones who use the term \"potty-mouth\" to talk about language. Gamers will get more mileage out of it, especially if they, like me, have fond memories of their own gaming exploits around a table.",

            "content": "Overall i enjoyed the fantasy world, adult-themed jokes, blood and all the stuff you'd rather avoid showing to kids. It felt fresh.. and gory. This review gonna have spoilers.Introduction to the world was pretty good. Tbh I got baited by the shows first scene aka Suicide Squad, where we follow 'wrong' team only to see their demise. Then we meet our \"correct\" team. Gotta say in the bar scene i did chuckle more than once, which is quite amazing achievement for a show.In all honesty I have hard time coming up with saying the good stuff. There are plenty of things there that i liked, but.. Lemme just focus on key aspects that didn't work all that much for me.Show tries to tell us that Dragons are capital B - BIG problem. It's the stuff you need an army to beat. Okay. Makes sense. In D'n'D fighting a Dragon is the finale of an adventure. In Vox machina... Killing a Dragon, Apex Predator, The Magical being with a status \"legendary badass, do not touch\" is used as an introduction to our teams teamwork. I liked how they killed the dragon.. But you simply DO NOT do that. It really wrecks with power levels. It's like Harry Potter beating Voldemort in the first book, or Luke killing his Vader and Imperator right at the start of his jedi adventure. Again, I liked HOW they killed the big winged lizard, but it's poor choice for the story.My second problem is kind of continuation of the first: Power levels. The magic powers in this world are really wonky so to speak. The biggest offenders here are Pike and Keyleth. Key' is the inexperienced adventurer/successor to elf throne (or something). And her power is inconsistent as hell. Sometimes her spells hardly do anything, while other times she's literally a walking nuke of a mage fueled by the shounen power of \"because i really want to\". It's difficult to invest in story when few spells do nothing, only to the final one making up for it by 10000x cause 'reasons'. Pike on the other hand is a paladin of sorts. Her powers also resemble drunked seismograph. They work.. Untill show decides she has faith issues... Then she's out of the team for a while only to return as a demigod spewing enough power as if she's some kind of magical dynamo of invinite power. She teleports as astral projection to different country, then she can fly, mass-enchant, mass heal, shoot lazor beams, throw light-weapons left, right and middle. And even with all that power she's only usefull untill director says \"okay, you can stop now\" and her power tap is turned off. And it's not that she loses her power. Her power simply stop being a threat. What a stellar script... If it was written by a highschooler. If you think this is cool and totally good writing, then you are the type of person that gets amazed by toothpaste advertisments and you shouldn't grade anything, cause it's beyond your mental capacity.Another thing is the world itself. It's a high fantasy world. You've got loads of races. Alot of magic and magical beings and.. Both the king and the \"army\" is as mundane as my socks. If you don't see the problem.. Imagine Fort Knoxx (a big safe full of gold in Kentucky) having its locks made out of.. lets be generous and say: paper. Oh \"but what about thieves\" you say? See, you know that thieves exist and therefore you know you need proper defenses and mechanisms to keep the gold safe. In the world of Vox Machina king has zero protections whatsoever. The guy was literally enchanted/hypnotized on a banquet WHILE EVERYONE WAS WATCHING. There should be at least 50 alarms, or 10 mage-guards turbo-vibrating getting ready to fight. But there's nothing. The army in this world is also a prop. Only to show if something is scary by showing how quickly it minces the \"army\" in gory scenes. They hold zero value on their own. Hack writing.Overall: kingdowm is a joke. Army is a joke. Sovereign isn't even a quest-giver but a teritary side-mention of least importance AKA he's pure incompetence in a form of a joke. The world is simply fake. And................ I understand why. It's all about Vox Machina adventures.. But if that's the case director should have simply removed the uneccessary bits. Remove all the unimportant things like: kingdom, king, army, royal council (which is also a bad joke). We don't need to see that. Use it only if you have a goal in mind. If it doesn't add half a sh to the world, then don't bother, cause you'll constrict yourself later. Just fcus on the team and adventure. Well.. It's too late for that now.My final of the \"this world makes no bloody sense\" problem is how nonsensical the main plot is. Long story short: one of VM members is Percy. His whole family of high-nobles has been slaughtered. Stuff like that doesn't get hushed up. Especially not when those nobles were ruling a pretty big city. Director did try to cover it with some excuse, but that was so god awful I can;t even put it into words. If we were to go by real world example: imagine country.. Lets go with USA.. where first thing you, as a prisident, learn that whole council and mayor of... New York kinda got bored and quit their job, gave it away to some random hobo. You don't get any info beyond that. Soon after the whole city closes its borders and you no longer receive any informations from it. As a president, you'd send whole damn ARMY to check what the f is going on... But out incompetent director using the power of a script made an excuse that it's fine cause we tried to send few scouts and it failed tee-hee.This whole plot would have shattered in thousand pieces if on the banquet Percy said out loud who he is and what has happend to his family and by whom, which should have caused a cascade of reactions and actions. But that is.. if the world was actually well written.Ok, so this ends up my list of \"BIG BADs\". The \"small bads\".. I'd say I have only 1. The character of Grog. I don't have anything against Drax ripoffs. But this one was just.. His dialogue and \"i am very simple barbarian\" way of talking was mishandled. Not to mention the voice actor just doesn't fit the person in my opinion. But VA voice is the smallest problem here. Overall Grogs way of talking was fake as hell and it felt like someone scraping a knife on the plate whenever there was some banter.On the \"so good I need to mention it\" list we have Voice Actors of Vex and Vax. Amazing job. They are pros. And whatever they get paid I can say one thing: it definitely was not enough. Then we have whole character of Scanlan. Also quite interesting. Rest kinda existed and thats the best i can say about them. Sorry.---Should you watch it? It's a decent show. I liked it and i dont regret spending around 3 hours on it. If you can tune out logic it gets alot better. Although saying \"after lobotomy this show gets really good!\" is a very low crap-bar. Director is a newbie at his job and it shows. And if he's not a newbie, but a veteran... Then I don't think he should be anywhere near directors seat.If you like gore, adult jokes (of varying heights.. and lows) with decent'ish-at-best western animation.. Go ahead and watch it :)",

If you like very raunchy humour, which I do, there are some laughs in this show. If not, it might not be for you. The story is varied and interesting, and there are some great and memorable villains in here. I think this would make an excellent video game, preferably 2D action, or even a 2D side scrolling beat em up, where you get to choose from, or switch between the seven heroes. The cast of villains would make for great end of level bosses. While on the subject of the heroes, they are varied, and every one is memorable. The episodes are about 25 minutes long, which is a perfect length in my opinion, and there are 10 of them, so not too much to get through. If you like animation and raunchy adult humour, coupled with an adventure, check it out. It's quite a lot better than the massively overrated Castlevania, and as an added bonus, it's not woke, at all. Highly recommended, for the right audience.",

It's a shame because other characters, particularly Pike, Percy and Keyleth so far, have really been given depth and development that adds to what they were in the OG campaign and there's some really moving scenes. Pike's development and story has been absolutely masterful and could not be more antithetical to the completely one dimensional Scanlan of this series.The animation itself is incredible, as are the rest of the cast, full time members and guests. Certainly there is plenty of crude humor in the live streams, but in the scope of the entire campaigns so far, it's not the unending steam that the animated series has chosen to embrace so fully., and some of it is funny and it has its place, but too much feels forced here.The OG characters are all incredible as are the folks voicing them and they are all ridiculously talented and capable of creating tension, drama, tender moments and laughs without having to go for the low hanging fruit/base humor for every single laugh.I hope Scanlan evolves into more in future seasons, but honestly this just really makes me want a Mighty Nein adaptation so much more instead.",

However, there is no way this show deserves a 9 or 10, maybe if you are a long time cr fan and you've already watched this adventure in their podcast form, you were able to get more nuances as to the characters relationships and find little easter eggs in the show that made you go \"YAY! There's the thing that i know from the podcast!\" But, for everyone else, there are certain dialogues and scenes that are unnecessary and thrown in there purely for fan service.However, all that being said the journey that the heroes take was very entertaining and kept me watching for all 12 episodes, but again gets ruined by the absolutely unsatisfying ending! I was really disappointed by how the villains were built up for like 9 episodes and then for them to have little or no impact at the end. Maybe season 2 will change all that, however, the way the villains died were so lame; and then immediately we were thrust into another conflict right at the end, it was so absurdly abrupt. This probably worked very well in the podcasts but it does not work here.Now, the show wasn't all terrible, i really enjoyed the middle part of the story, especially episodes 6-10, there were some great and tense moments there. And going into the final 2 episodes i had the show at a 7 or 7.5 even! So even though the ending was unsatisfying, i still would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys fantasy.My rating system is based on the scale where 5/10 is considered an average show, it's a show that's fine but doesn't do anything unique but is still enjoyable, so a 6/10 is above average for me, and that's what this show is to me, it is slightly above average.",

Dialog was fun at times, action was good, we had dark humor here and there and though there were boring parts and constipated characters (clerics... lol), it just worked.

Like all works made for a specific audience, it focuses on gaining views through fanservice rather than solid quality.Why does Vex seek information about dragons from a magic items dealer when she herself said she's an expert on them? To introduce Gilmore for no reason other than to make a cameo appearance, of course.Why does Uriel hire Vox Machina as the exclusive protectors of Emon after a single task they were lucky to complete? To set up the series without all the adventures in the original story to back it up.Why does Grog yell \"I would like to rage\" out loud? Because that was his player's catch phrase in the game of Critical Role. Think about how absurd of a battle cry that would be for an actual fighter in a fantasy universe to say in character. It's like Keyleth yelling \"I would like to cast call lightning on the dragon!\"I'm sure this show will be enjoyable for critters all the way through, myself included, but objectively people have to realize it's not a 10-star show.

            "content": "Second season just finished and my review hasn't changed much. A lot of fetch quests and strange storytelling for a series until you remember is all based on D&D campaigns, so the weird pacing somewhat makes sense. A new adult animated series on Amazon Prime created by Matt Mercer and his group Critical Role. I've followed Critical Role through Twitch for a good while now and I hadn't actually realized this series was based on those old D&D campaigns until recently, so of course I immediately decided to give it a watch. For those that don't know, Critical Role is a group of very fantastic voice actors in the film/tv/video game industries who all play D&D (and other games) live streamed on Twitch.tv. Matt Mercer stars as the dungeon master and uses his incredible story telling talents (and voice acting) to bring massive worlds to life. This new series, The Legend of Vox Machina, is an animated series following the first D&D campaign of that group as they team up to take down evil wizards, fight dragons, and save the city. Being created and starring the group that it does the voice acting is of course superb, and the humour brings over the same banter and quick wittedness the group has always offered; lots of f-bombs, farting, and chopping off heads. For anyone who at this point is at all interested in what I've said so far, I would say check this out, its only a single season so far so is fairly short, and was very entertaining the whole way through. It's sort of an Invincible but for a D&D based fantasy world. All that said, the general plotlines and backstories (which they are sure to rush through a bit for every character) aren't told incredibly deeply and often fit some pretty basic tropes of everyones first D&D campaign. That being said throughout the series you can almost imagine the real world group of players above the table, something that can either bring its own charm to the series or the opposite leave a bit of a narrative distaste when things fall a bit flat. In terms of \"ragtag group of adventurers going off to save the world\" series I've watched recently I'd have to say Andor > Willow > The Legend of Vox Machina > Dragon Age: Absolution > Witcher: Blood Origin, if that helps see about where it sits. It has its moments and was fun, almost as good as the 1983 Dungeons & Dragons animated series. Long live Venger!",

It's a DnD campaign, but select parts of it since animating the whole thing would have required 100+ episodes. This show is literally a dream come true for any DnD group. But since I have no prior knowledge of the 1st campaign this series is based on, I'm also not too blinded by expectations.The show is basically about an unlikely party of adventures doing DnD stuff. As this show doesn't cover any sort of back story of how they met, we're left to either speculate or watch the streams of the campaign. But even though we don't get any of that, the group is extremely fun and charming to watch. The show's humor is extremely ranchy and juvenile, and I love it. This is exactly how DnD games are: everyone just having fun with their characters and making the occasional dick joke then actually doing the objective if they have the time.The chemistry between characters also feels very natural, despite me not knowing much about their relationships besides the two siblings Vex and Vax. You can see the different levels of intimacy between different members. From the budding love between Keyleth and Vax, the close friendship between Grog and Pike, and a bunch of other more subtle dynamics. It's all very well rounded.The other characters aren't anything special, unfortunately. Other than the main villians of the Briarwoods, all the other characters are little more than props, comic relief, or flashy roadblocks. What I mean is, none of them are very interesting. Just their interactions with the party bring about interest.As for the plot, it's serviceable. The world building feels slightly phoned in, though. With the whole thing just feeling like a generic fantasy setting. Lots of the details on the Kingdom don't make sense if you think about it, too.Luckily, most of the plot involves a main character's backstory so it kept me engaged since this party was the only thing I really cared about in the show. It had many clich\u00e9s, but I didn't find myself hating it since the whole adventure was still a joy to watch. The best parts were when the party needed to solve some sort of immediate problem and seeing how they did it was always hilarious and fun.The show probably isn't for everyone. I've seen many reviews bemoan the humor and the ranchiness, and I can see some people not being into it. All I know is that it, combined with the charm of the main cast, were the highlights. Even though the side characters and world building were pretty bad, it didn't matter to me since most of the show revolved around its best parts, Vox Machina.",

It is crass, it is raunchy, it is violent, and it is grim. The trailers truly do not prepare you for the level of adult content in this series, and it does this well.I will admit, it will not be everyone's cup of tea. You will know if you want to continue by the end of the third episode, but I do implore that you watch it to the third episode. The first episode is very crass and raunchy. The second episode is very violent. Episode three, however, shows the true heart of the series once all the characters are introduced.Critical Role, and The Legend of the Vox Machina, are very character focused stories. Yes, there are grand plots surrounding them, but it is the characters that are the focus. And the characters are fun, charming, and engaging. Of course they are. The original 'script' was 'written' by a bunch of trained actors enjoying It is a bunch of actors who are also friends doing improve for four or so hours. So, when it came time to actually perform as these characters outside of the sessions, they had already played these characters for literal days' worth of time. 450 or so hours.Now, yes. There are issues. Episode one is a bit heavy on the crassness and the raunchy. Some of the writing is heavy handed in episode two. Despite this, it feels less like a consistent part of the series and more early installment weirdness or growing pains.It is a good series, and if it sounds like something you might enjoy, I do recommend it. The animation is beautiful, the character design incredible. The fight scenes are the complete opposite of half-done, and it is just a fun ride.For those Critters out there wondering how the series handles the source material, I will say that there are a lot of changes. How we meet the Vox Machina in the original streams verses when we meet them in the series. A lot had to be streamlined and a lot of fat cut, and I feel that these decisions were justified and best for the show.There was so much to the pre-streams that we missed. So much story, so much character, that starting in medias res would be confusion, and the audience would have to play catch up just to understand the history. Not only that, but the actual plot of the season starts 24 episodes into the original stream. Simplifying things makes it easier to consume and easier for new people to engage with the characters and story.Don't go into this expecting a perfect recreation of the episodes. It's simply not possible, not realistic, and utterly unfair to the hard work and passion poured into this show. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride.",

            "review_title": "A satisfying fantasy adventure adaptation",
            "content": "I'm a big fan of Critical Role. Everyone in the cast and crew, and guests, have a history of putting together a terrifically entertaining show, and churning out excellent fantasy storytelling. On a personal level, CR helped to get me through a dark period in my life, as has been true for many others. All the same, I think I have enough distance from the fandom to maintain a broader perspective on the company and everything they produce - and that also means 'The legend of Vox Machina,' perhaps their most ambitious endeavor since Critical Role's humble beginnings in 2015. What I see (in the first season) is a satisfying rendition of one of the most beloved story arcs of CR's first campaign, and of an additional story that took place before the stream began. I won't say that it's perfect - it's not - but I deeply admire the strong effort, and I think it's sufficiently well made that established fans, and viewers unfamiliar with the source material, can all enjoy the animated version.The extensive cast of LOVM is a treasure. Everyone that reprises their roles from the live stream show is a joy, of course - all professional voice actors, and it shows as they bring gratifying spirit and weight and to their performances as the adventuring party. Meanwhile, the list of people attached to fill supporting parts is flat-out impressive. It's a bit sad that not all are given the opportunity to truly illustrate their talents with the dialogue they are given, but all nonetheless turn in (thusly limited) portrayals that bring the characters to life and give a hint of their greater skill set. Among that supporting cast, Grey Griffin stands out above the others for an exceptional contribution: Delilah is as complex as she is villainous, and the venomous fire and gravity that Griffin brings to the part outshines everyone else who spent time in the (any) booth. Practiced as all are, hats off to veteran voice actor and director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, herself a guest on CR many times over, for her guidance in realizing a story she knows so well.The animation is truly top-notch, as audiences have come to expect of Titmouse. The production here plainly recalls the fluid, natural, action-oriented style of the studio's most dynamic work, yet perhaps with a refined edge that shows not just the extraordinary budget that the whole operation had to work with, but the development of skills over many years - and, of course, the approach best suiting an epic fantasy story. The visualization of characters and settings previously seen only in our imagination, or in fan art or cosplay, are given beautiful, vivid form befitting the grandiosity of the tale imparted through Critical Role, but also of the genre at large. And when it comes to rapid movement, spellcasting, combat, blood and gore, and so on - I admit I don't tend to watch many cartoons, but I have a hard time believing that what we see here isn't representative of some of the very best to be found in 2022. This is a marvelous feast for the eyes, and with a core focus on horror violence for much of the first season, the visions before us are very satisfying for how unsettling they are.I think it's worth noting, though - as wonderful as the casting, voice work, and animation are, frankly the high quality was a foregone conclusion. There was no chance these aspects wouldn't dazzle, especially with the people involved. Of greater interest to me generally, and I think more important to assess here specifically, is the writing. How is the story? How is the adaptation of the saga fans know in such detail? Is this a series that can appeal to newcomers while still sating the hordes of \"critters\" that enthusiastically devour all the lore and content that CR, their collaborators, and fellow fans can serve up?Everyone in the writers' room had an immense task before them. Each episode of Critical Role, as a stream of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, is anywhere from 3-5 hours long on average; a single combat encounter, seconds or minutes long in-game, may well last 1-2 hours in real time, or more. The Briarwood arc that constitutes 10 of the 12 half-hour episodes in the first season of 'The legend of Vox Machina' played out in about a dozen episodes on the stream. Shrinking that ponderous volume of story into a handful of hours of animation, adapting it for critters and uninitiated viewers alike, and doing so while keeping the heart of the narrative intact, was honestly an unenviable, daunting undertaking.Much more so than not, I think the writing team very well succeed in conjuring a satisfying rendition of these tales. Though I repeat myself, it's \"critical\" to remember that this is an adaptation: some beats and characters are effectively unchanged, while others are expanded or diminished in their significance or personality. Some facets and story beats are truncated, while others are omitted outright, or altered in favor of a new twist that better serves the format of a 30-minute cartoon. Some of the changes are less stimulating than the original presentation on the D&D live stream - while others are if not better, then at least just as delightfully electrifying. Without betraying spoilers, I think in particular of an encounter that the party has at their home before setting out to settle business with the Briarwoods. What we got on the game's stream was great - and though LOVM's take is different, in its own way it's equally awe-inspiring in the least, and certainly more viscerally horrifying.By and large, I think 'The legend of Vox Machina' is a tremendous endeavor that has paid off handsomely. Yet it's not without shortcomings. One does one's best to put aside the above-game shenanigans that have lent considerably to Critical Role's skyrocketing popularity from its very inception, and even the smaller moments to play out in-game apart from the core story arc. And still there is so much content we got in the streaming campaign that is sorely missed in this adaptation. I don't even mean specific proper nouns of the story - but rather, perhaps more substantially: the full emotional weight, the impact; the thrills, the dark dread, the utmost horror, the uncertainty, the tragedy, the love, the triumph, the pride. What shades of these notions LOVM delivers are mostly just that - shades, mere slivers of not just what we got in the live stream, but of what storytelling as an art form should convey. Furthermore, with rare exception, the cutting complexity of the characters has been reduced to a decidedly simplified interpretation that struggles to spark the imagination. Some character traits, character development, interactions between characters (the principles in particular), and some story beats have been both condensed and amplified to an extent that is unmistakably artificial and forced (e.g. Keyleth's growth; Vex's haughtiness; a budding relationship). And while as a fan of Critical Role it's hard not to smile at small references to other moments that canonically took place elsewhere in the story of Vox Machina, or in the story of The Mighty Nein in the stream's second campaign - I'm just not sure that these are always woven in organically, or convincingly.I think my criticism boils down to two points. Firstly, in trying to adapt and open the saga to the widest possible audience, the writing scales down every aspect of the storytelling, yet in so doing tips its hand too far and trims away some of those very elements of what makes the tale of these ragtag adventurers so endearing and rewarding in the first place. And secondly, to some measure, LOVM feels purely like fan service. I believe LOVM would be entertaining and worthwhile for a CR neophyte, but the necessary abridgement of the narrative extends to the characters that are a part of it, and the feelings that it should stir in us. However much 'The legend of Vox Machina' may be enjoyed by someone who has never watched so much as a fan-made highlight video of an episode of Critical Role - it also comes across as a passion project to retell the same story in a new medium for fans who already have the context to most appreciate the reimagining, and all its flourishes, regardless of whether any given moment has been reshaped with all due meaningfulness.In fairness: as events escalate in the latter half of the season, the writing broadens to allow every charged emotion to feel more momentous, nearer to what it should. Moreover, the final three episodes feel like the best possible animated realization of these crucial, cataclysmic story beats. Still - maybe the critiques I offer are harsh, yet they come from a place of love. I love Critical Role, the stories they tell, and that 'The legend of Vox Machina' was able to exist at all. Everyone involved should be proud of what they've accomplished; every person with a hand in the creation - the chief CR cast most of all - obviously poured tremendous energy into the production. I think it's a roundly entertaining, deserving venture, one that I'e no qualms about recommending to anyone receptive to fantasy, and animation, that alternates between varying moods, levels of violence, and types of humor.I like the series and recognize what it does well - I just also see where it falters. I think that general audiences would find this a good time, yet also understand that my overall favorable opinion still carries bias that could amount to rose-tinted glasses. Meanwhile, my foreknowledge of Vox Machina canon also arguably limits my enjoyment compared to those watching with fresh eyes. There's no one correct response here - after all, storytelling is an art, and art is subjective. All I can say is that while my expectations for (the first season of) LOVM were perhaps met incompletely, far and away I consider this to be an admirable, landmark endeavor, and I look forward to seeing what comes next.A job well done, everyone. Now - is it Thursday yet?",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this show and it almost lived up to my expectations. As a fan of the original youtube dungeons and dragons series with Critical Role, I was not disappointed by the return of these characters and their portrayals.A few things I think are the weakest aspects that need to be worked on. The writing, first of all, is the weakest part of the show. They have great characters and the dynamics between them are brilliant, naturally, it's just like the dnd show. But the writing is underwhelming, some of the dialogue is just meh and the plot was also meh and not as interesting as it could have been. I've seen weird reviews on here from uptight people over the crudeness of the jokes and behaviors of characters, the characters are like that originally. They need to improve on the writing massively for season 2, a better fleshed out plot that is split up into episodes in a better way, more realistic and interesting dialogue, and more of a focus on each main character. Please stop making Keyleth save the day every damn time, same with Pike, each character has amazing potential and there was many times another character could have done something to save the gang but you keep defaulting to Keyleth and Pike, they need to work on that predictability for the next season.The next thing they need to work on is the music, while the credits music is the same rhythm as the original theme song, it all needs to be more epic and less underwhelming, I'm looking for some iconic music and a consistent and memorable overarching tone, at the moment the music is very underwhelming and there is no specific character music or Scanlan songs, which were one of the most beloved aspects of the original series Scanlan's songs.Lastly, there needs to be a way for them to make the show stand on its own two feet, while my mother and I who watched it are fans of DnD, the show needs to pay homage and respect to the original series and their characters while also adapting it to newer audiences, it's a hard balance to achieve, but seeing feedback from season 1 should be helpful in achieving that.Overall, it has great potential and I will be watching season 2, hopefully they take what I spoke of into account and make this what it should be, iconic and wonderful. The animation is straight-up incredible, some of the best I've seen, it's flashy and beautiful but not distracting. The voice acting is on point as expected. The character dynamics while not 100% what they should have been, were still incredible. I'd still recommend people watch the show! This review is from a fan that can still enjoy a show and highlight the problems, I'm optimistic for season 2.",

But if anything, it's made me give up on it for good, and that's frustrating. There's just no getting away from it, the Campaign One characters are almost all stereotypes. I know they're very much loved by fans of C1, but I just find them to be too unoriginal. I only really care about them because I love the cast. They're so stereotypical, they're not the best advert for present day Critical Role which now puts out much more compelling characters.Still, however, a great effort, and I am enjoying it.

When these types of shows are made for the English audience they are so much better, so please studios of the world please start doing more of this. I also like how they are a storyline rather than western cartoons generally being tune in to whatever episode and be able to follow along. They are made to be watched from beginning to end and develop characters and relationships between them. I also loved the whole bi-sexual dwarf aspect. Super unique and well inserted.

Exactly, like what a 13 year old boy trying to be edgy would act like, dropping f-bombs every other minute and telling cringe jokes. Its the most immediately annoying aspect, but sadly isn't even the worst offender.While the acting is quite good, the dialogue is quite stiff and predictable. The main characters are clich\u00e9 and 1-dimensional. For a d&d livestream where you also have the player's real personalities shine through its not a problem. For a show, its a serious problem.The tone is all over the place. It tries to take itself seriously and make us care about the world, only to then crack a silly meta joke and break immersion. The plot is incredibly predictable, and not nearly as intelligent as the rabid Critical Role cultists would make you believe.On a side note, if you do decide to get into watching the Critical Role stream, ignore the fanbase; both the positive and negative. A large portion of the CR fanbase has a seriously unhealthy obsession. They're willing to spend thousands of dollars on the franchise and take the franchise way WAY too seriously. They will quite literally lose their minds if you have any critiques what's so ever, like a cult, hence why I call them cultists (ironic considering in d&d you tend to fight cultists).Is this show the worst thing every made? No. Is it the best thing ever that'll revolutionize the fantasy genre? Hell no. 5/10, and honestly, that's me being nice.",

            "content": "An animated adaptation of Critical Role's Dungeons & Dragons tabletop campaign, The Legend of Vox Machina features the heroic adventures and world-saving exploits of a ragtag band of misfits.Based on what I hear from passionate Critters, the show is to be commended for its faithfulness to the source material. The plot, while not groundbreaking, is well-crafted and includes a diverse set of characters. The animation is excellent and provides the numerous action scenes with the desired vibrancy. Finally, the voice acting is phenomenal and imbues each scene with added pizzazz.However, adapting DnD gameplay does not come without its share of challenges. The reliance on dice limits the logical consistency in storytelling - Vax's lockpicking skill varies wildly, Keyleth's magical abilities are capricious, and Grog goes from taking on everyone at once to being knocked out by a single adversary. An ability to heal even the most potent of injuries and stave off death lowers the stakes severely. The absence of players also needs to be accommodated for by strange constructs ... as in the case of Pike's astral projection. And tropes such as the horny bard and the slow-witted brute abound, typically to the detriment of the narrative.The writing in general is rather underwhelming. Barring Percy, no character gets significant character growth with little time spent on their individual backstories and motivations. The romantic subplot between Vax and Keyleth appears out of the blue and the resolution to Pike's introspection of her faith feels lacking. Another of my gripes is with the dialogue which contains an excess of edgy one-liners and sexual humour, especially in the early episodes.In my opinion, The Legend of Vox Machina is perfect for an audience that is familiar with Critical Role and enjoys DnD. But even someone who generally adores animated fantasy will find the show entertaining.

To me, it seems more like a party of heroes going on side quests instead of a coherent well-structured story. It's still fun and easy to watch though, if you don't obsess over details.My main problem with the show is that while it advertises itself as an adult show, with so much gore, violence and swearing involved, it does not treat its audience as adults. For example, the \"NPCs\" are dying left and right, while the plot armor for the main cast is just too thick. There are just too many times when them surviving an encounter doesn't make much sense. And if the writers don't have the guts to kill off a character and end up bringing them back, why kill them in the first place? It has happened 3-4 times already. There's no tension if death means so little and the main characters can cheat it rather easily.TL;DR: It's not among the best shows I've watched, but it doesn't do anything particularly wrong to stop you from enjoying it.",

What the hell is this? I get that these are bad people starting to do good but all that happening in a single episode is ridiculous.And oh my god the writing. It's so messy and all over the place, all lines are either cringe jokes or cringier thoughts of the characters which they say out loud because the writers were too lazy to make us understand their thoughts. They tried calling to make unique characters but failed terribly, there is nothing interesting about the characters. They made bunch of different characters, didn't bother to show us how they meet, and didn't bother to show us what they had in common. One thing i can think of that they have in common is all of them being non complicated and cartoon level stupid.Honestly it's not the most terrible thing but it makes me so mad that they could have made it so much better, i want to be fair so I'll give it a 5.",

The animation quality is top notch. What CGI they use isn't distracting (*cough* season 2 of AoT *cough*), and all of the designs are really good. The music (score) isn't anything special, but it works. Where the show falls completely flat is the writing. There are so many cliches and cheesy-dumb moments that make it hard to believe in the \"awesomeness\" of Vox Machina. We're supposed to accept that they're the best despite what we see on-screen. They survive and succeed because the plot needs them to, not because of their actions. Why they're better than the first group that got fried in the opening minutes isn't apparent. Blaming plot armor is an argument you can leverage against a ton of shows, but all of the swagger and winking here highlights it even more. The worst offender in the writing is the adult content -- it's completely amateur. The mere seconds of nudity peppered throughout episodes and the barrage of R-rated language is so juvenile. Even the gore. It's all adult just for the sake of being adult. There's no cleverness to any of it. And that one shot of the turd coming out of that one dude? Seriously? Did they survey a middle school for script ideas? It all feels so unnecessary and amateur, and that's a shame because, without it, Vox Machina could have easily been a show to watch with the family. I know that's not the target audience, but it's not like the adult material is handled with finesse. Another issue is the pacing. I understand that it's hard to adapt 6-years-worth of material into 12 episodes, but it's not necessarily the content itself. Everything is *fine*, but the show obviously wants us to feel something. You can't force us to care about characters we barely know in an arc that just started. That's where the fandom comes into play. They've known the characters for years, so it's different for them. For those of us who are new, it's not as effective. Wrapping up, I just have to point out, Scanlan surviving the fight in S1, ep. 7... he acts like he outwitted the bad guy when he should have been chopped to pieces so many times. And Percival, really? The character is all buildup and no payoff. \"If you harm her, I will end you,\" is so hollow and cheesy, but that kind of represents the show as a whole: all hype, little delivery. It has me interested enough to see where it goes for now, so I'll continue to watch.",

The animation is okay, but minus points for the cgi use. The part I hated the most was the predictability of the plot.The sexual depictions and graphic violence are tasteless. Western fantasy (outside of got) is usually surrounded with an aura of grace, and twisting this into something more grotesque is fun to see. But the idea itself isn't ever enough.

They exist solely to move the plot forward for the main characters (which is to be expected from an adaptation of a D&D campaign)all of the main characters are too... \"interesting\"? I don't know how to put this, but all of them have a LOT going on in their past. Their party has TWO distinct \"mercenaries destined to rule their people\", just to give an idea of what I'm talking about. Half of them are built like they are the sole main character of an adventure story. Again, I think this is because they are adapted from a D&D campaignthe villains are clearly built as pure villains and nothing more. They have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, they are there just to be vanquished. They are caricatures of evil, made to be hated universally. Because of this, they end up being not interesting at all, you just end up thinking \"shut up and die\" every time they show up. Not to repeat myself, but as I see it, this is another consequence of this show being an adaptation of a D&D campaign, where the evil being vanquished is not even the main point of the game, it is just a justification for the adventure to happen for the players.Don't get me wrong, I've watched quite a lot of D&D campaign podcasts and such, and I thin they are very entertaining. They tend to be unpredictable (because of the dice rolls and such) and spontaneous (because of the unpredictability and the ability of the players to just act through all of the events), and that makes them very fun to watch/listen. You end up feeling like you are there, playing D&D with them.When you adapt this kind of media to a TV series, you end up having to throw out these thing I just pointed out, which are (IMO) the things that make this kind of media interesting. The characters, the worldbuilding, the villains, they are all secondary to the spontaneous interactions between the players and/or the GM, and to the dice rolls and the on-the-spot decision making.What you end up with is an average show, with bad-to-average worldbuilding, flat secondary characters and uninteresting villains. I still liked some of the moments, as the main characters have very interesting interactions between themselves, but that was it.",

The action scenes and knife and blood play is fast, deadly and gruesome, and that makes it all the more effective.

The individualized characterizations are made clear early on, and the quick pacing and frequent, over-the-top spectacles are more than enough to rope in newcomers to either Critical Role or the D&D fantasy genre as a whole. The animation is crisp during both high intensity combat sequences and slow moments of thoughtfulness. One of the great strengths of the live show was the ability of the cast to freely and expertly play with narrative tension, oscillating between somber moments of dark character exploration and vulnerability, and moments of tenderness and levity. In these first episodes, this show has seemingly found that balance and I hope, as the series progresses, the writers and producers find more ways to more effectively execute on those moments.",

            "content": "Credible, entertaining, and perfectly paced, \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" on Amazon Prime Video brought with it a small world of creative character-driven storytelling that I've seen abundantly in PC games. Crisp animation, great editing, and superb writing rendered this show a worthy animated series deserving of its own franchise.Remarkable directing by a team of sharp minds - Sung Jin Ahn, Alicia Chan, Young Heller, Stanley Von Medvey, and Yu-Won Pang. Praiseworthy screenplay by Brandon Auman, Marc Bernardin, Ashly Burch, Kevin Burke, Mae Catt, Jennifer Muro, Sam Riegel, Eugene Son, Travis Willingham, and Chris Wyatt.Neal Acree's musical scoring brought a deep sense of immediacy and fun to the show. Todd Raleigh's editing saved it in more ways than one. Superheroic work on art, animation, and VFX.Voice acting was instrumental in conveying the manifold magical splendours of \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" on Amazon Prime Video.Taliesin Jaffe (as Percy de Rolo) was quite good. Laura Bailey (as Vex'ahlia) was great. Liam O'Brien (as Vax'ildan) was noteworthy. Ashley Johnson (as Pike Trickfoot) was amazing. Marisha Ray (as Keyleth) was superb. Sam Riegel (as Scanlan Shorthalt) was outstanding. Travis Willingham (as Grog Strongjaw) was memorable. It was hard to choose a favourite when each character felt so distinct.All other voice-artists did notable work for various characters in Season 1 of \"The Legend of Vox Machina\". The villains Silas and Delilah Briarwood (voiced by Matthew Mercer and Grey Griffin) were great. Lesser baddies like Duke Vedmire (voiced by Rory McCann), Professor Anders (voiced by Stephen Root), Kerrion Stonefell (voiced by Darin De Paul), and General Krieg (voiced by David Tennant) were great. Sovereign council member Lady Allura Vysoren (voiced by Indira Varma) was memorable. Archibald Desnay (voiced by Dominic Monaghan) was remarkable.The first season was off to a promising start. Plenty of humour and action, with enough gore and explicit content to keep adult viewers entertained. I loved some of the Steampunk inspirations as well. The characters were well-crafted and their interactions, wholly convincing. The show also contained 'real life' moments - modern swearing, nudity, and more.Despite being an animated series, every episode felt real because of such elements. Some nice \"Final Fantasy\", \"Game Of Thrones\", \"Lord of the Rings\", \"The Witcher\", and \"Dungeons & Dragons\" vibes as well. I can't forget to mention the many funny moments that prevailed in this show, imparting perfect humorous balance to an otherwise dark and bloody tale.In the \"The Legend of Vox Machina\", you'll find an unemployed and disreputable gang of mercenaries faced with the prospect of saving the kingdom of Exandria. Misfits in every way, their quest held great symbolic significance. Not all heroes wear capes, indeed.Critical Role did excellent work creating this masterpiece. The show's almost cinematic fight choreography, outstanding musical scoring, and witty as well as humourous writing more than made it worthy of multiple seasons. That jaw-dropping cliffhanger of a finale included.",

The characters are all pretty typical (the comedian, the stoic, the big dumb nice ogre character, etc.) and many parts of the story could have used some fleshing out. Not enough background is given for some of the characters and, while this has 12 episodes of about 300 minutes total season one length, the show struggles with pacing at times.I believe that the show is well worth a watch and am happy it was picked up for a second season.",

It really feels like a high school improvisational act play - \"long long ago there was a great world with magic and abilities and giants etc. And everyone lived peacefully BUT THEN EVIL CAME AND THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING\" This is literally almost a quote from the series and it does not hook me at all. Then there's presentation of random team of heroes which eventually getting vanished in 30 seconds by SOME EVIL EVIL. And then there's a jump to some meeting with king (of what?) and his dudes which are discussing how their best heroes sucked and now they need new and better ones. I'm not interested in retelling every second of it so I just tell that right after statement that we need better heroes we are getting teleported to some kind of tavern when we are being intoduced to our main protagonists (Spoiler - their characters are made of a cardboard). Our heroes are took up to a fight, being kicked, thats the most stereotypical bearded trans bull/man/woman/creaturx (of course comes with a f**king undercut) and kicks out heroes. Then they realize they can't cope with each other and ask themselves a question - why are they even together? And then surprisingly one of the characters comes back with a paper with king's announcement and THEN our heroes realize that the only thing that bonds them together is money. Wow. What a great introduction. Literally no words. It was literally 10 mins in and I went through all of this stream of information, and the only info that is truly useful is character's names. Hillarious.Humor - Bad, bad try. Believe me, my sense of humor is broken af and it really made me chuckle a few times, but the rest of my \"chuckles\" were from serious scenes that supposed to be, you know, serious. Waist majority of jokes is not funny at all, at least for me, because excuse me, I can't handle everlasting flow of penis/vomit/sex/ball jokes, and unfortunately, most of them are like this. Also, huge amount of cursed words only in one episode is just mindblowing, it really feels like I'm watching Dota 2 anime.Characters - as I said before, they are made out of cardboard. You'll barely remember their names at the end of episode, but the thing you WILL remember is their stupid and stereotypical characters - Goofy giant, cynic twins, pervert midget with charisma, some steampunk-ass smart guy with glasses, self-aware druid redhead (which is also the only character with reasonable decisions). That's it. Now, really. We didn't get even king's name. Eventually, we feel nothing for this characters, and when some of them die in the end of episode, AND you see OUR CHARACTERS getting sad about it, it just feels so confusing and out of sense, you just can't get rid of cringe in moments like this.Conclusion - sorry, this story is just not for me at all. I'm sure, someone in the age of 14 or even less might like it, but not me. Story - stupid, characters - stupid, plot - even stupider, motivations - out of words. Knowing how much money did authors raise, they really could have made a better job, at least hire better writers.One episode was enough for me, which is quite rare, for example I watched 3 episodes of new hee man just to give this show a chance, but I will not do that in this time.

The show has completely delivered on what it promised in it's epic kickstarter debut. All the naysayers just want to hate, if you read the 1 star reviews they say give up in the first episode, that's a cop out. You need time to lay out a good story and if you're open minded, it's worthy of your time.The voice acting is great, the animation is adequate, and the story telling is what happens when a group of friends sit around a table and collaborate on something that they all love. Non-D&D players might find it a bit confusing at first, which is understandable. After a few episodes, hopefully, it will inspire you to get out there and join in your first game. Just don't expect every game to be as epic as this one.Show the series some love and it will bring more adventures like these to life. There is so many great stories being told around the table top and The Legends of Vox Machina will open the doors for the rest. <3.",

And I forced myself to watch 12 episodes despite wanting to give in within a few.Instead you get a show that repeats itself every episode. Here's the formula; the little purple gnome guy says sex jokes because tee hee sex isn't sex naughty, the garden girl plays the awkward shy character that all geek girls are meant to relate to and just randomly every episode \"discovers\" a new power that handles the episodes present danger when all else is lost, she then flirts aimlessly with the brother of the twins without it going anywhere because tee hee aren't girls cute, the sister of the twin just sighs and barks order all episode, the guy with the gun is moody all the time and is literally the only character with development, the holy girl I almost forgot she existed, she just personifies goody goody. Then there's the warrior, dear lord, the WORST voice acting and dialogue writing I've encountered in any show, Guardians of the Galaxy literally gave a free template on how to write the funny powerful oath and somehow they just failed in every way imaginable. Every ep he gets angry, swings, gets beat and says something like \"ouch that hurty\".ZERO risks taken with writing, I was so hyped when Percy's sister randomly gets murdered, I was like here we go, plot development, nope, literally chicken out of her death in 5 minutes, she's back alive because magic lol. Then after the massive battle the garden girl sacrifices herself, FINALLY a main character is killed off for plot development? Nope, literally goes from unsavable to SUDDELNY ALIVE OUT OF NOWEHERE in 5 minutes.Pathetic writing honestly, no character will ever die but a bad person, do not waste your time, it's by the books good vs. Evil, good always wins trash, it might as well be a 12 rated show, there's not even 18 rated content but swearing and tee hee virgin sex. Absolute wasted opportunity writer have no backbone at all, can't even commit to their own plot twists.I literally made an IMDB account to counter these fan service addicts and hopefully save someone's time.

Fight dragon terrorizing city, kill dragon, get reward. Make cringe jokes, insert unfunny one-liners. Fight this and that, kill this and that, blah blah blah.It starts to pick up a little bit after, but it's nothing too special.Only reason this show got me interested in all episodes is because of it's main character, Percy. A knock off Harry Potter with a gun. His backstory is actually worth listening to and he's easily the coolest member of the group.All of this, plus the excessive use of cursing so it makes it seem like: \"Hey! We're for adults only!

            "content": "Let me begin by saying I am a huge Critical Role and Vox Machina is my favorite of the three streams they've made so far. The streams are filled with great characters, good humor, and excellent storytelling.The show, however, has none of those things.This was a major letdown for me. Everyone who is giving this more than a 3 star review is either delusional or not familiar with the streams.Let's start with the worst part of it all!First: the jokes.9 out of 10 of them don't land and. They. Are. Constant. I don't believe there's a moment of silence in the show that lasts longer than two seconds. There's never just a moment to breathe or enjoy a quiet interaction between characters before it's interrupted by terrible joke. Now here's the thing, I love crude humor. I find it hilarious. But this feels like the jokes were written by a 13 yr old who just found out what sex and the f word was. Which I find so strange because the jokes on the stream were never like this. They were well-timed, genuinely funny, and the most important part, spread out. Hearing Scanlan say a handful of dirty jokes over the course of 3-4 hrs is nothing. But hearing 20 dirty jokes in the span of 20 minutes? It just feels childish and like it's trying way too hard to be for Adults. I genuinely hate the character Scanlan in this show when I actually liked him in the stream. But they've made him unbearable in the tv adaption and I'm not sure why. But it's bad.Second: the animation.The animation is stiff as heck. Like REALLY stiff. It honestly looks like a fan animation. Reminds me of that person who animated like the first 10 books of a kids book series all by themself. But that was impression because one person did it. This? A billionaire company and thousands of fundings from fans to produce.. this? It's actually astounding how bad it is. I've seen cartoons that were 80+ years old that move more fluidly. Animation is supposed to get better with time (and money), and yet this just looks like a dumpster fire. Not to mention all but 2 characters designs are ugly as sin and look nothing like the original art used in the stream.Third: the pacing.The pacing in this show is godawful. It moves at a breakneck speed. Within the first few minutes they've killed a dragon and became members of a royal council. Like huh? Let's slow down here for sec! I think we've missed a few major steps here. There's so many scenes that have been cut for time when a lot of them are integral. For example, Percy crafts Vex an explosive arrow in the stream. They have a conversation about it and he basically says he'd do anything to please her. This scene gives us some insight into how Percival feels about Vex. In the show however, the arrow is bought in a rushed shopping scene and it's over within a minute. I understand that they are having to cut a lot out to make it fit into a 20-30 min episode and I would be able to forgive them for this if they didn't cut out scenes, only to add some in that NEVER happen in the stream. Like Scanlan singing about his \"beads of love\" during the middle of an emotional fight scene. But I digress. The point being, the show moves way too fast and it's genuinely hard to keep up if you don't already know what's going on.Fourth: the voice acting.I'm genuinely surprised at how Bad a lot of the voice work is. Scanlan sounds like he's from a badly dubbed anime. Grog sounds like dumb child, constantly mispronouncing words like \"dat\", \"widdle\", \"pwease\". He's supposed to be cockney, not 5. And Keyleth's voice is extremely whiny and her dialogue lasts too long because it's full of excessive stuttering. These are all professional voice actors who did amazing jobs while on stream. But in the studio? Apparently, they aren't very good I'm finding out. It's appalling.There's many more things wrong with this show but this is all I can think of for now.I know this was a passion project for CR and all that and they really wanted it to work. But it just goes to show you, just because someone has been in a lot of tv shows, doesn't automatically mean they can make one. I see now why they are voice actors and not directors. I shudder to think what season 2 will be like.",

            "content": "I have currently watched 9 episodes, as the last three haven't been released yet, so my review will obviously only take into account what has been released so far.I will also try to not put in spoilers and talk about this as generally as possible.So first of all, I am not a fan of Critical Role and I have not watched the original campaigns. I do however have many friends that are huge fans of the series, so I was roughly aware of the premise.From what I gathered, the general consensus of the fanbase has been very positive, and I am very happy for them! I will however look at this from the perspective of someone with no real ties to the source material and just talk about my opinions on this as an animated series first and foremost.The premise of the adventure is pretty generic, with a mostly stereotypical cast of characters. You have an awkward druid, a horny halfling (?) bard, a (trying to be) suave half elf and his greedy sister, a serious dude with a gun, a dumb big guy with a heart of gold and another halfling cleric who seems to struggle with her god.THE GOOD:The art: The characters in the show look pretty. The backgrounds are gorgeous. The animation is not mind blowing and cannot compare with things like Legend of Korra or Castlevania, but it is decent enough! Knowing this was funded by kickstarter money, I am impressed because this looks polished and like something I could see on television. Some of the 3D looks outdated (especially in episode 1), but that is fine considering the budget they probably had.The intro: The intro is gorgeous. The animation of the show is not as good as the intro, like in many animes, but I actually found myself searching for it on youtube just because I wanted to see it again.Staying faithful to the original: As far as I understand from my friends, nothing has been changed too much in this adaptation lore-wise, and I can respect that! Nice!Voice acting: The voice acting is pretty decent. Some of the main cast are AMAZING and sound very genuine (Scanlan, Pike, Vex, Percy), but there are others that sound a bit too.. Over the top. A bit too much like a generic anime dub, and that breaks my immersion a bit (Vax, Grog and Keyleth at times). Some of the character interactions are genuinely funny though, and I like that the conversations between the heroes do sound organic, with the constant banter back and forth.The music: The music is decent. The main theme is memorable enough.THE OK:\nThe story: The story is very generic in my opinion and the character arcs as well. It's not bad per se, but it's not something that instantly hooked me either. I was mostly just hooked by the premise of \"DnD show made into a cartoon by kickstarter money\". It doesn't really stand out yet. The first three episodes suffer from the shaky legs syndrome, where the pacing feels a bit all over the place. The first one is filled with cringey things during the introduction, but I assume it is there to introduce the audience to the general \"yes this isn't censored, we actually put this in\" vibe.For better or worse, very dependant on what you want to see from this show. After those first 3 episodes it does pick up though.THE BAD AND UGLY - Direction, Length of the Episode and the Adult Content:Ok. I have a lot of problems with the show. It's not the worst show I've seen, but also not the best. It's... Ok.My biggest gripe with the entire series is that it tries to stand out because it's an \"adult show\".Now, here's the thing: The show has A LOT of cringey and yucky scenes and does not shy away from crude jokes, hinting at genitalia, sex and gore, but it does not make it feel adult. In fact, somehow despite all of this, it feels incredibly childish BECAUSE of that. This is the kind of humor pubescent teenagers like, period. And that's okay, but hyping it up as an \"adult show\" with these themes does not cut it. It is simply a very vulgar show.There are hints of adult themes in this that felt serious at first, but then the direction of the episodes usually fell really flat.The biggest problem of this series IS the Direction. I am going to try and explain it:\nThe way a show treats its audience, indicates heavily if it's for adults or not. Cartoons for kids for example will usually try to chew things out for you, show very obvious scenes and metaphorically push your nose into the plot. Shows for adults on the other hand do things much more discreetly. They will hint at things here and there, and give you the opportunity to read between the lines, and maybe even theorize yourself. \"Show - Don't Tell\" is where a good adult show shines.The Legend of Vox Machina does not really do this (well). It is directed like a kids show, to put it simply. Flashbacks are shown too early, a character's distress will be shown directly in relation to a completely new element that is introduced, and you get to the narrative conclusion in your head about 3 minutes into the episode. As a viewer, you don't really get the chance to be shocked or surprised, because the plot points play out in such an obvious way. The audience is basically treated like dummies.As an example: Avatar was a show for kids with none of the sexual innuendos TLoVM had, and it felt miles and miles more mature than this.If I had to guess, a big reason for this silly direction is probably the length of the episodes. 20 minutes seem enough at first glace, with how long the episodes *feel*, but that is because it's trying to rush through most of the plot in a more superficial way without appealing to emotional storytelling beats. It is in my opinion nowhere near enough to establish all of these plot points in an actual satisfying way though. This really dampened my enjoyment unfortunately.In conclusion, I think it's ok. It's nothing special (except the fact it was made with kickstarter funding and is based on a dnd show) and it does not come near other western animation like Netflix Castlevania or Arcane, both in animation or narratively. Story and pacing wise, there is still a lot to improve. It's good enough to kill time with, or maybe use it as a teaser to get into the actual DnD show, which is much more compelling and complex as I understand. A good way to imrpove it imo would be less episodes, but make them about 40 minutes each. Don't try to imitate anime or a specific media, just try to make a good film/show.I don't really understand the high rating and I assume it must be the excited fanbase, but perhaps I am simply too critical. This is after all, just my subjective opinion.Tl;dr: This is a fun, quirky, light hearted show with cringe humor but pleasant art. It's good for popcorn cinema, but don't expect a masterpiece of storytelling from this.",

            "content": "'Vox Machina' is a 12 episode animated fantasy series that debuted on the Amazon Prime Video streaming service in January of 2022. One of the more fascinating things about this production has nothing to do with what you see on screen. Instead how the production came to be is at least as interesting as the rollicking fantasy adventure. There is a group of D&D players called Critical Role who turned a D&D campaign into a very successful, if somewhat niche, podcast. Those folks then launched a Kickstarter to produce an animated special and it was so wildly successful that the special became a legit show with the streaming rights acquired by Amazon.The show features a band of 7 adventurers in the land of Tal'Dorei seeking fame, gold, wine, women and song; all of the things classic adventure groups crave. It is a prototypical group featuring such character archetypes as druid, warrior, ranger, cleric and the like although it does dawn on me with some astonishment that there group does not possess a traditional mage. The bulk of the show has to do with the intrepid group investigating the mysterious Lord and Lady Briarwood who have taken over the city/land of Whitestone. One of their group, Percy, was a lord in Whitestone as a child before the Briarwood's came along with their contingent and slaughtered his family so now he and the rest of his Vox Machina crew are looking for answers and vengeance. There are various side quests and plots, but all of those serve this primary narrative. All of the dominoes steadily fall with some twists and turns as Vox Machina close in on the Briarwoods and find out the nature of their secrets as well as some dark secrets of their own.This show is a heck of a lot of fun. It is cool as a kid to be enamored with the old Dungeons & Dragons cartoon and now flash forward to adult hood and there is a much grittier adult style take on that cartoon. 'Vox Machina' doesn't bare much resemblance to that old cartoon, but the D&D link connects them in my mind. 'Vox Machina' is much more adult animation and doesn't shy away from swearing, violence, dark thematic material or nudity. Another great aspect to the show is its humor. While I wouldn't strictly lump it into the comedy genre this does have a lot of funny, comedic elements to counterbalance the darker violence and adventure tones as well. Only one season into its run 'The Legend of Vox Machina' has already been renewed for two more seasons. If you have any interest in adult fantasy then this is not a show to miss.Eric's Grade: A-",

As a person who doesn't watch a lot of animated stuff however, my knowledge is limited. I have enjoyed Final Space, Arcane, and Invincible however, and found the style to be of the same quality. (Not on the level of Arcane, but what is?)The plot is a tricky one, as I already know it. It moves a lot quicker than the live stream, but of course it has to. They don't have 400 hours like before. I do find it very compelling, the characters are fantastic and it's such a good feeling to finally see these people that I love come to life in this way.As is to be expected, the voice acting is superb. Not just the main cast, but everyone does a fantastic job. If you have watched CR before there will be Easter eggs for you to find and some funny DnD references to look out for.The Briarwood arc was something very, very special in campaign one (even though Percy is my least favourite member). And the talent these guys have assembled, and the love they have poured into this show is evident in every frame.Yes it has blood and swearing, and no. It isn't suitable at all for children. But is it childish? No.It's like real life, most of the time we are trying to keep things fun and positive. We laugh when we can. But there is some heart in this too, and knowing where it goes, it's going to get very emotional.Absolutely love this show so far, I'll be rewatching it a few times no doubt. If you dig fantasy, or DnD, or swords and sorcery. Like I do, give it a go. You'll probably be very pleasantly surprised.",

The characters get better as the show goes on and you start knowing them but the character development is very slow. I have mixed feelings on the characters, Percy and Pike are great and have nice backstory. Keyleth and the twins are likeable and cool but they're not really developed. The humor is either Grog being dumb or Scanlan cursing, they're not great. The story is nothing special as it's just a group of warrior doing quest, it's not bad but there isn't much substance for the first half. Not much is explained, you're thrown in the show and expected to care, I've learned later why but I've not seen Critical Role so it wasn't great for me. The animation is pretty standard but the action is pretty good, it's probably the highlight of the season.Season two is an improvement on pretty much every level, apart from the animation who's still pretty standard. The characters were likeable by the end of the season and now they're great for the whole season, apart from Scanlan who's still pretty annoying. Grog is the most improved elements of the show, he has a good backstory in the season and becomes more than a comedic relief. The twins also got a backstory which was pretty interesting and Keyleth was used more as a character, the rest of the characters were as good as before. On a story level it's much better, there's not a lot of boring moments and every episodes have something to offer.Season 1: 6.5/10\nSeason 2: 7.5/10.",

I should've known that no one knows or cares more about the story of Vox Machina than the players who created them. Not only is the show 100% loyal to the personalities of the characters and the energy of the show, it also manages to preserve the most impactful moments from the campaign with practically perfect fidelity.I can't recommend this show enough.",

I really expected to drop it like I do midway through a latest installment of Jackazz.The story themes are a lot like a session of D&D, not a bad thing. The banter is a lot like you find with a group of friends while playing DDO. The actors seemed to know each other quite well. Reading a bit more about it, they have been doing this together for years. It shows in a good way. There is a lot of creativity in the world of D&D so they won't lack for material. I expect this to be very good for a long time.The bad: The quantity of \"adult humor\" is overboard. It comes of as \"We're not a kid show, really!\" Throw a bit in once in a while and it would be effective without desperation.Mixed bag: The writing is good almost always but does rely on.worn tropes, which I was expecting so wasn't a problem. It just seems like it came from their sessions. The \"bad guy\" in the first couple episodes did trick me even if it seemed obvious after.Overall it is a fun watch with quick episodes that keep you interested. I gave it a 6 when I first started writing this but bumped it to a 7 before clicking submit. As they refine things in future seasons it could become an 8 and a 7 for cartoons is high praise from me.

If it gets picked up for another (preferably longer) season then we will get to know the characters beyond their fa\u00e7ade.What's interesting with a series based on a campaign spanning years is that first-off there's so much material to draw from and secondly that the \"writer\" of this show did not create his main protagonists.

            "content": "This show is essentially sheer ego stroking.After years of having hundreds of thousands of people sit around while they filmed hundreds of 4+ hour episodes where you got the privilege of watching trained voice actors play DnD around a table, and making bazillions on their Kickstarter, clearly the fame got to their head. Now it's more about them than the characters, the plot or the setting.So, if you want to watch anime style animation that doesn't jive with a bunch of Millennial and Gen Z slang that could have dropped right out of any modern, hip, sitcom or web series, so none of their dialogue fits at all ... be my guest.If you want sarcastic, snide Millennial and Gen Z insults and humour to pepper the whole thing, so it's like you're sitting on a bus, surrounded by university students making fun of each other ... be my guest.If you want to marvel at the clumsily introduced EDI inserts that are so literally scripted and dropped in that you cannot but think that they were literally working to a checklist ... be my guest. I especially loved the bearded magic shop owner in gaudy, Romani style make up, the pansexual gnome that can't keep it in his pants for more than 30 seconds, or - the piece de resistance - the 'master hunter' in a wheel chair. I mean, seriously, how do you get to be a master hunter when you can't even go into the forest? Onto a mountain? Do four of them carry him in the wilderness so that he can feel like he fits in? When you feel you need to insert this nonsense into a fantasy story where it clearly sticks out like a 21st century identity politics it is, you're missing the point of being a storyteller.Above and beyond that, the pacing is just ridiculous. You drop right in the middle of the first campaign and you're literally in the middle of the celebration of their victory when the attack that drives the second campaign hits. Sure, it's based on some actual DnD campaigns, but come on, let them get a beer. Give the audience a bit of a denouement.So, I made it about half way into the second season and then called it quits. I know all kinds of people who watched the original Critical Role series and loved it, and they also love Vox Machina, but they are all 20 years my junior and they couldn't give a fig about character, plot or setting. Just be sarcastic and charming and entertaining and they will worship the ground you walk on, to the tune of 12M buckaroos. You don't need to be good at telling a story or playing a role, you just have to be audacious. Apparently.No thanks. Even my own DnD campaign has more maturity than this lot.",

            "content": "While most certainly biased, this review aims to be as objective as possible.The show may very well be characterized as fan service, for better or worse.A lot of the jokes simply won't hit the same without knowing the source material or other geek subculture factoids.A good chunk of those jokes won't hit at all, but rather fly over the heads of people who ended up watching it randomly or by proxy.Personally, I do not think this makes the show worse or better. It is the way they chose to go and the reception to that has been mixed by fans and newcomers alike.The voice acting is the best component of the show. All of these people have been in the business for decades and it is evident.If you like video games and animated shows but know nothing of the cast, you might very well have moments where you listen to the character voices, certain you have\nheard them before, but unable to pinpoint from where.Or in case of characters voiced be Mercer... your reaction would be more along the lines of \"HOW IS THAT THE SAME PERSON?!\"The pacing is off. This is something everyone, including the cast, seems to agree on. The first two episodes are the worst of the bunch in that regard.This is most likely the result of the cast expecting the project to be much smaller in scope when the kickstarter happened, and the result of cramming dozens of hours of\nDnD sessions into a 30ish minute animated episode. It is not nearly as bad later on in the season. Probably because the remaining episodes of the season focus\non a different arc, resulting in more time to tell the story.On the subject of story, adamantly wanting to avoid spoilers, I will only say that it is great. This is a matter of personal preference, however.You will have to look elsewhere for further insight into it.The writing however, is again, hit and miss. A good chunk is not only lifted directly from the sessions, but improved upon due to hindsight and retrospect.It is much weaker in some episodes. (again, the first two) and feels very much like it picks up the slack in episodes written later on.(Sam Riegel, Travis Willingham, Ashley Burch and Marc Bernardin did awesome work)The animation is very mixed too. The worst of it comes from the mixture of 3D and 2D animation done at the same time resulting in such a terrible clash on screen.It is almost disappointing and may very well pull you out of it, especially the first few times it happens. Luckily, the 2D animation by itself ranges from\naverage to absolutely impressive.One thing I will admit and have discussed with other critters is how much more brutal the show was than we expected. While the nudity and sex related content\n(which are always done as a joke or simply a funny scene) are a factor in classifying it as an adult show. It pales in comparison to the blood and gore visuals,\nwhich are done without the tongue-in-cheek factor the former thrives on.All things considered, I find recommending the show depends very much on your taste, interests, and how repulsive you find the visuals.I've been looking forward to it since it was announced, and it actually pains me to give it a 7. I chose to do so because there is much room for improvement.Hopefully it is a matter of the team settling in into the format and it is only uphill from here.",

Voice acting is amazing as you'd expect, but as a stand alone, this show feels more like an ode to CR and their achievements than a digestible fantasy show for the mass market.If you are a fan of CR, I highly recommend this show to enjoy their vision and support them, but if you see a score of 9 on IMDB and think wow this is going to be the next big thing, I think you will be sorely disappointed.Its got good voice acting, some hit or miss comedy, ok action and gore, and a off the rails pace.

            "content": "Given the nature of fandom I will say up front I am a Critical Role fan. In that regard the series already satisfies what many of us fantasied about since the inception of the actual play. However for a review from a more objective stand point continue reading.Only three episodes have been released so far, so if I can edit my review after the release of the entire season I will. Also know upfront, this isn't a show for kids or the prudish.Episode 1 introduces to us the characters at a time when they are down on their luck, most of the episode is given to developing the characters and does an ok job. The first couple episodes suffer from pretty severe tonal whiplash at times. It also sets up an overly humorous atmosphere which I don't think translates as well in a purely narrative endeavor compared to the kind of table humour an actual play series can sustain. That said the third episode really got the balance right in my opinion and I expect sets the standard for what we'll see going forward given what I know about the events to come.In between all of that though were some really heartfelt emotional and inspirational moments pretty typical of the fantasy genre. The show certainly leans into its tabletop roots with the story telling and action pieces which I'm sure will delight many and probably put off a few at the same time.The first mini arc contained within episodes 1 and 2 really feels a little rushed and I do wonder how well those episodes will hook in viewers who aren't already acquainted with the characters. The story itself is quite generic for the genre, though this is typical of many introductory stories where you're trying to set up the meaty \"main quest\" as quickly as possible.In fact I would go as far as to say you could comfortably start at episode 3 if you are not already a CR fan. The episode is well paced and does a good job at setting up the right amount of intrigue. The Briarwoods, set up as the villains for the series, were the highlight of the episode, especially Silas, voiced by Mercer who in my opinion steals the whole episode with his performance. Though a couple of narrative decisions could have been executed better as I could see them being a little confusing to those without the context of the original material.I can't comment on the quality of the animation because it's just not something I really pay attention to whilst watching a show.Overall though the show was very fun to watch. The voice acting was top notch, unsurprisingly. If the show continues with the quality shown in episode 3 this will develop into a solid series that anyone who is into fantasy and adventure will enjoy.",

The background reveals of Percy throughout this and the political ties of multi realms is believable through the lens of both fantasy and realism as you take this walk with such a wonderful voice acting cast and deeply developed world.I can't describe the nostalgic feeling I felt, almost like a 39 year old man transported back to his teenager years rolling dice in the living room of friends, laughing at the jokes, anticipating that 20 and feeling despair at that 1. Through the ups and downs you felt it all and this is the first D&D adventure that I watched that gave me those childhood memories back in vivid clear photoesque remembrance as the character development progressed surrounded by drama, comedy, loss, and true story driven content, no matter the skin color, sexual orientation, gender, etc...

On the flip side, a lot of the character interactions are nice. Not all the jokes are awful, the art direction for the most part was really fun. It felt like a more adult version of avatar or the dragon prince in terms of characters and show feeling. Also, for a show funded by a kickstarter campaign, really not bad! (Political portion ahead) I also really like how the characters that are coded to be non binary and gay were played very tastefully. I could see anyone as them, and they felt natural to the setting.

Most of the main characters can't seem to go 5 words without dropping a cringe inducing f-bomb or similar, and it cheapens what could have been an impactful moment between chracters or dumbing down a funny joke. The actors' deliveries of these lines also have this \"wink\" to the audience each time like \"hey look I'm naughty I cussed. Look how cool I am!\" Nobody talks like that and if they did in real life people would think they were idiots...All this to say the show is really well done, animation is great, but tone down the awkward swearing and save it for moments that can deliver real impact to a line of dialogue, and you'll have a masterpiece.

A lot of humor, a little bit of swearing. You can see a little bit of character development in good measure. Only thing i wish i would have seen before the end of second season, it's how the hell did they meet each other. We learn a little bit of each others, but not how they came to be a group. We probably learn that in a season or 2. Any how, great show! Watch it!",

Which overall suffers from lack of stakes, very trope heavy writing and some pacing issues.I don't write reviews; but I hate this show for how much potential it had. I wish it was just simply bad.The animation is gorgeous (I can't overstate this), the voice acting is world class, and same with the editing and direction.The place in which this show originated from (a specific dnd game a group played?) hurts it at every stage of its story.The cast is too large with the thickest of plot armor. The settings and tropes are tired and toothless, all of which have been done better countless times before. No matter how grand the visual or build up of suspense, it falls flat when there is no stakes. The themes within are also soft; the clich\u00e9 of characters growing a moral conviction moments before ending the main villains life had me turning off the last episode early.It generally sucks to see a show that has had so much love and time poured into it fall completely on its face because of poor writing. Plot holes and inconsistencies that could be fixed in an short afternoon of rewrites; I will never understand how shows such as these come out with such fundamental mistakes.I see they are going to make a season two. I hope they don't pull their punches with the jokes and themes next time.",

            "content": "I may not be a fan of role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, but after watching seasons one and two of The Legend of Vox Machina, I must express the main points that I found were under par!The first thing to note has to be the pacing! Some scenes could have been more timely in places like the lore, which prevented me from learning about the deeper meaning behind the characters and their world. If I had changed the show's structure to meet the viewers' expectations, I would've made each episode forty minutes long.Secondly is the gang, Vox Machina themselves, who never interested me whatsoever. Although they're a bunch of misfits whose job is to save the realm of Exandria from powerful evil forces, none of them, I believed, packed a punch.Furthermore, the main cast portraying each of the members of Vox Machina tried their hardest to make me care about them emotionally, but I could see their Achilles Heel easily. What I mean is they could've voiced their roles naturally, like they're in a real life conversation!I had to skip through some of the main characters' dialogue simply because I found them boring. The secondary characters' roles tend to help out Vox Machina in different situations, whoever they stumble upon during their travels.Thirdly has to be the writing! Honestly, I found it not engaging as I hoped it would! To put it this way, the characters' different styles of humour, whether Vox Machina or the supporting ones, didn't make me laugh or cry at all! The writers could've done more effort at adding raw emotion, rather than putting in stale dialogue for me to listen to in some episodes.The amount of swearing done by the characters would've been a good idea for the creators to enjoy doing while recording their lines in the studio, but not for me! I understand that swearing is the norm on adult-friendly TV shows, but it would've been better if there weren't any on this show I'm reviewing.Finally, the battles between Vox Machina and the evil forces at play didn't suit my style! The animation may have been smooth nonetheless, but I've seen better!Overall, The Legend of Vox Machina isn't the legendary show I thought it was.",

            "content": "The series opens without a long exposition, but immediately with an interesting subplot. With the help of which it is clear how the characters live in this world and what problems they face. We are very quickly introduced to the bright main characters. Since one of the characters is a cheerful and vulgar bard, there will be a lot of humor, music and songs. But first impressions can be deceiving. Real characters begin to reveal themselves through events that put pressure on the characters. Funny scenes where the protagonists find themselves in an awkward position, as well as in battles that are superbly staged and do not leave any of the team members in the shadows. Picked up a great moment for a dramatic inciting incident that forces the characters to make moral choices. What touches the soul of the viewer and brings them closer to Vox Machina.The antagonists are diverse, not stereotyped and imposing. They throw very difficult challenges to the heroes, surpass them in various aspects, which makes their conflict even more interesting. In several episodes there are detective elements, you can think about who the villain is and what his motives are. Which leads to unexpected plot twists, not even counting the twists in the battles, and they will also be. In one series, the authors managed to weaken my vigilance several times and surprise me. When this happened, I remembered that there were clues and I could have guessed before. For this, special praise to the authors. Not every detective work manages to do this so skillfully.At some points, it felt like the characters were balancing on the verge of breaking the fourth wall. The feeling from the fact that this is a fantasy hero is changing to the fact that this is a group of friends from our world who got there and have fun. This is suitable for the film adaptation of a tabletop role-playing game. It is surprising why there are so few works of this type. I hope this will change and in the future we will have many adventures of Vox Machina and other interesting companies of heroes in their worlds.You are waiting for charismatic heroes and villains, plot twists, original and exciting battles, vulgar and sophisticated humor, cool music and songs.

It is beautifully done on what I see and I would like to see more.... a lot more.",

The plot is okay, the characters are written in a certain way I guess. But the dialoque is easily worth a 2 or less. The characters literrally converse with not even half a second pauses in between and the intonation doesn't sound right at all when a character reacts to someone/something. I predict that when this show hits the masses the score will drop significantly. And for the people that grade this show high i recommend some proper fantasy anime or for example Arcane on \"the other streaming service\" to go watch that and compare.",

Empowered female characters, healthy relationships and friendships, and lots of heroism.Honestly the show is great in every way, I'd say it's not a show for young children because of a couple scenes of adult imagery and innuendoes. However it does what it does best tell an amazing action fantasy story with fun and comedy at healthy doses.I wholeheartedly hope they do MANY MORE seasons they can easily do 4 or 5 more with all the plot and storylines from critical role's campaign.",

            "content": "This is an Amazon show adapted from Critical Role: Campaign I, probably the touchstone of this recent wave of Twitch and YouTube D&D shows, emblematic of the game's resurgence in the late 2010s.It's crazy how much the liveness and hard-line game aspects of the original show made that experience. That sense that the story could go anywhere and that it's even happening is a miracle of improv talent. The spontaneous banter and creator personality that would leak into the project. Shows don't usually have their own cast members gasping at plot twists as they happen, and that's something special.Not knocking that original story by any means, even if I always thought that the cast was better than the material (LA by Night is an example of better storytelling done in the same format by partially the same crew). This simplifies, rushes and takes all subtlety out of most of the quieter characterisation essential to investment in the action and freeing the cast from just being two-dimensional archetypes. Mercer's voice as a worldbuilder quite literally gets lost. The bulk of this adapts easily his worst arc back when Vox Machina was at their most unlikeable.Scanlan goes from the best to the worst character in the group, even if Riegel (especially early gross-out humour Riegel) antics were never going to translate well to animated television. The adaptation's biggest problem is that sometimes it doesn't want to be for children, and sometimes it doesn't want to be for adults, and sometimes in the same beat.But it's still fun and obviously a fanservice-y but very professionally made passion project with solid pacing and character design. Legitimately monumental that it even came together. Has very comparable production value to Invincible's first season. It's hard to complain, and it's refreshing to watch a Critical Role plot I can actually follow after Exandria Unlimited & Campaign III. You'll probably know at a glance whether this'll be your thing or not.If this very niche property or the game of D&D interests you at all, start with Campaign II or one of the one-shots. I'll always owe it for getting me started on the only thing I love more than film.",

            "content": "An amazing journey for Critical Role from being a home game a little over 6 years ago no to being their own company, creating their own comics and merch based around their original home characters to raising over 11million dollars on Kickstarter when their goal was only 800 000. Insane, truly insane and amazing that something like this exists.The acting and writing are phenomenal. I see some reviews saying that some of the humor is cringe, I can see where they are coming from but that is sort of the essence of critical role in a nutshell. Hilarious? Yes. Cringe moments? Yes. Moments of heartbreak and darkness? Yes.Its essentially a home DnD campaign adapted to animation and there will be all the hilariousness, raunchiness, awkwardness and fowl language that would be in a real Campaign. I, personally think they captured it beautifully.Its not perfect though. I can why someone who does not know DnD, or Critical Role for that matter may find it a bit unapproachable.There is this inside joke they do in the show that Critical Role cast cannot deal with doors in any DnD scenario and there are a couple of animated scenes that have that as a focus. From an outside perspective you many think this is strange or \"cringe\" which is fair. I also saw in a couple reviews that the world building is rushed and I'd have to agree with that as well. The world is beautiful but it may be confusing just dropping someone who does not know these characters or world right into the action with little explanation, may make the buy in a little more difficult for you.That being said though I hope this show goes on for a long time and many people watch it because it really is an amazing show with amazing characters and I hope they are able to keep the new comers watching because we could always use more Critters!!

I think Travis Willingham has the worst English accent I've ever heard. He sounds like maybe a Texan trying to do an English accent. Why on earth would you have him do an accent he obviously can't do when the character doesn't need to have any accent at all? He must have used Dick Van Dyke's Bert the chimney sweep as his model.",

Not a die hard balls-to-wall-critter-obsessive but I've seen pretty much all of the campaigns over the years and I like the cast and crew.Beware this contains show spoilers.....Seriously though... SPOILERS....I think even without that prior fan knowledge, this show is good... Good, but not amazing. It definitely has its miss-steps, it's weaker characteristics and weaker episodes.Character wise I really like what they've done with Vex'ahlia, Percy, and even Pike by filling in her time away from the table.Vax'ildan doesn't have a personality or characterisation, and Keyleths only characterisation is only 'I can't do magic very well until every screams at me, and then I end the fight' which is super two-dimensional.And Grog and Scanlan are bad. They are two of my favourite characters piloted by two of my favourite players, but they leaned super hard into them as comic relief which has made them into caricatures of the characters in the live play campaign. They still have some good moments, but both are a let down imo.I feel like story was finding it's feet throughout the run though, the first two episodes were bad, the pacing was all over the place, as was the narrative, the stakes and well... Everything, it was a breakneck pace to wrap up krieg and position them as protectors if the realm that didn't stop to actually tell it's story.But from episode 3 it gets pretty much better and better. Still a few teething problems and missteps along the way, but the Briarwood arc was badass. The wraiths in episode 4 were a particular highlight, as well as the sheer brutality of the undead giants, and the silver tongue fight... And our first glimpse of No-Mercy Percy gunning down Stonefell.I don't think it's a 10/10 that knocked it out if the park like many reviews. And to be fair I understand the people who've given it a 1/10 because they don't like gross-out humour sex-jokes and swearing. That's a personal taste that's going to offend some people.But overall I think it's a solid opening season, and that if they can improve upon it moving into the Chroma Conclave arc, then it has all the trappings of a great series waiting to grow into itself.",
