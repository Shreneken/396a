You hope for some big twist at the end to redeem this long insufferable movie, but alas, there is no such twist. The plot is a joke, and most of the acting is wooden, especially by the detective and the sister. With an instantly recognizable brand, from her childhood days to being the \"inventor\" of #metoo in modern times, Alyssa Milano is used as the big draw for this, and mostly she succeeds. She is no Jennifer Lawrence but she is a decent actress. Give credit where credit is due. She is truly the only thing that makes this remotely watchable.",

The story itself could have been interesting but the acting and especially the dialogue were so bad! Alyssa Milano looks awful in this movie. Terrible performance on her part, really. The chemistry between her and Sam Page didn't feel right either. Too many scenes were repetitive (and redundant). Some were just happening for the sake of the story, like the part where Grace is becoming a consultant (I mean, come on!). Everything about this movie was really fake. Nothing felt authentic, not the love, not the anger, not the sadness, not even the so called \"revelations\". It was so stiff, nothing was fluent. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Or maybe read the book. I haven't read it but it's got to be better than this. Another failed Netflix production, but what else is new?!",

            "review_title": "An Awful Netflix Film",
            "content": "This film premiered on Netflix a few days ago so I decided to watch Brazen and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after a tragedy, an author who is an expert in murder mysteries aids the police in their attempts to find a killer.Main Character\nAlyssa Milano plays the lead character in this film and she is just really bad here. Lets face it the most famous thing she is known for these days is the fact that the ship in Guardians of The Galaxy is named after her not her current acting ability. She overacts throughout and her character is so infuriating and annoying to watch, she always thinks she is better then everybody else in the film and it comes off as pretentious.Supporting Characters\nThe cast is small and unremarkable with their characters. The main one is the main detective played by Sam Page, the two of them are meant to have chemistry but they really don't and it kills this film. He is written badly and feels like a weak character despite the fact that he is meant to be the best detective they have which is laughable. The rest of the characters add little value and I just didn't care about anybody in this film and that was a big let down.Story\nThe story at least has a bit of intrigue to it, the best thing I can say is that I slightly enjoyed watching the investigation into the case and how it links to together with other elements of the film. Unfortunately, though I worked out what was going on pretty quickly which made the reveal feel lacklustre to me.Script\nThe script is bad, it does nothing to make itself too imaginative or creative. It is filled with a bunch of clich\u00e9s with none of it working. The romance and humour fails and the drama overall misses the mark in my opinion.Style\nThe film has some pretty good action sequences and I thought they did an effective job of showing this killer going after these woman, so that was one aspect that was handled well. But the film struggles with its pacing and really rushes the final act, the film also ends so abruptly that the film fails to explain what really happened and it makes you really wonder why you bothered.Overall\nOverall, Brazen is another awful Netflix film that should be avoided at all cost. Netflix make quality programming but they really have to improve some of these original films that are just rubbish.Rating - 2/10.",

Due to the subject matter and themes, this film should have been darker and many avenues could have been taken with it, but it reminded me of those basic thrillers you see on Lifetime (or Channel 5 in the UK). So many more twists could have been thrown in. I expect better from Netflix. It didn't have enough suspects, and so it was quite predictable and a little flaccid. I do like Alyssa Milano however, I think she's a good actress and this film was really a waste of her talent. I see it was based on a book which I've not read, so I'm unable to make comparisons, but the book has to be better than the movie, right?",

            "content": "First, I want to say it's very unfair that so many of the negative reviews for this movie are based on the lead actor's personal politics, because the reality is this movie deserves to be judged on just how truly awful it is and we can also be pretty sure the people who hate Milano didn't watch the movie to begin with.What this movie does is give some wooden acting and cheap production and direction to an already cliched and unoriginal story by a pretty mediocre romance novelist. Everything about this plot is cookie cutter. I had to hold back the laughter when Grace was talking to the detectives and said one of the suspects was her former brother-in-law, Jonathan Breezewood \"the third.\" \"He's a bigshot attorney,\" Grace said. Keep in mind, this character is supposed to be a famous author herself. What self-respecting writer would use such a hackneyed phrase?So the murdered sister was a teacher who had a secret second job as a webcam model. Gee, how original. And her ex-husband whom she was in a custody battle with was a suspect. Again, snore. And then of course one of her students who was a slightly awkward literature nerd happened to have a special interest in her. Is this a movie script or a mad libs exercise?One of my favorite scenes (before I got too bored to keep watching) was when the detectives went to visit the corporate office of the website she was modeling on and meet with the CEO to ask questions about her clients. First, let's acknowledge how stupid it is that the OnlyFans-like website she was using just happens to be headquartered in the same town she lived in. Now add on how stupid it is that detectives would talk to a corporate executive to try to get information about who the woman's subscribers (which the movie calls clients) were. This is simply not how an investigation like this would work at all in the real world. They would most likely have to subpoena that information or at the very least get it from a low-level security employee, not the CEO. It's how a very simple-minded or purely unmotivated person would write it though. And the best part of the scene is that the CEO's office walls are covered in giant TVs that are supposed to be showing a bunch of different models live streaming, but if you look for even a second you'll realize all the screens are showing the same 10-second loops over and over again. Do they really think the CEO of OnlyFans has dozens of screens streaming porn going on at all times in their office?I rarely stop a movie after I've started it, but this one was just trash. It doesn't even have the cheesy, campy entertainment factor of similar Lifetime and Hallmark movies. It's just a dreary, stupid, pointless waste of time.",

Alyssa plays someone close to her heart, powerful, driven and woke - as in fighting inequality and all that jazz. Now that is more than a noble cause and her character is one that we should celebrate I suppose ... yet, she comes off as annoying to most and even when she has the upper hand and should be superior (against an \"evil\" man) ... he is almost more sympathetic than she is ... which is insane considering he is painted as bad Dude.Anyway, the movie has quite a few cliches, tries to be sizzling too, but never achieves any goals it sets out to do.",

So, I watched it to know how bad it is.After I watched it, I found out that it wasn't that bad after all. The story is kind of good. A little bit of mystery. But I must admit what some people were saying is right. The acting is kind of not that good. I feel like their acting is not sincere. It's like it's not coming from the heart, not serious. It's like they are not taking seriously. A little bit like child play. Just like that. But I've seen the worst. So, I think this kind of acting isn't that bad.It seems to me that this film is made with low budget. I'm not saying it's low budget because there aren't famous actors and all. I'm saying that it seemed to be low budget film. The quality is a bit low.

Literally every element of this story has been done, done, and done again. No twists, no reversals, no surprises means no excitement and no suspense.But that's not the worst of it. There's an elephant in the room that simply can't be overlooked: Alyssa Milano.While Milano wasn't any worse than anyone else in this movie (which doesn't mean she was good), she's problematic and hard to watch. Like most people, I am aware she's an activist whose convictions are extreme and ethics situational, and that her persona is caustic. While her politics shouldn't be relevant to the movie, the fact is we live in a world in which personal conduct has a bearing on professional reputation. It's no different for Milano. The fact that she's an all around unpleasant person is impossible to forget, and nothing about Brazen is strong enough to overcome that. The other reviews here are further indication she no longer has enough goodwill left to be viable in the entertainment industry, especially in the absence of a polished, deeply felt performance.All that said, the film sports decent production values. It's competently filmed with good framing and good color. The sound is decent as well. Unfortunately, there's nothing worthwhile here to amplify.",

Which is a blatant lie, clouded by their hatred towards her. They must really hate her guts! Jesus! Her acting hasn't dropped at all since her Charmed days. It's always good. I won't say it's amazing, since I'm not an actor, I don't know the criteria of amazing acting. But if it was lousy, even an amateur like me would've recognized it.With that being said about the main actress, I'll just point some weaknesses this movie has. The story is very simple, it's meant to be a mystery but turned out to be too simple for a complex crime story. The plot is too predictable. Within the first 15 minutes, I already could guess the culprit. The next 15 minutes, I knew for sure who the killer was. So there wasn't any real mystery in this movie. The Desiree part (Alyssa's Desiree) was meant to be sexy, but that fell short and looked kinda awkward. So if the objective was to turn on the audience, they failed to do so. And last but not least, the killing scenes were less intense than they were supposed to be. Maybe it's the director's lack on the action department. They should consult a fighting scene choreographer to make it more intense.But after taking all of these shortcomings, I still think that this movie is still watchable. It's a decent movie that doesn't deserve a 1 star rating. Don't believe all of those haters. If you need something to kill time with, you won't regret watching this flick.",

            "content": "Based on Nora Roberts' bestselling novel by the name \"Brazen Virtue\" that hit the shelves in May 1988, the Netflix film \"Brazen\" deals with the dark side of desire and is a story about serial killing. Grace Miller (Alyssa Milano) is a popular author of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries, enjoying the publicity of her latest novel when she is summoned by her younger sister Kathleen. Visiting their family home where Kathleen lives, Grace discovers that her sister is going through a messy divorce and barely makes enough to survive as a school teacher. She barely has had enough time to understand the mental condition of Kathleen, when a shocking tragedy strikes her - Grace returns home after a date with Kathleen's neighbour DC Ed Jennings (Sam Page) to find Kathleen brutally murdered. More surprise awaits her as she discovers soon that Kathleen was leading a double life, as she worked for an online pornography site.She won't suffer silently and watch the police chug along cluelessly to find her sister's assasin and virtually bulldozes her way into the police department, seeking to help Ed track down the potential suspects. And yet, there's another murder, almost similar in attributes. Both the victims worked for the same online site and acted as dominatrix. Both the deadbodies were left in a particular pose. Ed isn't pleased with Grace's intrusive ploy in spite of their romantic liaison as he finds it difficult to draw the line between his professional and personal life.\"Brazen\" is an ordinary murder mystery by the current standards where there's no dearth of such thrillers either in the print media or as motion pictures. Perhaps its adaptation of a vintage bestseller is far too delayed to make an impression now. We need to appreciate that the novel first surfaced almost three and a half decades back when the concept could have created shock waves and evoked die-hard excitement but is considered passe today. The film is like a hundred such stories we have seen or read in the past twenty years with the suspense rather flat and the climax rather underwhelming.",

The police department is inept in every aspect that at no time does it seem anyone is really in charge of closing the case. There is just a lot of running around asking questions but never any real analysis to consolidate the data for the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Hallmark Mysteries does a good job for the viewer by combining drama, romance, mystery and humor in one package. Brazen doesn't have humor, romance is clumsy, no drama or mystery.

There is bad acting, and then there is Brazen's acting, which looks so fake that it feels forced, like that is part of the script.The main plot might be creative, but the quality is so bad I didn't care.

The need to obsolve itself of any predicted feminist backlash, shows this movie's ass. Its attempt at moral purity rings futile, because it itself is unconfident in reconciling with its own sky-high moral code. Alyssa Milano of course cannot resist being \"reluctantly\" sexy - you know, for women everywhere! - in an arrogant display by both her and her character's supposed \"selfless heroism\".

That line invoked to me that she is that kind of a scrappy girlboss, fluent in sarcasm who drinks right wing tears, from a mug that literally says that, which would not be heavy-handed in this movie. Her character also arrogantly purports that she as a crime novel-writer, is qualified to investigate a murder case. But I'm not complaining about any of this, I liked it, it's up my ally, a glass is dropped on the floor in slow-mo, which is always a good sign in my book. My only complaint is that the ending does not go off the rails enough, like The Boy Next Door starring Jennifer Lopez, but it's close.",

Alyssa teams up with the hunky police detective next door to sift through the suspects including her sister's rich entitled ex-husband who is embroiled in a savage custody battle, sister's sullen air pod wearing student whose grades are slipping and the creepy school janitor that knows a little too much about sister's secret life.Sounds juicy right? I mean how do you get this wrong?Unfortunately it plods along at such a slow pace, that by the time we finally hit the reveal of the killer I had long since lost interest. The ultimate downfall is the lacklustre relationship between Alyssa and the cop-next-door. They do cutesy really well and then straight away get cranky at each other as the investigation intensifies. We never really get any love/hate sexual tension vibes and much as with the killers reveal, the will they/won't they dynamic is more like 'who cares?'The absolute highlight of the film is Malachai Weir (who you may recognise from Billions) as the laid back partner of the hunky cop next door. He is the perfect identification point for the audience as he honestly looks like he could give a stuff if the murders gets solved or not. Also keep your eyes peeled here for Alison Araya as Police Cheif who is absolutely hilarious in the new Peacekeeper series.Oh and it goes without saying - they missed a huge opportunity by dressing Alyssa Milano as a Dominatrix and NOT having her ask 'Who's\nthe Boss?'",

One does not expect much but you do want a few tense moments, a twist no matter how small. Sadly nothing satisfies. I am putting aside the story and lack of tension, the writing is careless which causes the acting to be cringe worthy to watch. I felt like I was watching a regular 40 min episode of a light hearted drama series most of the time. There is no character build up, no relationship foundations set and zero attempts at allowing the audience to think for themselves and make predictions.Apart from that, the reality side of the matter makes it very hard to digest - the head of the police is just going to simply allow a writer to be a consultant after clearly stating that the lead investigator should ensure boundaries with the writer 5 mins earlier??? Then they allow this writer to use herself as bait to catch the serial killer after 15 secs of convincing??? Then this supposedly grieving sister is going to make the best of losing her beloved sister by moving into her deceased sister's home, get it on with the neighbour/lead investigator, live a happy life and completely ignore the fact that her nephew now is going to be raised by an arrogant pompous father???Sadly a complete waste of time and I feel sorry for anyone who invested in this project.

I could only watch half of the film because the rest has no motive to stay on.1.) Casting issue:\nI don't quite get why the female captain chose Alyssa to be on the case. Female captain delivered the lines with robotic tone and poor body expression. Therefore, I was not sure how Alyssa's character got the job in this murder case since the family victim should not be an advisor. It makes no sense why this female boss allows her male detectives to go with Alyssa's random ideas (book fan or sexist?). This it the sample of bad casting and poor written of this film.2.) Poor Written:\nThe first half of this film. Alyssa tried to express her acting and dialog very well. Yet, the second half is the issue when the writers want to spell out or highlight the killer. It is too obvious that the male characters get strange lines to make Alyssa stop saying the long dialogs or sometimes they repeat each others. The poster tries to make this film as romantic thriller, but I don't get the romance in the film since the detective guy does not have a decent dialog or show the connection to the audience. He is more like a background character. Why borther made the poster like a romantic story? The film does not let other characters to breath, but forces them to dash and talk. The ending lasts only two minutes with zero chemistry of two characters.The only thing that I like about this film is NO Racial propaganda like those ABC or CW. The film does not push too many Asian, Black or Latino on the sceen because the only one spotlight in this film is Alyssa's chracter. The rest is not memorable due to the casting or written.",

I have read the book and enjoyed it at the time. But the movie is absurdly unbelievable and Milano was completely the wrong choice for the lead. The foreshadowing was so heavy handed it wasn't even trying to be a mystery. I read this book yeaaarrrrs ago. I had no memory going in who the killer was but I knew who the killer was in his first scene. I'm happier with the acting of Emilie Ullerup and Sam Page but Milano was not relatable at all. I'm sick of these movies treating their audience as though they are unsophisticated. I was hoping for a grittier, sexier take and Netflix did not deliver. Please going forward stop relying solely on the Name Recognition of your actors and sell the story. If anyone who has watched 20 minutes of true crime is going to call out your realism then make it believable. Stop overselling the plot. Please treat the material with a smidgen of respect and the audience like a woman's viewpoint matters. Netflix don't do a bad take of a lifetime movie. Take a sexy murder mystery and SELL it. This book was was good but it was published in 1988. It's actually book 2 in a series! The author has newer more timely material you could have brought to the screen like Come Sundown or Shelter in Place. Instead you pick a novel that is really old and only minimally bring it up to date. Do better Netflix. Treat the material with respect. Get direction that is less heavy handed and leads who can sell the story. I should have given this 2 stars but the rest of the cast don't deserve that.",

Well, except for the love interest cop's partner.He plays the part with a lot of self-awareness for how his character is written and what kind of film he is in. It is a bit like he is sharing a wink with the audience, half the time.Now, you will read a lot about how horrible Milano is in this film and yes, she is not good, she is also not the worst actor in the film and at least with the 1-star reviews, you definitely can see that some people are rating this film due to her politics or her person and not really for what it is.Which kind of annoys me, because this is a bad film, and when people read this kind of review, they might think that it just got review-bombed due to Milano's politics.So, yes there are a few of those reviews, from what I can see about 10-12%, so, disregard the 1-star reviews, but probably also the 10-star ones, because some of these are probably that high to counter the others.I think this film is a solid 3, a 4 if you are feeling generous.Now, I did not feel generous and tbh, it is because the film is too focused on Milano's politics as well.The male cops are fools, men are creepy or evil or stupid, the female police captain is \"sharp.\" Because of course it is very smart to let a crime novelist work on the case of her own killed sister, as if she is part of the police herself.Milano's character's books are about evil men, who hurt the weakest of society (probably women, I guess that's what she is saying? Maybe they didn't really think this through). It really is all so cringe.Look, the disinterest of cops to solve cases involving sex workers is a well established fact and definitely something that needs to be addressed and changed, in general how often women become victims of violence through men, also does not reflect well on our society.That much is true, but for me in any form of entertainment (film, book, game, TV show, comicbook whatever) the story and the characters have to come first, agenda, politics, topics, issues, representation etc. All of that should only come AFTER having a good story, a well written script.Here, probably due to Milano's involvement, it's just too in your face, too obvious.I don't dislike Milano, I loved her as a kid growing up with \"Who's the Boss,\" liked her in Charmed, hell I even had lots of fun with her over the top persona in \"Insatiable\".just recently, but like with her former Charmed co-star Rose McGowan, it seems the more politically active they become, the worse their acting has become. Probably due to how much they focus on what is more important to them.I can understand that, but it's still a bad thing to happen with an actor, female or male.To sum it up, an unsurprising, badly written, weak-acted low-budget thriller, with a very unsympathetic protagonist and too overt involvement of agenda. And oh my god, was it obvious from the moment we get to know him who the killer is.Don't let yourself be fooled by the 1-star ratings either way, the film isn't a 1 out of 10, but it's also not only rated that bad because misogynists review-bombed it.",

Brazen reminds me of a Cliff's Notes version of what this movie should have & could have been.

It would be possible to add a large number of turns. We look forward to the most with Netflix. There were not enough defendants in the mute, for this reason someone was absolutely predictable and somewhat apathetic. But we like Alyssa Milano, we think that the beloved is an excellent artist, also this movie was a useless waste of her talent.

The charisma of Alyssa Milano in the title role adorns the movie in its own way, but does not add weight to this very depressing picture. Honestly, it's better to revisit the classic detective stories by Alfred Hitchcock (\"Stage Fright\") or Robert Altman (\"The Long Goodbye\") if you want vivid emotions and real intrigue that keeps you up to the finale.",

Usually a fireman who is building his own boat or a lumber jack who volunteers at a day care centre.....you know....a 'Brad'. A proper hero (I think I have been a bit sick in my mouth....sorry).

In this case a respected cop building a house.Yes, one of them films.It's as predictable as a hangover on a Saturday and as gritty as Peppa pig eating marshmallows in tomato soup and as sick making as both of those things.

There is none in the film. No swearing either. This is an afternoon matinee that had no surprises or plot twists.Oh yes as usual the 'Brad' hero turns up at the end after the (and I use this word wrongly) 'mystery' is solved and killer identified and pretty much captured by the heroine.
