            "content": "For a movie that promotes the final showdown between Laurie and Michael, it's very head scratching that Myers doesn't make his first on screen appearance to almost 45 mins into the film. That was a really bad sign. The movie really centers around Corey, not Michael nor Laurie for that matter. It's about his severe struggles with reality and how he continues to unravel from a freak babysitting accident. The film does do a decent job of making you root for the guy and all the people who were pricks to him look to get their comeuppance. But again, way too much time was spent on Corey and not Michael and Laurie. The last scene though was a very creative way to put everybody's mind at rest that this time Michael is certainly NOT coming back. I would say the movie as a whole was disappointing but I'd be lying if I said I was expecting it to be great before watching it. Most people I'm sure would agree.",

            "review_title": "Cheap and random \"conclusion\" to the franchise",
            "content": "To give context to how little I cared about HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022), the \"conclusion\" to this now bloated, confusing, retconned franchise, I completely forgot that it was coming out this year. When I saw trailers on YouTube recently, I was thinking it was coming out some time next year. Also, I literally found out on the SAME DAY it was premiering that it was available on Peacock! And I was like, it's Halloween month, this is (supposedly) the final Halloween film, I have time to spare, so I'll give it a go. Maybe my low expectations will be countered with something remotely decent. And, honestly, this movie might actually be worse than the atrocious predecessor Halloween Kills! It's that bad. Looking very cheap and less cinematic than the prior 2 entries, Halloween Ends tells what feels like an incredibly random story that could have been any throwaway sequel from the 80s.Inexplicably, this movie opts to focus on a completely new character Corey and the filmmakers chose one of the most boring and annoying horror movie protagonists/antagonists that I can recall in recent memory. In the film's pre-credits scene set on Halloween night of 2019, Corey accidentally killed the kid he was babysitting for and spends the rest of the movie, set in 2022, being the town pariah. The film opens with an interesting premise that the Haddonfield citizens are so paranoid about Michael Myers that they implode and turn on each other, but it never really followed through with it. Instead, we get all these weird scenes of random citizens verbally attacking the main characters Corey and the Strodes for being the cause of all the evil and killings. What's odd is that even though Laurie (once again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) was barely a blip in Kills, even though she gets a lot more screentime in Ends, she still feels like a bit player.As I said, it focuses on this new character Corey, who ends up in a forbidden romance with Laurie's annoying granddaughter Allyson (reprised by Andi Matchak), the most useless character in this recent retconned trilogy of films. I couldn't stand Allyson in the 2018 movie or Kills, and Ends just confirms my belief that Allyson was nothing more than a terrible plot device in the trilogy. In H2018 and Kills, she just a random nuisance who got caught up in the action while Laurie (in H2018) and Karen (in Kills) were the proactive badasses who got things done. Then Laurie gets sidelined while Karen gets killed off, while Allyson gets to hang around and continue to be useless. In Ends, this time it's Corey who gets to be proactive while Allyson is just his love interest. Somehow, this girl is a filler love interest after she's been in 2 movies, while the new guy gets to be the lead. Shows how uninteresting she is. Also, Lindsay is in this movie for no reason whatsoever than to exist, just like she did in Kills.But the worst offense in this movie is how little Michael got to do. For some reason, he's been hiding out under a bridge for the last 4 years since the tragic events of H2018/Kills and no one has even caught him yet. Then he only re-surfaces when Corey gets thrown over the bridge by those 4 juvenile delinquents, who for some reason are dressed like it's still the 1970s. So he takes Corey in as his apprentice and the duo tag teams it for a while until Corey decides he wants to be the alpha and incapacitates Michael stealing his mask and taking over being the main killer. To top off this weirdness, Allyson basically stays with Corey knowing how sick he is. He literally tells her that he killed a person and her first instinct is to comfort him and go on a date! No reporting the crime to the police...she just wants to keep making out with him. The duo have all these weird scenes where Allyson is all like she's drawn to him and they were meant to be together.In fact, the tone of this entire movie was strange with a terrible supporting cast of unlikable characters. I know it's a \"small\" town, but what was with all these random moments of people running into Laurie, Corey, and Allyson and spewing out judgment on them? There was that grocery store parking lot scene where the lady scolded Laurie for being the cause of Michael slashing her cousin's throat (how did that old lady survive Kills?), the 4 teen bullies always running into and bullying Corey, the creepy cop (who looks twice her age) hitting on Allyson, the couple whose kid Corey accidentally killed just show up randomly in the bar including the father delivering that weird monologue, Corey's strict and holier-than-thou mother, and his boss/stepfather's odd line \"I hope you find love\"? So much weird dialogue in this movie. Then there were filler characters like Allyson's co-workers: the sleazy doctor and the mouthy nurse. Were they supposed to be comic relief?The climax made no sense. Laurie shoots Corey a couple of times, then purposefully shoots the wall using up her bullets, lets him grab a knife to supposedly kill her. But she literally said a few minutes ago \"Did you think I was going to kill myself?\" He stabs himself and then she's sad about it? He just tried to kill her. Of course the plot deviced Allyson walks in and assumes Laurie killed him and then drives away then gets a call from Hawkins (played again by Will Patton) who asks about Laurie because she called about a suicide, so she goes back. Didn't Allyson realize that was a hoax? She just saw Laurie standing over Corey's body with a knife. Why would Laurie commit suicide when she just stopped her assailant? Also, why would Laurie tell someone she was going to kill herself? Then Michael pops up, Laurie battles him, gets the upper hand, then slows around and killer talks him until he can grab her throat, Allyson shows up, she runs her mouth unnecessarily, they don't finish him and instead wait for the police and entire town to parade Michael's body to the junkyard where they mutilate his body. The End.There were several times where I kept looking at how much time was left in this tedious film because that's how bored and frustrated I was. The first 30 minutes felt like an hour. By the 50-minute mark, there was a whole hour left and I couldn't believe it because the movie felt so slow and random with such an unimpressive cast of characters. There was actually one decent scene in the entire movie (thus the extra star) and that was the scene between Laurie and Hawkins in the grocery store. It was actually well-written and acted by Curtis and Patton, but then the movie followed it with randomness, just like virtually every other moment in the film. Kills and now this film Ends are so bad, it's making me appreciate H2018 even more because that movie had some cohesion, tension, buildup, and horror and a smashing ending, even though it had it's share of cringe moments indicative of modern writing and filmmaking. But Kills and Ends are just cringe films start to finish. It's hard to believe that this is how the storied franchise is actually going to end. They'll probably reboot/remake it again for like the 5th time. They may have to because this film is not the right note to go out on.",

            "content": "I hope the next installment will forget about arthouse Halloween, and be back to the normal timeline. Halloween was never a psychological thriller. It was just a silly slasher flick, with stereotypical characters, and an unbelievably resistant vilain. Just like previous installments of this trilogy, Halloween Ends, takes itself too seriously, without having something to back it up. Sometimes it felt like a cheap soap, other times, like reality TV. Or a bad play, with uncomfortable chairs. And people telling their boring live, and sharing their feelings, to each other, and us... And when the horror kicked in, it made you laugh more than it should've. With the way it couldn't be effectively scary. I didn't mind the \u00ab new approach \u00bb but was it really one? Because at the end of the day, it still felt like the same all over again. And why make the kill count so unsympathetic? What's the point in watching a slasher movie, where you can't wait for characters to die. I liked the finale showdown between Michael and Laurie, but they felt like two people who fight for divorce at that point. Which is why the siblings connection gave their encounters, more depth and meaning, in previous \u00ab no more canon \u00bb installments. I was getting sick of Laurie's victim/survivor rambling, or was it Jamie Lee's? But I liked that end voice over. It was in par with the rest of the idea behind this new side of the story. But why did they had to end Ends like a Tarantino movie? And why the parallel between Michael and Corey? Like they said in 2018, he picked her randomly, so making it look like Laurie was trying to prevent Allyson her own disappointment, was too random and far fetched. They just were full of ideas, but weren't good enough filmmakers to make it all stick. Sorry, but that's just the way I feel. I cringed every time Kyle Richards appeared onscreen. Just because she was in the first Halloween, doesn't mean she had to be there too. It made Haddonfield feel a lot more like a hillbilly town, than it appeared to be in the original movie. Maybe it's the end for this heroine, but I doubt studios will allow this to be the last of the series. So see you in a couple of years, and don't mind me pretending it ended with H20.",

            "content": "Obnoxious brat Jeremy (Jaxon Goldenberg) locks his babysitter Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) in the attic. Corey gets flustered and kicks the attic door open, accidentally knocking Jeremy over the bannisters to land in a bloody heap at the feet of his parents, who have just arrived home.Corey is released but becomes a local pariah, someone for the people of Haddonfield to demonise now that Michael Myers isn't around. Except that Michael is around. He's been living in the sewers like a ninja turtle, presumably feeding on rats and poo. Or rat poo. After Corey is pushed off a bridge by local bullies, he is dragged underground by Michael, but Myers doesn't kill him: instead, they become best buds and go on a killing spree, which is bad news for Laurie Strode's granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) who has just started dating Corey. Fortunately, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has seen something in Corey's eyes that makes her believe that he is going down a dark path, but can she convince Allyson that her boyfriend is evil before it is too late?I went into Halloween Ends with the mindset 'How can director David Gordon Green possibly make a worse movie than Halloween Kills?'. I've just found out.The film kicks things off with a pre-credits sequence that made me wonder whether this was going to be a comedy, and it just gets worse. And worse. And worse. Each time I thought the film couldn't be any more insulting to horror fans, Green does the seemingly impossible.From the moment they show the metal crusher in the junkyard where Corey works, it's obvious that Michael will be reduced to mincemeat at the end. Less predictable is just how little Michael actually features in the film: this is a Halloween movie, so one might reasonably expect Myers to play a big part, but the series' iconic killer only makes brief appearances, the bulk of the film revolving around Corey. This is not what fans want!But it's not just the lack of Myers that makes this film a total failure: there's the awful script, which offers up more groan-worthy dialogue and godawful moments than its predecessor, something that I didn't think was even possible. Michael and Corey becoming pals is dreadful (I half expected to see Michael riding pillion on Corey's motorcycle), but for me the worst bits are when Corey tells Allyson that he has killed someone and she doesn't bat an eyelid, or when Laurie decides to pull the knife out of Corey's neck after he has stabbed himself, just as Allyson walks in through the door, leading the girl to believe that her gran has killed her boyfriend. Doh!After the inevitable and risible showdown between Laurie and Michael, and the disposing of the maniac's body in that grinder, the film finally ends, leaving David Gordon Green to focus on destroying another horror classic, The Exorcist (why does he hate horror fans so much? What have we ever done to him?).",

No trick or treat or scary halloween vibes here. I feel so bad for JLC for getting wrapped up in this garbage.

You're watching the thirteenth installment of a simple and good film made 44 years ago. Michael Myers has become a blood-transmitted disease, and Halloween is now a self-meta pseudophilosophical parody nightmare.The time-space continuum was broken, and Haddonfield now exists in two temporal realities simultaneously - 1978 and 2019. People act like videogame NPCs, you press the interaction key, and they speak in random text lines or do random things.There are many scenes in this film, none of which are connected in any way but are very diverse in nature. There was some good gore, and funny parody sketches with actors almost laughing on set.The film almost drove me into an epileptic seizure 30 minutes in, but then Shaft showed up, and things got really cool.In all seriousness, it seems to me that the script was assembled from scraps of something else, most likely a gritty thriller set in the '70s setting. They took some scene ideas and just slapped them over the tired Halloween routine.There is one more possibility, though. They probably wanted to pull off a Matrix sequel, making it bad and saying it was made that way deliberately. But this only works once, and they already did it with The Matrix Resurrections. So, intentionally making it trash doesn't justify anything.Overall rating - garbage fire/10. Looking forward to more sequels.",

Whoever handed the reigns over to David Gordon Green needs to be fired and blacklisted. Again, Green proves that he just cannot make a mainstream film. From the camera work right down to his actors performances(and these are good actors he's working with), he just cannot break from his indie roots, and I believe this really hurt the new trilogy. Look at the stark difference in directorial style from the first film in this trilogy compared to the other two and that will give you a bit of a clue as to what happened with production. The producers put far too much trust into their director, and the end result was catastrophic. Somebody, anybody, should have told him that most of this material makes no sense with the rest of the storyline and that nobody cares about any of these characters other than Michael Myers.I have many questions for Mr. Green. Such as, why did he decide Lorie Strode needed to be a narrator that sounded similar to a Jane Austen novel? Or, Why did you think giving Michael Myers a partner, or even thinking that someone would have the same evil inside them as he does, would be a good idea? Scratch that, why is Michael Myers not immortal and just going complete psycho killer on everyone, including the guy he ends up helping? And how are 2 women who weigh maybe about 90 lbs soaking wet could over power him in such a way? Also, if he's not immortal, how in the hell did he survive a house fire, get injured(shot, stabbed, etc.) and kill a bunch of people all in the same night, only to go into hiding for 4 years and somehow take care of his wounds and not die? I get that it is just a movie, but make it make sense!Not to mention, what is the deal with the political statements in the movie? Did the horror film about a maniac who wants to kill everything in his path to killing his family really need an overt political statement being made throughout? I personally don't and it, just like many, many other things, didn't even gel well in terms of the story. I also feel like I need to address the fact that this finale seems to forget it's a horror movie until about the last 15-20 mins. There are 2 kills in the first 80 mins, and then the end was just as unimpressive with the kills as the first 80 mins. I'd say it was on par with the last Scream film in terms of violence. Nowhere near the brutal deaths of Kills or, because it's fresh from last weekend, Terrifier 2.Overall, this has to be the worst in the franchise right next to Kills. Even Halloween: Resurrection was better than this. At least they knew how to stick with their own lore about Michael Myers. This final installment seems to forget everything about him, included the lore that was being set up by this trilogy. I suppose that's something I'm impressed by. Never seen a planned trilogy of a well known franchise ditch ideas from previous films in said trilogy. They're usually more planned than this slapdash effort. I do not think the Halloween franchise will ever recover from this.\u00bd a butcher knife out of 5.",

I thought the second one was terrible and the focus away from Michael Myers and towards social commentary was a bad choice then this film happens and makes the other two look like Godfather 1 & 2.What happened?The first hour is a weird, unrealistic love story and then all of a sudden Michael Myers appears, living in a pipe for 4 years and his \"spirit\" possesses some guy and they become Tag Team Champions of the Serial Murder Division. Then the end.None of the decisions anyone made, made any sense. None of the story made any sense and the whole thing was so delicately attached to the 2 films that came before it that it may as well have been a standalone film.Take Michael Myers out of this and you've got a boring love story that turns into a thriller. Keep Michael Myers in it and youve got a boring love story that kind of turns into a Halloween film for a few minutes.",

It is not as bad as some have made it out to be, definitely not as bad as the Rob Zombie entries, but this definitely is a TEXTBOOK way to NOT end a trilogy of films.I don't want to get into spoilers but if you read this before watching, go in with LOW expectations and you might come out not feelin as ripped off.",

The dialogue just had me saying \"shoot yourself\" and \"people don't talk like this\" multiple times. I suppose the nicest thing I can say for this film is that it looked good and the kills were bloody and messy, also a certain subplot I liked but I'll get to that later. The kills though they were also downright hilarious.Which will lead me to say this film only escapes being a 1 because of how much I was laughing. It was like a train wreck that I couldn't stop watching.Now for the subplot which I will not spoil, I will say that at first it had me rolling my eyes but as the film progressed it was getting more outlandish and because of that I came around to this plot line and just wanted them to go all the way with it. If they have I would've just been dying in my theater seat.Anyway this is exactly how I anticipated Halloween Ends to be especially after Kills, the only relief I have is that it's finally over. At least until the inevitable Halloween reboot/remake.IMDb: 2/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.",

They did that with Halloween H20, and then they did it again in 2018.This is just the same old thing over and over again guys, there is no difference. The worst thing is that this movie is 100% false advertising. It is two different things, it is a weird teenage dating movie, then becomes a slasher towards the tale end. Don't believe the advertising, Michael Myers is barely in this thing.The Halloween series is like the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the first one is a masterpiece, then everything else is just silly, unnecessary, and lame (Halloween 3 was all right though).If you must watch this, watch it for free using a friends account or whatever. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as always, but they just make her do the same thing and the same old \"I'm a tough S. O. B. And I ain't scared of Michael Myers\" attitude that she has had since the 2018 movie. Her tough woman talk is just kinda old at this point, we get it she has become \"Sarah Connor\" from \"Terminator 2.\"The 2018 movie was a good return, but to be 1000% honest, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends are just straight up cash grabs.

It is a clich\u00e9d mess of a movie in which the appearances of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are down to a bare minimum and the story is so badly patched together that it makes no sense. It continues 4 years after the last film and Michael Myers has disappeared. Laurie Strode and her granddaughter Allyson are living in Haddonfield and Laurie introduces Allyson to Corey, a once promising engineering student who accidentally killed a boy he was babysitting and is now disliked by most of the townspeople who are deeply affected by the massacres that took place in the earlier films (when the plot calls for it that is-at other times they are chilled out). Corey appears to be a meek guy but ends up running into Michael Myers who is now a weak old man and takes Corey on as an apprentice and they kill a few people together. Then Corey takes the mask from Michael and goes on a killing spree. Micheal gets annoyed and comes to get his mask. Laurie kills him and and then then she and some townspeople dismember him in a car breaking yard.Things to ponder:\nWhy is Michael who is an indestructible killing machine now a weakling hiding in a sewer? How did he stop himself from killing or being seen in the 4 years he was in hiding? Why is he as an epitome of evil taking on an apprentice? Why doesn't anyone react when they see the famed Michael Myers mask when in the previous film they formed a huge lynch mob to take him out. How did Laurie Strode go from being a main protagonist and a halloween doomsday pepper to being a woman who bakes pies, knits and is writing a book. And how does she manage to kill Michael when 50 people couldn't in the last film. Why does Alyssa have no problem when Corey tells her he killed someone, and how is he being bullied by teenagers not old enough to buy their own booze. The inconsistencies and plotholes continue on and on making this movie which is 1 hour and 51 minutes long feel never ending and yet the story could have been told in 15 minutes. The acting is OK and the end fight is decent but the rest is downright insulting to fans of Halloween.",

We saw this in multiple Halloweens already. Yawn. Then Corey diaes because.. well he is no Michael myers. He is mortal and weak, feels pain. Micheal Myers has to jump in like a sidekick to Corey and save him from Laurie. OK so let's get this straight. The psycho (Michael Myers) who the entire franchise is based off of, and who Haddonfield is scared of, plays second fiddle to some punk kid the audience has known for an hour... at least make it Allyson or something.

Not that I really an enraged or upset about how they opted to end it, but I am sure that fans out there will not be thrilled.The storyline in \"Halloween Ends\" was too mundane and slow paced for my liking.

But I have to say that I didn't really care much about the characters in the movie, as the narrative was not entertaining to me, and the character gallery was just a bit too mundane.I wasn't impressed with this movie, and I think it is actually one of the worst additions to the \"Halloween\" franchise.My rating of \"Halloween Ends\" lands on a three out of ten stars.",

The divine Ms. Jamie Lee Curtis gives an awesome performance as always but that is about the only redeeming virture of this film. I have so many problems with it. Why did they make. Allyson such a spoiled little brat who was so disrespectful to Laurie when she was only trying to save her? Why was she so stupid to fall for.such an obviously disturbed person as Cory? After what she went through in the two previous films she should have known better! I didn't like how the film focused so much on Cory (Michael doesn't even make an appearance until the first hour!). I couldn't stand that obnoxious little kid he accidentally killed at the beginning or those four bullies and that obnoxious radio shock jock AND his shrew of a mother whom he killed later on. The final fight scene between Laurie and Mike in the kitchen is thrilling you almost expect to see Michael Buffer there saying \"All right Laurie and Mike LETS GET READY TO RUMBLE!\" The only quibble I have SPOILER ALERT Laurie would have to be in her sixties and she puts up an awesome fight and defeats him. Why couldn't Michael's many younger victims fight like that? SPOILER ALERT Lets see Michael gets crucified on the kitchen table with his throat and wrists cut, he then gets taken to a junkyard and his body put through a crushing machine after he has been unmasked and positively identified.

Corey's character is pathetic, his storyline is pathetic and we don't talk about the love story between him and Allyson, but who comes out worse is poor Michael here reduced to a parody of himself and a simple extra.My god, the disappointment of 2022 is the second worst Halloween after 3, I hope that at least after this abomination people start to reevaluate that visionary masterpiece that is Rob's H2, that was a different film, but smart, elegant and fascinating, this it's different, but it's different because it looks like a soap opera with Michael appearing from time to time.

For starters, I liked that they actually did something different. It would have been so easy to just have Michael Myers go on a rampage, kill a bunch of people and surprise surprise is someone alive at the end. I dont know if Michael somehow transferred a part of his soul or if he just sensed the darkness already in, but I was totally on board for exploring the idea of evil never dying because anybody can become it. Im not syhaing the film was perfect. I did roll my eyes a bit at the romance sub plot. But I always find so unbelievable in any genre when someone knows someone for like 3 days and is like \"Ermagerd, you're the love of my life. Lets run away together\". They could have done more to expand that relationship. I also don t get why the town was against Laurie. I mean, to a certain extent I get the town needed a scapegoat. But, I just dont get the sentiment that its her fault because she taunted him and invited him in. Like sure, she was paranoid and built a death trap house. But its not like she was visiting him at the criminal hospital going \"Ha ha sucker, you didnt get me\" or something. Like, he came back and started killing people on his volition. Also, I dont get the criticism of the film being messy. I think it had a very clear idea in mind of where it wanted to go, whereas Halloween Kills seemed a lot more random and trying to cash in nostalgia rather than plot. And I also wanted to add that I really liked that they brought back the whole \" Michael is just a man\" mythos. Whereas again Halloween Kills seemed to ignore that and just went straight into \"No hes a supernatural, unstoppable killer\". And I thought Rohan Campbell was a good addition to the cast.

            "content": "I've had mixed expectations about this movie, and it feels important at the outset to delineate why. John Carpenter's 1978 original is an essential classic, built on strong atmosphere; the first 1981 sequel is blustery, boorish nonsense (which Carpenter himself seems to agree with, and he wrote it). I've long avoided the rest of the franchise assuming standard bland slasher fare, a feeling reinforced by 'Halloween II.' 2018's direct sequel, meanwhile, I personally loved, as it felt like a great amalgamation of Carpenter's atmosphere and grisly slasher violence. However, my hopes for this latest run of pictures was brought low with last year's 'Halloween kills,' as some scenes and story beats were unnecessary, the pace was unfavorably brisk, and it too often sidelined plot and some genuinely great ideas for wanton slasher brutality. So here we are: October 2022, the theoretical (never actual, surely) end of 'Halloween,' and THE promised showdown between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. How does it stack up? Long story short, I like it.It quickly becomes apparent that this feature is not the same 'Halloween' any of its predecessors have been, and it emphatically tries to be something else. To the extent that 'Halloween kills' incorporated some Big Brain ideas in what was ultimately a bit of a mess, it seems to me like this goes further still and works backward from larger notions that are at its core, beyond violence for the sake of violence, to then swing back to that violence after all. I don't know how completely successful the result is, but I deeply admire the effort: a town recovering from trauma, descending into blame and fear; trying (and failing) to reason through the How and Why by blaming the victim instead of the culprit; demonization manifesting a self-fulfilling prophecy; and more. Moreover, to the credit of the writers, the concepts at play here dovetail into substantial dialogue that closed the 2021 film, and cast it in a new and more favorable light.John Carpenter returns as composer alongside recent collaborators Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies, and as with 2018's picture (and less so the 2021 movie), they again turn in a slew of themes that are utterly outstanding. Building off Carpenter's original 1978 music, the score readily creates strong, uneasy atmosphere from start to finish with wide-ranging dynamics - complementing able tension and a measure of atmosphere that the film can claim of its own accord. As 'Halloween ends' goes a slightly different direction it more capably engages viewers as we anxiously wait to see just where it's going to go, and where these characters will end up. It even creates an air of ambiguity about its characters, such that any one might be headed on a dark path and become another bleak mark on Haddonfield's legacy. Rest assured that we still get plenty of gruesome violence, at once even more gnarly than what we saw in the immediate predecessor (almost excessively so), but also less frequent and more calculated (and all the better for it). And: while the climax and especially the ending are unquestionably too On The Nose, I'd be lying if I said they weren't nonetheless very satisfying such as they are.To be honest, this is much better than I expected. 'Kills' dampened my anticipation, but I still hoped 'Ends' might eke out a victory, and I think it succeeds. It's certainly not perfect, though. Clocking in at almost two hours, that length is a double-edged sword. There's a lot of ideas that the feature tries to include, and it maintains a fairly quick gait to be able to do so. There are also, arguably, too many ideas herein, and not all are tackled completely; some might not have even been necessary, which means the length is more than it needed to be. The climax in particular, and the scenes leading up to it, seem like they're smashing together too much all at once, and the result is a tad inelegant. The arc of one specific character - you'll know the one - is obviously integral to the movie as it presents, but comes across like that progress bar on software installation that always hovers at 99% but never hits 100%. Some scenes, especially earlier in the runtime, feel a little too common, while some of the violence is so nasty that it reminds (in a bad way) of tawdry gorefests like 'Hostel.'And it should be said, too, that the confluence of some of the Big Ideas here impress as a perversion of some real-life issues that have been of heated debate in the last several years especially. We, the audience, know that despite the reputation Laurie has acquired over the years in-universe, she isn't wrong, she is a victim, and Michael is a monster. The way these emphatic points are played with in 'Ends' questionably mirrors bad faith arguments in real life about people with repugnant beliefs being held accountable for them, only to double-down, and the victims then being wrongfully taken to task for daring to speak out. In the fictional universe of 'Halloween' this is a grey area; in real life, it's black and white - and the inclusion here just feels Off in a way that's hard to pin down.Yes, 'Halloween ends' is imperfect. But I think it's much stronger than not, especially coming off the sadly middling middle child that was 'Halloween kills.' Of course David Gordon Green's direction is superb, and the screenplay is tight in every individual way. The cast is excellent, Jamie Lee Curtis and Andi Matichak especially, and all the contributions of those behind the scenes are unimpeachable, including the effects artists. All this is well and good; the heart of the matter is the story that is told. It's not all that it could have been, but as far as I'm concerned, this is engrossing, entertaining, and ultimately fulfilling for (ostensibly) bringing the saga to an end. In the days to follow its release opinions will vary, yet for my part I'm quite pleased with 'Halloween ends,' flaws and all, and find it to be a worthy finale.",

This just looks like a new reboot with added elements in the film. They go onto introducing a brand new character that has to do with the main film's plot. They build up a story for him where Corey (New Character) is an accidental murderer in the start of the film, slowly realizing what he is truly capable of when Michael Myers let's him go without a death, then he has been corrupted with evil inside him ever since that moment he has escaped. They even build him up with a relationship with Alison Strode in which the movie felt like a horror romance. The true Michael Myers would only show up in some scenes in the middle of the movie with Corey as an murdering duo to the end. It is entertaining to say the least with the good kill count and a new and old cast of characters. It is an above average movie because this does not feel like a true Halloween movie at all from once we all knew.",

            "content": "Defying all logic, I have a soft spot for the Halloween series. Perhaps because The very first Halloween was the second real horror film I ever saw, and made little kid me afraid of the dark for a good few weeks. It left a lasting impression. I saw them out of order, 4,6,5,7,3,2,8. I can't remember where I put my keys yesterday, but I remember the order in which I watched the Halloween series. While that is indeed ridiculous, part of the reason was that Part 2 was banned in my country and I had to jump through some hoops to watch it. Back then tracking down uncut horror movies was an art in itself.But enough rambling about yesteryear, all I wanted to say is that I very much enjoy the series and wanted to like this. Halloween 2018 started the new series off promisingly. The first hour in particular was tense and gruesome. They managed to establish logical places for the characters to be in, and the two reporters were interesting new characters - until they died and the far less interesting Strode family became the protagonists for the remaining 40 minutes of the film. Therein lies a fundamental flaw of the sequel trilogy. The Strodes are boring. While Jamie Lee Curtis was able to inject some life into crazy lady Laurie in 2018, Karen and Allison are more or less just there without much to do. They just as well could have been one character.In this movie, one again the new character is the most interesting. Corey's story is actually engaging. Yes, the romance was poorly handled, but as a character we feel for him. At least initially, until the stupid stuff with Michael Myers happens.The first 30 minutes of Halloween Ends offers more character development than Halloween Kills in its entire run time.Where this Ends falls into the same trap though, is pretentiousness masquerading as substance. Since Kills, they are pretending that their slasher movies are some profound musings on the nature of evil or the trauma, when really they didn't.In Ends, yet again, they try to add subtext and philosophy into a story that starts off as a character drama. The ending in particular is one of the worst instances of pretentious film school style pseudo-intellectualism I have ever seen. I kept thinking of Neil Breen - if you know who that is, you know what means. If not, look him up.The filmmakers tried to be clever and adding some allegory about trauma spreading from person to person (not how trauma works) before leading into a pretentious setup for yet another sequel. \"Evil doesn't die, it just changes shape.\" Someone in the movie theatre called out \"Life finds a way\" and everone laughed. This was certainly not the filmmakers desired reaction for their profound horror soliloquy.Halloween Ends contorts its narrative logic until it collapses under its own pretentions. The original movie worked, because it was a master class in film making. Starting with wide shots, giving us a feeling of the town more so than any exposition dump in the new movies. The presence of the killer always felt, rarely seen, paranoia slowly creeping up as night fell, with the camera angles getting closer, the scenery more claustrophibic and frightening and the darkness eventually encompassing everything.The new ones are way too convoluted from a narrative and thematic standpoint for their own good.There are a few things to like here. As said, the first half hour is strong, mostly carried by Rohan Campbell's acting. He carries the film. A very promising actor.The use of music is very good and the remixed versions of the original still add tension and class.They got the look of the mask right, there are a few adequately bloody kills and the color grading and cinematography are good.I didn't mind the fact that they moves away fromt he formula or that Michael's role was so reduced. He's been overused more than Darth Vader at this point. Halloween was on the right track with Halloween 3 Season of the Witch. They should have continued with that kind of anthology concept of a Halloween themed horror film every few years. Here's hoping the next inevitable reboot will do just that.",

            "review_title": "Halloween Ends (2022, David Gordon Green) And so Halloween Ends.... thankfully because this last installment was awful",
            "content": "Along comes 'Halloween Ends' which is the thirteenth overall 'Halloween' film and the final entry in this latest trilogy which purports to be the legit end of the series, and given the finale it very well could be. The same creative team from the previous two films are in place with David Gordon Green behind the camera as well as co-writing along with Danny McBride and others. Jamie Lee Curtis dons the mantle of Laurie Strode one last time to do battle with her mysteriously mute and homicidal brother. 'Halloween Ends' is the lowest grossing of the new trilogy at the box office.At the end of 'Halloween Kills' Michael manages to kill Laurie Strode's daughter after foiling the town's attempt to slay him vigilante style. After that he apparently just vanished into the ether, and now the town exists with an odd pall cast over everything as no one truly knows what became of the boogeyman. The populace, for lack of anything better to do, blames Laurie for unleashing Michael on them like she antagonized him into his actions somehow. She has turned over a new leaf and is not the doomsday prepper type from the previous films and instead is writing a book and seems to have found some sort of inner peace. The film starts with tragedy as two years previous a boy named Corey Cunningham was babysitting a young boy who tragically and quite graphically dies on Halloween night. Flash forward to now and Corey is a shunned pariah who manages to find friendship with Laurie's granddaughter and later it blossoms into romance. There is trouble in paradise as Corey starts acting oddly and eventually stumbles across the M. I. A. Michael Myers and from there the story gets darker in a somewhat unexpected way before finally rolling around to an inevitable confrontation between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers which is one of the parts of the movie that works quite well. There seems to be a definitive close on the series, but with franchises like this who knows for sure.So I pretty much detested the first two entries in this series, but I believe it peaked with the first one and each one is getting progressively worse. This film actually commits the worst sin that movies like this can. It is a Halloween film that for most of its run time isn't really a Halloween film as the focus is taken away from Michael Myers and role of antagonist slides to another. It is somewhat in the same lane as 'Friday the 13th part V' where that series essentially takes away Jason although there you don't realize it until the end in a twist bait and switch tactic. Here you see the shift occurring before your very eyes. Basically I hate the Corey Cunningham character and everything that occurs with him which is the majority of the movie, and then his finding and interaction with Michael is bizarre and nonsensical. The whole thing is just a horrible idea that may have sounded interesting in a brainstorming session, but is an absolutely ridiculous way for the final chapter of this story to play out. I will say that the last bit of the film, when Corey is finally off the board, the story becomes more what the film should have been the entire time, but it is far from enough to redeem this complete and utter misfire. I am not sure what they were thinking when they conjured this thing up, but all I can say is I am truly glad they are done driving this classic slasher series into the ground.Eric's Grade: D-",

It's nice to see a Halloween movie that isn't just a set up for most of the characters to be murdered - while there is still some of that here it's not the focus.While the story is compelling and the acting excellent, the direction feels...off. It's like an inexperienced film student has put it together, such is the random execution of the scenes and story, and some of the characters actions just don't ring true as a result.When the ending comes around it's done well and is very visceral, but it feels somewhat of an anticlimax after the journey we've gone through in this movie alone, to say nothing about all the movies that came before it.While this is easily the best of this new trilogy, it's a shame it couldn't have been executed better, but it is a somewhat satisfying end to this chapter in the Halloween saga.",

I don't know but this was a horrible acting job by her. In fact by everyone but since she has such a long \"career\" she should be better. Also, Curtis has had a rough life. I saw her and thought wow how old is she? I find out that she is 6 years older than me. She makes me look like I am in my 30s with how wrinkled and old looking she is.Now for the movie, at first I was thinking this was \"Fight Club\" meets horror movie. Everything right up until the last 20 minutes you could say was Corey thinking he was Michael Meyers. I was praying that was not going to be the ending but it was certainly lining up that way. In fact, I could see them spinning another sequel as Laurie having a breakdown and imagining all of it and she was the killer after she offed Corey.This movie had not one person that was likable. Laurie and her granddaughter were both bonkers and the granddaughter had a spoiled craziness. Corey's mother was a nutjob, the teens we see are destined for a life of crime. How this script got the greenlight I will never understand. Laurie should have died 2 sequels ago. But I guess grl power...Michael have been shot dozens of times, stabbed dozens of times, blown up, caught on fire, almost beheaded and yet he keeps coming back. This means he has some supernatural aspect like Jason, which means unkillable. We see Michael being so string he can one arm dead lift someone straight in the air and drive a knife through them so hard they are pinned to the wall. Yet when Michael and Laurie are fighting and he tries to push her hand down the running disposal she is able to overpower him and get her hand away.This was a horrible Michael Meyers movie. The movie is 111 minutes and we maybe see Michael 21 of those minutes. This is like the Godzilla movies where you only know it is a Godzilla movie because of the title due to seeing the main character so little. The movie should be called Halloween Ruined. Even the second Halloween was better than this. I know it had nothing to do with Michael Meyers but it was still a better movie than this crap. The only reason it didn't lose millions was because no one was expecting a crapfest this bad. I bet everyone wishes they could go back in time and warn everyone off before they watched it. This was a horrible sendoff to a long running series. And as I said before...Laurie should have been bumped off 2 movies ago.",

In their defense, the climax was overwhelmingly anticlimactic.You're lucky, Rob Zombie...you still get to claim the dead-last place in the Halloween franchise, but just barely. This would've received the rare 1/10 stars if not for that fantastic cold open. Literally, those first 10 minutes before the terrible opening credits, really had my hopes up. Plus, the newly introduced main character was enormously cute. But, while a bonus, it's incidental to the quality of this flick.It's so incredibly hard to describe the \"plot\" without major spoilers. Suffice to say, the main idea is two screwed up young adults with absolutely zero chemistry fall more and more \"in love\" with each other and one of them may be becoming a monster like the legend of Michael Myers.I'll give the movie some credit. It was thee most different Halloween sequel since Season of the Witch. Coincidentally, this is a semi-part III in itself since it's the final part of the requel trilogy beginning with Halloween (2018) and followed by Halloween Kills (2021.) They REALLY decided to make a different movie and yet still contain many familiar cameos/stills/flashbacks/monologues and Laurie Strode with her Granddaughter at the center of things.And by \"things\" I mean all the subplots only mildly explored. This movie felt like six ideas from six different people and no one wanted to coexist or edit themselves out. Sadly, even examined on their own and separate from the \"main plot,\" they not only fizzle out before being fully explored, they're just not believable. Sure, people are saying the right words and actions are happening, but they all feel very fake, staged and if given to the right hands, they could've really elevated this film.Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Halloween (2018) was not just an incredible Halloween chapter and fairly close to matching the Original 1978 masterpiece, it was also an overall great horror movie. I need to ask for forgiveness from the follow-up Halloween Kills. I nitpicked my way into almost hating that movie. It is a near-perfect movie compared to this mess.So many characters are established and they all constantly go against character. It's almost as if every several minutes, the actors believe they're auditioning for another role. Michael Myers, himself, seems bored, disinterested and worn out. Worse, no one feels like they wanna be there. Heck, by the time this weird movie FINALLY gets Halloweening, I didn't want to be there in the theatre. I envy that couple who blatantly walked out.Again, I don't wish to spoil it for anyone who wants to go see this movie. Just know, this movie is wildly different than anything you'd expect, or want in a Halloween movie...DESPITE the forced nostalgia and obligatory trigger phrases or dumb props to remind you of better Halloween movies. And YES, this is way worse than both Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween: Resurrection.Sorry, H2 of 2009, you're still the bottom of the barrel. Heck, even your opening, which was also the best part of your movie, wasn't as good as this one.SKIP THIS!!! Don't even bother. True fans can stay away, as well.***Final Thoughts: I really had higher hopes, but here's how it fell in my ranking of the franchise:1. Halloween (1978)2. Halloween (2018)3. Halloween II (1981)4. Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later (1998)5. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)6. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)7. Halloween Kills (2021)8. Halloween (2007)9.

No one stood out in this movie. They were very easy to forget and dislike. Whoever wrote this film needs to stay out of the film industry. Let this be the last film you ever write.The plot continuing from 2021's Halloween Kills was completely abandoned and replaced with Bonnie & Clyde meets \"How to be Michael Myers for Dummies\". A great portion of the film was about an entirely new character taking lessons (YES LESSONS) on how to kill from Michael Myers. On the Job training for the position of Michael Myers would be the perfect way to describe this. Rather than build this character to maybe establish future films around him they went the easy route and made him the typical misunderstood kid who gets bullied & has family issues. One day he gets tired of the treatment and he snaps and Boom now we have Michael Myers in training. I say in training because there are scenes where they are TAG TEAMING in kills. WHY.They tried to force a love story with this film as well and I was highly annoyed with it. Everything felt forced and it seemed like it was moreso trying to romanticize the situation of people dying instead of focusing on the task of making sure Michael Myers is dead.The ending was very lackluster. Fake Mike tries to do real Mike's job and failed. You know the rest. Real Mike comes in..They fight and he loses.If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. Save your time.

David Gordon green and Danny McBride and the other writers absolutely drag the Halloween legacy through the mud. I was not a fan of Rob zombie's Halloween's but they're basically masterpieces compared to this piece of excrement. And yes it sounds like I'm overreacting but I'm not.The first five minutes this film let you know that it's nowhere near the feel of some of the other films. First of all you get an opening that contains about 2 minutes of rock and roll. Compare this to the opening of the original Halloween the follow-up and even Halloween 4 and it'll just make you that much more angry.Michael Myers is reduced to a cameo and then an afterthought and then he shows up for the final 10 minutes. They actually make someone else in the film do most of his dirty work. Allison, Laurie's granddaughter, is probably the only reason why I didn't leave the film after the first 30 minutes. She was terrific and easy on the eyes and that is all I can say for the movie in terms of its good qualities.The finale of the film is just a fist fight between strode and Meyers and by that time I was so angry, so uninvested in the film that I couldn't care less. I was actually hoping that everybody died just so they really couldn't make another Halloween film, at least not one done by this crew.Halloween is my favorite horror movie of all time. I love the follow-up to it and I loved part 4. This is a complete dichotomy of the films I just mentioned. It's horribly written, not very well directed and they basically kill any of the good stuff that they tried to emulate from the other films.I don't know how John Carpenter or Jamie Lee Curtis or Malek Akkad or Jason Blum could have read the script, approved it, saw the dailies, approve them and then watched the final cut of the movie and thought to themselves, yes this is awesome.This is without a doubt the worst Halloween film out of all of them.

There is also very little Laurie which again the same issue all her scenes are really good but this movie was centred around Alyson and Corey.Why dear god why does nobody listen to Laurie, she has proven to be right time and time again yet whenever she thinks something bad people shrug it off and say she is paranoid or obsessing with Michael, even if she was in this movie it shows how she is moving on !! Also why is everyone blaming her for the other movie and the killings ??? If anyone it's the guy with the baseball bat that started riots !!The \"love\" story was very forced and silly, is Alyson absolutely clueless and can't spot a red flag 10 miles away !!What I did like, all the killings were very good, the last 20-30 minutes very good, every Michael and Laurie scene were 10/10.Michael was doing something in this movie that I can't say without spoiling it but when you see it you'll know exactly what I mean and I really liked it!!The Corey plot was to fast and made the movie feel a little disconnected but I'm saying that I liked where it ended up.I have just come out of the movies so I still need to digest it, right now I'm standing at a 6, with a little more time and characters developed in previous movies, and not the ultimate end to Halloween it would have been much better.",

Do they saw the movie in 1978? Yes they saw it: a lot of flashback show that they knew the movie so what happened? Why introduced a new character that dont avoid the clich\u00e9 and really the worst part is that he completely illogical ( how can someone can believe about his transformations to the evil side or whatever?) Michael is another time not seen not for a long time in the whole movie (what a shame! The movie its his conclusion right?).In the first hours of the movie i didnt knew what movie i had paid for: a romance movie? A drama movie? Damn i didnt knew. What about Michael? What they introduced that new character? The Corey's tragedy and stuff. Why? I had the feeling during the whole movie that the directors wanted just to get rid off the franchise and to end it. What is that end? How Michael can be caught so easily like this? The whole movie dont have any sense for me at all. The most gory scene was when Michael killed the guy in the radio house. Thats really meaningless. I mean why they used so many times to elaborate a story? Thats not the principle to a slasher to make gory scenes, build tensions, have a main character to focus on? To make some places to let the set design give that chills and goosebumps? I mean the only thing that i liked is the soundtrack but thats really all for me. I loved the two first movies but after that its just the exploitation of a name and a franchise to make money and really destroy the saga in my opinion. Just look the two first movies and watch this after you will completely understand what i am talking about. The movie dont feel a slasher at all. Michael seem really not going after Laurie the whole movie; its just when Corey get in the tunnel that he will activate something in him. Stupid right? And i still didnt understand how Laurie found that Corey was supposely to be the \"evil\" (\"by looking from his eyes\" she said) how am i supposed to believe this; there is no credibility at all.The end really make me sad: how they can rushed a movie like this? It really felt dumb: why to put Michael as an exhibition to everyone at Haddonfield? When they killed Michael with that big machine, they really destroyed everything: this movie included. I felt also the vibe of Halloween Kills: i mean bad decisions, characters completely dumb, lack of Michael Myers appearances (i thought it was the movie about Corey because we see him more than michael and thats become a problem. Its Michael franchise not Corey).They needed to use the old slasher movie vibe and really dont put a complex story in that kind of movie: its meaningless (we know why we are here) a complete disrespect to Halloween Franchise and to the character of Michael Myers. The scary part dont work at all and the Jumpscares was really cheap. Pretty disappointed overall and this movie bring nothin new except the dead of Michael Myers but for me that part was a scandal from lazy writers and people who just wanted to sell something and not being respectful of the spirit of the movie and the genre. The movie didnt feel like an Halloween movie at all. Just the intro credits and the soundtrack theme remember us what we are watching but thats all. And i want to clarify also that yes the halloween Franchise is not known for his story to be complex,engaging and stuff but please the movie didnt feel like a slasher at all and Corey was clearly not necessary and bring just non sense with him and Michael. Even the violence is too light for that kind of movie. Michael dont give any tension and feel weak from the beginning and the fight against laurie.Im just happy that they put an end to the franchise because they did really bad since a long time and maybe thats a good thing to put an end to this because they clearly dont know what to tell and what to make: i really felt that i watched an other movie and not an halloween. The whole trilogy of the movie are non sense and they didnt have any direction to go into and felt empty and illogical from the beginning to the end. Just have the name and the sound of Halloween thats all. Pretty sad that the franchise end like this.We need to talk also about Laurie and that is pretty useless: she becomes a writer and we just heard what she wrotes about Michael and we feel that Michael was here only trough their words and the radio but physically was missing. Feel pretty wrong. The tension cant come trough words: we need actions and tension but instead we have a dumb Laurie who prefer to talk about Michael instead of faced him. Yes she faced him at the end but we felt that was no credibility at all: how she become so strong? Why Michael felt so weak in this movie? I cant really find any sense about that movie. So many bad choices(romance genre, Corey character, the fate of Michael, the decisions of the characters, the strangeness of the writing, the strangeness to not being able to recognize Michael.)and it will completely make disappointed the hardest fans of Michael and Halloween movies for sure. We were focus to much on unecessary things and forget Michael.Im glad that the franchise end and that will make them stop destroying that franchise years after years and thats a good thing. I dont really know what i saw in the theatre really. Just an other horror movie with some romance, comedy, love, violence but i clearly couldnt find any similarities with the slasher genre. That movie is known to be a slasher. So why a mixed so many genre for nothing? Why they needed to make such a confusing, illogical story? Try to be more simpler than that and just create a mood, an ambience is more important in that kind of movie than a complex story with no direction at all and stop to hide Michael and bring him from the beginning until the end.

Through a bizarre series of events he comes into contact with Michael Myers (who killed his own sister 44 years ago), Then went after his OTHER sister, Laurie.So Corey, in the present day, has made his own personal legacy on Haddonfield after he ACCIDENTALLY kills someone, Michael Myers has made his legacy in Haddonfield after INTENTIONALLY going on a killing spree. So these two killers come into contact with each other but Michael seemingly \"Likes\" Corey enough to let him live and inject his own killing personality into Corey while also giving him the black cold eyes that Laurie Strode seemingly picks up on. She looks into Corey's eyes and almost automatically sees Michaels eyes...It goes a step further to have Corey and Lauries granddaughter introduced to each other and strike up a romance with each other.Laurie doesn't realised she's romantiacally paired her granddaughter with the living soul of her brother who has wanted to kill her for close to half a century... I just can't believe the writers of this can honestly expect the audience to believe this mess.....And why have Michael Myers reduced to a pathetic no hoper living in a sewer? He's a badass killer who will stop at nothing normally but in this movie he's portrayed as some kind of of homeless guy living in a sewer???I just can't get my head around how badly these film makers have ruined the Michael Myers legacy.... horrible movie and will be forgotten about very quickly... I sincerely hope they just stop making these dreadful sequels, there's no need for them, no one wants them and no one needs them.",

For a moment I thought, wait, could this guy be the new serial killer? Is he gonna takeover the franchise? And the grand daughter. I was thinking someone who's educated as her would be so dumb as to falling for a loose cannon like Mike wannabee.I liked part 1 and 2 of the trilogy. Mike on a rampage and I was expecting at least double the body count on his last hurrah. But he took a huge backseat.....at the back of the bus.",

He's dead.The beginning of the movie, to me; was clunky & almost irrelevant. I understand Corey's evil intentions were transferred to him by Michael & his environment; ie his psycho mom & being bullied as he was; (the old nature vs nurture debate reared it's head once again). I also understand that Michael is human. I also understand that the human condition is fragile, yet bonded by its environment like Corey's or like Michael's.This movie & its series has always been about a person's milieu & about how it can change a person into a monster or prevent them from becoming one.This movie & its series has also always been about containment. Let me explain. The containment of Michael's soul & of evil itself came into question this entire movie. Does he transfer the evil to Corey, does Corey transfer it to the bum in the park? Etc etc. That containment aspect holds deep, so deep that Loomis can feel it in the afterlife. It's the containment of oneself and the preservation of one's own being that surrounds the Haddonfieldien air of this movie. Laurie's struggle to contain her thoughts by writing them out on her memoirs, Corey's struggle to contain his emotions when he accidentally kills the child he's babysitting, Allyson's struggle to fit in after her parents died & grandma went psychotic etc etc.Overall, slow, clunky & could've been cut down to an hour or 30 min movie. 4/10. Would've been 7 or 8 if I hadn't been totally convinced that Corey was going to be the shape for the entire movie after Michael tried to strangle him. That would've wholly ruined the experience.I love Jaimie Lee Curtis in everything she ever does. That helps.",

It opens with undoubtably the best pumpkin title sequence, and a thudding mix of Carpenter's theme.The attraction of the final three movies to me is Jamie Lee Curtis. And although I feel she's stretching it a little to claim in interviews this film is all about relatable trauma (it's still a modern horror with modern annoyances), there are elements of this and the roundup is somewhat satisfying. Not because it is classical Halloween as hoped, but because as producer and overseer she may have delivered the ultimate f-you to the anti-hero worshiping fanboys of this franchise. In a fashion: trauma dealt with.Of the 1978 original, Richard Combs said it was \"one of the cinema's most perfectly engineered devices for saying 'Boo!'\". That's spot on, and nothing beyond the original really matches. The moment Myers steps beyong those first 91 minutes, with any attempted explaination, motivation or widening, the illusion evaporates. Today the suspense and atmosphere is replaced with an apparent need for seeing people stabbed many, many, many times. Weirdly this might be more to meet the limited appetites of an attention deprived modern audience, rather than anything to do with the original.There was no blood shown in 1978, and the ghost story worked well in the first telling.",

The ending should be too great but it was a biggest mistake for whole halloween parts. The Vibe and that intense back ground music was missing in entire movie and was focussed on developing new lame characters instead of the main one which they showcased like a joke. The farewell of Myers should be great but it turned out to be the wastage of time. And the ending was literally the biggest disaster.

Co-writer/director David Gordon Green and co-writer Danny McBride have made a movie that's worse than Halloween Kills(2021), which I didn't think was possible. After the high of Halloween(2018), it has just gone downhill from there. No one is interested in a deep character study with an unnecessary romance, in a movie from the Halloween franchise. Yet again, Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie is sidelined & the spotlight is on Andi Matichak's Allyson & a pointless supporting character called Corey(Rohan Campbell). The trailers & poster for the film are very misleading. There are barely any thrills & creepy elements that the Halloween franchise is known for. The background score by John Carpenter & Cody Carpenter is the highlight of the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is spectacular as Laurie. I just wish Curtis was given more screentime instead of being criminally underutilized. Andi Matichak is good as Allyson. James Jude Courtney is effective as The Shape. Rohan Campbell is great as Corey. The supporting cast is impressive. Halloween Ends has effectively ended this franchise by being so lackluster. Fans of this franchise, be warned.

The plot was pretty much obvious from start but it doesn't make any sense. I thought it was going to be an \"epic finale\" to end the whole thing but rather than giving viewers that they just went like \"you know what, I am bored let's write a completely different kind of a movie\".It's like they forgot the first movie completely. Even if it was terrible, it still felt like it was trying to build the finale I am sure people thought they would evetually be seeing. Jokes on you! We never get to see one.This movie is not about Halloween at all, but rather some poor attempt to ride the legend and relive some of the classic 80's horror movies. I mean I can definitely see there are subtle and nonsubtle! References to Lost Boys (the \"love story\" and effin endeless motorcycle driving with the jumping from roofs and dancing 0_0), Texas Chainshaw Massacre 2 ( the 80's style radiostation) and IT (Myers lives in a sewer now :0). I don't know if this was the directors attempt to give something nostalgic to the viewers or was he really attempting to ride on those good movies in the hopes to add something good to this as well. I have no idea, but it does more harm then good.Only staple thing about this piece is that it's rotten, nothing makes sense, the poor plot, boring scenes, events unevenness of the characters and their motives. The scenes aren't bound together in anyway. It's just scene after a scene like in some poor edited music video. The dialogue is terrible and the relationships and events aren't logical, real feeling and the whole movie just fails to connect with the viewers in every way possible. It's always a super bad sign if the movie can't encage and intreract even in a lower level with the audience. The relevanse of what is shown and what isn't doesn't make sense. Nothing makes sense.Even though I knew they couldn't do a good film after watching Halloween Kills and being bored out of my mind, I feel like they could have had at least had fun with this. But they didn't even do that. They spent forever with unneccesary yapping scenes with the reality star turned in to actress and minium with the stuff that actually matters! There is more yapping in the movie than Myers or anything interesting at all. Of yeah, and the endless motorcycle driving! Like why the heck do we need to see several scenes of that bullcrap? At least they could have given us some scenes with suspension and horror or at least goofy stupid death scenes to laught at but nah not even that. Just some tired quick ass kills with nothing fun. It's like blowing air into a broken balloon that get's limb every other second. Oh yeah except that one freaking weird scene with the tongue cutting. The hell was that about?0_0I think the 2018 Halloween was the real ending and then they got greedy and threw up these because they felt they had a good thing going. Because you know $$$. Sad thing. The is really no real attempt to make quality movies anymore, if there is quick bucks to gain.So if you want to see the Halloween end, just watch again Halloween 2018 what is the real ending, I am sure that was ment to be. The others are just for you to lose your money, time and sanity. Or better yet watch The original Halloween 2.I would like to say something positive about this in the end but I really don't have anything good to say about this film. Nothing. Nada. Zero.You have to wonder why in earth did they brought these writers and director together to make this junk? Just looking at what kind of movies they have previously made makes you have a question or few. Maybe because Halloween Kills was a flop they felt it's ok to throw the whole thing to the pooper for good so nobody ever want's to touch it again. Since they couldn't do it, they made sure that nobody can. It feels like very unfair thing to do, since this is Carpenter's creation and not Green's. I hear people have been demanding for a new movie to replace this one. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT MAKE ONE! Let's just forget these two ever happened and let the real horror movie writers and directors do their job for now on.",

            "content": "Sometimes you can out-smart yourself. Here, they are attempting to re-boot the series in a way where you can finally release Michael Myers into the void and be done with him. He is a money maker. As you can see the reviews here have said, you can't have Halloween movies without Myers. In this case, they are going to have a VERY hard time trying to figure out how to bring him back. Here's the issue, they listen to long time staple Jamie Lee Curtis. If you've done enough research she repeatedly states that she wanted Myers to be killed. And be sure he is dead. Well, here you go. However, I'm almost certain people are more sick of Laurie Strode than they are of Myers. See, first Michael is her brother, then it's some totally random neighbor. Then they have to try to give a physical manifestation of evil. You see the spiral they fell into.The problem with people like Curtis, is that she is attempting to intellectualize something that functions more visceral. Here's a simple solution...kill off Laurie Strode. NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE would be having this level of disappointment if Michael did away with her maudlin, tired old hag lady. In fact, I think Curtis would agree. It wasn't until she discovered Mustapha Akaad's marching order...you CANNOT kill Michael, is when she checked out. The rest is comical fan fiction. Then they make the second biggest mistake. Trying to get the blessing of old grouchy codger John Carpenter. I am a huge Carpenter fan. His storytelling abilities are remarkable. Great when he is more playful. Like \"Big Trouble Little China\" or \"They Live\" This is when he is most fun. Why oh why would you want the blessings of a man who also made \"Vampyres\" or \"Body Bags\" He has slid his life into being a joyless mercenary. Look at him in this flick relegating himself to making music. He's a real cuckold to remakes of his films. A sad slide into the autumn years of his life is to tell the public what he believes is good and what is bad. He, above anyone else, understands...no one cares.So where does that leave us? Talentless dummy David Gordon Green. A fanboy who knows NOTHING of the spirit of these films. They are aren't meant to be philosophical theories of evil. Seriously spent two flicks trying to define it. Then never getting to a clear point. Why so secular with something that Carpenter himself would've included a church scene. This was a odd lazy scripting. Four years is not long enough to just let things go. Especially if a determined killer is after you. And you have knowledge of this. You don't just shake that off. It isn't that you have to live your life without fear. There is a middle ground between drunken survivalist and Stephen King. It certainly isn't opening your door to a (clearly) emotionally broken teen and pushing her to your granddaughter. The stupidity is beyond words. That's a way for audiences to cheer for Strode to be mercilessly murdered. Great job.The other thing is, just because 2018 \"Halloween\" was successful meant you made a good movie. Read my review of that first one. It's hot garbage. And I could see the idiot behind this. They abandoned all attachments to what made 70's version interesting. While true they shouldn't be hammering the same note, there is a legacy you have to live to (NOT fan service, by the way).So the problem is...what made Halloween so special? Hard to say. Doubt anyone could articulate it. Perhaps it's the same reason why Michael is a killing machine. Should we try to figure out why it was so part of the 70's zeitgeist. Hard to say. Boomer flicks tend to have a deeper meaning. If your point of a unrepentant killer is that they have no redeemable quality, you will go no where.So here we are.",

This was supposed to be Michael and Laurie's final showdown and seeing as how Michael is a horror icon, his ending should've been epic and it wasn't.Michael seemed weak, geriatric and to me, this film feels more like the birth of a new icon. The birth of Corey. It was like Michael sensed an evil under Corey's surface and rather than kill him, he infected him and brought that evil to maturity.I thought the plot was initially shaping up to be a showdown between two boogie men. It sorta felt like Corey could've been developing his evil but when it came time to for Michael to show up and attempt to take out Laurie and Allison, he would've helped destroy Michael to protect Allison. But, alas, this is not what happened.Here are a few things bothered me.Why had Michael not made more attempts on Laurie's life if he was free and living in the sewer for four years? The homeless man implied that Michael had been in the same spot for those years and all the people who went in the sewer had failed to come out and was shocked when Corey emerged.Why was Corey able to so easily subdue Michael and steal his mask? It was almost sad to see that Michael was being manhandled.Did Corey gain Michael's supernatural strength and ability to regenerate? It seemed he gained strength because he squished the girl trapped under the truck with a single stomp. He was also able to jump up and attempt to keep Michael's mask after having stabbed himself in the neck. Does that mean that he could survive Michael's attempt to break his neck? Is that why they left Michael's mask behind rather than get rid of it?Why couldn't there had finally been an explanation as to why Michael was impervious to harm and driven to kill Laurie? After all these years, a little explanation would have brought his story full circle.Why weren't the Haddonfield residents dressed in costumes on Halloween night? The procession to the grinder was a missed opportunity to return to that classic Halloween night feel and they really should've had the people of Haddonfield dressed in costumes to play that moment up to its full potential and made it a true homage to Michael's legacy.The film wasn't total garbage and could've been fine as a stand alone spinoff of the Halloween franchise but it just didn't feel like Michael's Halloween and it didn't send him off with the epic last stand his legendary status deserved and should've had. It wouldn't surprise me if we were to see a Halloween Reborn film that brings us a potentially new slasher icon to fill Michael's shoes.",

Many would argue she was the main protagonist throughout this franchise & it may not sit well with this change of direction for the die hard fans.It is strange direction to which they took this film. Corey's tragic backstory is flushed out well and the resulting hatred towards him from most people in the town plays well in his character development.Michael's introduction is also peculiar and how they meet does beggars belief & very starry eyes... I could say more but that would ruin the twist for potential viewers...On the plus side, the kills were gory but not ott as previous incarnation.Allyson makes very unusual decisions as though she was a repressed teenager that seeks and sought out the \"bad boyfriend phrase\" in Corey.

I understood this one was going to be very different. Almost like 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch (which I love, by the way.) I tried watching it with an open mind.The first time I watched it, I was a little iffy on a few things. I felt that Michael was portrayed as being too weak, but you gotta understand he's been shot, stabbed, and 65 years old in this timeline. He's getting some age on him, so I'll let it slide for now. I was very happy and satisfied with how it all ended.I was intrigued by Rohan Campbell's character, Corey Cunningham, which is a nod and tribute to Arnie Cunningham from John Carpenter's Christine film by Stephen King. Corey is basically the main character of the movie. We follow his journey from seemingly innocent babysitter, to trying to become the next 'shape of evil' He's an interesting case study if you enjoy films like Taxi Driver, Joker, or Pearl.Jamie Lee Curtis is great as always as Laurie Strode, the OG final girl. Laurie is definitely in a happier place in time at the start of Ends. She has gotten therapy and writing a memoir about her dealings with Michael Myers, but people in Haddonfield still place the blame on her.The film starts in 2019, one year after the events of Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills. We meet Corey Cunningham, who is babysitting a boy named Jeremy. During the night, something tragic happens, and all the blame is placed on Corey.Three years later, Corey is still dealing with the trauma of what happened and the town of Haddonfield is still trying to heal from Michael's last rampage. Corey is taunted by bullies, and soon meets Laurie Strode. Knowing that they have shared trauma, she introduces him to her granddaughter, Allyson.At its core, most of the movie becomes a weird psychotic love story with Corey and Allyson. They are fed up with how the townspeople have treated them and wanna 'burn it all down' They almost become like Bonnie & Clyde, or Joker and Harley Quinn.When Corey is thrown over a rail by his bullies, he ends up in a sewer and has a face to face confrontation with Michael Myers, who has been living in the sewers the past four years, and slowly losing strength. This is where some Halloween fans may not like what happens because Michael and Corey almost help each other, give each other strength, and sorta kinda become partners.I'll try not to say too much else, but if you can get behind the fact that Michael is older and weakened and Corey wants to become like him, then you might enjoy it. Just turn your brain off and don't overanalyze it.Like I said earlier, I was happy and very satisfied with how it all ends. I also love that the font during the opening credits are the same as Halloween III, so it's saying right off the bat that it's trying to be different and stand on its own, which I respect. I'm sure we'll get more Halloween films down the road, but right now, this was the perfect way to end the series. Congratulations to everyone involved. I would highly recommend HALLOWEEN ENDS!!!",

Just lame installments in a series that starts good and sort of goes nowhere and fizzles out. Halloween 4 is this super great film, followed by two awful sequels Halloween 5 & 6. Halloween 2.0 had the dreadful sequel. The second Rob Zombie Halloween movie was super bad.This is the same with Halloween ends...which somehow is worse than Halloween Kills by several miles. I was stoked at the first Halloween movie that returned to Laurie and was said to take place after just the first movie and disconnected from all the rest. That film was well made and effective.The sequel wasn't as good but at least it sort of continued the story. This film jumps a year or so ahead and really makes no sense whatsoever. There is some kid who killed a child on Halloween and the town is mean to him so becomes Michael Meyers, and also hangs out with Michael Meyers, and somehow wins a fight against Michael and takes his mask?It's just weird and stupid and boring. The final battle between Meyers and Laurie is underwhelming. I wish this film had continued the long Halloween of the first two. But...no such luck. See you again one day, Meyers.",

            "content": "The original Halloween practically invented the trope of the killer rising from his apparent death for one last surprise attack. In that same way, Halloween Ends as a whole feels like one heck of a narrative curveball right before the curtain closes on the franchise as we've known it up to this point. Director David Gordon Green made an early choice to focus down his Halloween trilogy on the essentials of what made John Carpenter's classic work, especially on how Michael Myers' violence represented evil as an elemental force. Halloween Ends furthers Green's exploration of whether evil and its effects can truly be overcome in ways that are intriguing in their larger implications, but sometimes at odds with its more grounded goal of bringing Laurie Strode's story to a satisfying close. Ends focuses on how trauma can mutate and form destructive cycles - something the opening credits image of a reincarnating pumpkin announces early on. Halloween Ends' interrogation of that idea rests largely on the shoulders of new character Cory Cunningham (Rohan Campbell), whose strong introduction sets the stage for a study in how Michael Myers' legacy has affected Haddonfield's hopes for the future. A young man with great college prospects, Cory shares a lot in common with Laurie Strode at that age, and Green uses details like him choosing chocolate milk over beer while he's babysitting to raise interesting questions about his moral compass. Halloween Ends concludes the Myers/Strode rematch trilogy with an ambitious, if somewhat confused, final chapter. Despite dialed-in performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and franchise newcomer Rohan Campbell, David Gordon Green's larger exploration of evil and trauma expands on the conversation he started in Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills at a rate that Ends doesn't quite have time to keep up with. There are some memorable kills and reverence for the franchise at large, but it stumbles as it brings it to a close.",

II mean, did this dude really have a Wrestlemania battle with MM? Was MM just casually hanging out that whole time underground and in pipes like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle? Did Allyson really fall head over heels in like 24 hours to where she was ready to risk it all for the town outcast/\"child murderer?\" I know he didn't do it, but come'on! SHE didn't know that! They made her character dumb as hell. Just about everything about Halloween Ends was DAH. Zero suspense. Zero build up. Everyone was just going through the motions. Even MM looked like he was completely over it and just doing it because there was nothing better to do at the time.I don't know if I believe that this is the final movie. Just the same as MM springs up and gets a 2nd wind every time he fools you into thinking he's dead, I feel like they will do that to us again a few years down the line.

            "content": "...what did I just watch? Halloween (2018) was a very solid addition to Halloween canon. Halloween Kills, though flawed, was an average to good addition. But, as in past iterations of this franchise, each subsequent film was worse than its predecessor. To say that I have never been more disappointed in a movie, is an understatement. We get virtually zero Michael Myers here. The focus of the film is on this new character of Corey. Why do we spend the entire film following Corey when he just becomes another casualty at the end. I thought perhaps they were setting him up to 'take over' for Michael. Corey is an incredibly uninteresting character from the beginning. We are not rooting for him, we are not connected to him, we have no feeling toward Corey whatsoever. Yet he is our main character. Allison is completely lost in this film. I understand both her parents are dead, and she is a shell of her former self. But there is no growth for Allison. She loves her grandmother, meets a guy, somehow instantly falls for him, hates her grandmother, goes back to save her grandmother, and then we get a line at the end of film that Laurie was right about Corey? Everything with her character felt rushed and had no clear path.Laurie, as always is great. I have no issue whatsoever with her story. She's trying to be everything to Allison. She's also trying to keep her own stuff together as to not completely lose her mind again. Jamie Lee Curtis is so good as Laurie Strode.As I said earlier, virtually no Michael in this film. When we do see him he's weak. Then strong again. Then he's beaten up by a 70 year old woman. Again, no clear path. I hate seeing the character of Michael Myers die. I love the character. But that is not the reason for the negative review. He is just completely wasted.Also, some of the dialogue in the film was incredibly hard to hear. There were several scenes where the music playing on screen was louder than the dialogue. This film was just a huge misfire overall. I thought after viewing Halloween (2018) that this trilogy was in safe hands. Turns out another group of people not named John Carpenter can't handle this material. This movie is dreadful. It may be the new low for the franchise. And yes, i am including Halloween: Resurrection and Halloween 6. I am so utterly disappointed.",

Not only does it not make for an interesting plot line, it is guilty of an irredeemable offense -- it's the end of Michael Myers and he's barely in the movie. The writer ends the story of an OG horror villain and barely gives him air time. Instead the primary antagonist of the movie is an intensely bland man that I thought maybe the film was setting up to be a new iteration of Michael Myers, but nope movie didn't go that way, because that guy died too, though not nearly soon enough.Jamie Lee Curtis, great in most of her roles, didn't seem to have her heart in this performance, which makes sense since she's admitted never liking the role or the movies, but she's always put forth a good effort in previous roles. This time, while technically proficient, there was no real soul behind her character.The movie chose to focus primarily on Lori's granddaughter and her mopey, sad-sack, milquetoast boyfriend. The characters make few decisions that make sense from an emotional and often intellectual standpoint and fail to be interesting or engaging enough to befit the end of an iconic horror movie franchise.",

Everything seemed rushed, and Michael seemed to be more of a cameo. Let me tell you something: Michael Myers is a killer. He is pure evil. Michael Myers would have killed Corey when he had him in the choke. Suddenly Michael decides he needs a sidekick? No. Michael was greatly reduced in this film and it's sad to see. Remember that This is the SAME old guy who still got up after being beaten by a town but suddenly now Michael realizes his old age and accepts a sidekick? No. No. He doesn't get reduced like that.

Instead of getting Michael to do what he does best, we get a dull character study on what makes a person evil in the FINAL film of this trilogy. Taking the attention away from Michael Myers and putting it on a new character that eventually gets killed at the END of the movie at the END of this trilogy is reprehensible and ludicrous.The notorious shape was portrayed as a broken, decrepit, and fragile old man for the majority of his minimal screen time. A far cry from the terrifying unstoppable killing machine from the past installments. The defenses of him being in that state do not add up, especially since the end of the last film sees him triumphant and incensed.On a positive side of things, Jamie Lee Curtis' performance was a stand out as Laurie Strode remains one of the best heroines in horror history. The final confrontation between the two legacy characters was satisfying but was demeaned by the first hour and a half of the film.Halloween 2018 revitalized the franchise, Halloween Kills was a gory good time and Halloween Ends shreds your expectations and puts you down along with Michael Myers himself in disappointing fashion.",

Instead, the whole story focuses on this random character that was suddenly introduced as he gets more insane and gets involved in this warped, romance. And I guess he becomes Michael's apprentice in killing, that seems to be what they were going for. Honestly, it felt like they just took some random movie idea that has nothing to do with the franchise and just tweaked the plot around a bit to make it fit into the Halloween franchise. But the presence of the actually Halloween characters feel forced and out of place, like they're not even in the right movie. If they showed the trailer of what this movie was actually about, you would have no clue that it was a Halloween movie.And as I said, Michael is pretty much not even in the movie at all. He's basically been reduced to a background side character with little to no involvement with the story, but he needed to be shoehorned into the plot in order to make it a Halloween movie, but even then, only as an afterthought. And he came across as a weak and feeble person and an additional side villain rather than being the scene stealing slasher he's meant to be. And after everything they built up in Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills, none of that is addressed and amounts to nothing. They told a completely different, unrelated story involving Laurie and her granddaughter, and then just randomly threw Michael into the movie at the end for one final minute long showdown with Laurie because they needed to, and even that was underwhelming. And if all that wasn't bad enough, the characters aren't even likable. I mean, sure there's Laurie and her granddaughter, but even they're not that appealing in this one. And all the kill victims, they're either random characters you care nothing about or unlikable characters you want to see killed off.As a movie in itself, it was \"meh\". As a Halloween movie, it was an utter disaster. This is easily the worst movie of the entire franchise. Yes, even worse than Halloween Resurrection and Rob Zombie's Halloween 2. What an insult to the series and a horrible way to send Michael off and conclude the story. They told a story that wasn't Halloween with Michael occasionally popping up in the background for only a few minutes of screen time and then going out like a chump. Should you see it? Sure, why not, if for no other reason than to conclude the Halloween story, a story that practically doesn't even feature Michael, but don't expect anything even remotely close to great, and don't expect a payoff from anything built up in the previous movies.",

It felt like David Gordon Green put the the audience on a wild goose chase on a merry-go-round.I was waiting for some kind of \"horror\"-worthy moment in the movie but it just got dragged on and on about the angst of some young love. I mean fine, you could have that in this one but if they're making another film in the Halloween franchise then they better have some horror elements to it; or at least some suspence.But sadly, Halloween Ends fell short and it felt tired. Sitting in the theater I was like waiting throughout the movie when anything Halloween-ish scenario going to happen but nothing.I read that many people prefer this one than the last one, Halloween Kills, but that's their preference and can't argue with their tastes. But personally, at least \"Kills\" (and the 2018 one) had more impact than this one.I mean for a movie that had the definitive word \"Ends\" in it, it lacks any form of resolution to the supposedly the last movie of the franchise. Instead, the momentum of the movie right from the start was like a gradual fade into the sunset. It was as if Halloween Kills was the ending dramatic end and \"Ends\" was like a 2 hour plus epilogue to \"Kills\". It was such a waste of time.Right from the start of \"Ends\", it felt like it's as if it's suggesting that Halloween Ends is a 'legacy' to the Michael Myers' story. As if Michael Myers was passing his torch or sceptre of murderous rampage to this young guy. As if transcending the young man's inner soul with his killing impulses. I mean Michael Myers spared the kid's life? What the heck was that? Err, hello! Michael Myers kills indiscriminately for goodness' sakes. And Myers passed his legacy to that kid?And as if that's not enough, we've got to have blossoming romance between Laurie Strode's granddaughter with this potential serial killer just so the spirit of Michael Myers would get to Laurie? How convenient is that?The bottom line is Halloween Kills served as a better conclusion to the whole franshise even thought Michael Myers was nowhere to be found afterwards. But no, they just have to keep the franchise going on and on.By the way, I don't know if the filmmakers were trying to make the opening titles with that Jack-o-Lantern as a homage to the original but with the cheap-looking transitions between one Jack-o-Lantern to the next, it's just insulting.",

            "content": "I'm not the only one that 'moaned' about another Halloween movie - let me guess - Michael Myers will chase Laurie, people will die, blah blah blah. Same boring formula.Well Halloween Ends tossed that out the window, with a refreshing take on the whole franchise.I'd label this one the 'thinking person's Halloween'\nIf you are looking for cheap jump scares - then move along. If you are looking for the traditional Halloween formula (minus 3) then move along.Now I am going to spoil away here...\nBut hear me out.. my theory, and it is just a theory and it is wild.From the beginning of Halloween kills we are lead from Laurie's narration. Pretty much straight away you are shown that she is writing a book about her experiences, which later on you discover was Frank's suggestion. Like a Catharsis.Laurie has changed a hell of a lot from Halloween Kills, it was not the Laurie I was expecting. Her daughter was slaughtered by Michael at the end of Halloween Kills, so surely she is even more wound up that the previous films.Not in this film, Laurie is chilled, a baking, knitting grandma.. This all adds to my theory.The one thing that really threw me was Allyson's character in this film. In 4 years she has turned from a teenage girl, into this predatory woman. I get she has been through a lot, but she certainly is not demure in this take. And either is Laurie. They both (and you can through the hate as much as you like) have a man hungry quality to them, that is just a bit 'off' and I don't mean its off in the sense that a woman can't be straight forward sexually. I mean 'off' as in, it just doesn't fit their previous character representation. And again this feeds into my theory.Then enter Corey. Corey the baby sitter. At first we are thinking, okay they have thrown this on its head. Michael vs a male baby sitter, very cool. But no, well not yet...\nCorey accidentally kills a little boy he is baby sitting. And I have to point out here, that at first we are getting the vibe that this kid is super cute and sweet, then they turn it on the head by making him into a brat, which I believe they did, to soften the blow of his demise.Corey doesn't go to jail, but has to live in this town tormented by the locals. Until he meets Allyson and they begin this relationship, which was at first encouraged by Laurie, but then takes a whole new turn. When Corey discovers Michael in the sewers and there is some telepathic introduction. Where Michael catches images of Corey and what he has done and kind of takes him on.. not as in fighting, but an apprentice way.Another thing that buys into my theory is the way Corey treats Michael in some encounters. I am sorry but there is no way Michael would put up being pushed around by anyone. And I also do not believe that Michael would not kill someone just because they too had killed someone, especially when it was an accident.I know I'm rambling.So if you have read this far, you have probably watched the film so I can throw my theory out there.In some points of the film, I was believing that Michael was all in Corey's head. That yes he discovered Michael in the sewer. Michael must have gone and hidden in there at the end of Halloween Kills and died. Corey sees him, and all the torment he has been through and his weird relationship with his mother, make him finally snap and he takes the mask off Michael and embodies him. That is what I thought initially.At the conclusion of the film. And I have to say that the last ten minutes were my least favourite.I believe that this whole film was a work of fiction in Laurie's book she was writing.It was her catharsis. She could never get over that Michael had disappeared and hadn't been seen for 4 years, she could never get over the fact that she wasted all her life thinking Michael was after her, when its clearly pointed out in the last film that he doesn't even remember her and was just lead to her by the Doctor. She wasted so much time on the boogeyman, and in turn blames herself for her daughters death at his hands.So what does she do, she writes a fictionalised version because she needs to kill of Michael in her head, she needs to feel that he was after her all along to justify the death of her daughter and the waste of her own life.This is why in this version (book) she is this baking, knitting grandma who has a flirty obsession with Frank, and why she encourages Allyson into a relationship with Corey, but then realises she could lose Allyson and changes the plot.Corey's man handling of Michael is Laurie's way of belittling Michael. And as for the whole ending. Come on, - she kills Michael that easily? He has been burned, stabbed, shot, blown up and she kills him like that? Then the whole town in like a morbid funeral procession to chomp up his body in the disposal shredder thing... Michael is finally dead.. Well In Laurie's eyes.Yes my theory is out there, but I think it is definitely plausible.Or maybe I am searching for an explanation to the film. I did honestly enjoy it, apart from the ending. And I was extremely disappointed that Michael didn't get to kill Laurie at the end.",

I thought it was pretty horrendous that Halloween Kills had Laurie Strode stuck in a hospital the entire time, with absolutely zero interaction with Michael. The only thing worse would be to not feature Michael at all until the last few minutes-and that's what they went ahead and did with this installment (with the exception of a few small moments here and there).This movie doesn't know what it is; it doesn't go far enough in exploring its own social commentary on violence and its effect on society, but then it also forgets to be a movie about a serial killer named Michael Myers. Instead it spends the first hour and forty-minutes muddying the waters, trying to establish a totally different setup, so that we're left with a movie about a revenge killer with a weak motive, who uses Michael's brand for a hot minute before Michael himself has a weak showdown with Laurie Strode, which in and of itself leaves much to be desired. We only needed two things from this movie: Michael versus Lindsey, then Laurie versus Michael in an epic showdown... but they didn't even give us that. Michael was so weak, it wasn't even a challenge. Which brings me to the glaring plot hole: how did Michael even follow Corey around? Are we to believe that he rode on the back of Corey's motorcycle, with his hands around Corey's waist? That imagine alone turns this movie into a joke.",

After that crazy climax of Halloween Kills, one would expect this to be another Michael Myers carnage till the explosive final showdown in the end. Instead what we get is the introduction of a new killer and a prolonged drama of him turning into a psychotic killer while Michael Myers took the back seat. The Pscho & the Freakshow, though sounded intriguing, neither of them delivered on the promise.The problem was solely with the writing and the narrative pace. It really was a very slow movie with hardly any dramatic impact. Corey's struggle with the town ill treating him and him eventually embracing the evil lacked the impact it aimed for. The portrayal of Corey was good though. With not much thrills or scares, this empty finale ended on a dull note with the climax being far more underwhelming. The ever energetic Jamie Lee Curtis tried to do complete justice to her Laurie. One simply couldn't stop thinking about an entirely different take for a fitting finale.",

            "content": "Comparing it with Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare(1991) and Jason X(2001) and Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes(2006) this final installment falls short of its mark.And what an uninspiring movie it is. Been there, done that seems the motto. I feel relieved actress Jamie Lee Curtis is finally freed from the clutches of this horror franchise.Let's go back in time. The first Halloween film directed by the legendary cult director John Carpenter(The Thing, Starman, Escape From New York, In The Mouth Of Madness, Prince Of Darkness) was basically an exploitation movie. They exploited the then 20 year old actress Curtis for her first role in the soon to become a cult slasher horror franchise, the likes of the Friday The 13th horror films.Truth be told, I was never a fan of the film. Same with Friday The 13th. I would never care to see those films again. But, this is an exception: Jason X a very re-watchable attempt at the end to the Friday The 13th franchise. But they rebooted it as well.This new and last entry for Curtis attempts to resolve the blood feud between them. You'll have to see the movie how this happens. The actors in the film are decent on the level of a good American TV series. Nothing extraordinary. The level of special effects is kept to a bare minimum. Horror films these days, even independent ones, have surpassed Halloween in the level of gore. The photography and sound effects are also okay. My only gripe is that for a last entry you should have a grand finish and spare no expense. All the best effects should have been in this one and a lot of carnage and rampage and should have been a non-stop action thrill ride like James Cameron's Aliens or Terminator 2. Should've had Michael fight against elite commandos/SWAT team and should've let Curtis fire heavy weapons like Sigourney Weaver did in Aliens.In my opinion I have seen better slasher movies in my life, two of the best being The Burning(1981) and Intruder(1989). If you haven't seen these two gems, you're in for a real treat.",

The storyline makes no sense. The beginning of the movie opens up with this teenager who accidentally kills the kid he's babysitting for. He ends up really screwed up in the head and all of a sudden, thinks he's Michael Myers with no transition/explanation, whatsoever. Then we see Laurie Strode, who is now the 'recovered victim' living a ridiculously positive life without a care in the world. She's evidently a recovering alcoholic in this movie. She's living with her granddaughter who, for some reason, becomes obsessed with and decides to become a psychopath with aforementioned former babysitter turned evil killer. The guy who plays Michael Myers only has one major fight scene and that scene is weak as can be...probably because the guy playing him is 65 years old and has arthritis so he can't move as well? Who knows? I'll just leave this here. It's a hot mess and a disappointment.

            "review_title": "This movie really went out with a whimper",
            "content": "Honestly, the only saving grace in this movie is the acting in it. The acting in this movie might not be the best out of the trilogy of these movies, but it was still entertaining to watch and kept the audience hooked till the very end. Obviously, the stand-out performance in this movie is Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie. Throughout all of these new Halloween movies, Jamie Lee Curtis has remained the best actor in all of them showing how hard it is to move on from a traumatic event and how it impacts your family as well. This continues with this movie but this time we finally get to see her in a different light. I enjoy the fact we get to see her in the final stage of grieving and not just this paranoid person anymore. A surprise performance I really enjoyed in this movie was Rohan Campbell, who plays Corey. I can't properly explain why his performance was one of my favourites due to it spoiling it but trust me when I say it's captivating. Corey is a very interesting character that has a deep significance when it comes to the story. He easily could've been a stereotypical character but Rohan Campbell brings so much passion to this role that you feel bad for this character and want to see him be forgiven. Unfortunately, other than those two performances the rest of the cast wasn't really that spectacular. This is especially sad to say about Andi Matichak, who plays Allyson, who was a standout in the other two movies due to being a tough finale girl. In this movie, though, her entire character got rewritten as it seems as if she feels like such an entirely different person. But I can't really talk as the actors did the best they could with the story that they had which is definitely going to divide people.The most non-spoiler way I can describe this movie is that the advertisements for this movie don't properly show what happens in this movie. Most times misleading advertisements are a good choice to make as that means the movie isn't spoiled and the audience doesn't fully know what to expect. But for this movie, it flops as the audience goes in expecting one thing and comes out disappointed. This movie technically has two stories, one that isn't shown in the trailers and the other which is. Now having a dual storyline could work for this movie if the two stories were integrated properly and unfortunately that isn't the case here. The first story feels nothing like a Halloween movie until the writers remember what movie this is and try to connect it to the next storyline and just feels weak. While the second part of the movie's story fully feels like a Halloween movie but unfortunately it's all shown in the trailers. So once we actually get to the exciting part of the story everything has been spoiled for the audience and we already know what's going to happen. The story for this movie would've worked much better if they better integrated the two storylines. You can have the story of Laurie properly coming to terms with what happened to her while still preparing for his possible return. I know there's one part of this story that most audience people aren't going to like and I can see why as it is annoying but I also get why it was included. This part was included to be part of the deeper meaning of this movie's story of how society can create monsters. Just like everything else in this story it isn't handled well and just feels like something they threw in for possible future sequels. But honestly, even if the story wasn't a huge mess, another big issue this movie has is its pacing of it. The pacing of this movie is slow-burn and I know that Halloween movies are known for slow-burn but it didn't work here. The slow-burn pacing especially doesn't work when the last twenty minutes of this movie is so fast-paced in order to try and make up for the start of the movie.I wouldn't really have an issue with this kind of pacing if it had led to a satisfying end for this iconic horror movie villain but it doesn't. Due to the fast-paced ending, everything is rushed and it doesn't feel like a satisfactory ending between Laurie and Michael. In the end, Halloween Ends is definitely the weakest film of this trilogy and ends the Laurie and Michael Myers story with a whimper. If the movie was more accurate to how it was advertised I probably would've enjoyed this movie a bit more.",

Michael disappears for 4 years (we literally never find out why, and for some reason he hides in a sewer in Haddonfield) and he meets a disgraced teen named Corey who accidentally killed a kid. Even though he's innocent, Michael \"sees potential in him\" apparently and decides to pick him up and stare into his eyes, showing that he's transferring evil into him. Next thing you know, yep, he wants to kill people for no reason. My jaw dropped. Why wasn't this shown in the trailer? Corey is basically the new Michael, for Michael only pops in around the middle, and near the end. And that's all I'll say about that in case if you really wanna waste your time watching a film that doesn't scare, horrify, make you wonder, let alone simply follow its own established story. The writing is weird, the pacing is slow, the plot placement is pointless, the new Michael successor Corey was by far one of the most offensive inclusions in any of the Halloween films. WE CAME FOR MICHAEL MYERS.All in all, if I weren't watching with my family, I would have boo'd and walked out half way through. I don't know what kind of drug Danny McBride and company used while making this movie, but I certainly would never take it.",

How this is getting positive reviews is truly beyond me, if you are going to waste your time watching this id suggest saving your money and using it to put towards actual good movies in theaters and stream this on peacock maybe right before bedtime so at least the positives that this movie will offer you is its a surefire way to go to sleep quickly.",

            "content": "Wow... so after this getting pushed back by a year & all the hype & song & dance & this is what we get!? I was actually looking forward to this film, properly hyped up! But man, my expectations where completely & utterly quashed!The film follows the events in 2018 in Halloween Kills where the town has laid quiet, shook & traumatized after the events that have rocked them to their bones! With Michael Myers gone, 4 Years have passed since the tragic events, along with Laurie losing her daughter! However, it seems one man has been traumatised the most when he accidentally kills a child he was meant to be babysitting one night & sees his life start to get worse & worse! It is then, he finds himself going down a pretty dark path...!I found the film to be pretty dyer! I mean a good 40 minutes elapses until we actually see Michael & another 10 on from that til we see him kill his one & only & final kill! Pathetic! It's definitely one of the main issues with the film! The other, is that the film is too talk talky talk!! I mean, I really started to question if I was seeing a Halloween Film or a bloody Soap Opera!! If I wanted to hear people talk & talk & talk & talk, I would've listen to this film through a bloody Podcast!The whole idea of some young man being \"possessed\" by evil & taking Michael Myers' place was absolutely dumb! The character was sympathetic until they done that to him! It was a poor path to go down! A very poor path! A lot of the kills were done by him & not Myers as I stated above, & when you think about (not including that dumb opening), nearly a good hour goes by without a kill or any action to speak of! Alright, we see some drama, but honestly, I wanted to see Michael Myers killing victims, not some soap opera!The film itself is way too long & the pacing is abysmal! 1 hour & 45 minutes seriously isn't justified for this film or any film that has little to no action going on to justify cheating its viewers & doing nothing earn its right to be that long! At all! Especially given this film has a good hour of nothing but drama & talking!I mean, there was some good I suppose, the gore was great, the violence was great, there was some pretty dark & messed up scenes which really did well, along with some eye candy & funny scenes, the ending with Michael Vs. Laurie was also pretty good!Sadly though, it was too little too late & didn't justify the lack of kills from Myers! Speaking of which, the twist & part before that was absolutely bad! The opening itself was poor & not even a kill fro Myers which should've said something to me as soon as the opening credits started to roll!Overall, the film is just boring! Say what you will about Halloween Kills, but at least that film did what it set out to be & didn't lead it's viewers on to believe that the film was going to deliver! And people wonder why there was very little to no trailers out for this film, never mind any lengthy trailers! That, is because there is very little of Michael Myers & too much talking & teen drama & kak! I wouldn't recommend this one! It's definitely the worst out of the trilogy & one of the poorest of them all! This Halloween Film really lost it's way & should've been named Halloween Zzz!2/10.",

And then Cory acts like he is the real Myers going out to slash everyone? NO! Nobody gets to be Michael Myers except Myers himself only! Such BS. Then an ending with only a 5 minute showdown between Laurie and Myers. She manages to kill Myers, but then only to take him all the way out to a dumpster grinder where his body gets chopped? The whole town goes to watch that? Laurie narrates her life of how she overcame the evil, last shot of Myers mask in the house, then cuts to black with the freaking Blue Oyster Cult of Don't Fear The Reaper song to play in the credits?! REALLY? We all should know that this is not the trilogy that we wanted. It's hard for me to even process and believe that BlumHouse and Universal were a part of this stinky pile of cat hairball! This is one of those moments where the best episode or best show should have been saved for LAST. Like Halloween Kills would've been the marvelous way to end a trilogy. But how in this world do you transition from something that great to something THIS terrible?? I'll never understand. Therefore, shame on the directors, producers and writers for letting fans down.

I would've went 150m and added to that storyline to get a better understanding of the kid taking on the new role and give the relationship more depth. Then, I would've rather seen MM die in the sewers and let the kid take over solo. I love JLC, but would've been better if she did commit suicide. Then, let the granddaughter take over and boom - the new future of Halloween. However, that's my own personal take on the matter. The way they end MM once and for all just puts the thought in your head as to why they just didn't do that 40 years ago??!! Sad that this is all they could come up with.

It felt like I was watching a different movie, or a spin off rather than another sequel.The acting isn't great, and most of the characters are unlikable tired stereotypes.I really didn't like the way Laurie Strode and Michael Meyers are portrayed and i found it disrespectful to their legacy.Some of the film was basically unwatchable it was that bad and I feel they tried cramming in a few cheap kills just for the sake of it. The kills themselves were unoriginal, and the special effects gore and makeup looked like it was from the 1980's.Thankfully there is a showdown between Laurie and Michael which should have lasted a lot longer to make this movie more bearable.Sadly what started as such a successful reboot of the franchise in 2018, ends terribly in 2022.Summed up, Halloween Ends... badly.",

The concepts are awful, the execution is bad, the characters are unlikable, it's confusing and just an absolute steaming pile. If this was Jamie Lee Curtis's last time playing Laurie strode, I feel bad for her because this is going to be remembered as much as the original Halloween. The concept of a apprentice killer for Michael? Was just dumb. He didn't even show up for the first 40 or 45 minutes of the movie. It goes so far off of the path of where the original from 2018 was at that it's embarrassing. It's just a real punch in the face to Halloween fans. I consider myself a diehard Halloween fan and I was extremely disappointed, this is just a bad, bad movie that makes no sense. Somebody needs to pick this serious up and do it right.

But this was an absolute slap in the face of some fans who've supported the franchise for best part of 4 decades!Because writers are so devoid of talent and fresh ideas they get licences from dormant franchises with decent followings and flog them to death, there's no pride, no passion, like the new scream, the final 3 halloweens went from barely watchable to this mess.Imagine doing the finale of a franchise with one of the most iconic figures in horror movie history, then making the decision to barely feature him and use one of the most untalented actors to deliver a weird performance with a disjointed delivery that was genuinely nonsensical. His voice constantly changed, it was awful to listen to, he had an awful presence and that whole live angle was forced cliches and lazy writing.It gets boring how pain and damage doesn't affect these people, one with brain damage and another with a multitude of mental health issues, are thru saying that poorly people are evil? It was just ridiculous.Then there's the girl, her decision making, loyalty and actions made very little sense, there was no chemistry between any characters at all. Personally JLC should retire as the last 5 films I've seen her in she's been horrific to watch!To do this story as a book or memoir was lazy but not the worst way but then we come to all the other things, the constant use of reflections for images to avoid showing things, the skipping away from multiple kills so there's a lack of gore or satisfaction of seeing the kill, that the whole point of these films surely? The kills in this one were weak, hidden or cartoonish.Then the ending, although predictable and literally given away in the trailer it was just utterly embarrassing, it made no sense and many of the things were ignored just for a United town image and his body. It was genuinely hilariously poor.The last bit actually made me sad, the last image of a mask I've known my whole life, I've watched most films multiple times so literally days of my life loving the films and this genre and yet again another thing this generation has just destroyed. No one values how others feel about things and no one with any sense of quality control or loyalty to the franchise would've okayed this. All about money.Don't go an see it, waste of money!

            "content": "With the experiences of the past behind them, the survivors of the previous rampage offer their support to each other when one of them enters into a potential relationship to help heal, but when it's discovered there are ties to the still-present killer roaming the city race to stop him.There are very few redeeming qualities to this one. About the only worthwhile thing here is the general brutality and viciousness in the kills which are admittedly handled quite well whenever they occur. With a few somewhat tense stalking scenes or confrontations spread throughout here including the attack on the doctors' house or the sequence at the impound lot, these and the few other scenes of actual stalking action allow this one to feature a slew of rather graphic kills that continue on all the way through to the finale which is quite hard-hitting in the way the interaction plays out. With the way the interconnecting storylines are played out here and the plot twists that come about due to reveling in the setups provided here manage to give a wholly effective and deserved sense of euphoria. This one has a ton of flaws to it. The biggest drawback to this one is the utterly infuriating and aggravating storyline that makes this one feel far too long for what it really is. Way too much of the film is taken up by these absolutely banal and irritating romance angle that is unwarranted and drain the energy of the film completely, with the loner kid attempting to start a romance with the granddaughter over their traumatic past that comes out of nowhere since they've never interacted with each other before and goes through way too much too quickly for a realistic relationship. Their meet-cute is haphazardly handled and doesn't deserve the kind of treatment they generate together, especially with the whole point of their relationship status built on their mutual hatred for the town because they're being bullied for their past. That helps to highlight the secondary issue with this one in an absolutely criminal lack of genre action or thrills throughout here. Michael is a non-entity for the first hour of the film for he makes no appearance at all nor is there anything resembling deaths or kills present with it building up their flawed romance. Rather than get any kind of hints about his presence in the community as everyone believes that he's simply disappeared into obscurity but hardly any of that matters with nothing being given as to why he's not involved in the lives of others. Instead of bringing about any kind of overt stalking attempts or ambushes to showcase his constant menace to the community, he's barely in the film in the first part of the film and then even more rarely gets involved in things to just stand and watch which really hurts this one. The other really big issue here is that, for all the attempts at foreshadowing how this fits into the franchise, barely any of it has an effect. The entire ordeal is presented as the trauma of the past causing them to be unable to move on and accept their fate in life, but instead of showing the effects of this on the town and what's gone through hardly anything here tends to connect to the past. That it's been years between these incidents and the past film yet none of the events are brought up or even matter makes for a wholly loose connection at best that doesn't get helped out by how nonsensical everything comes together which is the whole point of finishing off the trilogy. While it all ends on a high note with their final conclusion, because there's been so little connection to anything else it does come off lower than it really should've.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",

Probably nothing.It is no exaggeration to say that this movie failed to deliver in every possible way and provided absolutely no satisfactory closure for the series. It feels ridiculous to even type these words, but Michael Myers is apparently taking on apprentices now, for anyone interested in honing their murder skills. Michael takes a complete backseat to the character of some town reject who the movie initially tries to build sympathy for. This reject inherits Michael's evil, develops a mean streak, and commits murders of his own around Haddonfield. We're even given a few scenes where old man Michael and his newly adopted son run around as a tag team committing several uninspired, lackluster murders. Rinse and repeat, with things gradually becoming sillier and more confusing along the way. I know reviewers say this a lot, and it's a bit of a cliche, but I truly could've walked out of this one and not cared a bit. I wouldn't have missed a thing.Laurie is the same old jaded and paranoid woman she was in the last two films. Nothing awe-inspiring or jaw-dropping about her presence in this film. The actress playing her granddaughter looks bored most of the time, like she's just praying for filming to wrap soon so she can get her paycheck. We have the usual array of wooden law enforcement characters, none of which add anything memorable to any of the scenes.I've said it before, and I'll say it yet again: Halloween H20 is the true end of the series. It was a good film with a perfect conclusion. That's how it was supposed to end. Laurie had decapitated Michael and the story was finished. The only reason the series continued after that, and turned into a clown show, is obviously because of money. What really aggravates me is how disengaged the creators of this crap film are from the fans. The group of idiots who greenlighted this mess had to have known that this was is no way an entertaining or well-made film. If they honestly thought this film was quality material, then every single one of them degenerates should be fired and sent to a psychiatrist. The truth is that they couldn't have cared less about giving the loyal Halloween fans what they truly deserved: a strong, satisfying, and memorable finish to the series.A very disappointing, disgraceful end to what used to be one of the most terrifying horror series. This was one of the very few times that I was physically agitated sitting through a film. It felt like I was being force-fed poison.This film will leave you with nothing to remember, except for maybe lighter pockets and a headache. Dismiss it like it was never there. It plain old sucks.",

For decades we've watched a seemingly indestructible monster provide us with some of the most legendary moments in Horror movie history and in this movie, he was reduced to a geriatric extra with probably 10 minutes of screen time. Don't get me wrong, I love Laurie Strode as her own character. But I don't watch Halloween for her story alone.I feel like the Directors and Writers wanted to tell two separate stories. On one hand, we have Corey's story and his descent into evil. Did the town cause it? Was it always there? Did Michael possess him? Did Michael let him live because he knew he was evil too? Many questions unanswered. They could have went a \"Halloween Rebirth\" route and had Corey take over his legacy but Corey dies too. It makes no sense when the entire movie is about Corey - which makes even less sense, because what about Michael?Michael Myers was a secondary character in his own finale. Sure, some will argue this was mostly about Laurie and her healing/closure but like I said, I don't watch Halloween because of her character. Because there would be no Laurie without Michael. If he was going to actually die, he deserved to go out in a memorable way.But did anyone really believe that Michael Myers was a human Man capable of dying? In the last movie he was effortlessly roasting firefighters on a pitch fork and in this movie he is a stumbling sidekick. What?!I really liked Halloween and I didn't really mind Halloween Kills as much as everyone else seemed to have.

People hate on Halloween 2 sometimes but I think it is a great continuation from the original. I like Halloween 3 and kindof wish the series went to an anthology. I really enjoyed 4-6 even though they were quirky in a sense. H2O was a disappointment but it not entirely a disaster. Resurrection was terrible and the worst in the franchise. Thr Rob Zombie movies were good in their own way. At least he showed an alternate version that stayed true to the basic idea of the monster. I really enjoyed 2018 Halloween. I though it was a well written and smart way to reintroduce the series to the original. Halloween Kills is a mirror to Halloween 2 in that it may have not been a necessary sequel but it just enhances the violence and evil of Michael Myers.Halloween Ends sucks. No way to sugarcoat it. We don't even see any part of Michael until over 39 minutes into the movie and that's just for 30 seconds. Then again around the 55 minute mark for about 2 minutes. Then 1:15 in for another minute.It's not until 1:32 into the movie that we see Michael out and about in Haddonfield. That's crazy. Halloween is supposed to be Michael Myers terrorizing Haddonfield. Michael Myers killed 1 person that was brought to him and held down, 1 person a legit \"Myers\" way and he finished off 1 person that was almost dead anyway. So give him 2.5 kills this movie, only 1 unassisted? That's just not the Halloween I grew up with.Why spend 70% of the movie showing us that evil can somehow be transferred and understood by similar humans just to have the other one die like he has no bearing on the movie at all. Its basically Zombies Halloween 2 all over again. The celtic angle in Halloween 6 was much more enjoyable than this.I'm just sitting here so disappointing and heartbroken over what I just watched. I'm serious, what an absolutely terrible way to end such an iconic character. The writers somehow pulled off erasing all movies except the original and gave us a really good sequel in 2018 and a not so bad follow up or extension in 2021. How the hell did they mess this up so bad. I know I'm rambling but I'm just in awe of how terrible the movie is. The only thing good is about 10 minutes near the end and that's it.

While the other two films in this trilogy are far more focused on Michael, this film seems to pick up the pieces thereafter and become more of a focused character study that I just found to be far more fascinating. The writing is phenomenal, heartbreaking, and incredibly personal. Every performer puts their absolute all into every single scene and it's truly a spectacle unlike any before, and I praise it for taking a chance to be so unique. It's so tempting to stick to the same formula for so many times, especially when it's been so much easier to do so for so long, but i'm honestly so glad to see something so different like this film stand out. It may piss some people off, just even solely for the fact that it's a different type of film, and was not quite marketed the way it turned out to be. But for people willing to give this one a chance, you are in for such an amazing ride- and I really hope you enjoy it. The film is incredibly brutal and violent, but also so personal. It's so much different than what we have seen from these films before and allows us to delve into the mind of a killer rather than just watching violent act after violent act. There is a slow crawl to insanity that we see linger inside their mind, and it's just utterly fascinating to watch, and I hope its attention to detail and gripping resolution will eventually be appreciated in days to come. In many ways, this film reminds me of Halloween III Season of the Witch. A very different film from the previous ones, one that sticks out, and was frowned upon for the most part on release, but I hope like that film it will earn the cult status it so deserves and earn the attention of people who look for quality in a horror film like this rather than just mindless entertainment.My Rating: 9.5/10.",

            "content": "Words do not do justice in describing what a horrific pile of trash this \"\"\"film\"\"\" is, nevertheless I will do my best to explain this garbage. First of all, this film and its marketing has defrauded the audience by lying to them and telling them this is primarily about Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, it is not. The overwhelming majority of this film tells this pseudo intellectual drivel of a story about this guy named Corey who is bad because we as society are all terrible and should be ashamed of ourselves, and the Michael and Laurie story is shoved in for a tiny portion of the film so that, technically speaking, the marketed material is somehow in the film. This film takes a lot from Halloween 3 and also takes a lot out of the dumpster fire of the worst ideas anyone could ever come up with. The credits in the film use what looks like some cheap Microsoft movie maker font in baby sky blue color and the film has a soundtrack that sounds like some middle school band if they suffered severe vocal injuries and wanted to make music mocking themselves. The microscopic fraction of the film that does have Myers has him being beaten down by everyone as if it was Jason vs My Little Pony with Michael being My Little Pony. The only thing Michael can do in this film is magically send visual waves into people's eyes that causes them to become bad when combined with the horrible society that we're all in. The few people that defend this filth say \"you Halloween fans are spoiled, they did something different, that's great\". This is literally identical to marketing a film about a sasquatch, and then 99 percent of the film is a car ride where people are bullying each other and the film is saying how we all should be ashamed of ourselves as a society, and in the final few minutes, the sasquatch is just a bully in a costume who gets defeated in a pillow fight. Then, the film's defenders start saying \"how dare you sasquatch fans expect a sasquatch movie to actually be about sasquatch? They did something different that's great! You sasquatch fans are spoiled!\". The concept of this film is also identical to having a shark movie like jaws, and then 99 percent of the film depicts bullying on the beach and bad behavior on the beach as a pseudo intellectual commentary film on how we are all bad as a society and the shark turns out to be a robot machine controlled by a bully who gets defeated with a pool noodle, and then the defenders say \"how dare you fans of shark movies actually expect the shark movie to be about a shark? They did something different that's great! You shark movie fans are spoiled!\". Don't forget to include in those identical comparisons marketing that depicts the films as being all about a sasquatch human battle or shark human battle, like Halloween Ends fraudulently did with Michael and Laurie. Imagine Titanic being released today with marketing showing it being about a sinking ship, and then, in the actual film, 99 percent of the over 2 hour film takes place on land in some office workplace and depicts people acting bad towards each other as a pseudo intellectual commentary on how horrible we all are, and then the final few minutes shows a model boat in a bathtub sinking as a commentary for how society is bad. That is literally identical to what this film is, no actual boat sinking in this case being the equivalent of Myers being as strong and violent as a teddy bear like he is in this \"\"\"film\"\"\". This garbage is a slap in the face of the franchise and its fans. This garbage makes Halloween Resurrection look like Shakespeare. Instead of wasting your time with this sack of garbage of a film, I highly recommend you go spend time with a loved one, or go for a walk, or take a nap, or watch a Halloween film which is an actual Halloween film unlike this garbage on the screen.",

I found myself even more disappointed and perplexed than I was with Halloween Kills.Michael is barely in the film (been hiding in a sewer for 4 years because why not) and his climactic fight with Laurie that's been hyped for years is pretty lackluster to be honest.

Michael was never some tortured soul twisted into a monster by abuse and alienation; he was the embodiment of irrational evil.

As a result the promised epic final showdown between Laurie and Michael is a rushed and pointless afterthought. There's barely any consistency with the prior films in the reboot trilogy. In Halloween Kills, Michael was an immortal murder ninja. Here he's just a frail old loony; he even loses a scrap to a local doofus who was himself beaten up by the high school drama club (twice.)

For some reason, after the last movie, Michael decided he would go move into the sewer system and live for years. A kid falls off a bridge and goes into the sewer, Myers sees him and chokes him, only to let him go, because of a mysterious power that Myers has that he can see into the mind of someone he is choking, and he liked the kid, and wanted him to be a sidekick. So the kid goes and kills for Michael, while Myers chills in the sewer. Then the kid gets mad at Michael, and goes and beats him up in the sewer and takes his mask. Then the ending, Laurie just nonchalantly takes down Michael as if he's an old man that lived in a sewer systemAVOID THIS MOVIE.",

Michael isnt even a shadow of his former self.Bringing in a new character (Corey) to fill his shoes was a moron move. First off he gets bullied by the entire town, then Michael spares his life because between kills and ends Michael aparently grew a conscious. Then Corey bullies Michael and takes his mask. Michael for some reason acts like he is still recovering from the last act in kills. Even though there was supposed to be a 4 year gap between the two. Corey goes around pretending to be him while doing some pretty non memorable kills. The one in the radio station was just awful. 80s horror looked better then this with special affects.The only pleasure I got from watching this movie was seeing Michael snap Corey's neck. Michael hardly had any screen time nor did Laurie. The entire movie was a lame twisted love story that nobody wanted. The writer needs to go back to working on the notebook 2 and never touch horror again.

A main one is that Michael Myers will indeed be the antagonist...Like so many Halloween fans I anxiously awaited this movie. I had high expectations yet as I sat in a practically empty theatre I found myself wondering if I was even at the right movie.Not since Friday the 13th Part V (you remember, the one where Jason wasn't even in it) have I ever been so disappointed in a sequel. \"Final installment in a trilogy\" it has been said. Well, as Laurie Strode says, \"Evil never dies, it just changes shape\"Now that I have managed to be as nice as I can with a review without revealing spoilers I am going to make a prediction and it will contain spoilers so be warned. In this movie we do get to see the demise of Michael Myers. But as we have learned from all the Halloweens prior, Michael never dies. Even in instances where there was no way he could have survived (recalling the decapitation from H20) it is later revealed that he was not the one decapitated. So my thought on his death in \"Halloween Ends\"\" - it was not Michael. He supposedly has been living in the sewers for the past 4 years. We know at least 1 vagrant has been residing under the bridge near the drainage pipe. We know that one can walk down the pipe into Michael's lair. I'm thinking the person who has been living in the sewer was not Michael at all but rather a less fortunate person who has been seeking shelter. Yes he is wearing a mechanics jumpsuit but guess what? There was a junkyard not too far away. Yes he is wearing a mask but it was burnt to the point it didn't even look like what I would expect Michael's mask to look like. Not to mention, when Michael is de-masked we see a man with gray beard stubble. In order to have stubble you must shave. Are we to think that this mad, evil, entity who has been terrorizing the residents of Haddonfield for all these decades takes time to shave? Maybe I'm grasping at straws but the point being, IF someone wanted to write a true \"Final Installment\" there are ways that Michael could be brought back. My ramblings could be no worse than what I feel were actually filmed and shown in the theatre!",

I think it was a one off film that did so we'll that of course commerce demanded not one more but two more films. I really liked the new film. It was a direct sequel to the 1978 original. Completely ignoring the really bad sequels that came after Halloween 2 that became a joke. So the 2018 film was very much a tribute to what made the original so good. Alot of people didn't like it because there wasn't enough Michael Myers. After the success of the 2018 film 2 more films were announced Last year came Halloween Kills and that film was all Michael doing his thing all the time. I also liked it. It was what Halloween should be. A kick butt slasher film. Period.Halloween Ends has been hyped for a year as the final, epic battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Of course, as a fan I wanted to see this film for that reason. The marketing was exclusively focused on the Michael vs Laurie showdown. I just saw the film today but from the 1st moment the film is completely different from what was advertised. It goes in directions that really don't work and shortchanges it's 2 main characters that are the reason audiences want to see the film. Michael Myers is the most famous film slasher. He takes a backseat in this film that is just almost laughable. I don't want to do spoilers but he is not ready the focus of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis dies get more screen time and her performance is not bad but she is more of an observer until the inevitable showdown with Michael. The focus is more on Laurie's granddaughter Allison played by Andi Matichak and her love interest Corey played by Rogan Campbell. Corey is a troubled teenager that is scorned by the people of Haddon field for a very tragic death that he was involved in. Their performances are good but the film focuses on thatore and it doesn't work. Again. Michael Myers is hardly in the film and when he is it's anti climactic. The film tried to deal with the trauma caused by Michael's murders on Hadfonfield but it doesn't really have the resonance it should. Even though the showdown does come it really doesn't have the impact it should because the film is too unfocused for it to hit the way it should. There are some good, gory kills bit no suspense. The film is really flat. For a film that was so hyped as an epic conclusion, it really misses the mark..Truly disappointed.Grade: D.",

            "content": "The halloween trilogy suffers from the same indecision as the new star wars trilogy. In both modern trilogies, the 1st and 2nd entries feel like rough drafts for the final entry which then is the actual sequel. Like, why now, introduce a successor to the evil presence that is michael myers? Seems like the whole trilogy is stuck between fan service and creating an original entry that could presumably follow up the original halloween.Danny Mcbride and David Gordon Green have left their mark on this trilogy. I don't quite get the logic of handing the franchise over to the crew who made Your Highness. I was curious to see what they would bring to the material when i found out they were working on the reboot. I thought, maybe, their talent had some diversity and that bridging from comedy to horror would produce something unexpected. Gotta love 'em, but right from the first movie i could feel the kenny powers of the whole thing. The franchise is now a versus match, michael myers vs traumatized little sister (all grown up and ready to take him on), myers vs the town, and finally...myers vs old age? I especially felt mcbride's presence in the scene where myers regains his strength and thirst for evil. Weak, old myers stabs doofy sheriff and has an almost orgasmic jolt reminiscent of goku reaching super saiyan. The more he stabs the stronger he becomes lol.There was a big misunderstanding in the writers room on the importance of innocence in horror. It's hard to remember any innocent unassuming characters in this trilogy. I guess the murders of 1978 would still be fresh on the collective memory, although it lead to an anticlimactic sense that the town itself isn't surprised. There were multiple times in this trilogy i was half expecting the victim to be like , \"oh you got me good on that one michael, nice stab dog\" I'll reiterate, Kenny Powers made this!I forgot something very important...i can only hope that someone somewhere was as transfixed as i was that the bullies were members of the high school marching band. I couldn't get that out of my head anytime they were on screen. Marching band bullies ?! Couldn't recover from the shock of the idea lol.",

Halloween Ends has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The first half of the movie feels like romantic drama. And what was the point of Corey? I get that they might have been going for conveying that the events of previous films have transformed Haddonfield and made everyone go crazy, but making Corey become Michael's sidekick/copycat was a terrible idea. And the sidekick even takes most of the scree time. Michael probably had a combined 10 mins of screen time, he didn't do much in that time, and his showdown with Laurie at the end was so rushed and offered no satisfaction. The writing also seemed to fall flat by having such a large time jump between the events of Halloween Kills and Ends. It appeared like many of the characters conveniently forgot what happened with the events of Kills and after the first 5 minutes of the movie you never hear anything about it again. To me giving this film a 1/10 is still too generous.",

            "content": "Halloween Ends is the conclusion to the 3rd reboot in this convoluted franchise. Halloween (2018) was an enjoyable movie and made for a perfectly great finale. Unfortunately, it got the \"franchise milking\" treatment. It was followed up by Halloween Kills which was bad. This made me worried about the quality of Halloween Ends. So is this the satisfying end to Michael Myers or should he have stayed dead in the fire in 2018?Let's get the positive out of the way first. Jamie Lee Curtis is still awesome as Laurie Strode. She manages to convey the vulnerability of her character after the loss of her daughter in Halloween Kills but still be badass when she needs to. The first couple of minutes of the film is pretty good too. It has suspense and a pretty fun kill. The actual anticipated fight between Laurie and Michael Myers is thoroughly entertaining as well. There are also some enjoyable kills with one concerning a 'tongue' which is quite memorable.However, that is where the positive ends. I'm going full spoilers in my negatives because this film manages to succeed in annoying me. The first and last couple of minutes in the movie is good but everything in between sucks. There is nothing fun in these 90 minutes, heck I would even say it is downright boring at times. The fun intro is replaced with this dull seriousness and drama that just isn't engaging whatsoever. It takes almost half the runtime for Michael to kill someone, it's ridiculous. On that note, I don't find the kills to be as enjoyable as Halloween (2018) or Halloween Kills. As much as I dislike Halloween Kills, it at least provides a lot of kills and really fun goofy ones too. Halloween Ends barely has any and a majority of them are forgettable. Likewise, the final fight is good but it isn't as good as Halloween (2018) so I ended up being disappointed that this was how Michael Myers dies...The most incredibly stupid thing this movie does is having the main character not be Laurie Strode. Instead, we have Corey, a young man who accidentally murdered a child while he babysat. He has the majority of screen time in the movie showing his descent into being the next Michael Myers. I genuinely couldn't believe that the director was having him be a focus instead of the characters we care about. A majority of the kills in this movie are done by Corey, not Michael Myers. I was so irritated by this decision as instead of providing us what was advertised, the epic conclusion between Laurie and Michael, we get cringy Corey. I think the actor, Rohan Campbell, does a fine job of showing the descent of the character but he is let down by the stupid script. Corey just isn't very sympathetic or likeable as everything that comes out of his mouth is just silly or edgy. I can't believe the conclusion of this franchise would have someone other than Michael or Laurie as the focus.Additionally, the story is stupid as well. Michael has vanished after his massacre in Halloween Kills for 3 years for some reason that is never explained. Corey gets treated like a psycho by the town and Laurie is blamed for the murders by the town for some reason. The disposable characters in this film act like unbelievable A-holes. For example, there are some bullies in this film that act like over-the-top bullies from a 90s movie even though the setting is 2022. Corey and Laurie's granddaughter, Allyson, fall in love after like 5 seconds of meeting each other which is unbelievably stupid. The movie is then about their stupid romance with Laurie just kind of there. Corey meets Michael but is spared by him. Corey uses Michael to kill people who wrong him or his girlfriend. The stupid part is that Michael starts following Corey around like a pet dog for some reason. On the topic of Michael, he is so pathetic in this movie. He was fighting multiple people in Halloween Kills but was struggling to fight one single person in this film. Halloween Kills implies that he has supernatural powers but in this film, that seems to be completely gone with no explanation. Corey starts becoming incredibly edgy and takes over being the next Michael Myer even though no one watching wants that. The movie then finally gets rid of Corey but then suddenly remembers the characters of Michael and Laurie. There is no tension or build-up to Laurie and Michael's fight, it just kind of happens. It then tries to wrap up those two in a couple of minutes. It's just astounding that a professional writer wrote this...Overall, what a disappointing finale to Jamie's final appearance as Laurie. It feels like the director didn't have any story in mind for the conclusion of Michael and Laurie so brought a random character to pad the time. This doesn't remotely feel like a Halloween movie and instead feels like someone shoved another movie into it. I'm angry at the director for thinking this story was acceptable. Halloween H20 and even Halloween (2018) were a better finale to the franchise than Halloween Ends. I recommend just watching Halloween (2018) and not even bothering with Kills and Ends. Halloween Ends fails to deliver a proper satisfying finale while being a movie with a lot of missed opportunities. Michael should've just died in the fire because this is lame and disrespectful.",

            "content": "This is a movie that I knew I'd see in the theaters. Jaime even joined me since she watched the previous installment from the year prior. I'll be honest though, I'm not the biggest fan of the franchise or this line of sequels, but I still enjoy them. I was wondering what they were doing to do and the route they would go to 'end' this series.Synopsis: four years after the events of Halloween in 2018, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man is accused of a killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force her to finally confront the evil she can't control, once and for all.Now for this movie, we start in 2019. The effects of Michael Myers' rampage are still felt. He seems to have disappeared, but the fear is there. Corey (Rohan Campbell) rides his bike to Mr. Allen (Jack William Marshall) and Mrs. Allen's (Candice Rose) place. It is Halloween and they're going to a party. Corey is there to watch their son, Jeremy (Jaxon Goldenberg). Tragedy strikes though, leaving the boy dead and Corey blamed.It then shifts to the present. As the synopsis says, Laurie has decided to stop living in fear and now lives with granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). She is working as a nurse in the nearby medical center while Laurie is writing a book about her ordeal. She is trying to move on, but even today, the effects of Michael still linger.Corey also tried to move on with his life. He didn't move away to go to engineering school and instead works at a junkyard with who I'm assuming is his stepfather, Ronald (Rick Moose). The townspeople of Haddonfield look down on him and he's bullied by a group of high school students.A couple of things change his outlook though. The first is that Laurie helps him and tries to set him up with Allyson. The other is an encounter with Michael Myers. This monstrous human sees something in him and doesn't kill him. The killings in Haddonfield start up again, spiraling this town back in fear and paranoia.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Without necessarily going into spoilers, this movie did something that I wasn't expecting. It is interesting that coming into seeing this, I saw a couple of people on social media post cryptic things that got me thinking. The first was from my friend Ken Sledge from over on Sledgehammer Horror. He said that if fans of a certain franchise movie hated this, they were being hypocritical. The other was from Dave Zee from the Exploding Heads Horror Movie Podcast. He said that they did something a bit different here and he loved where it went. Now what does that mean?I'm not going to give away what the movie Ken is alluding to, but I like some what they do here. They don't explain how Michael got away at the end of Halloween Kills, but it is what it is. I like that they toned down the over-the-top nature of the mob from that movie. This settles in that the evil of Michael is still here. Whenever someone is killed or takes their own life, they look back to him. It makes everyone uneasy. This plays in with the death of Jeremy and changing the life forever of Corey.This character is where I'll go next. I think that Campbell does a great job at being uneasy from this point on in the movie. He is bullied by most everyone he meets. This includes his mother, Joan (Joanne Baron). What is intriguing there is that she babies him while also being strict. Mrs. Allen as well as Terry (Michael Barbieri) and his group of friends are bullies. The mother makes sense, only in that she has to blame someone for the death of her son. These teens are jerks. The only person who is nice to him is Ronald. That is until he meets Laurie and then Allyson. The performance by Campbell is good in that he conveys that feeling of deserving what he is getting. He wants to be happy, but he can't be. Allyson gives him hope. That hope can be dangerous though.There is also an interesting change here with these characters. I love that Laurie sees what happened to her daughter and son-in-law. She doesn't want that isolated life she's been living. She moves in with Allyson and the two of them heal. This feels believable. The problem that I have is that writing is too awkward. There are so many interactions here that don't feel real. They push almost everything early in this movie to a level of cringy. I'm not sure why as seeing where things go when we shift to the slasher elements finally, the performances aren't bad. It feels like the writing team wanted to add drama and it didn't work out how they wanted for me.Being that this is a slasher, that is where I'll go next. These elements are what brought me there. This movie is as brutal as the previous which I love. Michael wrecks people once again. The problem is that we don't get a lot of it. There is the opening kill of Jeremy and then we get some lulls between getting more. This does something a bit different that I didn't mind. I wasn't sure if they were going to make Michael supernatural or not. There is a twinge of that, but I can work with it. The change made here I thought was solid to be honest and I went with it. There are people who will hate it for sure as I'm already seeing it.Speaking of the slasher elements, I'll go to the effects and the kills. This movie does go practical with what they can and CGI where they need to. I didn't have issues here to be honest. There were kills that made me cringe which I loved. Jaime even had to cover her eyes at time so this is a success. I'll include the cinematography as well. This is shot well. It is strategic if you can't go practical or make it look good with CGI, cut away. The use of shadows help as well. The only gripe here is that I wanted more.That will take me to the acting and I've already touched on this a bit. No one is great here, but I'm going to blame the writing more. I think we get a good send off for Curtis as Laurie. Matichak is fine once again as Allyson. She owns this role and is attractive. There are just some things with her character that made my eyes roll. I thought that Campbell was good too. Their 'love' connection just seems too rushed which is a gripe I have. James Jude Courtney has a good body shape to be Michael Myers. That works. I liked seeing Will Patton back as Frank. The rest of the cast is fine. Again, most of my issues is with the writing, not necessarily the performances. It is fun to see Kyle Richards back as Lindsey as well.Last thing to go into before closing this out is the soundtrack. I love seeing John Carpenter back working with his son Codi. This is probably my least favorite of this new 'trilogy'. This might not be their best work, but it is better than most slashers out there still. That is saying something.In conclusion, this again is a polarizing film like the previous two. I like the changes that are made here. It makes it stand out and I think there's an interesting commentary about Michael Myers and his effect on this town. If I have a gripe with the story, they focus too much on the human element that wasn't fleshed out in a way that I cared. It is a bit too awkward. When they get to the slasher stuff, it is great. Going with that, the acting is good minus the 'dramatic' moments. The effects are good. The soundtrack is solid. For how many sequels we have this in franchise, I've seen much worse. I enjoyed my time with this one, even though it runs too long and could be trimmed.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",

This film features some of the best things in this new trilogy, but also features some of the worst things in this trilogy.Starting off with the good Jamie Lee Curtis gives her best performance not just in these new films, but in the whole series. She is great and I loved what the did for the most part with her character. Also Rohan Campbell as Corey was really good. His character was very interesting in the beginning. The opening of this movie is well done, it's creepy and even a little shocking. The movies very well shot with some nice callbacks to the franchise. David Gordon Green also does a really good job directing. Some of the best directing in the series. There's one kill in here that really stands out that was not only bloody, but creative. And finally the final fight at the end of the film was very well done.However this film really stumbles with this story. No spoilers but this film does something very different which while commendable makes for a very messy and unsatisfying finale. The movie surprisingly is really slow. It takes nearly 45 minutes for Micheal Myers to show up. This movie has the lowest kill count in the series which was disappointing. Certain characters like Lindsey Wallace have nothing to do in this film. The movie really seems like it forgot how to be a Halloween movie. I also didn't like how Corey ended up in the movie. They set up some intriguing things but it didn't pay off. Certain things in the finale just felt very weird and almost like the film didn't know where it wanted to go with the story. And finally this movie did not have nearly enough of the stakes or thrills to make it a good finale. It ends surprisingly far too quickly with only 15 minutes left for the movie to give us what we want. Laurie and Micheal.Overall this is a very conflicting movie. It's not bad but very hard to really understand. Jamie Lee Curtis is great, it's well directed, and clearly has passion. But the story is a mess, the pacing is poor, and the decisions made in this movie really make it hard to call this a satisfying finale.",

Michael Myers is reduced to being a total joke who lives in the sewers and is barely strong enough to stand.The male lead can hardly be surpassed in terms of ridiculousness and can neither portray the pitiful outcast nor the psychopath (out of nowhere) believably.According to Halloween 2018, Laurie Strode has been preparing for 40 years to kill Michael and then, just before the climax, decides to become a dear granny who leads a nice life in a clean suburban cottage.Her granddaughter behaves like a rebellious teenager and sinks into an equally ridiculous and totally unnecessary love story, which is completely misplaced.I could go on writing like this forever and I want 2 hours of my lifetime back!One huge disappointment for any Halloween fan. You feel like you're in a twilight movie starring Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.After 30 minutes I wished to leave the film, but I thought that couldn't be meant seriously and that things would really get going. That didn't happen and ended in such a ridiculous finale as it could not have been written worse and more boring. Are you kidding me\nCongratulations David, you managed to make the worst Halloween movie ever and make a legend laugh out loud.I wonder how it can happen that the audience is expected to do something like that.Where were the countless eyes that could have prevented this story from being even remotely considered or a film like this from being unleashed on fans and cinemas? Why? I can't believe and I'm terrified that this person was assigned to do the remake of The Exorcist.In summary: a ridiculous story, bad actors, dialogues from hell, disfigurement of a legend of the cinema world, miserable writing, 0 percent fan service and the urge to leave the hall after 30 minutes. There was no one in the screening who remotely liked the film. 100 disappointed faces when the light went on. Shame on your head blumhouse, David Gordon Green, even Carpenter for allowing this to happen.",

            "content": "While I am not a massive Halloween fan even to me this episode feels like an unsatisfying resolution to the franchise.In terms of how this stacks up to the latest trilogy it has more story than the second but certainly is nowhere near as good as the first. For some reason franchises are seemingly ruined by trying to be too clever or \"meta\" as the current lingo goes or they try to shoehorn identity politics into the mix just to make point. Meanwhile both cinemas are closing and people are cancelling streaming platform memberships in droves.While Season Of The Witch was a standalone, this too doesn't quite fit into the franchise properly, basically because the majority of the movie isn't about MM. Its almost as if the character who takes up most of the screen time is being teased as a successor to MM. However that is simply not what people paid to see. After so many movies at least an hour should have been dedicated to a final showdown. Instead what we get is simply an endnote which didn't seem to clock in at even a quarter of the movie. The final scenes were also a huge disappointment, there is an odd narrative about evil etc which is mentioned throughout the movie, which nobody really cares about. As mentioned prior its part of some odd movement in Hollywood which is trying to over analyse movie themes, that is maybe interesting to a film student pushing some social theory, however this is a slasher movie. Nobody wants to hear philosophical musings on the why MM does what he does or why he exists. To do so undermines the entire mythology the franchise is built upon. Another current trend for horror movies is the Stranger Things effect. This appears at times like a bad episode of Things with the retro style synths. Its bizarre when a franchise that influenced Stranger Things appears to be copying something it influenced.As a stand alone movie its simply average, like the previous outing there is very little tension or scares. Its mainly people you don't care about behaving in ways that make you not care about them while some of them get killed in not very creative ways. But as a franchise ender its terrible. Halloween ended, and not many people were impressed.",

The town now hates him, he's picked on by high school kids, etc.Randomly he ends up in a sewer where Michael has been for the past 4 years and chokes him and I guess he becomes possessed or snaps because he starts killing everyone that's been mean to him.Meanwhile, Michael's first appearance in the movie is at the 45 min mark, for about 10 seconds when he was choking Corey. Corey I guess becomes an \"errand boy\" at first and brings someone to the sewer for Michael to kill and after that he wants to do it himself and goes on the rampage mentioned before.Corey goes to kill Jamie Lee Curtis and she somehow knows he's snapped and shoots him. He beats her to the punch in terms of \"dying\" and stabs himself to die. He doesn't quite die and Michael randomly shows up and kills his \"apprentice\" himself, final battle with JLC, end movie.Absolute waste and it's clear the writers ran out of ideas on this one.",

It does not have ANY of the nostalgia of the type of characters and story that SHOULD happen. Why move away from the formula that worked and why not give it that clear, clean, zenith finality? Sure, there were some planted forms of sentimental woven in but the entire movie just seems irrelevant--- with \"some\" good dialogue and attempts.

I can accept inconsistency but not when you've made a big deal setting it up in the previous film just to then ignore it.Also he's psychic now too I guess and can turn people evil? Not a terrible concept but, you spent 30 seconds setting it up half way through the third movie in your trilogy.

This of course after expressly emphasizing on multiple occasions she could not achieve that. During the audience's time jump; the character Laurie has somehow resolved her grief and anger over her daughter's brutal murder. Just four years ago after a lifetime of PTSD and trauma no less? It's just unbelievable wherever the film goes after is pointless. Everything feels out of character. The best that can be said about H. E. in my opinion is the title sequence which shows morphing pumpkin carvings; symbolizing evil will always change yet stay the same. (RLM touches on it briefly). It's profound and inadvertently pretentious but is hands down the best part of this horrendous attempt at a HALLOWEEN installment. This film feels very much like it's own film with sparse threads of the previous installment sparsely dispersed throughout.

The storyline on the other hand, is arguably some of the worst imaginable for a movie that is meant to close a story that has spanned over 40 years.The main character and plot of the movie has little if anything to do with Michael Myers.

I have no idea what conversations went on behind the scenes here but do not think I have ever seen so much squandered potential. Despite having the reins of the one of the most popular horror franchises, and despite getting its legacy protagonist back (for a trilogy!), and despite starting strong with a solid sequel in 2018, somehow they managed to still ruin it.That is almost an impressive accomplishment. Somehow they managed to introduce multiple new elements to the Michael Myers mythos while explaining nothing and leaving everything unresolved and half-baked. Somehow they managed to make Laurie and Michael side characters in their own franchise. And somehow they managed to build Michael up as an unstoppable force only to have him die ignominiously in this last movie.Bravo...Seriously, though, it is like they could not decide what story they wanted to tell. In Kills, they established that something was going on with Michael's bedroom window, but then they had the Myers' house torn down between movies and never returned to that topic. But then, in this film, Michael can kind of mind control (?) people with tragic pasts and turn them into killers too. But then we get no explanation of how he did that or why he only ever used that power one time.I honestly think Michael works best as an enigma, so I was actually hoping they would not answer a bunch of questions about him. But, still, if you are going to introduce all these elements, you should probably put some thought into them so there is payoff at the end of your trilogy. Instead, what we got is a confused mess of three films with only the barest semblance of a unifying plot.Frankly, this trilogy clearly had no idea what it wanted to be. So, instead of one cohesive story, we got three different stories: the first a solid follow up to the classic original, the second a confused and poorly shot political statement out of place for the material, and the third...I am not sure, the writers' expression of their disdain for the source material?Whatever the case may be, can we please keep David Gordon Green away from The Exorcist before he decides his own undeveloped ideas are somehow better than all the source material of that franchise too?",

Michael Myers is basically a cameo appearance in his own movie. Wtf? Then, they introduce this new character in Corey, who is supposed to be Michael's successor (or at least he thinks he is), and they make the entire movie about him, only to have him killed in the final act.Allison's character changed for the worse. They try to justify her actions as a result of trauma, but the problem is she does not convey that at all. And it's not her being a bad actress, it's just bad writing. They tried to do so much in just one movie, and they completely forgot about the most important thing: Michael and Laurie. People want to see Michael. He IS the boogeyman. And people want to see the boogeyman's nemesis.Jamie Lee is amazing, as usual. Her performance is the best thing about the film. But her character is diminished by bad writing and every subplot going in different directions without being able to satisfactorily come together.The confrontation between Michael and Laurie, which is what us fans wanted to see, lasts only a few minutes and it's so underwhelming you are left saying to yourself \"what!? This is it!?\" Personally, I never understood what they intended with Michael in these films. There are instances in which he's not human, as he endures things humans could not (e.g. The mob scene in Halloween Kills). But then in this movie they go with this whole \"he's old and fragile\" idea. They misunderstood the character entirely. Michael is pure evil. That's it. That's what makes him terrifying. Trying to humanize him is ridiculous, and that's one of the reasons this movie fails.This was not a Halloween movie. This was a failed attempt at \"something new\", which they disregarded themselves by killing the Michael wannabe. It's a mess of a film. Michael, Laurie and the fans deserved so much more.",

The success sparked the green light for a sequel, but alas that sequel was split into two films. Halloween Kills; a serious case of sequelitis. Where plot, and characters went out the window in favor of bloodshed, and brutality. A fun slasher romp for sure, but a weak sequel to an overall fantastic reboot/requel. That film was decent, and was at the very least, memorable.Now here we are!Halloween Ends.... *queue dramatic music*This film is not bad, but it is most certainly not good either. It follows in much the same vein as Kills minus the carnage candy that made that film fun to watch. Ends feels like two disconnected scripts smashed together, and the main marketed premise of \"Laurie Strode vs. Michael Myers: the Final Battle\" is only relevant to the last 15 minutes. Making it seem like less of a franchise cornerstone, and more of a footnote. The real premise is....!!!LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!4 years after Kills, Laurie and Allyson live together, and this new character; Corey, starts dating Allyson, and he's a bit off. Laurie sees the same thing she saw in Myers in him, and thus shenanigans ensue. The main problem is that Corey is essentially the lead of the film. For what reason? No idea. A third film in an established trilogy should not introduce a new main character for zero logical reason, and sadly, it all feels pointless by the end of the film.Halloween Ends is a wimper of an ending to this Halloween timeline, and is a sad case of wasted potential. Myers should never take this huge of a backseat in his own series, and you should never introduce a new main character in the final film of a trilogy.

The music and bike rides with Laurie and Corey are simply a misplacement into this supposed-to-be-horror movie, and I really had to push back considerably the urge to leave my chair and go out into the lobby to wait the movie out had it not been for my friend who was accompanying me in that particular showing.

I liked how Laurie is actually trying to put her life back together after all the years of survivors guilt and grief. I loved how it shows that people will not let you try to move on and try and make a life. They just are always trying to throw it in your face, just like real life.

But there's something different this time...This is in part exploring trauma, like the first two of this trilogy. David Gordon Green continues to demonstrate a lot of ambition. This is in fact the 14th in the series, If you count all of the different timelines. That's more than even Friday the 13th, which has 11, or 12 if you count the crossover. And for so long, for most of these movies, they kept making them immensely similar to one another. This is a very different movie from what a lot expected. I'm sorry to see so many unhappy about that - and I do want to clarify that not all of them are rejecting it out of hand. One big issue with this is that it introduces a new main character, who could easily have been introduced and gotten some screen time and development in the 2018 entry, which would make this significantly less rushed. This provides closure, and gives us some of what we knew had to be in this, the last Jamie Lee Curtis, the original Final Girl, will appear in.This features a lot of graphic bloody violence and gore, strong language, and some sexual references. I recommend this to any fan of horror movies who enjoys having their expectations subverted. You don't even need prior knowledge of the series. It brings you up to speed at the start. 8/10.",

            "content": "One of the problems in today's discourse - on anything, be it politics, pop culture or even what the best tasting fast food might be - is mired in the fact that not only does everyone have an opinion, but everyone now has a way to broadcast that opinion. So for the next few weeks, you're going to see a wide variety of opinions on this movie, whether it's from people who are assured that it's the worst movie in the series - if not the worst movie ever, if you believe some people - to the best sequel to the series and a film that takes \"big swings\" to actually make a surprising entry in a series of films that has already hit 13 with this new release.Watching this movie last night and then reading the social media discourse that resulted, I was left with several questions:Is different better?Is this arguably a good movie?Building on that, is this a good Halloween movie?Has anyone working on this movie - with the obvious people like those who were in the actual movie - ever seen the first Halloween?Have they ever seen a movie before?Is it a Halloween movie when Michael Myers basically has a cameo and that's it? I mean, the only movie in the series he's in less of is Halloween 3: Season of the Witch.Speaking of that movie, I am old enough to remember just how upset people were when it came out. Sure, it's been critically reevaluated - something that others feel will happen someday with this movie - but at the time, it was beyond hated.There are some that say that this movie will be much like the third installment, one that people will come around to liking, an acquired taste that eventually people will discover that they really do like.The problem is that that takes us back to the argument that I started three hundred words ago: nobody changes their mind any longer. No one argues a position. That's because positions are predetermined and no one debates. They just soapbox and refuse to listen to anyone from any other side.Most critically: Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is a flawed film, but is an entertaining and interesting one.Halloween Ends is not.It's a movie made by five writers, all of whom came to the first story session with their own ideas of what the story would be about, then got into a fight and their mothers had to be called in, who told them that they were all special but they needed to learn an important lesson in working together by trying to get all of their ideas to work in one idea.Here are the many movies that make up Halloween Ends:The town of Haddonfield has been haunted by the murders that have happened there over the years and as a result, people have started killing one another and themselves. This idea stops after the montage that introduces it.Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) accidentally kills a kid he's babysitting and stays within his small town, dealing with the anger and resentment of the people who live there. He finds love - doomed, tragic love - with someone who might understand his pain, Allyson Nelson (Andi Matichak), who survived the death of her parents at the hands of Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle).After stating that the sequels were all horrible movies, a team of filmmakers take a whole bunch of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and have Michael Myers/The Shape (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle) hiding out in a storm sewer along with some homeless folks, not to mention the black convertible that comes directly from that movie. Despite never being related to Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), he still recovers and hunts her down, even though she has moved to a new house that is not his childhood home, nor is it near the magical window that was suggested to be why he killed in the last movie.An evil radio tower has beamed the messages that has caused Michael Myers/The Shape (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle) to be a killer for forty years begins to influence a teenager who hangs out at the radio station, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell), and he takes on the powers and abilities of the killer. According to leaked scripts, this was actually where the movie really was going, as the radio tower was added to Halloween Kills via CGI and spoken about in the commentary track as integral to the mythology of Haddonfield. Supposedly, this movie was going to have Michael killed by being impaled on the tower twenty minutes into the movie and his powers going into Corey.A confused young man named Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) is unsure of his sexuality and expresses his uncertainty through violence. Despite a potential relationship with Allyson Nelson (Andi Matichak), he keeps heading to the cruise spot on town, bringing other men to watch Michael Myers/The Shape (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle) have their way with them, then bringing him to the outside world where his impotence keeps him from having sex with a nurse (Michele Dawson), leaving him pawing at a glass window while The Shape easily penetrates her. Also at times it seems that through poor filmmaking that Michael is riding on the back of his motorcycle. Also also he lives with a mother (Joanne Baron) who belittles and slaps him when she isn't kissing him full on the lips and works for his junkyard-owning father (Rick Moose) who just wants to watch Hard Target and is given to saying things like, \"I hope you find love, son.\" PS: When this line was said, I laughed like Max Cady for a full minute. A loud, joyous, braying laugh at one of the absolute worst lines in the history of movies that I have seen, one so poorly placed that it had to be satire if intended and sheer ineptitude if not.A soap opera about the town of Haddonfield, a place that unlike any of the other versions of the story only has one convenience store, one bar and one restaurant. There, everyone will come into conflict with one another:\nMrs. Allen (Candice Rose), the mother of Jeremy, who accidentally died when Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) kicked him off a stairwell while babysitting him. She has never changed her clothes for at least two years, still dressing in the same flapper costume she was wearing that same Halloween. Or worse, she still celebrates Halloween and still wears the same costume that she wore the night her son died and both ideas are both very dark and also very dumb.Mr. Allen (Jack William Marshall) who is trying to forgive Corey for the death of his son and keeps trying to pick him up on the way from work and worries that he has no idea what to say.Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) - note not Lindsay Wallace as the initial credits misspelled - the survivor of the Michael Myers murders when she was a kid, which made her lifelong friends with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) when she isn't working her two jobs: door to door Tarot reader and owner of the only bar in town.Allyson Nelson (Andi Matichak), the survivor of a series of murders that killed her parents, boyfriend and friends, but who now works at Haddonfield Memorial - man, is Fright Rags going to make a million bucks selling those scrubs or what? - and is vying for a promotion that instead goes to a nurse (Michele Dawson) who is sleeping with their boss Dr. Mathis (Michael O'Leary), who has his whole home wired for Alexa and plays \"Tell Me with Your Eyes (Just Be You)\" by Rob Galbraith before he does some horizontal mambo with the much younger redhead nurse. She also might be in love with Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) despite meeting him once yet she shares that she has always had a psychic connection with him. She kind of wants to leave town but feels responsible for her grandmother.Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an older women who has finally moved on from the death of her friends forty years ago and the death of her daughter by embracing therapy, getting sober and working to become a positive influence in the life of her granddaughter Allyson Nelson (Andi Matichak), which includes setting her up with a young man named Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell). She also is in love with Deputy Frank Hawkins (Will Patton), a police officer who has also been impacted by the events of the past and now studies Japanese and yearns to see cherry blossoms. However, she's haunted by people in the town who have not forgiven her, like Sondra (Diva Tyler), who was put in a wheelchair by Michael Myers/The Shape (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle), who also killed her husband when they were just trying to eat cheese, drink wine and fly a drone inside their house.A gang of miscreants led by Terry (Michael Barbieri), whose father does not love him. They are all members of the toughest kids in town, the Haddonfield Marching Band, as we have already learned through all of the now non-canon sequels that the children of Haddonfield are the absolute worst human beings who will remind you that your uncle was the boogeyman and smash your pumpkin. He is joined by Billy (Marteen), who looks like Ninja from Die Antwoord, Stacy (Destiny Mone) and Margo (Joey Harris).WURQ The Verge, is the only radio station in town. It's run by Willy the Kid (Keraun Harris), who not only owns the property but is mean to anyone who stands on its grounds and is given to incite paranoia in the town by talking loudly all day long. He enjoys eating Chinese food and has a secretary who looks like a mail lady.Anyways.All of those movies have been thrown into a film that has basically a Michael Myers cameo, strobing moments that nearly broke my brain, sleepovers in an abandoned house between a meet cute couple where one of them killed a kid, a decent scene in the junkyard between Corey and his tormentors, a supposed extended role for Kyle Richards that lasts as long as Michael is in this movie and a plot that's more Christine than Halloween.",

It's not.Halloween Ends has very little connective tissue and feels like it was made by a whole new team from the prior two. There are elements tossed in this film that literally come out of nowhere and make no sense what so ever. The characters are absolutely weird in this film and the kills, other than one, are very lackluster.The best way I can describe Halloween Ends in one word is frustrating.

This movie is the \"last\" in huge franchise so you can imagine that the franchise has a big fanbase and the final movie is going to be very important to them. As one of those fans I can say this was the worst possible thing the writers and director could have done. Michael Myers and Laurie strode were in maybe 15 minutes of the time hike movie and most of that was just Laurie looking at Alison and Michael stumbling around in a sewer. The entire rest of the 2 hour runtime was taken up with some random guy named Corey slowly turning into a new Michael Myers or something, I'm really not sure what he was doing honestly. I could understand that the filmmakers wanted to do something different after 13 movies of pretty much the same thing but this was not what anyone wanted to see. Michael somehow transfers part of himself into Corey and Corey starts killing people. No explanation to how this is even possible but whatever. About halfway through the movie I thought that Michael would die and Corey would take his place and it would leave on a kind of cliff hanger. I didn't like the idea of a new Michael but I could respect the filmmakers for trying something new. I did not expect for them to just randomly kill Corey at the end of movie. What was the purpose of his character. If he was just going to die then why did we have to watch him decent into evilness for literally the entire film. Then after he dies Michael and Laurie fight for 15 seconds and Laurie wins, the end. This was atrocious. There were so many other problems with this movie, why was Michael in a sewer, why was he so weak after killing all those people in the previous movie and gaining so much power? Why was Alison obsessed with this random guy who killed a kid a few years ago. How is Laurie so calm when she knows Michael is still out there on the loose. You can tell this was rushed and very little thought was put into it. The filmmakers knew what they wanted to do and that's all they focused on and didn't try to resolve anything or even come to a satisfying end. Jamie lee's character deserves to go out in a much better movie. She, as usual, was the best part of the movie and the only reason why I give it a 5 instead of a 1.",

Unlike many, I actually enjoy Kills (extended cut) because it explores the notion of the entire town wanting to finally rid themselves of the evil that is Michael Myers. You have Michael who survives the mob justice, kills Laurie's Daughter, and Laurie leaves the hospital saying she is \"coming for Michael\".Fast forward to Ends and basically every single continuing thread of the story is abandoned. Even though Michael is still alive, no one seems to care anymore. Everyone has moved on, including Laurie, and a new \"boogeyman\" is created to be the main villain. You can literally tell the minute the babysitter is introduced, they are going to become Michael Myers. It's the most ridiculous \"twist\" incorporated into this \"Halloween\" film and it just goes downhill from there.The babysitter's story is what is on full display here as Michael is reduced to an old, haggard man living in a sewer (yet somehow manages to stay fairly clean shaven) that decides he wants to have a sidekick to help get his killing mojo back. The film then introduces mean people in the babysitter's life for the sole purpose of setting up the inevitable kills that will follow. It's so poorly written and such a detour from what SHOULD have been the concluding story arch that makes it one of the oddest films to sit through.If you take away the babysitter's storyline, you have a 20 minute conclusion to the Halloween trilogy. In a nutshell. Michael goes into Hiding for 4 years, Laurie doesn't care and starts writing a book, Michael shows up randomly to kill Laurie, Laurie kills Michael, the end. It's beyond frustrating to see so many ideas from H2018 and Kills dropped to make an unrelated babysitter slasher movie disguised as a trilogy conclusion. I recommend everyone watch this as it's mediocracy has to be seen to be believed. A colossal waste to what was a fairly decent reboot franchise.",

The entire movie is centered around Corey trying to become Michael...and let's face it....no one will ever be Michael Myers. Nearly every kill in the movie comes from Corey. Then, as if things couldn't be any worse, the first 45 minutes of the movie are pretty much just about Corey and Allison falling in love. Since when did the Halloween franchise become a romance novel!? Michael was shown maybe 4 times the entire movie. This was such a disservice to Jamie Lee Curtis for all of her years of hard work and dedication to this franchise. What a pathetic way to end such a nostalgic piece of horror history. Absolutely disgusted!",

I'm totally not kidding.Watch this movie without ANY preconceived notions. About it.David Gordon Greens direction is superb. I wasn't as taken with Halloween 2018 like some people. It was borderline generic in my opinion... but this movie. Wow.The kills are less frequent than in the last movie but the overall violence here is cranked up to an eleven.Jamie Lee Curtis said this would be a decisive Halloween movie and she was right. There are \"purests\" out there who will dislike the change of pace, but for me... it was a welcome departure from the same old formula. The twist in this movie was reminiscent of Halloweens past and I totally enjoyed it.Like the first two movies it was certainly a slow burn and kinda long... but it gave me what I was hoping for and then some.I'm hard to surprise and shock when it comes to horror films.

Michael has returned after being discovered in the sewers and actually kind of has a partner with the character Corey...no joke. The town has turned on Laurie, blaming her for what happened. All comes culminating in the biggest letdown ever written for this franchise and yes I said that.It completely ignores the mythology of Myers, and actually ignores elements of the trilogy it's apart of. The story is disjointed from the start. It's up there with Rob Zombies Halloween 2, it's that hard to follow at times.The kills are few and far between, the scares are non-existent, and the movie moves a snails pace for a majority of it. The movie does look good, Green is great at the cinematography and the lighting and tone does evoke a sense of terror, too bad it doesn't live up to that sense.Also, if you were expecting this great answer to the question surrounding Michael Myers powers and immortality, you are going to be deeply disappointed. I won't give it away, but it definitely doesn't add up for a man that's been shot over 15 times, beaten by a mob, burned and stabbed multiple times in this retconned series to go down so easy.The performances are good. Curtis is magnificent and Andi Matichak is still good. Rohan Campbell is bit off but is tolerable. Of course, James Jude Courtney is still great as Myers.Overall, it looks good but that's it.

First off the gore has been toned way down from the previous film, the body count is lower and overall it just does not make any sense. This films could have had a different title and not shown Michael at all and it may have been better, but the shape himself is only in the film for about a maximum of 15-20 minutes.

Just a typical stalker again going after a woman and town he hasn't seen for 40 yrs. And her upending her life in preparation to trap and kill him when he returns. Again, just a random guy.And to top that off Laurie just leaves him supposedly trapped...without making sure Michael IS DEAD!!Laurie Strode from the original flicks wouldn't have left without Michael in pieces.Number two was the least offensive in this new trilogy and that doesn't say very much.And then there's Halloween Ends...\nThis movie went in so many useless directions, that for the first hour I thought I was watching a terrible YA drama.

Yet she, somehow, not only doesn't take any apparent damage, but also miraculously overpowers him (even though he was just chucking her across the room one handed) and then pins him to the counter top.Then he gets a hand free to choke her out, only for good ole granddaughter to come back and knock his hand off her throat while squealing like a slaughtered pig.Good God.

Unlike the other people on here whining about him being the focus of the movie, I thought it was a good way to introduce a successor. He meets the original and starts down his path of insanity. That works for me.What doesn't work is the whole geriatric Mary Sue and her jolly little screeching sidekick. You could've had both of them and maybe that older buddy of hers and somebody else ganging up on Michael to take him out. That would be more believable.

At the wrong bits. Kills were boring and a few off screen, and it could have ended twenty mins earlier.A real shame, considering how good the first two of this new trilogy was.Shame. Shame. Shame.",

The list could go on.The focus was woefully misplaced in this film, and just made no sense at all. I appreciate what they were trying to do in terms of their messaging but it just did not even remotely work.The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the there was some good gory horror action in the third act, the opening of the movie was shocking, and its always good hearing the Halloween theme music. Other than that this film is a mess that is probably best avoided.",

            "content": "You can't accuse the makers of this new Halloween trilogy of playing it safe. After the crowd pleasing beats of Halloween 2018 and the carnage of last years Halloween Kills things here begin much more sedately, shelving Micheal entirely for the first part of the movie and building up a new antagonist.After the opening scene Halloween Ends picks up four years later then the events of the last two films and focuses on the impact Micheal Myers' (who hasn't been seen since) rampage has had on the town of Hadenfield and its inhabitants. This is a bold change of pace and the idea it sets up is interesting but the movie struggles to pull it off, largely due to lackluster characters. Allyson in particular seems to have become an idiot over the intervening years in order ti help drive the plot forward. Had they spread the developments of the film over a longer time frame rather than a couple of days it might have been more successful. As it is, vague allusions to the nature of evil don't really go anywere and the theme of dealing with trauma is only realised in the most surface of ways. Its all wrapped up with an ending feels too triumphant for the story that has played out over the trilogy.The other problem with Halloween Ends is Micheal Myers himself. While new character Corey gets a fairly satisfying character arc it feels like director David Gordon Green has already wrung everything he wants out of the original slasher. If you are looking for answers to questions like, why can he survive being shot and stabbed dozens of times? What is his obsession with the window in his old house? Why did he disappear for years? You aren't going to find them here. This would have been fine had they made the film a full on passing of the torch story but it feels as if the filmakers felt duty bound to wrap up the Laurie vs Micheal story whether they wanted to or not.A thumbs up for the ambition but lackluster execution makes it a severed thumb.6 children sent tumbling to their death out of 10 babysitters.",

It logically makes sense why he is in the state that he is in. Yet I personally found he is back to being as mysterious as he was in the first film, he's back to being the bogeyman, an embodiment of evil. The way he lures Corey into evil, tempts him to commit more evil acts without even speaking a word to him, the way his legacy is practically a physical presence corrupting the town of Haddonfield, great stuff. I loved Laurie's struggle in this too.The climax is a tad bit weak compared to the other movies in the trilogy, but the ending is satisfying.Perhaps a better name for the movie would have been \"Halloween Legacy\" or something of the sort.",

            "content": "The closing chapter on a decades long horror franchise. It ends with a fizzle. I don't like what David Gordon Green has done to 'Halloween'. Green took our boogeyman and removed everything great about the character; the mystique, the surprises, and the fright. He directed his 'Halloween' trilogy into a completely neutered killer. I had several more thoughts when I wrote my reviews on the other two movies, and here I am laughing and somewhat in disbelief at the newest release. Green has finished a tale through a great lack of intelligence, common sense, and basic emotional caring for movie making. We didn't expect Shakespeare, we didn't expect Jane Austen, and we didn't expect anything Orwellian. But we deserved something cohesive and we deserved (in the very least) something fun to watch.'Halloween Ends' began as a basic story about survivor's grief. It is 4 years later as Laurie Strode and her granddaughter Allyson live together in a new home, still in the same town, but somehow moving on from the trauma of the prior films. Laurie is writing her life story, a memoir, and finding peace although the rest of the Haddonfield community continually blames them for killings perpetrated by Michael Myers. Laurie seems to be in a really good place after losing her daughter and several friends, even though she spent the previous 40 years too afraid to venture outside. Yes, the angry anxiety-ridden woman of the last two films has taking these past 4 years to reflect, work on herself, and heal. The previous 40 years of trauma Laurie lived with is finally at rest... somehow, ever since that same murderer killed her only daughter.'Halloween Ends' began suspiciously, as if, it would continue onward. In 2019 a new babysitter named Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) watches a bratty rich kid, accidentally kills that kid, and it's how the story kicks off. I have no ideas who Corey is, or the family he's sitting for, but here we are. The same night Michael Myers went on his newest killing spree, we're told a horrific event occurred just down the road, and then we skip to 4 years later. \"What was that?\" I asked myself. Corey enters the story as the typical \"he's a good kid\" plot, who is bullied by his peers and most of the town. With the citizens of Haddonfield believing Michael Myers is dead, they've now turned their attention to poor Corey, who has become their new monster.Corey gets Laurie approval to date Allyson. Allyson falls in love, and then Corey meets Michael Myers - who has been hiding out in the sewer since we last saw him four years ago. Michael lets Corey live for some reason, but somehow Myers magically passes his evil to the bullied boy, through the power of eye contact. It was dumb. Wimpy Corey then goes about murdering those who have wronged him, including his tormentors, his overbearing mother, and incredibly loving & thoughtful father. Yeah, it was all over the place. So Laurie Strode who introduced Corey to her granddaughter Allyson, notices something different in the way Corey hides behind bushes and suddenly appears behind her. She's afraid for Allyson who simply can't see that Corey has the same stare as Michael Myers. Corey and Allyson are ready to leave Haddonfield forever, but Corey has to secretly kill a radio station DJ and Allyson's grandmother before they can do that.Laurie watched Allyson leave and is depressed, so she decides to commit suicide with a handgun. Sure. Laurie calls the police and let's them know. We see Corey is in Laurie's house wearing the famous mask as Laurie walks behind a door with the gun to her head and pulls the trigger off screen. Surprise. Laurie knew Corey was in the house the whole time and tricks him just so she can shoot him as he walks into the same room. Corey falls off the balcony in the same way that kid he babysat did. Laurie taunts the dying Corey who then plunges a knife in his own neck. My head really hurts from all of this. Allyson comes home just in time to see Corey dead with her grandmother holding the knife, so she runs off again. So we're all wondering were is Michael Myers? Oh, there he is. Michael comes in and takes his mask back. Corey, who is somehow still alive grabs Michael's arm. Michael breaks Corey's neck as Laurie hides in another room. The police call Allyson and ASK HER ABOUT A STRANGE CALL THEY GOT ABOUT LAURIE GOING TO KILL HERSELF. Allyson returns immediately to forgive her grandmother. Grandma is battling Michael in the kitchen and beats him down with her grandmother strength. Allyson rushes in just in time to break Michael's arm. The police arrive later. They tie Michael to the roof of Allyson's car and parade him through town. The citizens of Haddonfield follow the procession to the junkyard where Corey worked with his very loving and kind father. Michael's body is dumped into a giant metal shredder. The end.I walked away from this movie feeling dumber for having watched it. I came to write a review to warn others to not bother with it, and hopefully save their money. I then noticed that Director David Gordon Green has been granted direction of 'The Exorcist', a much more famous and wonder film than John Carpenter's 'Halloween'. Somebody please prevent this from happening. Do not give this \"director\" a chance to ruin another of my favorite horror movie. Please.",

Not only did they add this clown in the last installment, they did one better and made him the star of the movie. Allyson is a mindless side character, but then again she has been through all three films. Laurie is now a cookie baking grandma who is no longer afraid of Michael Myers, although he's been on the loose for 4 years, but when he was locked up for 40 she lost her mind and became a reclusive survivalist. How does that make any sense? Not only that but Michael was apparently living off of, I don't know, grubs and rats in the sewer. At the end of Kills, they had him magically turn into Iron Man and jump up from near death and Chuck Norris the entire group that had beat him down. But it gest even better, as Corey is beaten up by the ugliest high schoolers in Haddonfield, yet he can overpower Michael Myers. Who in god's name gave this horrid script the green light? This whole trilogy has been one incoherent, inconsistent mess! In the shortest duel in history, Laurie some frigging how easily overpowers the shape and kills him. Then, someone turns on the bat signal and the entire town stops what they're doing and shows up in seconds to help Laurie escort Michael (tied to the roof) to the impound yard to throw him into the scrap grinder. I'm just laughing at this point because it's so so stupid. What a disservice this trilogy (especially Ends) wound up being to Halloween fans.",

Hell yes.But the story is cohesive And there's tons of immortal MM just walking around causing carnage.As most have said, MM does r even show up until after the first hour. The Corey guy and his psych mother are more annoying than anything and I don't know why there was so much focus on him. He isn't cute. His character is boring. And his attachment to the granddaughter is weird and dark.Which is another point about this movie. It was just dark and heavy with no gory payoff. The Corey kid was just weird and uncomfortable to watch. The granddaughter is good only for screaming, looks of disdain, misplaced teen angst in a grown woman, and a complete z character change since HKills. She's a brat who is snarky with Laurie Strode for no reason. It's jarring and frustrating.And Mike....this immortal beast who survived being trapped in a burning house, shot at, stabbed, run over and falling off roofs is now defeated by a grandma and her grandkid? Where's the logic here? This dude killed like 12 firefighters in H2018 but now can't fight a wimpy man-child and is defeated by an elderly woman.The parade to the town dump is cheesy.Adding insult to injury is the random hate people in the town have for Laurie and Corey. In HKills MM killed like 25 people but now the people in town seem to have no memory.And MM living in a sewer just makes no sense. The story could have picked up immediately after H2018 with more tension between him and Laurie and Officer Hawkins. They could have done so much more to drive closure to the story line.Jumping ahead 4 years offers little value. Don't pay for this movie. Stream it. The last 2 movies were great but this travesty dropped a bomb. A large funky bomb....the kind left in a porcelain bowl after Taco Bell.But watch it for yourself.

To my surprise though Mike and Jay said it was great and it piqued my interest enough to give this a chance. I still thought it would likely be pretty bad just like Matrix Resurrections which they also liked.But after seeing Halloween Ends for myself I completely agreed with their assessment and thought it was fantastic. I'm not surprised professional critics didn't like it as the Halloween franchise has never been meant for them. But for fans of the franchise the vitriol against this film is shocking to me. Yes the film was completely mis-advertised and it shouldn't have even been presented as a conclusion to the so called trilogy. It really is its own film and does something completely different which you can only say about Halloween 3 Season of the Witch which I also loved. If all you want is some simple entertainment of Michael killing many people in fun/inventive ways (and really that's what this franchise is about), you will be disappointed.

That is in my humble opinion the main reason why this movie was made, the story can't be the reason - it's lame, it's too slow, it's boring as hell and it's simply just stupid.

But due to an accident, the kid ends up dead: caused by the babysitter. Fast forward and we get to see the psychological trauma he's been through in some weird attempt at creating a new sympathetic killer. And the next hour is his decent into darkness, love with Laurie's granddaughter, and his mentor relationship with Michael, which... makes no sense. A literal hour into the movie, I was checking my phone to see if this clunker was close to finishing. Then the last half hour or so is the typical we've come to expect. Murders, Michael, and the epic conclusion to this 40 year story?! Laurie vs Michael! We saw her burn him to death in 2. We saw her behead him in 7 after an edge of your seat fight. We saw her die at his hand in 8. We saw her hunt him, trap him, and burn him alive in 11. After the mayhem and evil and the ending of 12, this should be the most amazing, over the too, grandiose fight they've ever had! What we got was Laurie being a frightened, drunk old lady who takes Michael down with a fair amount of ease comparatively. This is by far the worst Halloween film and we had one with Busta Rimes for crying out loud. Rob Zombie made one of the most random, incoherent entries in the series with Halloween II, and I'd rather watch that over this. This was a travesty against a 12 film, 40 year franchise.

            "content": "And I thought Halloween Kills was bad. After the previous entry failed to capitalise on the clean slate & sturdy platform that was provided by the 2018 revision, Halloween Ends decides to add insult to injury by taking an even more rogue & ridiculous route than its predecessor and makes for one of the most boring, convoluted & disappointing finales, for the film is neither thrilling nor fun.Directed by David Gordon Green, the story starts on a seemingly promising note but then takes such a wild turn that it becomes ludicrous & laughable. Whether the film will work for you or not depends almost entirely on if you buy its conceit, for it goes into places that can be alienating & frustrating for some, especially if the only thing they came looking for is a last standoff between Strode & Myers.When stepping away from the noise and looking at it from a different vantage point, this sequel trilogy has been more about the effect the evil of Myers had on Haddonfield as a whole and not only Strode. But the creative decisions made to address those ideas are downright bonkers and far from effective. The film makes the cardinal sin of sidelining the franchise icons to focus on a new face who isn't worth investing into.Overall, Halloween Ends does provide a sense of closure to the decades-spanning saga but the road it takes to get there is insulting & infuriating in ways that will provoke strong reactions from the fandom. Apart from John Carpenter's effective score, there is nothing in this instalment that works in its favour. The final showdown surfaces without any build-up & is rather short-lived but our interest in the picture is gone long before we get there.",

Corey is more-or-less the star of the movie (next to Jamie Lee Curtis of course).I really liked this movie. I came into this quite certain that Laurie Strode would finally meet her fate. I've been telling myself the only way to have a \"Halloween Ends\" and for the only way to kill Michael off is for Laurie to die too. I was so sure this was going to happen in this film... does she die or does she survive? I'll leave that for you to find out.I don't know why I'm seeing a lot of 1/10 ratings, these are probably from people who expected too much from the movie. It's 2022 for god sake, did you expect to be taken back to 1978 again?The final showdown between Laurie & Michael was excellent. Pure brilliance.Don't really know what else to say. We can't all be pleased with the final outcome. I'm happy enough that it's ended the way it has. A franchise like Halloween can't go on forever. Lee Curtis has done us proud!",

This could have been a decent film if it just wasn't a Halloween sequel.I've seen every Halloween film and this offends me, watching busta rhymes have a kung fu fight against Myers is better than this and you know why?

            "content": "After a surprisingly good revival/sequel with 2018's Halloween, and its sequel, Halloween Kills - which was a major step down in quality - I wondered how this new trilogy would conclude? Halloween Ends doesn't know what it wants to be. Set years after the events of Halloween Kills, Laurie and her granddaughter are living together and adjusting to life - like the other residents of Haddonfield - without Michael terrorizing them. The film takes a good forty to forty-five minutes before we get to any Michael action, with the bulk of the beginning of the film establishing a new character, Corey. I won't go into spoilers about him, but he is an eventual love interest of Laurie's granddaughter, Allyson. Cory's story is intriguing but feels forced into a movie that's supposed to be about, you know, Halloween. It doesn't help that I found Cory's actor, Rohan Campbell to be not that great of an actor. It could be a combination of the direction and acting? There are some interesting ideas in the film, but Halloween Ends could have done without them. In a way it feels like a fan-film where the filmmakers creatively pitched around ideas, filmed it, and then realized, oh yeah, we have to conclude Laurie and Michael's story. Sadly, despite the cliched tropes viewers have come to expect with the Halloween series, there is really nothing to celebrate. I will however give the film points for trying new things, even if it didn't stick the landing. Who know's when Halloween will get rebooted again? All I know is I'll be there, good or bad.",

I wasn't fortunate enough to see Halloween in theaters because I wasn't born yet (1987) but I envy every one of you who have. Carpenter's 'Halloween' will be ultimately the only nightmare I still have where I feel helpless trying to frantically wake up from. Chucky and Jason appear from time to time but it's as comedic as the theater. Myers is the OG.Queue H2018 which is creative and somewhat feels like Haddonfield, made me smile at least. I prefer H2 and Strode being the sister -- hell I liked the third weird one and 4 onto curse because it's just popcorn in your face fun but it wasn't the original 1 and 2 (even though 2 was more of a gore fest than ambience and terror)Halloween Kills felt like they tried to make H2 again but with social commentary and then Halloween Ends crowns it and it takes away the claustrophobia and realism that the first film had. It felt like the busy world of Richard Scarry and all these come-backs from previous characters didn't do anything but bring back a false sense of nostalgia clouded by hacks who worked on the film. I call them hacks because it seems like they are just cashing in after they gave up being creative. Hollywood is a cesspool afterall.H: Ends, is a 1/2 a movie about a disturbed kid pushed into becoming a serial killer during Halloween. The 2nd half is Michael asking himself, \"Okay, fine, this time I'll ruin the franchise in a pretentious way\" and come in the finale and die like a b****.Sorry folks, parks closed. Halloween H20 is still the masterful ending to the trilogy. It isn't messy, it doesn't have \"tHe MeSsAgE\" and it's fun... which is what it's supposed to be: A resilient lunatic trying to kill his sister and kills people around her along the way.",

Ending was also far fetched - like in previous movies twenty guys couldn't take on M. Myers and in this one ~65 something old lady does? No spoilers, but it didn't make any sense. And this is just bare barrel of why this movie wasn't good.Overall, \"Halloween Ends\" is a terrible example of trilogy conclusion. Bad story, bad writing and bad ending. The only saving grace was J.

            "content": "I really hated \"Halloween Kills\". A dull pointless sequel to a passable reboot. What is really interesting is that I'd imagine people went to this expecting to see another standard slasher film, hopefully with some innovative kills and some jump scares. That \"Halloween Ends\" is not that has, I think, delighted and annoyed in equal measures. Whilst I didn't love it, I'd prefer an interesting failure over a dull retread any day of the week.Four years after Michael (James Jude Courtney) disappeared, the town of Haddonfield is forever altered by the violence and fear he has brought to them. Corey (Rohan Campbell) is an outcast in this town, having been involved in the accidental death of a child years earlier. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) saves him from being bullied and introduces him to her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). Though their relationship is the one good thing in his life, abuse at home and a violent assault push him into the hands of the one man who is as damaged as him.As I say, if you came to see Michael hack up the town one last time, you're mostly going to be disappointed. Focusing on an entirely new character and making him the lead is an interesting way to go and, though not without its missteps, the exploration of the effects of violence is much better done in this film that it was in the second. One such misstep is the age of the kids that beat up Corey. I understand that he's lacking in confidence but he's a foot taller, several stone heavier and looks about ten years older than the bully's ringleader and it jars that he can't fight back. Another misstep is the personality change of Laurie, no longer badass grandmother - instead she's writing a book about her experiences and having coy meetings with Will Patton at the supermarket. It implies she couldn't move on in twenty years, when she knew where Michael was, but could in four when he's out and missing.I think it would be better if Corey, some of his story and the relationship with Allyson had been introduced in the second film. Maybe overlap the last films mob scenes with the meeting of Michael and him here. If she'd just lost her parents, rather than several years ago, it might help sell why she falls for Corey, who is evidentially damaged, rather than just the vague two freaks together idea the film likes so much. What's really unusual, given than these three films were all written by the same writers and it was suggested that they had the structure in place all along, just how disjointed this film feels from the previous two.As it is, it's a film that I don't think is good, by any stretch, but I don't feels as let down by, as plenty of others seem to be.",

First, as I am sure as many lamented it isn't a Halloween movie. Michael is barely in it and when he is it is not Michael Myers or at least the one originally conceived that these two dopes say they revere.Some have said the alternate storyline of Corey was well done. It was not. Setting aside the fact it shouldn't have even been done because after all this is the end of the Original Halloween cannon, this story is lazy and full of holes. I don't believe Corey's descent into madness and Allison's love for him is even less believable.I didn't have high expectations. Halloween 2018 was ok and Kills was dreadful, but at the very least I thought they would attempt to make a Halloween movie. At least I only spent $4.99 for Peacock and didn't have to endure this in a theater.

I do not understand how this movie became our finale. I can't stop thinking about the movie which isn't a bad thing. I didn't dislike the movie, in fact, I had to watch it again because it just left me confused. I have too many questions to be able to point out the discretions I had with the movie. Instead I will say the one thing I liked about the film, and that was the amazing opening scene.Not I'm not sure what it was, but the opening for this movie was unexpected and awesome. I was left thinking about that scene for a while and rewatched it several times just to experience with again. I will not go into detail about what happens because I want everyone to experience it for themselves but my goodness was I engaged during the entire scene. And the twist! Brilliant, in my opinion, and I would love to know who wrote the opener.Other than that, I recommend watching it. Corey was hot, if you're in to that.

            "content": "I thought the series started off great with Halloween 2018. Kills was ok, more of a filler movie if anything but still good. But Ends takes everything the first two have set up and throws it in the garbage. Here's why:First off (Spoilers) there is no Micheal Myers or any real violence/scary scenes for about 2/3 of the movie. I hated the Corey storyline because Michael works alone and doesn't need a \"partner\", let alone a stupid emo kid Like Corey. The Love story between Corey and Allison was also stupid, and is actually not a better love story than Twilight. Allyson is the typical young female idiot that dates the \"bad boy\" because she is so incompetent and mundane in her own life. Their relationship felt like it was written for young adults and emo kids and felt too cliche and redundant.Then there's Michael himself. I get it, he's kind of weak and his health has been declining considering he's been living as a homeless dude for the last four years and from going through all those beatings. But they made to where Micheal looks like he's going to kill over himself at any minute and made him about as weak as Montgomery Burns from the Simpsons. They should've at least made MM go into a coma and wake up from it after several years kinda like in Halloween 4&5 from the 80's, as it would make a lot more sense.In terms of Cinematography the film lacked the Halloween atmosphere the first two in the new trilogy had. In the first two you had trick or treaters and Halloween night felt like a real Halloween night. In this one Haddonfield felt empty and souless. Maybe because of what happened in 78 and 2018 people are afraid to celebrate the holiday but I would think some of the people would've gotten over it several years later. Also the color scheme and cinematography this one had felt boring and uninspired. No hues of blue and oranges like the 78 and the first two movies of the new trilogy had. Even the text in the begging movie had a boring bright blue color to it instead of the traditional bright orange.The final showdown between Laurie and Michael was dumb. Nothing really builds up to it and you don't have the creepy atmosphere that Micheal was stalking Laurie again. They fight for a few minutes before Laurie wins and Michael kills over. I think it would've been better if Michael gives Laurie a mortal wound, goes to attempt to kill Allyson, then have Laurie kill Michael before succumbing to her wounds. Or at least have the police kill Michael finally, or even time killing Michael as old age and declining health finally get the better of him.The last part I hated was when they paraded MM's corpse and just threw him into a garbage disposal. I think IRL the police would've been discreet about Myer's death and he would've more than likely been put in a body bag and taken to the morgue.Yes this movie was stupid. I really had high hopes for the movie when it came out in 2018 and even thought that Kills was ok. But Ends is the worst one in the series and even weaker than the cult or thorn nonsense or Rob Zombie's Halloween II. Hopefully a fan edit or even a fan film will come out and give Micheal Myers more respect and better closure.",

It was not the movie to experiment, it was the movie to give the fans what they had been waiting for for so long. It was disrespectful to the fans, and I cannot imagine how Jamie Lee accepted to become a part os this being in the franchise for such a long time, talking to fans throughout the years, getting messages...

They totally disrespect his character and have him be a whimp the whole movie. In Halloween kills he destroys an entire mob of people at the end, but can't take down a whimpy nerd and a 70 year old woman.. it's just laughable. Took about 50 mins into the movie just to see Michael. This didn't seem like a Halloween movie or a horror movie at all for the first hour.

Bad plot holes. Story focuses on this babysitter who accidentally kills a kid who he's watching. Basically becomes Michael myers and dates Laurie's niece. The part where he goes down to the sewers (which why is Michael in the sewers in the first place?) and gets him to start killing again happened near the end. Michael was only out of the Sewer for maybe 10 mins. My problem here is this; If Halloween kills is about defeating him, which an entire town can't. But, Laurie can in 3 mins which was the fight. It made no sense and honestly a very sloppy put together ending. Very bad concept for this series. It would have worked better as it's own film. Does not deserve to follow the franchise.

This film delivered a very different Halloween experience and I was engaged the entire run time of the film. Never have I seen a \"slasher\" flick show an evolution and de-evolution of a killer.

Think of the spooky cinematography of the first movie. It'll be better than this. I enjoyed the first two in Green's trilogy, but this is a stretch to say it was okay. 4/10 is generous. I was on board for the first 30 min, then it was all about this new character, Corey. It's Corey's story, The Shape and Strode take the backseat. The Shape went from invincible against a group of people in H Kills to easily overpowered in Ends. Minor spoiler early on that Strode (Curtis) has given up having a house with traps and weapons where she can easily defend herself, now living a mostly normal life in an average home in Haddonfield. The fact that she was so skilled and equipped was awesome, and this movie just dropped it for an underwhelming end. The best way to fix this movie is if The Shape killed Corey the second he came face to face with him, then hunted down the strong Strodes on Halloween night but kept eluding capture. The fact that Corey was spared by The Shape doesn't make sense and didn't lead to an interesting other story. Maybe 10 min of the action was fun. Characters made odd choices. There was maybe 50 people in the 250 seat theatre, and at maybe a few points in the movie was there a reaction. Very few scenes with Halloween vibes in making the action feel like it was happening on the holiday. Weak end to the trilogy. Why did they greenlight this weak story into production when there are so many fun, creepy, halloween-y slasher ways the Strodes and neighbours could have come together to trap and end The Shape for good? In horror movies, I'm usually giving out 6+, 5 and 4 rarely, and I'm struggling not to knock my rating of Ends to 3. Missed opportunity for the series.",

            "content": "Ever since the iconic original, the Halloween franchise has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at trying to create a sequel that matches the '78 magic. Retreads, re-imaginings, farces, messes--you name it and it has been tried. At this point, a Halloween film is as much an October tradition as a promise of anything truly remarkable in the cinematic sense. All that being said, \"Halloween Ends\" comes the closest of any sequel to giving viewers a truly original, compelling idea.For a very basic overview, \"Halloween Ends\" sees Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) having finally reconciled her grief after the events of Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills and living with granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). That is, until Allyson's newfound boyfriend--Corey (Rohan Campbell)--enters the picture. While initially welcomed as an outlet for Allyson's rocky past (Corey has an unfortunate backstory of his own), Laurie begins to see troubling signs in Corey that reminder her of her own past's shadowy figure. Speaking of which--a Shape (James Jude Courtney) lurks in Haddonfield's sewers, just waiting for the calendar to flip to October 31.After an uneven 2018 effort and an over-the-top \"Kills\" second chapter, \"Ends\" rounds out the David Gordon Green Halloween trilogy. It does this by primarily focusing on the Corey character and how Haddonfield's inherent evil (as per the Myers terror) manifests in him. These are some interesting musings on the nature of evil, and done in a way that is fascinating for long-time and devoted franchise fans.Here, we get a Michael Myers who is clearly vulnerable--no longer necessarily the unstoppable force he once was--and hardly seen for most of the film's runtime. This is a huge Green gamble, and one that mostly pays off, as Myers' spectre is clearly felt without him needing to be present and churning through body counts. In fact, the ideas here are so interesting and original (at least for this franchise post-'78) that the film's climax is perhaps a bit undersold.The biggest weakness in \"Ends\"? As with a good number of other Blumhouse productions, the overall execution of the interesting themes is often lacking. A lot more could have been done with the Corey/Michael dynamic, and as previously mentioned the expected ending is surprisingly a bit anticlimactic considering the fresh direction most of the narrative takes (a bit of dissonance, in other words). Though perhaps playing to a very specific genre and audience, I feel as if some opportunities were missed to really dig deeper into some of the themes inherent in the picture.Overall, though, I settled on 7/10 stars--the highest ranking I've ever given a Halloween sequel (excepting Rob Zombie's quasi-remake). Though not nailing every character or thematic beat to perfection, \"Halloween Kills\" had the guts to go a very different direction from what I was expecting. Not only that, but the u-turn actually enhanced my liking of the overall experience--no small feat for a franchise often struggling just to stay afloat quality-wise.",

            "content": "It's time, Michael.Okay, who directed the opening - Quentin Tarantino? What's with the Beach Boy's sound wave?Corey, who's looking a little Clark Kent-ish, claims he's not a babysitter. Well then he's an au pair for a rich couple then? (Take that. Can't have it both ways.) So this is the future Michael Myers, eh? He looks more like Bob from the original 'Halloween,' or Jimmy from part 2.'Halloween Ends' title themes in baby blue? Why change a winning formula to a different color? It's like that lady just said, \"What, have, you, done?\"\nBy the looks of it these title pumpkins, multiplying and rejuvenating, are telling a story in their own right like it's the birth of a new era where the egg is hatched and the baton passed on to the new protege.It's safe to say that the town of Haddonfield itself is cursed and now Granny Smith Strode sees herself as a light keeper who oversees the place like some guardian. (She didn't do anything to prevent that lady from hanging herself.)How convenient for the movie that Screech, I mean Corey, just so happens to wear the same coveralls as Michael Myers.It's interesting that Laurie Strode chooses to shop in IGA which was formally known as Franklins and predated the hippie era. What does this all mean? It means she's revealed her true age and reflecting that she's menopausal and in her twilight. Dead giveaway.Hmm, is this 'Halloween' or Miguel and Sam in 'Cobra Kai?'\nI thought we paid to see Michael Myers and not this Degrassi drop out?There's a hidden face in the wall at the 55:30-minute mark. Did you see it? Blink and you'll miss it. Do that again and you're dead meat in a tournament.This is sad that Myers is playing second fiddle to Screech in his own movie. It's almost like he's a coward in this and afraid of something. Old age perhaps? Or knowing he's being replaced by Screech. (In future movies.)Have they taken an element of 'Halloween 5-ply' with the whole wounded Myers being healed by Screech and Myers making him kill for him?I read a review here on Friday and somehow the name Neil Breen was intertwined in their review. Don't ask me how.There was a head stomping kill in the 2018 'Halloween' and it happens again in this which sees Screech wearing Myers mask and it's an exact replica look of Myers from 1981's 'Halloween 2.'I'm sorry, but a hot welder in the mouth and scissors to the tongue won't cut it. Pardon the pun. This is what happens when you make too many sequels and run out of killing method ideas. We're entering absurd 'Halloween 8' storylines with this farfetched garbage.In 2018's 'Halloween' Allyson claimed that Myers spoke to her. They never returned to this. Well, what did he say to her? \"Hurry home to watch the big give away at nine?\"And did Colonel Cochran have anything to do with the making of Michael Myers mask?I swear just before the old lady cuts Myers throat I saw a glimpse of Loomis on his face.So, Myers is easily overpowered and pinned to a dinner table. He folds so meekly. Is this because he took so much damage in 'Halloween Kills?'Myers becomes the property of the people of Haddonfield and he's paraded around like trash with no dignity on the roof of a car. I almost feel sorry for my childhood idol being disrespected in this manner. He's not deer to be butchered, you know! Any sympathy for the devil?Are they selling popcorn at his funeral procession? These rabble-rousers should be ashamed of themselves.Oh man, he's turned into chum bait by heavy machinery. He looks like Slipknot member #8 - The Sandman.But something's not adding up in this scene - nobody's holding up their phones and filming it. Did you notice? That's rare.Myers went out with a whimper. He's also a victim in all of this too, you know? He's a victim of today's women's liberation standards in modern-day cinema where girl power has run rampant these past 10 years.\"New movies lie ahead. Money flows through turnstiles. We decide when a new one comes out. I can no longer star in any more of these Halloween's though. But the truth is, Allyson and Screech can. Evil doesn't die, it changes shape.\"\nYou mean, like Screech being the new Myers for future movies? I can't warm to that kid. He's no Michael Myers.By rights, this movie should have been called 'Michael Myers Ends' not 'Halloween Ends.'\nAnd it's sad that so-called professionals, who went to college, had a hand in the making of this garbage. It's poor storytelling.I'm only giving this 3 out of 10 because 'Halloween 3: Season of The Witch' is the greatest Halloween movie out there.When 'Halloween Ends' is over you don't feel anything. No sense of nothing. Don't say I didn't warn you.RIP Michael Audrey Myers.Audrey?PS I know in which direction, and what angle, they'll take the inevitable next Halloween movie. It goes back to that scene when The Apprentice meets Myers under the tunnel and some form of eye contact exchange takes place. That would be Muck Olla. (Read the Curtis Richards book.) So, Allyson and The Apprentice slept together, and you guessed it, there's Rosmary's Baby. Or Damien. It'll be evil reborn to keep the boogeyman alive and kicking for future generations to watch.Evil never dies, remember?",

The rest of the films are enjoyable, but this one.. I wanted Michael to come through the screen and put me out of my misery. Yes, a bit hyperbolic, but what was this film trying to accomplish? Michael looks like he's in a nursing home with the condition he is in, which diminishes the entire point of his character. On top of that, Myers gets around 10-15 mins of screen time, and a significant portion of that is sharing the spotlight with... Michael Jr? Just a weird way to end a series in my opinion. Jamie Lee was great, and I enjoyed the flashback sequences, but the film lacked any sense of fear and terror that Michael Myers is supposed to strike into you. It was honestly a boring movie. The opening scene was well done, and a bit chilling, but after that is was down hill. This movie will do great at the box office, but I really hope it gets the criticism it deserves.",

            "content": "Starting with a disclaimer: those who go into this movie expecting a showdown of Michael Myers butchering people will be extremely disappointed. He's barely in the movie. And that's my primary gripe with the film. But I'll get to this later.Within this movie's first 20 minutes, it introduces a new character, Corey, and makes him a more complex, compelling character than ANY of the previous films in this corpse of a franchise have managed to pull off in their entire runtimes.He is given a very strong, tragic story arc in which he turns into a monster largely due to how the people of Haddonfield have treated him as a monster due to an accident from years before.Everything depicting Corey's descent into inhuman depravity and the interactions he has with the other main characters in the film is extremely well-handled and sadly compelling.I just really wish that this storyline had been it's own movie, because it pushes the stories of Laurie and Michael to the sidelines and makes them completely bereft of any meaningful narrative weight.The previous two films in this trilogy-while I'd argue they had terrible writing but impressive cinematic violence-built up a story depicting the brutal psychological impact that Michael's evil has had on Haddonfield.This concluding instalment does NOT pay this off at all. It goes a different route by showing how the legacy of widespread fear can manifest itself as a self-fulfilling prophecy.It's intriguing when the movie is focusing on this, but once this arc is over the movie doesn't know how to wrap up because no time has been spent to properly build up Michael and Laurie's conclusions.So the film's final 10 minutes is a limp to the finish line with a very pathetic, anticlimactic conclusion that attempts to give some emotional payoff but comes across as entirely unearned and half-baked at best.As it's own film, Halloween Ends has a lot to offer that's unique and compelling. But as a conclusion to this seemingly-eternal franchise, it misses the mark entirely.At least in this movie the characters aren't complete morons and every kill in the movie actually had a satisfying amount of setup and payoff.Your opinion of this ending will entirely depend on your expectations going into it.",

She finds a kindred spirit in Corey who is constantly being bullied. Her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) falls for him.According to Jamie, this is the end. I make no such assumption myself. It may be the end for her. I've got a feeling that the powers that be will reboot this sometime in the future. As for this iteration, they should end it here before it gets any worst. I do appreciate the attempt to make Michael a thing, a supernatural thing, an external evil thing. My first problem with this film is Rohan Campbell. I understand he's trying to set up a transformation. He's pushing too hard with the jittery nerd turned creepy killer character. I'd rather have a regular guy character. Second, I find the town folks rather problematic. They are forced to be that way for the sake of the story. Finally, I really don't like the gathering of the villagers for the finale.

We get a new character in this named Corey and the film follows his story for most of this movie, when it should have just been about Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, as what happens in this movie defies all logic, and to be honest I'm not going to go into detail as I'm quite sure you've read other reviews which go far more in depth.For me, there is only four Halloween films that are worth watching, the 1978 original, the first sequel in 1981 (Halloween 2), Halloween 4 and Halloween H20 is all you need to watch.

Now Laurie and the gang have to race against time to finish off Mike Myers and the copycat killer Corey before its too late.Overall I got bored watching this film as it didn't focus much on the main charcther himself Mike Myers.

I really enjoyed the previous two movies in this trilogy, but unfortunately this film was a huge letdown. It was massively disappointing and didn't even give us the 'big showdown' we all expected.The cinematography in this film was very dull and there's nothing notable to talk about. A lot of the lighting was poor and there were no interesting colour palettes. Also in terms of visuals, there wasn't much gore in this film which is the one thing I think most people expect from a slasher.The one good thing about this film was the score and sound design, which I found to be rather effective. The sound design provided the film with a level of tension, which is more than can be said for the rest of the film. The score features the iconic Halloween theme, modernised in a cool and refreshing way.My biggest criticism for this film was that it focused mainly on the new character Corey, rather than Michael Myers. Michael felt like a side plot, and not the main villain of the franchise, which made absolutely no sense. He also barely got any kills in this film and his death felt so rushed. Corey's actor did the best he could, but his character wasn't well written and ended up coming across as boring and very surface level.Lastly, the movie has a serious issue with pacing. It was incredibly slow, but then very rushed in other parts of the film. For the most part, the film felt like it was setting up a new villain which is confusing considering this is the last installation of the trilogy, so this all felt so rushed. The climax was super rushed and Michael Myers felt shoehorned in to his own franchise, it just didn't feel like a Halloween movie in the slightest.",

And the first two gave me a ton of unintentional laughs which made them pretty entertaining. I went off on them in my reviews. I have the top review for Halloween Kills if you want to laugh (\"A movie filled with morons\").For me this is the best of the trilogy. It starts off giving me hope with a really great opening scene. I started thinking, \"could this third movie somehow be good after two horrible chapters?\" It wouldn't be the craziest thing I've seen.Then we start getting the eye-brow raising moments. People will say or do something that makes no sense; react in a way that baffles you. But the story setup was so interesting that I was still invested.But just like with the first two, after getting me excited it starts to nosedive. There are so many stupid moments, although not nearly as many laugh-worthy ones as the previous movies. Bad acting, bad dialogue. A bunch of the technical aspects were bad. I couldn't understand some of the dialogue, possibly due to sound mixing. And there are some astonishingly bad writing decisions.I still had some fun, but this is another terrible chapter in a terrible trilogy. Watch Smile instead. It's a different subgenre of horror, but it's soooo good and legit scary (top review on that one too). (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/13/2022)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSA few things that stand out to me.There is a hilarious line that made me laugh so hard, I had to stay quiet so I wouldn't bother people. Allyson is hitting a microwave and yells, \"Can't I be mad? Just let me be mad!\" Not sure if it was the line delivery or just bad dialogue but that's the moment when I lost hope for a good iteration.There are so many awkward character interactions that are impossible to believe. Like after the mom confronts Corey at the bar, he yells at Allyson, \"Where were you?!?!\" Dude, your on a first date, why is this such a betrayal?Or later when they go for a walk, and the first thing Corey says is, \"I killed someone.\" Allyson stops, doesn't ask any questions, holds his hand and the scene is over. Whaaaaaaa????? I think that line may have been added after filming because you couldn't see his face. I think that happened multiple times, and every time the line doesn't make sense.My favorite part of the movie was crazy Corey turning into a killer. I would have loved to see what they could do with that, how they could weave it into the main plot. But nope, no clever writing. They just end it and switch back to normal Michael Myers fighting.Why would you just destroy everything you set up? And even worse, his last line is, \"if I can't have her... (no one can)\" and kills himself. How does killing yourself ensure that no one can? Horrible, horrible writing.How can I forget my favorite line in the movie:Margo: where is Stacy?Billy: she's dead.Margo: so are you.Rofl. Not, \"watch out!!!\" Not, \"he's behind you!!!!\" Nope, let's have a line that makes no logical sense and no one would ever say ever. Ever. Ever. Why? Because it sounds cool?

I went to the cinema to watch this and if I hadn't have paid for recliner seats, I would have left. It was so boring I honestly could have fell asleep. Also the idea that Michael all of a sudden shows remorse because he knows someone is evil or should I say on a \"dark path\" and become killing partners. Hilarious. Just leave old franchises alone fgs!!!",

I could spend an hour trying to come up with an interesting and thought out review but there aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe how much absolute trash this is. I've never been super into the Halloween movies but made a point to watch them every time one came out. Mainly because of the lore of the franchise. As much as they are hated on the Rob Zombie movies are actually probably my favorite other than the original but compared to this pile of steaming excrement they are worthy of an Oscar or two.

Its simply an overkill of the consept called halloween, an overkill i also noted after reviewing the 2019 production.Its a scary and creepy film for the novices of gory hillings and newcomers to the subject of graphical killings that tastes blacker than black, i clap my hands for that, but the plot is incoherent and the story about this killing spree belongs to the cathegory of D;E;F'ers. The use of flashbacks and creating a new monster in the myers figure is just too blatanly told and done.So if you feel the urges for blood and the commercial gain of the halloween consept then have a go, searching the silverscreen theater for a good and decent horror movie then skip this one. The 5 star award from the grumpy old man goes to the utterly gruesome methods of kill, and some of the revenge feeling of the plot. In total its a no recommend unless you feel the urge, and i hope this was the final look at haddonfield illinois on the movies...",

            "content": "The Halloween franchise while being flawed is one of IF NOT my favourite horror franchise ever,I adore the character of Michael myers and the idea of evil incarnate from the original. With these new Blumhouse movies I had high hope as Halloween 2018 was a amazing reintroduction to my favourite horror character and Halloween kills while flawed and with some dumb characters that are 100% not actual people was still enjoyable to me and had some amazing kills,so I was really excited to see this finale and see how Blumhouse finishes this interesting trilogy,but in the end it missed the landingStarting with the positives I liked actually seeing Laurie happy for once it's been so long and I think this is the best Lauries been in any Halloween film even the original the way she was written was really interesting to me,ironically the last 10 minutes is the best lauries been and one of the coolest fight scenes in Halloween,easily in my top 5,finally the music as usual slaps and I did adore the remix of the Halloween theme,also the cinematography looked really nice this time round some shots went hard and I could see me making some of them the background on my laptopNow for the negatives Michael gets mistreated in this movie,he gets pushed around literally he isn't menacing at all this time round while in the last 2 movies the movement the kills the strength shows PERFECTLY how Michael is and how he is truly this immortal shell of evil,now he is a pathetic old man even though it's just been one year and he isn't a threat whatsoever.I also really didn't enjoy Corey,i don't know why Blumhouse decided to make the movie mostly about this new character in the FINAL FILM of their trilogy and even sideline Michael for this new guy who really isn't interesting at all to me,while his kills were cool and it was nice to see a more youthful quick version of evil he's basically just a cosplayer of Michael after he robs his mask for a good 20 minutes,just to get killed at the end.In conclusion halloween ends is a huge disappointment for me,they sideline their main character of Michael and while they did atleast TRY something new with Corey and did make Laurie the best she's been,it's such a disappointment of a finale that just hurt to watch\n3/10 watch it on peacock not worth ur money.",

            "content": "It is disappointing to admit this, but David Gordon Green's version of the Michael Myers/Halloween saga should have probably ended after the release of Halloween 2018. In fact, I would go so far as to say that they should have increased the running time of H-'18 to about 120-130 minutes (from the actual running time of approximately 105 minutes), and then made H-2018 the only sequel in the series...a film that acted as a true continuation of, and a fitting conclusion to the 1978 masterpiece helmed by John Carpenter. Or, perhaps it could have been a 180 minute film, divided into two parts (released in consecutive years)...the second part being a continuation of the events that would have been very different from the existing sequel of Halloween Kills. Instead, we got a film (H-18) with an incredibly strong first half, and a second half that began to fall off the rails a bit. However, it was still a very good film. Then came Kills and Ends. The former was disappointing. The latter was monumentally disappointing. It seems pretty clear that, after H-'18, the filmmakers didn't really know where to go to continue the story. So they added a lot of filler material as justification for making two more films. I won't go into details regarding Kills since this is a review for Ends. However, here are a couple examples: First, Kills seemed redundant in multiple ways. An example would be how Laurie was, in large part, sidelined for much of the movie. And so was Hawkins. But the film keeps returning to both of them as they're laid up in a hospital room, and most of that time all they're doing is...conversing. Yep...that's right. They're talking to each other. While Michael is wreaking havoc all around the town, Laurie and Hawkins, two of the best characters in the film, are, quite literally, on the sidelines. Kills also seemed redundant in that people kept repeating their intentions, over and over (and if you've seen the movie, then you know what I'm talking about), while failing to accomplish said intentions. Needless to say, evil did not die that night. Fast forward to 2022, and we come to the events in Ends. First, a few positives: Ends did have a good beginning, a pretty good conclusion, and the acting was very good. In fact, this is the best performance Jamie Lee Curtis has given in a very long time, and maybe of her entire career. There are only three reasons Ends is worth someone's time. The beginning, the end, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The cinematography was quite good, and most of the actors are definitely giving their all. However, the story and screenplay are where this film falters. And boy, does this film falter. And that brings me to the negatives:Michael has very little screen time in Ends. In fact, I would be surprised if he was in this film for even 10 minutes. And yes, he was only in the original for about 15-17 minutes. But that made sense. John Carpenter knew that it's best to leave the unknown...well, unknown...at least, for as long as possible. But that was the first introduction everyone and anyone had into the cinematic universe of the Halloween films. Plus, H-'78 was Laurie's film. Ends should have been both Laurie and Michael's film. It really wasn't. In fact, the character who is most focused on in Ends is a character no one has ever seen before. It is mind boggling that they would introduce a character of the magnitude of Corey Cunningham in the last film of, what's supposed to be a cohesive series of films.Corey Cunningham as the lead just does not make sense. Especially considering the fact that he doesn't make it to the end. There really isn't enough time for the audience to care about him, and if the point was to have someone carry on as the \"new\" Michael Myers, then why in the world would you kill his character towards the end?The narrative is disjointed. The beginning and the ending are good. But the in-between is a convoluted mess. It just doesn't make sense. The relationship between Allyson and Corey is not even remotely believable. Much of that has to do with a glaring lack of chemistry. And then there are other characters who should have been seen more and should have been more involved, but weren't (i.e. Michael, Hawkins, Lindsey). In fact, speaking of chemistry, the two characters who did have chemistry were Laurie and Hawkins. And yet they have very little screen time together.Missed opportunities, in my opinion. There were multiple, but I'll just focus on one (and yes, I know this is my opinion). For a while now, I, and many others, wanted to see the character of podcaster Aaron Korey again. However, naysayers kept on reminding everyone that there was no way he could have survived his brutal beating at the hands of Michael Myers. Why did people want to see him again? Because his character had depth, and that was impressive, considering he was only in H-'18 for a handful of scenes. For whatever reason, audiences were drawn to his character. Bringing him back for Ends would have provided the opportunity for a deep character study. To see how his opinions have changed about Michael Myers could have been quite compelling. How does he feel now? What does he think about, possibly being the one who resparked Michael's appetite for causing death and destruction? And knowing his lover was killed by the hands of that maniacal monster...does he wish for revenge now? Does he believe in the boogeyman now? Will he join Laurie and others in brining Myers to a final justice? Or will he become the copycat, with a desire to inflict the physical and emotional pain that was inflicted on him? Instead, the character they bring back, that almost everyone believed was dead was the character of Sondra? What the hell? How did she survive her attack? And since she was brought back, why relegate her to what amounts to a minor intriguing, yet fleeting thought? What a wasted opportunity. And to those naysayers who said Aaron couldn't have survived, I say this: if Sondra survived, then Aaron Korey could have survived. One last missed opportunity: In my opinion, Michael should have been alive when he was disposed of in the grinder. Maybe paralyzed but alive.H-Ends, in my opinion, was monumentally disappointing. Now we are at the conclusion of Green and McBride's version of this story, and it seems like their heart and soul was definitely seen in H-'18, but not so much in Kills and Ends. If I'm being honest, it's almost like the attention to detail that was evident in H-'18, was gone by the time Ends was in pre-production. Maybe it was the delay that was caused by the pandemic. After all, originally Kills was supposed to be released in 2020, and Ends in 2021. By the end of last year, David Gordon Green was supposed to be half way home on his continuation/sequel of The Exorcist. It would be quite understandable if distractions multiplied along the way. There is still no excuse for this mess. It almost reminds me of what happened to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. But that epic mess was largely the result of too many cooks in the kitchen, who all had the freedom to go their own way. And while Ends did have 4 screenwriters, the main core of Green and McBride were in this project from the beginning to the end. I guess that's why it's so disappointing. Once again, at the end of one of the most classic cinematic franchises ever, many of us, instead of thinking \"Oh, what an awesome ending,\" are left, instead, thinking \"Oh, what might have been.\" But hey...that's just my opinion.",

Alarm bells started ringing.What transpired was in fact a farce of a film, the perfect example of how best spoil a franchise, the game of thrones effect if you will. Where do I start.Laurie Strode, absolute bad ass in the last 2 films, who's daughter was literally murdered in the last scene of the last film, has become a self healed, writer only 4 years later. Surely she should be on the war path destroying everything in her way.Then there's Corey, the films protagonist, the person who has had no connection with a Halloween film ever, who all of a sudden is front and center of the entire film, until oh wait they killed him off so what was the point. He wasn't even a very good characterIf you were to watch the first 45 minutes or so without seeing the titles or knowing what you were watching, you would think you were watching some kind of romance drama, no horror at all.The middle is a none event, Corey and Michael teaming up after Michael somehow gives Corey evil powers, romance between Corey and Laurie's granddaughter, some crap kills that you don't see all off, more romance and a few good one liners by the only likeable character (Corey's dad)Then there is the end, the death of Corey seemed a strange one, they had built him up to be a new Michael Myers and then he just dies, but will come back to that in a moment. Here it is, The final battle between good and evil, the part that has been 43 years in the making, and it was just nothing, Laurie gets thrown around a lot, then pins Michael down, taking his mask off (don't even show his face), and slitting his throat. Ok grinding him up at the end is a good touch but it was all just a bit crap.Then the end. Laurie has continued her book *yawn* and mentions that evil just changes, there is abother romance bit and then it ends. Wait.....evil changes, why not bring Corey back there (yes even though he was a bad character) and get him to kill Laurie off, giving another director in the future new possibilities because let's face it, there will be more films in the futureHalloween films were built on suspense, then they had to adapt to the times making this trilogy, not in keeping with original themes, but required to get the audience's in, which I can get onboard with. It just seems a shame that the \"END\" seems more like a spin-off.",

However, when a young man ignites a cascade of violence Laurie and her granddaughter are forced to confront evil again.Lapses in logic aside, a handful of writers and director David Gordon Green incorporates some supernatural elements from the disregarded sequels mainly IV through to VI. Even a smudging of the remakes. Those expecting more of Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills (2021) maybe left soured and sorely disappointed. With a lesser kill count, even with a pre-credit babysitter shocker opening scene, it's arguably not as emotionally charged or as graphic as its predecessors. Nevertheless, there's plenty of slasher staple blood and gore setups to satisfy. While it doesn't flow as well as Halloween and Kills, it finally brings closure, even if a little bumpy in places. What is even is throughout is John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies' great music score; along with moody cinematography from Michael Simmonds. Green delivers some solid jump scares, homages and call backs.Kyle Richards' bar person Lindsey Wallace, one of the children Laurie babysat in 1978 appears again, but sadly isn't integral to the plot. The same can be said for Will Patton's Deputy Frank Hawkins. Halloween Kills is very much about Rohan Campbell's character Corey Cunningham and his struggles; along with Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode and granddaughter Allyson played again by Andi Matichak. Even if not focal, James Jude Courtney is once again on form as Michael Myers / The Shape and gets to shine in the last act. That said, while physically the infamous killer has less screentime, Myers shadows looms across the characters in some way or another. Ends is interestingly complex with a web of emotions and fears, more somber and less frantic than its predecessors, unfolding with a creeping finality. Curtis gives a gripping performance and finishes Strode's story. Even if it doesn't expand on Myers past that Halloween Kills did so well.Overall, even though in-keeping with the Halloween franchise; with its change of direction, it's different and it may not go down well with everyone.

It's never going to be the same formula as '79, as this is a series that truly has become an anthology of itself and in a creative way, by folding in on itself like it has, in this Twilight Zone of manners.Fans got lucky that it's also a passion project that features some of the same original cast & creators.I liked this film to close out this newer chapter 40 years in, it felt more grounded in reality than some other sequels, and it dared to tread a different path.Creatively I found this film to be thematically stronger than its two predecessors for showcasing the back end of trauma survival, and giving it an exhale of closure.It will be cool to see how Michael Myers and the Halloween legacy is resurrected to live on in the future, thanks to it's rules of multiverse continuity.",

I suppose we saw enough of that in the last two films.Thankfully there were no cringe moments like in Kills with the mob going after the escaped prisoner.Cheers to Jamie Lee Curtis and let's hope that this truly is the end for this franchise.

            "content": "After a long wait the end of the saga has arrived and the result is quite disappointing. An attempt was made to make a different sequel such as \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\" (1982), although in this story we do have Laurie Strode and Michael Myers, but the central axis revolves around a new character as antagonist. The film would have been better as an original story released under a different title and with no connection to the \"Halloween\" franchise. The character of Laurie Strode has evolved but Michael Myers has remained stagnant, meanwhile the character of Allyson has a drastic change that is not much appreciated and the characters of the officer Frank Hawkins and Lindsey Wallace are totally prescindable in this latest installment (I really hope it's the last). Although the disappointed story also has a remarkable element with the theme of the survival of a beloved heroine, I was afraid that they would make the same unforgivable mistake that they did twenty years ago with \"Halloween: Resurrection\" (2002), I am happy that they did not fall back into that mistake. The technical aspects do not stand out, the cinematography is ordinary, the camera movements do not show anything new and the editing is flat. The filming locations and setting don't quite do the job, at no point do you feel the fall vibes or allure of a Halloween night, and you don't feel like you're in Haddonfield either. The performances deliver, clearly highlighting the always great Jamie Lee Curtis. \"Halloween Ends\" could have been a good movie but it is also appreciated that it is not entirely bad, its greatest success stands out in Curtis. The final verdict is that the perfect trilogy for this saga is and always will be the one made up of \"Halloween\" (1978), \"Halloween II\" (1981) and \"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\" (1998).The end of the saga came and failed to impress.",

            "content": "If I were to sum up Halloween Ends, I'd have no choice but to call it a disappointing conclusion to a (once) promising trilogy. Franchise reboots often suffer from tedium because many of them are focused around reimagining and recreating those iconic showdowns between the protagonist and the antagonist. But, for some unknown reason, the writers decide to introduce a new lead character here, who's recovering from a traumatic manslaughter incident. They then try to forcefit Michael Myers and Laurie Strode into that storyline.Director David Gordon Green should have just stuck to building to that grand finale between Myers and Strode, because after all, we're watching it for them. Almost an hour passes before Michael even shows up, and when he does, he suddenly acts out of character? It felt like the makers pushed themselves into a corner because now you have a purposeless Michael, a purposeless Laurie, and an out-of-place grey-shaded protagonist (turned antagonist) who shares a strange connection with both these characters. Laurie's dialogues too come across as plastic, especially in scenes where she's trying to tell her grand-daughter that the guy she's dating has an ominous streak. Also, they really did Andi Matichak bad. Like, BAAAAAADDD!For what its worth, almost every character shown in the film gets bumped off by Myers (or his untold apprentice), and when you observe the pattern, you're only concerned about how wacky the kills get. I'll give credit where it's due, and that's purely in the gore and special effects department. The Carpenters' musical score at least keeps Myers' scenes exciting. Does the actual showdown deliver? I mean, it's alright I guess. It's reasonably short (when you consider the 3-film build-up) and Laurie's in Rambo mode. I wish it was Laurie that sought out Michael where he was (for a change); that would have also offered a different venue for it than at Laurie's house yet again. As a trilogy concluder, this one's a bummer.The top entries in the franchise still remain JC's 1978 Halloween and DGG's 2018 Halloween.",

In some scenes, the main character and Michael would fight and sometimes it appeared they were killing together. Just a weird and disconnected version of the original story.

Basically, if Resurrection had the action between Michael and Laurie in the first 15-minutes, and then the rest of the movie sucked, then this one was the complete opposite. It took us an hour and a half to get to the part we all wanted to see and paid admission for. Subverting our expectations for the last movie (well, in this timeline anyway) and making this all about Corey as wannabe Michael was a piss poor way to go. Fans want Michael and only Michael to be the creepy, scary, stabby stabby killer we love (and actually be IN THE MOVIE). Not living in a sewer for years, and wounded, only to reactivate again after he looks in the eyes of Corey and \"sees\" what he's been through. What? I don't even know how a screenplay like this can happen..it's like fan fiction. Except fans could probably write something 1,000 times better. What a disconnected bubble this team of \"writers\" were living in.Besides story, the other big problem here is character inconsistency. You mean to tell me that Laurie became a one-woman army and stayed paranoid and on edge for 40 years after a few of her friends died and she survived her attack. But now after 4 years and the brutal murder of her daughter, son-in-law, and Tommy Doyle, she's in a great place, putting up Halloween decorations and baking pies? And yet Michael is still out there? So she's more relaxed and OK with that, as opposed to when he was locked up? WTF?! Allyson turns into a lovesick a-hole and it's gross how fast she falls for this dork, ready to skip town and trash talk her grandmother (if you blame Laurie for your parent's deaths, then why did you move in with her in the first place?). I would have been done with that dude the minute I saw how bad he danced, but I digress. And Lindsey...oh wait, she's barely in the movie. So glad I spent all this time excited to see what they would do with her character, only to give her 3 lines of dialogue and add nothing of value whatsoever.It wasn't scary, was 20-minutes too long, boring, felt disconnected from any of the other movies, and dialogue was clunky - \"I hope you find love\"...my audience laughed and groaned. At least this time, the Michael of this timeline is dead, and they can't pull some lame \"it was a paramedic the whole time\" crap. But how and why would they get the whole town to show up to watch him become ground beef? Why didn't Laurie cut Michael's head off in the kitchen before that? Why didn't she and Hawkins get together years earlier, if she was in such a good place? Why did they build up Corey so much, only for him to be killed off and not the new Michael? So many questions, and just think...they had been given more time because of Covid to come up with a better story. Jamie and the fans deserved better. A sad and shameful end to what could have been an amazing new trilogy.",

In the third act, not just does the grip on us start to get loose but also we feel like to rush to the end and see the conclusion leaving the weary things behind.

Jamie is writing her memoirs and Michael Myers has not been seen in 4 years. Rohan is a teenager that is babysitting a little boy when an accident happens that results in the little boy's death. Rohan is labeled as a killer-it was officially an accident-and receives the towns' scorn and ridicule, kind of like Jamie did with Michael Myers. Allyson plays Jamies' granddaughter that has sympathy for Rohan and starts liking him-you know how girls seem to fall for the bad boys. Will plays the former sheriff that has a hankerin' for Jamie. There are the usual body kills and there is a twist that makes it a little different from the other Halloween movies. Jamie has also stated that this is the final one but I'm sure that there will be more. This one ends as if it was a final movie but as long as they make money, I'm sure that there will be more at some point-kind of like what they did in the Bond series with No Time to Die, Bond will be back.

I liked that it seemed like a new Halloween story.Well that was the first 5 minutes. After that, I couldn't have been more bored. They couldn't decide what to do. When they do remember it's supposed to be a horror film, you don't care and remain bored because the people being killed are all terrible so there's absolutely zero suspense.Then they undo what they seemed to be doing in the beginning. So the kid was possessed half the film by Michael but yet not really because he was actually there still? I don't know what happened. I just know I could have watched an actual David Lynch film and actually been entertained, over watching this knock off and being bored beyond belief. I still can't believe this was a Halloween film.",

            "content": "The first of the reboot series followed on from the 1978 original, ignoring all events of the following sequels, and was very good, and the second film, Kills, was alright, this was the conclusion to the series, directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, The Sitter, Stronger). Basically, on Halloween night in 2019, 21-year-old Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) is babysitting young Jeremy Allen (Jaxon Goldenberg) who wants to stay up to watch The Thing. When Corey insists Jeremy gets ready for bed, the boy pranks him, locking him in the attic. Just as Jeremy's parents come home, Corey is petrified and angered, he kicks the door open, with Jeremy outside, and accidentally knocks the boy over the staircase railing to his death. Corey is accused of intentionally killing Jeremy but is cleared of manslaughter. Three years later, the town of Haddonfield, Illinois is still reeling from the return of the killer Michael Myers (Nick Castle, the original Michael from 1978, and James Jude Courtney). His latest extended killing spree occurred in 2018, 40 years since his original babysitter murders, he has since disappeared, but townspeople are wary he may come back. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, also producing) has recovered from the trauma, she is writing a memoir of her experiences and has bought a house, living with her granddaughter Allyson Nelson (Andi Matichak) who is now a nurse. Meanwhile, Corey is working at a salvage yard owned by his stepfather Ronald (Rick Moose). One day, whilst heading home, he is taunted by high school bullies and injures himself in the process. Laurie sees this happening and helps him, taking him to the doctor's office where Allyson works. Allyson and Corey develop a relationship and later attend a Halloween party. Jeremy's mother (Candice Rose) is at the party, she confronts Corey, and he leaves the party. He runs into the bullies, who throw him off a bridge, leaving him unconscious and dragged away by an unknown figure into a sewage pipe. Corey wakes up and finds Michael Myers, who has been living there for the past four years. Michael holds Corey by the throat and starts to strangle him, but suddenly lets him go and allows him to leave. On the way out, Corey is confronted by a homeless man (Blaque Fowler) who angrily grabs him. During their struggle, Corey takes out a knife previously given to him by Laurie, stabs the vagabond to death and flees. Corey and Allyson go on a dinner date, but Allyson's ex-boyfriend, police officer Doug Mulaney (Jesse C. Boyd), shows up and harasses them both. Corey later lures the cop into the sewer, and he watches with delight as a weakened Michel murders him. Corey decides to become a new boogeyman figure and to take vengeance upon anyone who wronged him and Allyson. Allyson is passed over for a promotion at work, his boss, Dr. Mathis (Michael O'Leary) instead promotes fellow Nurse Deb (Michele Dawson) who he is having an affair with. Corey goes to the doctor's home, he kills the doctor, while Michael has followed Corey and kills the nurse. Allyson is unaware of Corey's actions; she is planning to leave Haddonfield to escape the past trauma. Laurie has become increasingly suspicious of Corey's behaviour and concludes that he is mimicking Michael's behaviour. After finding him sleeping in the spot Jeremy died, Laurie offers to help him on the condition he leaves Allyson alone. But Corey angrily blames Laurie for the events that have occurred in Haddonfield and threatens Allyson, saying if he cannot have her, no one will. On October 31, Corey returns to the sewers, he fights Michael for his mask and takes it. Meanwhile, Laurie and Allyson argue as she plans to leave; Allyson in anger also blames her grandmother for the traumatic events. That night, Corey goes on a rampage, luring the bullies to the salvage yard and brutally murdering them all. In the confusion, Corey's stepfather is also accidentally killed. He then goes on to kill his overbearing mother Joan (Joanne Baron), and DJ Willy the Kid (Keraun Harris) and his receptionist (Diana Prince) at the local radio station. Back at the Strode house, Laurie appears to be preparing to commit suicide, but it is a trick to lure Corey to her. After being shot and falling down the stairs, Corey himself in the neck to frame Laurie for his death shortly before Allyson arrives. Moments later, Michael suddenly arrives to retrieve his mask and kills Corey. During a fight between Laurie and Michael, Laurie pins him to the table by stabbing him in his hands. She stabs him in the chest and neck before removing his mask and slitting his throat. But he tears free one of his hands and strangles her before Allyson arrives and breaks his arm. Laurie slices his wrist, finally killing him. Laurie and Allyson take Michael's body, strapped to a police car, to the salvage yard, with the residents of Haddonfield following in a procession. The body of Michael is finally destroyed in an industrial shredder. Sometime later, Allyson and Laurie have reconciled, and Laurie finishes her memoir. Allyson leaves Haddonfield while Laurie may be rekindling a romance with Deputy Frank Hawkins (Will Patton). It ends with Michael's mask, seen on a study room table with the song \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" by Blue Oyster Club playing. Also starring Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace, Michael Barbieri as Terry, Destiny Mone as Stacy, Joey Harris as Margo, Marteen as Billy, Jack William Marshall as Mr. Allen, Omar Dorsey as Sheriff Barker, Diva Tyler as Sondra Dickerson, and Jibrail Nantambu as Julian Morrisey. Curtis is alright as the original victim older and wiser, while Campbell is interesting if perhaps odd new addition. The opening with the young man accidentally killing a kid is kind of good, but the rest of the film is predictable stuff we've already seen, the subplots are slow and a little dull, and although the kills are gory and often over-the-top, they just don't thrill as much anymore. It tries to put across a story that trauma can create monsters, which doesn't fully work, it does look like Michael Myers is definitely dead now, with his body mashed up, but it is not the most satisfactory conclusion to the saga, I think this really should be the end, a disappointing only just watchable slasher horror.

            "content": "The first movie in the trilogy wich is a sequel to the original Halloween (but also simply named Halloween for some reasons) was honestly a good re-imagining of the timeline, wich already had 2 other timeline, wich is 1-2-4-5-6 and 1-7-8 and thats not counting the Rob Zombie remake and its sequel. It mixed up suspense with some nice kills and was pretty much what i wanted for a new Halloween movie.The second movie ramped up the blood and gore and was a pretty gruesome kill fest. Its story wasn't its best part but serviceable enough to justify the carnage.This third movie for some reason pick up 4 years after the second one. You are made to believe Michael mostly stayed hidden during all this time and only killed a few homeless peoples ocasionally. The finale of the second movie gave him some kind of Supernatural vibe and he didn't seem affected by the beating he got, so i don't get why he would go in hidding and not even come out for 3 halloweens. Anyway.So this movie pretty much open on some surprising scene where a kid is killed but not by Michael, rather in a freak accident. This kinda set up the character of Cory wich pretty much become the main killer of the movie. After having survived an encounter with Michael who for some reason let him live, the movie implying he saw the same evil in Cory's eye than his, Cory kinda get dragged into becoming a psycho because he get bullied by the townsfolk. He even have a few more interaction with Michael even beating him up and stealing his mask, wich felt pretty weird. Altough this \"next gen Michael Myers copycat story\" could work in itself, for some reason the character of Allyson, Laurie's Grand-daughter, kinda act weirdly. They get together and have sex, and eventually because Laurie feel Cory is acting off, she try to cast him away from her daughter, wich somewhat make him go after her.The story of a copycat killer is not terrible and its been done before, it could had work as some kind of middle sequel, or maybe if they had gone all the way with Cory making him litteraly the new Michael Myers, as Michael ain't young at this point. The issue is they don't, instead of a stoic ultra powerfull Michael Myers, you get Cory going around killing peoples only to be wounded badly by Laurie until Michael finally show up and finish the job.You do get a final showdown between Michael and Laurie, but its not even as long or epic as the one from H20. Its more bloody and violent, but pretty short, and ultimately if im fine with the ending, Michael finally being destroyed in a woodchipper or metal crusher or whatever it is, while the town watch, he basically only show up in the third act and barely does anything.The movie takes a while to get going because it has to introduce and develope Cory, and ultimately you kinda get a bait and switch and just keep saying to yourself \"when will Michael show up\".Ultimately its not a terrible movie, but its such a disapointing conclusion in general (the movie as a whole, not the ending per say) to this new timeline. It would had work much better as the second movie, having Michael back in full force for the third. Oh well. Im sure at some point they will once again reboot the franchise or something. Too much money to be made with it.",

            "content": "Laurie fights Michael... Again... but for the most part we get some awful drama sequences between Allyson and Corey due to subpar writing. I'm really let down by this movie. Halloween Kills was terrible in at least a funny way and that campiness saved the movie for me. But Ends tries much too hard and simply underdelivers. Same goes for what I remember of the first in this ''trilogy'' of Halloween.This movie really solidified for me that the whole Laurie Strode focus is a waste of time and just never really worked. There's no surprises left. And for that matter that goes for the kills in this movie too. The gore and ways they go about them are all subpar. Most of them feel cheap besides a few decent ones like the DJ. Practical effects are fine but the blood still has this ''goopy'' look to it I never liked in this trilogy. Also some inconsistently in bleeding and such. Corey gets his hand sliced open by glass but barely bleeds, the blood is already there in the next shot.Directing was chaotic and messy and mostly a copy of previous installments. Like straight up copying, I get what they try to do with this being the ''final'' Halloween movie and all but it came across as cheap and ''done before''. Editing wise there are a few skips that just kind of happen and you're like ''uh okay''.Characters are the weakest link here and especially their dialog writing. Some scenes are just incredible. Allyson's commitment to Corey comes outta nowhere and feels so out of place. Corey gives all the bad signs but Allyson gets no lines to respond. Most of the weird scenes end with a silence where you'd expect a normal human to respond. Like the part where Corey said ''I killed someone'' and literally nothing is said after. Just sloppy.Michael gets his character killed (of which there wasn't much left) and the GENIUSES behind this movie turn him into a hermit that lives in a sewer? Come on you just don't do that to Michael in his last movie.The whole passing on the torch angle felt ham-fisted and weird, it was never really explained why, and it just kind of happened during cuts. Michael apparently can posses people now but also not really. It's never made clear. It's so vague and makes Corey so flat as a character I stopped caring. Corey was unlikable from the start anyways, he never had a moment where the good in him showed and thus would've impacted his transformation, instead we just hear he's a good guy. Also the story is set up again for the next Michael aka Corey to take the reigns. Now I guess he's gonna hunt Allyson or something? Literally going to be the same concept.I miss the anonymity of Michael, and his impact in scenes. They make him old and weak for the story when they need to, and sometimes he isn't. The indecisiveness makes it annoying to watch.Music is here but we know what to expect. It's mostly okay. Never really used well. Acting was fine overall, they tried what they could with the script.If this was the ''real'' final Halloween it would've been a huge letdown. But we all know that reboot is coming sometime soon, it's inevitable.",

It has altered her life to that of a survivalist/ dooms day prepper to protect her family, which made her lose her family. Haddonfield thinks she is crazy until the shape returns then falls into chaos.

Allyson's relationship with her stalker is an example of how Laurie's stalker began.They stripped away the supernatural. Good. Watch parts 3-Resurrection. The society of Thorn became stupid. The pho-Freudian attempt to create back story to every slasher made some into anti heroes, and others goofy.What Halloween has over all slashers is character development for their victims. 1978 gave enough on each victim to allow their deaths resonance.What Halloween 1978, 2018, Kills and Ends does us demonstrate how different individuals and facets of society cope with tragedy. I'd argue that's the point of the series. The tragedy was 1978. Interpersonally by 2018 interpersonally 1978 affected Laurie and her family, altered Haddonfield for the worst, yet the events of End give the opportunity for the community to recover and be communal.Watched as a stand alone is a mistake.

            "content": "Halloween from four years back in 2018 was not really a necessary film. After all we have had countless sequels and knockoffs since the original 1978 film and Halloween wasnt really crying to be rebooted.But it was a surprisingly entertaining reboot that benefitted from good acting, genuine intensity and seeing Laurie Strode as played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a new role as a mother and grandmother still avenging Michael Myers.It was deservedly a box office and critical success one of few reboots that actually worked.Three years later after being delayed over a year from the COVID-19 pandemic came Halloween Kills in 2021 the second film in this rebooted franchise. It was a big step down from its predecessor and despite bad critical reviews I still found it reasonably entertaining. Its biggest flaw was that there was not enough of Laurie Strode but the side stuff with Michael was still interesting enough that things weren't boring. Despite bad reviews and mixed responses from Halloween fans it was still a big box office hit big enough that it made a substantial amount of money as the theater business was still recovering from the previous year of no movies in cinemas due to the pandemic.But everyone knew that wasnt the end and now we have Halloween Ends and this is a huge letdown. Let's hope it does end unless a screenwriter and/or director can come up with a fresh enough idea for a new Halloween film.I wasnt the biggest fan of Halloween Kills but that film is like Citizen Kane and Godfathers 1&2 compared to this near bottom of the barrell third film.Unlike the last installment Jamie Lee Curtis has more to do this time as Laurie. But whereas the script in the first installment of the rebooted trilogy gave her an interesting role, and in the second it was great to be able to see her onscreen when we did, this time around Laurie isnt really anything of a compelling character anymore.This film makes a huge mistake in taking its main character who was likeable and interesting in other films and giving her nothing worthwhile this time around.I wanted more of a showdown between Laurie and Michael and the film is hardly even about that. Rather this last film is more about Laurie's granddaughter Alyson befriending a nerd who was accused of murdering a kid he babysitter for and eventually having a romantic relationship with him. The nerd is basically another version of Michael Myers and by the time we actually see Michael the movies pacing has been so slow from an uninteresting story that I dont really care about the final showdown.By having the movie not be about Laurie and Michael it misses so many opportunities and it's boring because it focuses on other main characters who we didnt even pay our money to see to begin with. We paid to see more of Laurie vs. Michael and we got precious little of it.Curtis and the rest of the cast do try their best but they are sadly ill served by a bad screenplay that really has nothing to do with Halloween except the return of a couple characters and the setting of Haddonfield. But if it weren't for that this would be an entirely different horror film and still a bad one at thatOne of the worst movies of the year for sure Firestarter which came out in May a fellow Universal/Blumhouse release is the only one I place ahead of this on the bad scale.Even Jurassic World: Dominion in comparison was better and it was still pretty bad.Sequels and reboots are hard to do and we are getting more of them because Hollywood is running out of fresh ideas.With the right talent and attention to detail paid sequels and reboots can be done very well. Good examples of this include the first Halloween from four years ago and Top Gun Maverick which I feel is the best film of 2022 so far and they waited 36 years after its predecessor for a new installment. But they also put forth every effort to make a good movie and at least have some connection to and respect for its predecessor.This movie doesnt want to give fans more of what they wanted to see. It might have worked with a better script for a different Halloween franchise but as an entry to a surprisingly entertaining reboot trilogy with the first installment being very good and the second at least being passable this is a huge letdown.Reboots and sequels can work with the right amount of devotion and dedication made but here there just simply wasnt enough.Even if you are die hard Halloween fan save your money and trip to the theater. If you have nothing better to do and you're a die hard series fan and you have Peacock it may be worth a stream but it is definitely not worth admission price.I am sure in spite of all the backlash as was the case with Jurassic World Dominion this is still going to be a big hit but I remain tremendously disappointed and dont feel I am being unreasonable for wanting a better conclusion in an otherwise overall entertaining movie series.",

This installment\ntakes place 4 years after the previous film where Laurie (Curtis) and Allyson (Matichak) are trying to move on with their lives in Haddonfield. Soon, we meet troubled teen, Corey Cunningham (Campbell) who not only meets Allyson, but encounters Michael Myers aka \"The Shape\" (Courtney) who possesses him. Once again, Laurie tries to protect Allyson and herself from evil. Patton returns as Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards returns briefly as Lindsay Wallace and original Michael Myers, Nick Castle makes a quick cameo. This is a somewhat satisfying finale which obviously has a \"Christine\" vibe, but still improves upon the previous film in my opinion.",

            "content": "I went to watch Halloween Ends at the cinema last night, for the four days prior I had been doing my best to avoid reviews and opinions of it on social media etc. However on the grounds that the previous movie \"Halloween Kills\" was disappointing then I hardly had high hopes for this, the final entry. Michael Myers barely appears until 45 minutes in, up to that point the film plays like a romantic drama between young outcast Corey and Allyson, granddaughter of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Corey forms a kind of psychic link with Michael Myers, who is residing in a sewer (so that's how he has spent the last 4 years since Kills!) At first Michael appears weak but he gains strength through Corey's murderous actions, though it has to be sent that even by the end Myers is a shadow of his former killing machine self. Gore fans will have a long wait, there are a few really gory kills, likewise some of the kills are bloodless. In addition to being a combination of drama and horror it is also funny at times, though I don't know if any comedy was intentional. Jamie Lee Curtis was probably the original Scream Queen but I am not so keen on her mature character in these later Halloween films. At 111 minutes in length the film felt too long. I have given Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills (2021) repeat viewings, Halloween Ends is far from terrible but I am not sure that I would be bothered to give it a second chance. I have said it before and I'll say it again, in my opinion the Halloween franchise should have ended with H2O (1998). Ends is a disappointing end, but then is it really the end? Laurie says that evil never dies, it just changes shape, I really hope that that is not a hint at a continuation in one way or another!",

            "content": "Halloween Ends won't be the end. I'm not even sure I believe it's the end of the new reboot trilogy. Anything that can be milked will get milked, never mind any sense of closure or narrative completion the series might have had -- with slasher horror, this is triply true.For what it's worth, the response to Halloween Ends has been interesting; people either think it's one of the best movies of the year or the absolute worst (which, if discussions around Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Matrix: Resurrections have taught me anything, I typically take to mean that the truth lies somewhere in the middle) and they all point at the same thing: the fact that the movie feels like one big prank. Were you eagerly awaiting the showdown between Laurie Strode and Michael \"The Shape\" Myers that this trilogy has been building toward (and that the previous film postponed via its social-commentary tangent)? Well, Halloween Ends may not be what you're craving.People have justified this \"cheekiness\" by appealing to the homage that is implied by the film's opening titles, which (like the last two pictures) still mimic the 1978 intro but now use the credits font of Halloween III: Season of the Witch. As you recall, that's the Halloween sequel that outraged many by not featuring Michael Myers at all, as the original intent was to make an anthology series with a different spooky adventure per movie, bar the two-parter given to Myers.Therefore, since this is the Halloween 3 of the David Gordon Green trilogy, it makes sense, people argue, that it would Subvert Expectations\u2122 and break from the formula to make the tribute complete.The problem? This isn't actually \"Halloween 3\". Not according to the canon we've been told is official. The first entry in the reboot series was a direct sequel to the original 1978 Halloween, and so that one was actually Halloween 2 while Halloween Kills was the new Halloween 3, making this the fourth movie of the canon. Yes, I can admit that it's a bit funny the way it \"trolls\" people -- if that was the intent -- but the film as such is still goofy, inconsistent, and largely unsatisfying.The most divisive element for most viewers has been Corey (Rohan Campbell), a tormented dork who hogs much of the screen time and even gets a love story with Laurie's granddaughter. I, too, am confused as to why this rando's arc is effectively the main plot of this supposed climax of Halloween -- not just the culmination of the previous two films (whose final confrontation has lost its sense of gravity or urgency by the time we see Corey go on his second night-drive date, if not sooner) but a farewell to the entire Myers franchise. (Maybe it's to establish that other Bogeymen may yet emerge from the rot of Haddonfield and that this, as I suspect, isn't actually the finale, but most of the defenses of this plotline come back to the \"It subverted your expectations\" platitude). I think he has his moments, though. There's a super-dramatic scene where he kills a homeless man in front of some graffiti of a penis and a hilarious jumpscare where he just sorta pops out from the hammerspace behind Laurie's back. Just incredible stuff.I will say that Jamie Lee Curtis is impeccable when she does appear, Carpenter's music is still on fire like only Carpenter knows how, there are numerous recurring motifs that are kinda clever, and a few of the deaths are enjoyably gruesome, albeit sometimes clumsily directed. When there are fun kills to behold, I always find something to enjoy.Halloween Ends doesn't rank among the worst franchise movies of the year. It's not as astonishingly lifeless as Jurassic World: Dominion, nor as asinine as Texas Chainsaw Massacre -- which wasn't even good enough to deserve an October release, apparently. You can find it on Peacock for a few more days if you want to see for yourself and don't want to visit a theater. (The fewer people that clog up to lobby as I try to get to my Triangle of Sadness screening the better, anyway.)In any case, I suspect that the worst fate to befall this film is that we'll forget about it (our future selves might ask each other if they ever finished that Halloween reboot thingy that started out so promisingly in 2018).",

            "content": "Uh so I was never really all that big a fan of the Halloween horror movie franchise, or of this latest and hopefully last ever trilogy, but at least the 2018 Halloween and its sequel were consistent with each other and with Michael definitely being more than a man in terms of his resilience and the deadliness of his attacks, well they sure as sugar tossed all that out the window with this winner, ooh it's The dang Last Jedi of Halloween movies for sure! The previous two movies weren't perfect or even all that good to me, but the director did seem like he was making a pretty straightforward and basically entertaining Halloween trilogy, which is why the direction that this one goes in is so very bizarre and jarring, and indeed aggravating! It's just so stupidly unnecessary and weird how it goes off in a lot of different directions that never really feel right and just aren't what you were expecting, in a bad way. Yeah it might be different but that's not everything, it rather brazenly doesn't give the audience what they wanted at all and that's totally not cool in this instance, you do a movie with an oddball plot like this when it's just another standalone Halloween, not in what's supposed to be the big final Halloween movie. As a finale of this trilogy or of the whole series, yeah right, I can only consider it a horrifically convoluted mess of a movie and just very poor. For one thing the focus isn't even really on Michael, he was pretty much given the backseat of his own movie as an elderly man stuck in a stinky old sewer pipe with virtually no supernatural aspects to his character whatsoever, it's all about a rather boring dorky young man who starts out in the story as a very sympathetic character who, after being unfairly labelled as a murderer and relentlessly picked on by the really nasty citizens of Haddonfield as well as a strange encounter with Michael, unleashes his inner evil and becomes a complete monster, and nobody cares because he's so boring! I think they really mishandled his character, a good old redemption arc would have worked for him much better than making him the killer and focus of pretty much the entire movie.. In any case, nobody but nobody came to see the Corey Cunningham Halloween movie. That's where it became awful and fell apart for me, as a lead character and killer I don't like or am interested in Corey, I don't know him, I have no investment in him, and he's definitely no Michael. No complaints about the guy's performance I guess, but this was the wrong movie for it. I can enjoy a little change to an old tired formula but this was just too much to spring on the audience and expect them to just roll with. It felt very contrived and sloppy, like a Halloween flick that didn't know what it wanted to be, one that was being pulled in too many different directions for it to work, and one that falls way short of what it's trying to sell. Michel Myers doesn't even make an appearance until a good forty minutes have passed! And while he and Laurie do have a decent confrontation right at the end in a little teensy kitchen it's a case of too little too late because the rest of the movie isn't really leading up to that moment at all! It's beyond bogged down with the story of an uninteresting character and the direction is never really where it needs to be. Well, since they can magically rewrite and erase whole movies and timelines I think I'll be pretending that the story ended on the satisfying fiery note of part 2 all those years ago. Worst Halloween movie I've ever seen, no real respect for the characters and no real interest in giving this half-assed trilogy any kind of meaningful or satisfying conclusion, what a gigantic disappointment.",

To me these 3 new films starting in 2018 have no connection or resemblance to the films of the 70's and 80's. Those older films will always be superior and that didn't or shouldn't have been the case. I had absolutely no issue with revisiting the franchise and creating something new as along as it was worth it. For example, expanding the story and giving us something different that the original films didn't have. Plus also getting us scared at the cinema again! Sadly all the expectation and potential was wasted with just really lazy, over the top, boring films that actually weren't that frightening whatsoever!We as audience members deserved more, John Carpenter deserved more and also the characters deserved more!I don't have much to say about this film other than it was just as ridiculous as the last entry \"Halloween Kills\". Although I would say this one is slightly worse just because it story is even more stupid and embarrassing. The cast do their best with what they are given, however this film isn't frightening or scary at all. Complete lack of suspense or tension and just flat out bad!30% out of 100 and I'm being generous because I could easily give this a 20% but I think if you are either high or drunk this might not be that terrible!",

Yes, Michael is a side character, but this is Greens intention, he has remade the first three films without us knowing about it.He's Halloween is the night he came home.....\nHalloween Kills.... Laurie is in hospital for the majority of the film, just like Halloween II\nHalloween Ends....focuses on a new narrative and Story, just like Season Of The Witch.Many of you will disagree with me, but I don't really care. It's okay to like a film, and I loved Halloween Ends.Corey is an amazing character, a cross between Michale from The Lost Boys and Jeffery Dahmer, but Green makes you sympathise with his character. Unlike Myers, he was forced into his life by an accident, and his petulant Mother doesn't help his cause either.You can understand why he is doing what he's doing, he's as mad as hell and he's not taking it anymore, to quote Peter Finch.The thing you notice about this film is just how amazing the acting is. Curtis is wonderful as the the survivor, and her suspicions of Corey are pretty sound, even if he does stand like Myers outside of her house all those years ago. But again, even though she has top billing, Curtis is sidelined thanks to the Corey storey.Corey is an amazing character, angry yet vulnerable, terrifying yet terrified, and the film grips you, begging the question, will he stop, or will he become worse.The kills are pretty inventive, my Favourite being the DJs kill, it's as funny as it is grisly, and this relives the tension somewhat. We have little subtle references to the other films, like Corey sitting up in a 90 degree angle, like Myers did in the first film.Myers does seem more paranormal in this one though, and it seems like he is weak when we reconnect with him, but with each kill, he grows stronger and stronger, which is a little stupid, but we had to get him back to strength somehow.The final act depends on how you feel. You never get the feeling that this is the end, after all the producers who have owned this series for. The very begging have stated that they will never kill off Myers, so expect another film in five years. And I'm absolutely fine with that.It's one of the better films of the franchise, even though some peoples are saying it's the poorest entry. Have they never seen the Thorn films, or Resurrection, the one where Busta Rhymes has a Kung Fu fight with Myers?It's a really good end, to a really good trilogy.",

            "content": "LIKES:The Music and Opening: Fans of the series know the theme of the opening and series, and it's back again. The small touch of respect to the series is always welcome for me and I loved the haunting opening that dominates the movie. Eventually, the music gets used to help add that little element so well and I found the subtle device to be fantastic for the horror element.The Acting: No Oscar Winners here, but the movie again shows that you can have good acting in a horror movie and not be a college slasher film. The extras and simple characters are all well, simple, stupid, and work right into the DNA of the movie, so there is nothing I can say to talk that up. So going on to the main cast listed, Courtney is a great \"Shape\" in what he does. This is primarily focusing on just walking around, physical acting, and some impressive stunt work, but that's about it. Andi Matichak is an interesting character, engaging on one level and spooky on another that makes the typical generation of new female horror lead quite well, with edge and attitude, but also another side that balances it out. She plays the role fine, not really wowing with me the emotion control, but she works well. Rohan Campbell gets a shout out, though not top billed, because he probably has the most wide-range character of the bunch. He's fun, and empathetic at first, but soon the movie takes a new direction that adds a little more mystery and fun to the mix to determine what his character is all about. He acts all of this out decently well, only dropping into overacting a bit, but solid work for this role. Then comes Curtis. Who is the star once again. While still not as dodging, killing, fighting as the times before, Curtis is still dominating the fiery spirit of the protagonist with the attitude to match. She's funny, she's engaging, and she carries that role so well to which I found so much enjoyment watching as she handled so many things in the \"quaint\" little town. Curtis really does a great job with the direction of the character and making it her own as she handled all the stuff sent her way that caused trouble. Certainly the best delivery of lines, chemistry, and just the balance of the horror hero, Curtis is the champion of this film for me.The Lessons/Elevation To An Extent Of the Story: The surprise of the movie is how much more engaging a story it is compared to the usual slasher story. I know not to expect much in this department, but Halloween End really tried to \"elevate\" the genre of slasher by integrating a lot more food for thought into the story. The town's mentality is a big part of that, focusing a lot on who they pin the blame towards their troubles. It's a massive poke to the modern day society modalities, but again it works very well in the grand scheme of things and helps try to expand the black and white mindset. Characters get more development, there is more expansion of life, and I really did feel there were some great elements there to raise the bar of a slasher cast having more levels. So that's a solid step.The Cinematography For The Most Part: By far the best part of the movie for me, it's the camera work that does this movie so much justice. Halloween Ends has fantastic visualization for me, focusing so much on establishing the foreboding mood of the genre and series. The shadow work is amazing, both day and night really using darkness to layered levels that at times are fun, times safe, and many times a new level of terror. It helps establish the always on watch point that the movie does, robbing you of the safety, even in the time of day where it's supposed to lower your chances of death. The emotion soon follows in the closeups, the angle many times perfect to capture the gruesomeness of most moments to maximize your carnage, or maybe getting that shot of emotional punch that will crush your spirit. Very artistic for this type of movie, Halloween Ends works well for being shot at the right angles for the most part to capture the chaos of Halloween.DISLIKES:The Plot In General: Again, it's elevated, but that doesn't mean it feels the full Halloween mode that they were going for in this film. Halloween Ends is more of a drama than a horror, and though there are scary elements in it, overall the movie sequel took a different direction. This plot feels like something meant for the main bad guy much earlier on, a story that could have spanned the three movies to help expand the silent killer of Michael. I liked the tale, but the execution feels too forced and offsetting from the usual Halloween tale. And trying to elevate and then sort of pull back at the end, felt a little too off the rails in an attempt to be different. My fellow movie friends said it well, they committed to it and finish it up, but in terms of the traditional side of things, Ends does not do it justice.A Plot Twist That Did Not Get Fully Delivered: Relating back to the story, there is a \"twist\" to the movie they tried to do, perhaps in a way of passing the torch if this was really the end. And like many things I've seen, it does not seem like they had thought it all out, changed their mind, or ran out of time. For me, this twist was mostly making sense, so much of the first half really did a nice job of prepping for the end and being part of that story. Then it quickly rushes to end and gets sloppy for me, dropping into hasty tie ups to get to this symbolic ending they were looking to achieve. So, the twist isn't so much not needed, it just needed to be fully carried out.No Excitement For Nearly 48 minutes: When I say excitement, I either mean intense scenes of surviving the boogeyman, or some set up of emotional turmoil of the character finding something. Halloween Ends' artistic direction has dulled the movie for me, and this included the excitement. Ends works so hard on setting up the meta breaking messages and set up of another type of monster, and that level of world building is appreciated. For a slasher movie though, to hold so much of the momentum gathering and theme people are coming for is practically gone for almost half the movie. Sure, the early aspects are more strategically placed, but it might have been a bit too tame to deliver the chills.Boring: Again, the movie itself is very dull for me, losing the simple survival adventure for a chance to be something more. I appreciate the risks being taken, but once more sacrificing the foundation to an extent to get the new direction can sometimes lead to less entertainment. Halloween just lost so much edge for me from the other films I've seen, losing the stakes, edge, and even emotional investment for much of the film. Fight scenes were predictable, the fodder too obvious, and the story really not playing to what the first film did in this reboot. Some may enjoy this twist, but again, the movie just lacks that vicious edge that Halloween once held.Will Patton Does Very Little: For a man played up in trailers and the staple of the series as well, Patton got the treatment Curtis did in the last film. He pretty much does nothing in this film, a few moments of dialogue and story, but that's about it. Sure, he's not in the state to do stunts or fight the good fight like he was decades ago, but there are plenty of ways to get his character to do more. They just did nothing with him, and though the parts are cute and wholesome, I had expected a little more involvement in piecing what was going on, or helping plan to stop it.The VERDICT:Halloween used to be the series that might have gotten stale, but always delivered the slasher element for cult followers. This new trilogy seems to try something new to make it great, and in ways I appreciate and did enjoy the attempt to give Halloween more sustenance. For me, the story elements are stronger to an extent, with performances, music, and camera work coming together to make that element really strong. It still also has elements of the originals in it, foundations that work at times and are still cult favorites. Yet, the elevation of the movie seemed to get in the way, coming too late in the trilogy to have the full killing blow it wanted. Happening in one movie sort of dulled the knife, and it resulted in decisions that took the horror out of this horror movie. There is more time needed to finesse things out, or even another movie so the twist would have worked to the full advantage. Either that or they should have learned from the second film and gone back more towards the first entry level. I watched this with Peacock, and I believe outside of the theater speakers, most of my money was better towards a home viewing than anything else. My scores for Hallow Ends are:Horror/Thriller: 6.0\nMovie Overall: 4.5-5.0.",

            "content": "Halloween Ends is the finale in this new Halloween trilogy and seemingly the end of the franchise, or at least I really hope so. Because not only is this franchise beyond played out at this point, but this movie is such a pile of nothing that I have no more interest left in seeing any more films. This movie confirmed my feelings that this franchise should have ended for good after Halloween 2018. Heck, going even further, it should have ended after the original Halloween 2. It sucks because I'm a big fan of the franchise. Halloween was the first horror/slasher franchise I ever got into. The first movie is a classic. I really like Halloween 2 & 4. Even Halloween III and Halloween 6 (Producer's Cut) I've come to better appreciate over the years.You know what this new trilogy reminds me of? The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy. It's a trilogy that plays heavily on nostalgia and recycles concepts done before in other Halloween films but done mostly worse. Like the Sequel Trilogy, I really wanted to get behind this new Halloween in the beginning. Like the Force Awakens, when I first saw Halloween 2018 I really liked it. After Resurrection and the Rob Zombie films destroyed the franchise, I was happy to see a new film that wiped the slate clean and end the franchise on a solid note. However, deep down I knew the franchise would not be over, and I guarantee that this film is not the end either.I did not have high expectations going into this film. All I wanted was something on par with Halloween Kills, but they couldn't even give me that. Halloween Kills was really stupid but is also fun if you have the right mindset. It's a good-looking film with some good kills. On a dumb slasher movie level, it can be entertaining. You get plenty of Michael Myers in that film. This film is just a bore. It doesn't even really feel like a Halloween movie until the last twenty minutes. Michael is barely in the movie until the end. There isn't much atmosphere to it. The kills are nothing, except maybe one. Halloween Kills at least had those things going for it.You have this new introduced out of nowhere, and suddenly he's the main character until the end. I'm not a fan of this guy, especially as the lead of the film. Maybe if this character was in the other two movies it might have worked. It might've made this trilogy actually feel like a trilogy. I did not like this guy, or any other character for that matter. In addition to being boring, there wasn't a single character I liked. I didn't even care that much for Laurie in this.I understand what the writers were trying to do with most of this film. They took an idea from Halloween 4 & 5 where Michael's evil is infectious and can infect other people, even forming a link between them. It was just done better in part 4, which was a better movie all around. I would say this film gets close to being as bad as H5. This film is above that slightly due to it having a better ending.I will say, the last fifteen minutes of this film wasn't bad. It actually ended conclusively, with no room for a sequel. Then again, so did the ending of H20, and look how that went. And you just know they're going to reboot this again. They've already done it fur times. Because evil never dies, right? Corporate evil never dies. That's for sure.Also, the ending to this could've easily been the ending to Halloween Kills, and that would've made it a much better movie. The rest of this movie just feels like filler (worse than Kills), so much so that the final confrontation between Michael and Laurie feels so abrupt and not built up to. This should not have been a trilogy. In my opinion, they should have stopped after the 2018 film. I truly hope this is the last one. I'm so tired of this franchise.",

I didn't think too much of Halloween Kills but I did enjoy this ending and I was looking forward to see what the aftermath would look like after all Laurie Strode only screen time in Kills was from the hospital.I'm not sure what they were thinking jumping 4 years and barely acknowledging the death of her daughter this took away the big ending they built in Kills.Moving onto Corey, (spoiler for Ends) they decided to go with character development that shows Corey's fall into evil and then his transformation into the 'new' Michael Myers. What they failed to understand about Michael is that there is no backstory, he was not a troubled boy when he killed his sister. He is and was always pure evil.Less said about the love story running throughout the movie the better.And now we get to Michael, not only did they make Michael look weak and old in mask and out of mask they decided to only give him about 12mins of screen time in the whole film.Can we mention the whole storyline that he's been living in a sewage pipe for 4 years, this was lazy writing and did not make any sense to the storyline and especially when based on how he transcended at the end of Kills!While this is probably the end of the Jamie Lee Curtis Halloween franchise I will look forward to the day that Halloween and Michael returns to the big screen.",

Although being different and unique whether it's for a movie or TV series can be great, I don't think it worked in this case with the plotThere were some nice callbacks and shots from the very original Halloween movie which is still by far the best Halloween movie in the entire franchise and unbeatable which I liked and thought was very cool. Trying to give that this is really the end for the franchiseMost of the time I thought it was a bit boring and lacked suspense or a proper build-up, Michael is barely featured in Ends but that's not my biggest issue with the movie and why I'm not a fan of it. My biggest issue is the entire plot that involved Michael being supernatural again and transferring his evil into the new character and main protagonist, Corey Cunningham who accidentally killed a child he was babysitting at the start of the movie. Together they go on a killing spree before Corey wants to have what Michael has and be all supernatural. Yeah, it was so unbelievable and all over the place which didn't make any senseI think Halloween 2018 should have been a one-and-done deal ending the series as a whole. The plot was perfect, there was legit suspense that put me on the edge of my seat just like in the original Halloween movie and the ending was awesome. There should have been no Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. It was just pointless carrying on and using whatever idea that stuck to the wallBut hey as bad as Halloween Ends is it is definitely not the worst movie in the franchise. That title belongs to both Rob Zombie's Halloween movies and Halloween Resurrection. I might be inclined to watch this movie again in a year or two if not a couple of years as I like to give movies I didn't like the first time a second chance and to see if my view changes on themHonestly, the best part in Ends was the final battle between Michael and Laurie that's it.

It shows how we create the evil in our society and undertones of how our actions create creatures like Michael Myers.I have read many negative reviews about Michael Myers not having as much screen time as he should, but, I would argue he had more in this movie than any other film in the franchise. By understanding how Society creates evil it also answers the question about how society created Michael Myers.I know that when the first movies in this franchise were created that was obviously not the goal nor the message they were after, but, this franchise would not be possible using the same old formula of every other horror movie out there.There are many new horror films lately that are beginning to bring out a much deeper message, and I would argue that this trilogy of the franchise does exactly that from beginning to end, and especially with end.Going into this movie one must take it for the message it's trying to relay. If you're just expecting another typical Halloween franchise slasher film without a cerebral element, you will be very disappointed. If you want some thought and deeper meaning to what you're watching, you'll probably enjoy this movie as much as I did. Either way I highly recommend the entire set of the last three films.",

Since this, the movies have become more ridiculous with Michael surviving because every other human is so incredibly dumb - and when the plot depends on how dumb every other character is for it to carry on, then the story is done.This, however, was a really refreshing end. They were brave to do this, but, despite the mess in the interim years with all the movies that occurred in-between, this movie reversed that. It was in some respects a great tribute to Jamie-Lee Curtis who was the star alongside Michael in these films, and it marked the passage of a lifetime fighting 'the evil inside' and finally putting it to rest.I loved this ending.

Both of the sequels never hit like they should've and the dynamic wasn't there in either of the films. This newest one is somehow even more brooding than the last one. The true pulverizing brilliance of Meyers has been watered down in effectiveness in place of weird new attempts at character development that we just don't need to even see on screen. Some of the time you wonder if they just lost all ideas and bit off more than they could chew for both of the sequels. They clearly lost creative direction and force some things that did not belong in the franchise. Halloween has to end eventually and hopefully once and for all we can all just appreciate what Michael has already brought to us in the form of true terror.

It is almost like they realized hey in Halloween kills we made Michael the unstoppable badass he is known to be but we decided to have all the other main characters be so damn stupid and dry. Now the other main characters did way better in this movie and that made it alright but they kinda forgot the part where hey ugh Michael is a main character too I think? Hell as far as I'm concerned you're better off just watching the OG Halloween and Halloween 2018 and stopping after that. Or the OG Halloween and the OG Halloween 2 which another gripe I have about this timeline is they dropped that movie out of this timeline.

            "content": "So I've watched 'Halloween Ends' 3 times on Peacock so far, and am about to sit down and watch it again...so, long story short, I love it.Why?This film showcases David Gordon Green's most prolific directional efforts. He was able to capture the aesthetic of the Halloween season in Haddonfield; the atmosphere is very creepy, very autumn and very reminiscent of the early entries in the franchise throughout. Not only that, but the way he was able to shift the narrative between Corey, Laurie, Alyson and Michael Myers kept me engaged with each character the whole time.Moving on to the characters and performances, this is my favorite version of Laurie Strode in this trilogy and probably since the original. She comes across as confident, ready to face her fears, not allowing herself to live in the shadow of Michael Myers any longer. This film is set 4 years after the events of 'Halloween Kills' and you can really see the personal growth in Laurie Strode since then.Alyson is brought more center stage here. I always felt like this trilogy was setting her up for bigger things, and this entry explores her character in more depth, including her relationship with Laurie as they continue to grow and heal together, and how she and Corey connect.And that's just it -- this movie almost doesn't feel like a Halloween movie at times. It feels almost like a character study, driven by suspense and even romance -- yes, romance! Not overkill in that department, but the bond between Alyson and Corey was really interesting and drove the movie forward quite a bit. I loved it.Fair warning: we don't see Michael Myers until about 1/3 of the way into the film. Do with that information what you will; it seems to be dividing a lot of hardcore Halloween fans right now, but I think the character exploration of Corey Cunningham and his transformation throughout the film is enough to keep people engaged, and Myers comes on screen at just the right time.The dialogue is markedly improved in this film. No more of the one-liners and all-too-profound stuff from Laurie, no more of the \"evil dies tonight\"....the conversations had by the characters in 'Halloween Ends' feel natural and relatable. Also the attempts at humor are waaaaayyyy scaled back here. The tone of this film is completely serious and tense throughout.So I do wish the final confrontation between Michael and Laurie was longer and better. It's not bad, I'm not upset about It, it's just that it seems too convenient that they were both in the same place at the same time, and by time the fight breaks out, it's fast -- like, whoa okay I guess we're doing this now! The plot jumps there kinda quick. But hey, I can deal with it. The movie has way too many positives to dwell on the negatives.Corey Cunningham's transformation throughout the film, his interactions with Michael and Alyson, Laurie's persona.... Man, it all adds up to such an awesome movie. This was a great way to end this trilogy within the timeline and I can't wait to see what's in store for Michael Myers next. Because keep in mind, 'Halloween Ends' is only the end of this trilogy; not the franchise. \"You can't kill the boogeyman!\"",

The score was incredibly underwhelming. The town of Haddonfield was so obviously a set with a handful of extras and the principle characters.

We've all had evil inside ourselves some decide to let it captivate them and others don't. I thought the script is great I thought the acting was wonderful the only thing that bothered me was having a real housewives in this film, Halloween movies deserve better than that.But it left me with more understanding of what Michael Myers is and will always be.. evil inside.

            "content": "After more than 40 years the franchises is fully closed (or so we hear for now). This turn brought new things to the table, while still holding true to what fans already loved.As the 2018 movie did, and Jamie Lee Curtis and stated, this one more view of mental illness and healing. It also had the build ups and violence that we expect to come from a Halloween movie.I know that some of the people hating on this film actually are having issues with the story of this one. However, I do think it is a very logical place for them to go based on all of the previous films. These are characters that we have loved and feared for many years, some of us for out entire life. ( I say since I am only 30 and remember watching the first Halloween even as a young child).With this revival they have done a lot to match the tone and story of the original films while making it for the modern horror audience, which is a lot of blood and gore lovers. This instalment has the blood for those that only watch horror for that aspect. It also has actual parts that really put you on the edge of your seat and truly leave you wondering while making you feel the fear. It also has an actual in-depth story, not just a basic plot that you can scratch away.I am a connoisseur of horror; movie, books, creepy pasta, ETC.. So I will say for those looking at this if you enjoy horror films you will enjoy this. If what you enjoy from horror is mostly just torture p***, then this might be too involved for you to enjoy it. This is a film where if you don't enjoy the story line and commit to it at least a little bit than you wont get much out of it.Also I want to give a big nod to Jamie Lee Curtis. She is a very talented actress and I have always been a big fan of hers in everything from horror to comedy. But this. I honestly think this is the best performance we have ever seen from her. I was completely rooted in because of her. So thank you for this gift.",

Then when Michael finally does come into the movie he takes a backseat to a character who's entire arc is rushed into the first 30 minutes of this movie. Yes Laurie gets her happy ending and that's nice, but this movie is about the monster and frankly he has never ever seemed so docile.It's a crying shame that this is the last time Jamie Lee Curtis will portray Laurie Strode, as I honestly thought the characters deserved an ending worthy of their legacy in horror movie history.

Worse than Resurrection if you can believe it (and I hated Resurrection). Halloween 2018 was wonderful and reinvigorated the series. It felt like a Halloween film. Halloween Kills...1/2 is good, 1/2 is not so good. But this...wow I'm so disappointed. And I never thought I would say this but Kills was better. Which is really saying something.What I'm so confused and quite frankly baffled by is the character of Corey. What was the point? Why did we spend most of the movie on this character who ends up being killed by Michael Myers after working with him (huh?)? Did we need that melodramatic weird love story between Allyson and Corey? Absolutely not. You're entering Scream's territory (LOVE Scream, making a point) and that has never been what Halloween is about. And what's with EVERYONE in Haddonfield blaming Laurie? She didn't kill anyone. She tried to warn law enforcement that MM would come back and, GASP, he did. That also made no sense. Also, the atmosphere of the film was just plain off. It has a different feel than the rest of the trilogy (the rest of the franchise really) and I didn't like that. John Carpenter should have had a much larger role in this trilogy and if he didn't want to, then in all honesty maybe it shouldn't have been made or they should've just done the film in 2018 and ended it once and for all. Oh, and WHY was this 2 hours? It was 1 1/2 hours of Corey and Allyson and less than a half hour of Laurie and Michael. I'm just really sad that one of my all time favorite horror franchises ended like this.",

Although its predecessor, \"Halloween Kills\", wasn't the best, I felt that it appropriately met my expectations and made for a decent slasher. I had extremely high hopes that director, David Gordon Green, used the negative reviews to create an even better piece in Halloween Ends.Boy was I wrong.Not only has this movie ranked as my least favorite in the franchise, but I am also considering it for worst \"horror\" movie period. In addition to unlikeable characters and a boring plot, Michael Myers was a cameo in his own movie! I almost felt embarrassed watching this disgrace of a Halloween Movie. If somebody told me that a third grader wrote the plot, I wouldn't be surprised. What a letdown.The movie starts off 4 years after the events in Halloween Kills took place. A new character by the name, Corey Cunningham, is introduced. After a babysitting incident went wrong, Cunningham becomes a pariah. After three years in the movie, we see a familiar face- Lauri and her granddaughter Allison, who has an admiration for Corey. After finding Michael Myers in a sewer, Corey develops a bond with him. Infected by Myer's evil, these two go on a killing spree. While this goes on Allison finds herself more in love with Corey.The part where this movie went most wrong was forcing this strange love story. Instead of focusing on the antagonist the audience wants to see, they spend way too much time on this poorly written love-story. It just doesn't make sense to include this in such a conflicting and out-of-the-ordinary genre. Both Corey and Allison are extremely poorly written and acted. I also felt like giving Myers a partner completely went against everything he stands for. He's supposed to a psychotic killer with no feelings. This makes him seem like a comic book superhero.Even with films I dislike, I recommend watching them when they come to a streaming service. With Halloween Ends, I won't even say that. Stay far away from this film, as it's a time-wasting disgrace of a \"Halloween\" movie.",

Rather than following Michaels journey, we're stuck following a melodramatic killer obsessed with Lori's granddaughter Alison for a majority of the movie. Those of us that know Michael, know that he's reclusive, unpredictable, but deadly. We also know that in his killer form, he would NEVER work in cohorts with another person. Especially a teenager boy with girl troubles. Michael would cut him open the second he climbed into the sewer that first time. Years of savagery ruined completely.

In the case of this \"trilogy\" capper, the high-brow aspect is that the film really isn't about Michael Myers (who doesn't make his first appearance until 40 minutes into the film - even then he is a shell of himself), it's primarily about a new character known as Corey Cunningham. Corey is perfectly made for Gordon's trilogy because his life is ruined by an \"accident\" in his early twenties and the entire town essentially bullies him(along with his mother and could care less father) into being a disciple of Michael Myers. In other words, he fits Green's vision for Haddonfield as filled with selfish, small-minded people who ultimately deserve what's coming to them. Anyways, Corey eventually connects with Laurie Strode's family (see the thematic connections?) who are tired of the ostracization of the town as well. My take on this film is basically the same as the two before it - it's unbearably and irredeemably too violent, too filled with hateful and unredeemable characters because far too little of the \"high-brow themes\" actually hit enough to justify the pleasure it gets in its hate. I found this to be a miserable trilogy of films.",

However, David Gordon Green's choice as well as the writers to go with such a random conclusion to the saga of Michael and Laurie didn't work for me. After seeing how Halloween Kills (2021) ended, I was hoping that Michael Myers would be back and stronger and much more terrifying than before. Unfortunately that isn't the case at all with Halloween Ends. In this movie, Michael Myers is barely able to stand on two legs without tumbling over. Michael himself only makes a total of probably 3 kills in this entire movie. Michael Myers' first kill doesn't even happen until like an hour into the movie (which is HIGHLY disappointing as a hardcore Michael Myers fan). I understand what they were trying to do here with the \"Christine\" reference and how evil is passed on to another poor soul. But I just didn't feel like that was the appropriate plot to focus on for the entire first half of this movie when they promoted it as the final showdown between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. Also, about that...the final battle between Michael and Laurie doesn't happen until the final 20 minutes of the film and the fight isn't even that long (it's good and intense but just not long). Finally, after 44 years of being the victim, Laurie Strode finally manages to kill Michael Myers and say goodbye to her boogeyman once and for all. To be honest I liked the actual ending of this movie and how Laurie was the one that got to mutilate Michael's body in the car crusher. But the whole \"Corey being possessed by Michael Myers and becoming his lame sidekick\" wasn't what I wanted for THIS particular finale. I would've understood if they wanted to try this new idea in a rebooted or new timeline, but for the ending to this trilogy it just didn't fit and it was honestly quite a let down. I give this a 5 out of 10 stars.",

Myers living a sewer for four years for whatever bloody reason, who by the way might be on screen for 8 or 9 minutes. It's a mess. It's terrible.There is no tension or suspense as there was in the original 1978 Halloween. There's also no great kills as found in Halloween Kills or Rob Zombie's Halloweens. If you don't have tension, you can at least have great kills and that'll keep the movie afloat. If you don't have great kills, you can make it scary and tense, like Carpenter's version. No Halloween film really has both. But if you have neither, then you have no Halloween movie. This movie has neither. In fact it is excruciatingly boring for long stretches. It was a real chore to get through the opening 45 minutes. I mean nothing happens. Nothing. A boy dies by accident. That's it. The pacing is dreadful.I'm happy this is the last one.

To be honest they made him more human than ever and I can't stand it, I'm surprised they didn't make him talk and sit in a wheelchair. How to ruin something so great and mysterious.The whole idea of showing where he went in to hiding was irrelevant to the whole story.And all the focus on the love between Allyson and Corey felt like a Rushed storyline simply to fill in the blanks. They could have done so much more.I really wished they could have gone much more darker and deeper into the whole story with both Michael Myers and perhaps see a more realistic.. Laurie Strode, especially after her daughter got killed.Would also have been nice to see a much longer haunt scene, of a cat and mouse-game between Myers and Strode. I felt the kitchen scene was too rushed and it all just ended really quick.Suddenly Michael is so easy to kill? Yet the evil fleece within him was just the mask? I doesn't make much sense in this universe that it was just to cut him a few times and than do him over - with a fridge - I mean- now NOW he's trapped? After all this time he's just a man who bleeds out in the end.I've always felt the storyline somewhat tried to go along with that something really evil was always in him or got into him, weather it was something superhuman, dark force he created himself the night he killed his sister Judith at the age of 6 or 7 or that some kind of a demon consumed him and he became what went in. - Either way the ruined it.The only good thing was the ending, how they disposed of him - why they didn't to it earlier \"all tough this would be too realistic for the movies as why he would come back - perhaps a deadbyte\"I'm a huge fan of the original and really liked the 2018 as well.

It huffs and puffs and pretends to be really important and meaningful but it's just a daffodil in the wind. It's neither here nor there.Another sin Ends commits is dividing the main character's importance. I can't remember which one it is -- Friday the 13th 7 or 8 or something? -- but there are other killers other than Jason in that one. Whyyyyy?

Again, forget everything you think you know about MM.

But this is not supposed to be taken literally ... this is meant to be the end of the trilogy ... trilogy of new movies that is. That build from the original movie of course.Jamie Lee Curtis is a national treasure and she and the director find new ways to give her character some edge we may not expect. Just like the twists we may not expect - not all of them I reckon. Unless you have been spoiled by the internet/friends that is.I would say that the very first shocker (big shocker that is) - I could see that coming - or falling for that matter! No pun intended - I think it was obvious that this was going to happen. It says a lot about what myth and stories can do to someone. And an annoying kid too that is ... that being said, I am not saying that what happens in the beginning is deserved (or not).The score, the beginning credits (after that first big shocker) - all taking us back to the original. But all a bit updated ... a bit tweaked! And the tweaks are the ones you have to get on board with. I understand if some are not up for it. I am not saying they are right or wrong. There is no such thing. There is taste and either you like what you are presented or you don't.That being said, even if you do not like what they do with the characters (not just but of course also Michael Myers), you can't fault the movie technically. Also the effects ... just amazing. It is not a \"kill-fest\" like the one before it - but it does have some gruesome and violent scenes. It is a bit more psychological ... and you may feel that some people deserve what they got coming for them ... the movie is a bit twisted like that ... that all being said: it says more about your morals, than the movie itself.I think this is a very worthy entry into the Halloween Cinematic Universe ... and yes that is me telling you that there may be some more timelines/universes to be explored ... with more Michael Myers in them ... talking of: the original Myers has a neat little cameo at a party - showing us his face! Those who know ... know. And I am certain there are way more goodies like that (another one would be the window/bush scene) ... I liked it - very well ... executed (and hence my review ... ends!)",

The first hour and 20 minutes was so depressing because it wasn't even Michael Myers doing the killing, and it really felt like I was watching a different movie than a Halloween movie. I felt like there were elements of trying to be a rom-com which is not a horror movie trope. The movie was entirely too long, and the alternative killer aspect felt desperate.

The kills where good but it took too long to get started. If you care about how Lourie Strode is doing after Halloween Kills than you get to see her happiness for a long time. A long time without any killing in a slasher movie.I know a few people who did not like Halloween Kills but I thought it was great. What Halloween Kills has in common with Halloween ends is both movies tried to think outside of the box to spice things up.

It's like they forgot about him for the majority of the movie. I find it baffling to build up and market this as a \"giant conclusion\" only to have him show up about an hour into the film.I'm still annoyed with the Allyson character. She constantly makes really weird decisions and comes off ignorant and impulsive. I was hoping they would've either redeemed her or killed her off. They did neither.Jamie Lee Curtis is the reason this movie gets 3 stars. She is and always be the saving grace of the H40 trilogy. I enjoyed her final performance as Laurie.

I would be okay with this, as I love cheesy psycho stories, we're it not masquerading as a Halloween film. They didn't learn from Halloween III (which is a film that I do enjoy) that you can't over complicate the franchise, can't do without Michael. The previous film insinuated that Michael would become supernatural, a much smarter bit of writing. This makes the film very unlikable as a new direction and sadly doesn't provide closure either.

I hated Kills and should have known better but it's October and I wanted to believe the tradition of watching Halloween during Halloween still lived. There will be those who love this movie, those who trash it without even seeing it, those who say \"if you don't like it that's because you don't get it and finally those who did see it, do understand it and still do not like it. This might have been fine somewhere else in the timeline but to take Michael's and Laurie's swan song ang devote so much time into cultivating a new character and trying to deliver a message to all of the viewers that evil is bigger than just one man (we know that without a movie telling us so) was just really misplaced in my mind. Still, I tried to talk my way through it and even justify its stupidity in places..... \"ok, well Michael is weak and can't hunt so he needs this kid to bring him victims so he can regain his\"..... BOOM - next scene Michael is standing in Laurie's yard staring at her so there goes that weakness theory. \"Oh, I get it Michael is letting his mask be taken because he is passing the torch to a new generat\"....... WRONG, scene to come later proves he was not ok with the situation and we're back to wondering why he wasn't able to handle this guy when he lifted someone else off of the ground with ease a bit earlier. I don't think any of this really spoils the movie, don't usually put specifics in my reviews but this case merits it in order to critique it. I am not against anyone else loving it though. If this does it for you then good but for me it completely loses the essence of Halloween by (like Kills) trying to deliver some kind of message on the essence of evil and how it is greater than just one man but what I wanted for this was a simple but satisfying ending to a simple slasher executed so well back in 1978! Both Kills and Ends try so hard to explain to us the nature of evil that they lose focus on that simple story which fascinated us all by way of one man who just wouldn't stop coming, couldn't be reasoned with and seemingly had no reason for being the way he was. The flaws in Ends extend beyond just Michael though. The granddaughter becomes completely unlikeable at a certain point in this movie. She sees things for exactly what they are at one point and yet doubles down on the situation she is in anyway. Corey's progression is ridiculously quick to the point where the viewer can no longer believe it. This was so bad I found myself wishing four turtles in a half shell would show up in that sewer and put an end to it all. Halloween 2018 was solid and had a lot of promise but it also had some glaring red flags of possible stupidity to come (evil doctor sub-plot) and Ends and Kills delivered on that in droves!",

This film makes \"Halloween 6 the curse of Michael Myers\" seem like a well planned masterpiece. David has taken everything great from the original Halloween franchise and turned it into an illogical, inconsistent, bubblegum teen drama parody. By \"illogical\", I'm not referring to the supernatural and unexplained parts, This is simple story writing of character arches, character traits, and character continuities. Nothing in this film made sense and was the worst writing.",

Halloween 2018 was ok, had some real clunky and corny dialogue and cliche ridden script but nostalgia helped us along and it was a 5/10 film at best. Then Halloween Kills arrived and to say that was a bad BAD film would be an understatement. Very poor and totally illogical script with the stupidest dialouge put to film. It made no sense whatsoever!? And apart from some fun deaths and the scenes with a young Loomis it was a total disaster that tested and broke many Halloween fans tolerance limits.\"Endless Evil Dies\" Tonight that drove viewers up the wall and caused headaches with the eye rolls it caused. Why were these people so angry about a man that had been locked away for 40 years!? (Remember this continues after the first film) Nonsense logic. Idiotic decisions people made throughout, Strode Family idiocy and Laurie in a Hospital bed throughout. .......so when it came to the END. Expectations were LOW.I went into the film (streamed) trying to forget what a disaster Kills was and give it a chance.The film was more of a drama for the first 50minutes, focused on unlikable, badly written characters and Laurie suddenly deciding she would forget about it and get on with her life and not worry!......er.... OK. Myers still not been found after 4 years.They tried to create a new storyline about the town people still being paranoid etc after Myers went missing yet again, commiting suicide and killings etc and then totally forgot about it and never mentioned it again. Characters randomly and conveniently showed up at the right place just to provide a little plot line help in the bar or supermarket. Hilariously tacked on.Myers is hardly in the film and this is the real insult. He becomes a side character in what was to be the big final showdown between him and Laurie Strode. But they inexplicably dumped that for a weak new storyline about a babysitter suddenly becoming evil because he looked Myers in the eyes once!? What the... ...!!! Wow. Who thought that was a great idea? Were the script writers drunk or high!? Puzzling (and as I said earlier) totally disrespectful to the fans who have followed these two characters since the 70s.The producers, script writers and Director should be ashamed of themselves. Halloween will never be able to rid itself of the stain these last two films have caused. And it's inevitable they will bring it back sometime to squeeze more blood out of poor Michael Myers mythology.Watch it if you must. It really is bad.Halloween is now a joke series.",

I loved how they decided to write a direct sequel to the original Halloween from 78. It went perfectly. Going from that to H. K. just left me baffled and with no desire to see how the trilogy would end.I'm thrilled to say I was wrong. One hour into Halloween Ends I had to smile and be thankful that they swerved the story and found a unique way to end the saga. Obviously it had some issues. I have no insider information, but I have to believe that COVID messed up the plans for this franchise is many ways. I don't believe this was what they always had in mind, but I still liked it.I don't give spoilers but I wanted to try and spread the word to fans of the franchise: Give this movie a chance.

            "content": "Possibly the worst horror sequel I have ever seen, seriously I see four writers? It took four writers to pan out this garbage? Shades of a nightmare on elm street 2 with the whole evil possessed main protagonist working tag team, even Michael has a sidekick it seems. I can appreciate they were trying to create something different, however what I can't appreciate is a script so poorly executed. It's a total mess, it has to be a cohesive unit of writers respecting what came before whilst maintaining grass roots of what made Halloween great in the first place. Unfortunately none of this is it, it feels more like a terrible TV movie left on in the background. Previous incarnations have allowed us to get used to the fact Michael is very much a supernatural being, we've accepted this! Yet what I can't accept is his apprentice getting his throat slit only to then be moving moments after. Most the characters seem to develop so quickly it leaves you thinking they've know each other for years. The relationship for example of Allyson and Corey seems so forced and under developed in a short space of time it is just baffling to say the least. Why is Allyson so fixated on Corey so quickly? It's mind blowing! In a town where everyone is so cautious or paranoid due to years of torture Laurie is at first equally as fast to accept Corey as her granddaughters latest boyfriend as Allyson is. Then on top of that we got a random homeless guy who's main purpose is to be aware of Michael living under a bridge for sometime. Corey manages to kill two victims by accident, or does he? God only knows because I'm not sure the writers do. It feels like there was potential to say Michael is getting old and is in lot of pain from the physical confrontation which transpired in Kills, even so they don't really focus on this. Instead breaking all rules of Michael being a cold blooded ruthless killer only to form a bond with Corey. Why isn't he snapping his neck? Anybody who has seen a Halloween film knows Michael is just a Killing machine with nothing but pure evil, intent on killing anything in his way. None of the characters behave in a consistent way to make you believe they are all part of the same film throughout. Corey is the most confusing with his sadistic smile he makes you believe he is enjoying himself, which in contrast is the complete opposite to him feeling so bad and innocent at the beginning. Not until he meets Michael can he be a legitimate bonafide ice cold killer because one look at him and he'll be raring to go!The film has lots of quiet moments without any musical score to assist, which is also odd being halloweens are known for the famous theme with certain beats always revealing Michael in the background. Part of what made the original 1978 version of John Carpenters so scary or jumpy was anticipating when Michael would show up with its incredible score. The silent treatment didn't work for me, as much as it didn't in some of the early Friday the 13th sequels. Michael and Laurie appear to be sacrificed in this telling making way for newer characters, this would be fine if the new guys were actually interesting! We got Corey a group of delinquents, mixed with his romance getaway trip with Allyson, already well aware of the fact they ain't going nowhere no matter how much we'd like them to. A group of underdeveloped characters alongside some very mediocre acting. I had to admit the most exciting or enjoyable aspect was watching, as each delinquent met their demise at the hands of the apprentice! If you find you make it this far you'll start feeling like you've been compelled much like Corey. Finding yourself rooting for the death of each annoyingly uninteresting bore fest of character they'd whipped up on post it notes. Nothing really stands out or catches your eye as a memorable moment. We get shades of when Freddy tortured his victims around a scrap of wheels near Corey's job as a mechanic.As I try to conclude I'd like to say the end salvages what has already taken up over two hours of your time, all I can say is let's hope it really is the end this time because there is clearly nothing left to tell.",

            "content": "Fans of Halloween will always point to Season of the Witch and shake their heads. Not only because it's a truly awful film, and that's debatable, but because the core ingredient, The Mask, The Shape...Michael Meyers is entirely absent from proceedings. For a series that started out with Jamie Lee Curtis in the lead and John Carpenter at the helm, the franchise managed to live for long periods without them with the fourth and fifth installments offering their own twists. The Rob Zombie remake was interesting and the sequel was, at least, wonderfully bizarre. The key to success is the man in the mask and that's just a starting block.I though the 2018 return was a worthwhile endeavor. Not great but it certainly captured something from the old days. Halloween Kills was surprisingly satisfying and I would rank it in the top three....and so came the long wait for the grand finale. It came, we saw, it underwhelmed. It's difficult to imagine what went through the minds of writers and director on this one as they virtually removed the very thing we'd come to see...Michael Meyers. How they thought a third rate tale of Corey Cunningham, a nothing character tacked onto series as an after-thought, could hold an audience is beyond mindboggling. Ardent fans turned up specifically to see the promised final showdown between The Shape and Laurie Strode and we left asking \"Really.... REALLY???Halloween Ends is an insult to the fans that followed this franchise all the way back to the Carpenter masterpiece. It's insanely conceived, poorly written, badly cast...it lacks any attempt at creativity and it offers us only an abysmal copy of the terror that brought us back time and again. It's over and maybe its for the best. Careers could fall on another dud like this which makes it all the more confusing that the same team were able to hit such high notes with Halloween Kills just a year ago. Shame on all involved.",

            "content": "How does one take a franchise that is arguably the best horror franchise in the history of cinema and produce this film. If you ask anyone about horror films and to name some of the more iconic villains, Micheal Myers is most likely going to be upon the ones names. So you have one of the most iconic characters in horror in a super successful franchise and yet you produce the final film in the series and it comes out to be a disappointing mess. Majority of the movie doesn't even have Micheal in it. This movie mainly deals with Corey, whom I assume is to be set up as the new \"Boogeyman\". However in the end he ends up being killed, so what's the point. The movie starts out telling how Corey accidentally killed a kid and now the town turns on him, but is cleared of said charges. So now we have this random kid who has no friends and was accused of murder. Okay set up to why he may potentially could become a new \"Boogeyman\". Fast forward 4 years, Micheal has apparently disappeared, and we see Laurie and how she bought a house, got sober, and lives with her granddaughter. She seems to have moved on from Micheal and all that jazz cause she's in the Halloween holiday spirit. Allyson, her granddaughter, isn't. She now works as a nurse and is upset that her coworker got the promotion instead of her. Corey now works at a junkyard but is still being beaten down by the town constantly reminding him of what happened. He goes into a gas station and gets a drink only to be attacked by seniors after he refuses to buy them beer. He cuts his hand but his saved by Laurie. In the hospital Corey meets Allyson and weirdly have a connection between them and Allyson flirts with him and after a little they become a couple but if you ask me it's highly unhealthy. All the while this happens Corey keeps running into the seniors and keeps getting jumped. During one night he is thrown over a bridge. He is drug into the sewers to find Micheal hiding. Instead of being afraid for his life he is rather intrigued by him, practically wanting him to show him how he kills people. Throughout the rest of the movie Corey keeps trying to get Allyson to turn her back on the town and come with him. Laurie of course doesn't like this and attempts to get Allyson away from him. Eventually learning and talking to the family of the son he kinda killed and how he has \"changed\". Corey kills a homeless man, a cop who Allyson used to date, and the coworker who was banging the doctor into getting her the raise, and that same doctor. All while \"learning\" from Micheal. Corey then kills all the senior kids, mainly ofc screen cause budget probably. And then attempts to murder Laurie. But, after a phony suicide call to the police to drag them to the house, shoots Corey in the chest. Corey is eventually killed and the final show down ensues between Laurie and Micheal. It all ends in a throat slit and a wrist slit that kills the Boogeyman. All is done when they tie Micheal to the top of the car, ride through town bringing people along, and throwing him into an industrial grade compactor thingy then throw metal into that basically gets shredded. Anyways Micheal is like dead dead.That was a VERY brief of what happened in the film. My main beef with it is that I watched the movie wanting Micheal, not this random kid whom I don't care about. Like 90% of the film doesn't even include Micheal in it. They just talk about him and blaming Laurie for her obsession about him. And when he is in it he's portrayed as a mentor to this kid. And when Corey is dead it seems like Micheal never cared and just went after Laurie like always. In my opinion, Corey never should've been a thing. What they should've done is had the movie open up right where the last one ended and shown what the characters had to go through after losing Allyson's mom and seeing what Micheal has to do since being beaten mercilessly. Instead of telling us that Laurie went to therapy for a few years, why not show us what she had to do to overcome her daughters death. I would've rather liked to see Laurie end up dying by the hands of micheal as like the \"only way to stop him\". The connection they have fueling Micheal's rage and ability to get up after major damage be severed as the only way to finally put him down. Laurie still living is the reason Micheal is so strong and such a tank. I don't know that's my nonprofessional opinion on the matter. I just hated how they reduced Micheal to being a side character to be used only at the end to say they had him in the film. This film could've been set years after his death as a way to birth a new Boogeyman based off the legends of his name and violence.",

            "content": "This one is very unique and strays the farthest from the series formula. Your enjoyment of it will largely depend on how willing you are to go along. There's no getting around the fact that 'Halloween Ends' is going to live forever in infamy but in an odd way the risks the movie takes will make it a series stand out for good or evil.I get the sense that David Gordon Green and co. Felt that after the massive bloodletting of 'Halloween Kills' they needed to scale back and tell a more rounded story. 'Halloween Ends' feels very weird as a companion piece to that film. 'Ends' does what I've wanted to see from a 'Halloween' film. It is far more character and story-driven. The problem is that 'Ends' is totally uninterested in exploring Laurie Strode and especially Michael. As an individual entry, I think 'Ends' is a pretty cool experiment. As the culmination of an epic series and a send-off to Jamie Lee Curtis...'Ends' is a failure. I actually liked a lot about 'Halloween Ends' but as a 'Halloween' fan I understand the rage. Corey's story isn't a marquee event and it's no fault for the ideas being played with here which are fresher than the stale 'Kills'.This new 'Halloween' trilogy definitely does not feel creatively necessary or cohesive. I'm reminded a lot of our beloved and non-polarizing 'Star Wars' sequels. I can only say that I loved the 2018 'Halloween' and I'll even go out on a limb and say it is my favorite save the Carpenter original. I felt it had that right mix of carnage and character. I also felt that it did not lend itself to a sequel. Michael and Laurie's arc in that film felt pretty complete. The follow-up Kills' was a real low point in the 'Halloween' mythos. 'Kills' offered non-stop carnage with the filmiest characters to be offered up to Michael.'Halloween Ends' is an overcorrection to 'Kills' This new movie is all about the abstract concept of evil and how it has infected a new generation. Corey Cunningham is definitively the main character. Is his story interesting? Yeah, it is. Michael has been portrayed as a superhuman robot killing machine and frankly, he's less frightening or intriguing that way. I've always thought the stronger entries of the series had a Michael Myers who had mortality. When our hero appears in 'Ends' (and he doesn't appear often) he's banged up and elderly. His only remaining power is his legend and now we have Corey basking in it. This is pretty subversive stuff and I felt that Rohan Campbell was up to the challenge. We see a progression from a boy who went through hell to a monster. Does the script handle it well? No, at times it's bungled. The scene where Michael stares into his soul is kind of redundant. But despite the underdeveloped bits of the basic idea, I think this is intriguing stuff. 'Ends' is a movie that could have used another rewrite to flesh out the themes and give more motivation to the ensemble cast. The infatuation with Corey sidelines Laurie and makes Allyson look oblivious. Jamie Lee Curtis and especially Andi Matichak deserved better material.Now we all know Michael will never die but 'Halloween' has had the good sense to trim the branches when they got too convoluted. I mean it when I say I get the rage and totally understand it. 'Ends' isn't a great 'Halloween' film in the mold of the formula and you know what I love that formula too. It is kind of insulting to release 'Ends' with that title and Jamie Lee Curtis. I have to think this movie probably would have played better had it been the second part of the trilogy or a stand-alone sequel to the original 78 film. 'Kills' despite the shortcomings is a more epic movie and probably would have been a better conclusion than 'Ends'. When Michael finally enters the story it's an afterthought.'Halloween' will never end and Michael Myers will never die. To those disappointed in 'Ends' let Michael rest for a while. He'll be back. I think time will be kind to this film and it will be reassessed but if it's not I guess I'm a weird outlier and I can live with that.",

Michael Myers is a remorseless killer, he does not have buddies he hangs out with in the sewer.2. This film avoids showing a ton of kills for some strange reason, but then will show some gory stuff and I'm like why not just show everything??? Its a halloween movie the kills and horror is why we are watching\n3. The romance storyline was cringe and didn't make any sense. The granddaughter is overacting the whole time. Who talks to someone they are seeing like this after 2 days??? It is so incredibly forced and man it makes me angry.4. Michael is barely in the film, we see him after an hour of worthless storytelling that bored me to tears.5. The kills were ALL people we are supposed to dislike. That is not horror, that is an action trope. Horror is watching all types of people get killed, which is what they did in halloween kills. Not a great movie, but at least it works within the genre. Maybe a stupid claim but its something I noticed.6. Laurie completely obliterated michael in the final fight scene. Are we supposed to believe this old woman can defeat this evil god-like entity that survives gunshot, stabwounds and being burnt alive. Absolutely ridiculous and an embarrassment to the character\n7. The end where they parade the body through town because \"the town needs healing\" is absolutely ridiculous. This is in america not some third world country, they don't do public executions. Especially driving a bloody nasty corpse of a killer through a town on halloween, a time where CHILDREN are on the street. EVEN BAD SANTA UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF POLICE DOING BAD STUFF DURING A HOLIDAY GETS THEM REPRIMANDED.8. Overall a boring, stupid story that is too long. Not enough of what we want and too much of what we don't. If you couldn't tell I am furious that I've seen this film and I plead you to not watch this, even for fun.PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, I BEG YOU.",

            "content": "The closure of the new Michael Myers trilogy leaves the feeling of being something bittersweet. Beyond the nostalgic approach that the three-film saga entailed, there remains the feeling that an attempt was made to deliver a much more independent concept from the simplistic slasher to which we are accustomed.The intentions had their validity.Since the election of its director David Gordon Green, it could be sensed that something different would be tried to deliver to the Halloween saga. The feeling remains that this intention did not finish completely or simply the power of a character like Myers was already quite spent.It can be a mixture of both, personally I value the bet that his creative group makes to confront us with the reality of fear and openly point out that the great terror of Haddonfield is its own inhabitants, something that marks both Kills and Ends a lot. Certainly, that move ran its risks, that seed of an independent cinema, with something else, can be well executed or poorly executed. In this closure it seems to me that it is halfway, at times it seems to work and in others it is too much. This game clearly affects the reception of an audience that has a great icon behind it with a knife that is not really willing to accept everything that comes either.And on the contrary, it also leaves the feeling that Myers has symptoms of tiredness. After so many original sequels and like new trilogies, it is inevitable to feel that he is a character that has very little new to deliver. However, when we have him on screen it is still a pleasure and even morbid to see how the Boogeyman will make the next cut of him.The birth of something halfway.I have to admit that Corey's plot worked quite well for me both in his spectacular initial prologue and in how everything unfolds for him, even more so if we add the relationship he establishes with Allyson. There was something that generated satisfaction in those decisions, but unfortunately he ends up falling prey to history behind a Michael Myers who must close a cycle.I prefer a film that complies with giving Myers and Laurie a decent and correct ending. That he knew how to make nostalgia something beyond a simple memory and that has its value.Perhaps he could have had a better route to his outcome, but it doesn't end up being a disaster either. It is a film that has intentions, that you may like more or less, but it knows what it wants to offer and that is to try to close two great characters who have marked the history of horror movies with a great memory.The decision whether or not to accept what they give us is very personal and is not a matter of taste, personally I am left with positive feelings, how bad, but as Laurie says, everything has a different face, it is up to one to let it in or not .",

For long stretches it doesn't feel like such.However, there are some strong performances here that almost tick the terror to a rating of 7 stars.Namely, Andi Matichak, and Rohan Campbell as Allyson and Corey, respectively.Their story is well-written but at times takes away from Michael Myers doing what he does best.This is a relatively deep story about making a tragic mistake and never being able to live it down.It's about losing your life's potential because you can never live beyond that terrible accident.It's also about finding another darker path because that's where life has maybe led you to that point.But while all of this is being realized for other characters, the people in their seats to see MM wreak havoc sit restlessly.Where the guy in the old Shatner mask kills endlessly, maybe the next-in-line has an agenda.The killer with a motive brings the dark humor with his targets.In the end you might ask will there be another? There always seems to be another, even when they say this is the end.You will definitely have your answer at the end of this movie.",

I loved his low budget indie work and Pineapple Express is hilarious, but I don't think the man knows horror.Jamie Lee Curtis is in this more than the last, but again she is not the focus, and the grand daughter isn't really either, instead an insanely large chunk of this movie is spent with a new character, who is about as interesting as a saltine cracker.

And I LOVED Allison and the new characters. They felt very 3 dimensional and I wanted to root for them.Cory Cunningham is the new Michael Myers.

            "content": "While the previous two movies were just okay, the writers (that's plural, and more on that in a minute) really missed on \"Halloween Ends.\"There were so many things wrong with this film that I don't know where to begin. Well, okay, the writers (again, plural). Ever hear the saying \"too many chefs and not enough cooks\"? Yeah, that applies here. It is very clear that not only was this film but the Blumhouse trilogy really lacked a singular voice, someone to decide on the story, because there are so many concepts that are half-baked in here. The whole tone of this film--of the trilogy--is so uneven that it is hard to really know what to feel at any given time.First, the film jumps ahead 4 years from 2018. Well, not yet, anyway. First we get a year later and we are introduced to Corey ... a nice kid who is brought in to babysit a boy on Halloween night (I'm still amazed that parents in this films abandon their children on Halloween night, but whatever). Through an unfortunate accident, the boy dies and Corey is taken away.Cue opening credits after a rather long introduction for a guy who really shouldn't be the main focus of this film, but he ends up being the main focus of this film ... for some misguided reason.Four years after the Haddonfield massacre of 2018! Yada yada monologue from Laurie about living normally now after the events of 2018. What? 50 people were murdered, including her daughter and son-in-law, but Laurie's decision is to remain in Haddonfield and live in a normal house? What in this character's backstory causes her to go from a recluse alcoholic with severe mental issues to becoming this well-adjusted citizen after such a traumatic event? Whatever.Hey, speaking of 2018 ... So Michael tore through Haddonfield like it was nothing. Even after he was seemingly beaten to death by the mob, he got right up and slashed them to pieces. He followed Karen and slashed her too for good measure. And then he ... leaves? He goes down into a sewer and stays there ... for 4 years. What? Why? Shouldn't he still be out there murdering and stuff?So, this is getting long, but I'll say that Corey is out and about, being a social pariah in Haddonfield because he (didn't) murder that kid in 2019. He has a run-in with some marching band bullies (not making that up) with New York accents (not making that up either) and he ends up hurt. Laurie just happens to be there and she instantly takes a liking to him. She decides to set him up with her granddaughter. Because that makes sense. \"Hey, Allyson, there's this loner dude whom everyone hates, you should date him!\"\nAllyson instantly likes him. And they go out and bond. Until he is accosted by the mother of the boy he (didn't) murder and he runs away only to be cornered by the marching band bullies, who accidentally push him off a bridge near the sewer where Michael is lurking. Michael drags him into the sewer and ... does ... nothing. Corey wakes up, panics, and then Michael grabs him and ... I don't know what the hell happens, but there is some montage of tragic events and Michael just lets him go, presumably because Corey now has some of the evil? Unclear.Corey and Allyson continue to bond, even after he tells her he killed someone (he killed the homeless guy after emerging from the sewer) and Allyson is like \"yeah, cool, whatever, let's ride your motorcycle.\" Say what?And that right there is the central theme of this film--a dark romantic tragedy.Michael is portayed as an asthmatic old man who can barely lift a knife. At one point Corey assaults him and takes the mask. Yeah, a scrawny young adult defeats Michael ... the same Michael who was lifting firefighters into the air with axes and plowing through crowds of vigilantes can't fight off one kid.And when we do finally get the showdown between Michael and Laurie ... it's bleh. It's more like a mid-movie encounter than the final fight because the two characters spend most of the fight grappling, reaching for stuff, etc. The cat-and-mouse scene from \"Halloween 2018\" was much better. This ... this was just bad.There were 4 writers for this film and it shows. The movie had too many concepts that weren't fully realized here. I mean, the whole copycat thing was interesting, but not for the final act. They should have done that in the first movie or something ... if at all.The tone was wholly inconsistent as well. You're supposed to feel sorry for Corey, but he's also doing horrible things. You can tell the writers wanted you to get \"Joker\" vibes here. But the thing with \"Joker\" is that he was the main character, it was a movie about him. Halloween isn't supposed to be about Corey Cunningham, right? I mean, are we supposed to cheer for him when he goes up against Laurie Strode? Because that was the choice the writers gave you.Speaking of inconsistent. How big is Haddonfield? We saw it was big enough for a rather large hospital, a news channel, a sizable police and firefighter force ... but everyone knows everyone on sight. Everyone recognizes Corey ... for some reason. I mean, he would have been in the news 3 years ago, but so what? The film opens with a montage of other murders and suicides, so wouldn't Corey's face have been lost in the mix? Sorry, I'm not buying it.Look, I'll watch every other Halloween film (except for the Zombie ones), but I'm not ever going to watch this one again. It was boring. It wasn't a Halloween movie. The concepts were there to make it interesting, but they didn't know where to take them.Very disappointing.",

Did they completely forget about the previous instalments to the trilogy and the whole trilogy itself? What happened behind all of the screenwriting, and ideas, and production, and execution of this movie?Jamie Lee Curtis is back for another more-of-a-supporting-role than a featured hero role, which is where the disappointment begins. Anyway, the film is set four years after the events of Halloween Kills, with Laurie Strode living with her granddaughter as she writes her memoir, but there's a big focus a young man who was accused of intentionally murdering a young boy while babysitting him. The thematic plot aspect feels very new, despite Halloween (2018) actually having a story, but it's because it comes after Michael Myers' chaotic killing spree in the previous film.Since the previous instalment was packed with extremely frequent and fun deaths, centred on major blood and gore, the small amount of killings in this film is extremely frustrating, and you're questioning whether the film you just saw was the same film you were meant to be seeing. Halloween Ends deserves the credit and praise for trying to do something different, and it actually works out for some time, but it completely squashes your expectations. Plus, this movie never answers the questions relating to the big block of time between the stories of Halloween Ends and Halloween Kills.The failure of this film is actually painful, knowing that this WAS the final product. This is one of the biggest disappointments of 2022 and even people who just see these Halloween horror movies for fun, expecting plenty of gory kills and Michael Myers sequences, will even be disheartened that this was the final product.

We just had to get over the fact that it was a Halloween movie in name only.Halloween Ends doesn't have enough Michael Myers, has a completely bizarre story, a cast of annoying or weird characters, a new villain, and it even uses the same opening credit style as Halloween III. It's clearly trying to be the experimental entry in this new trilogy like Halloween III was 40 years ago, and I think it's attempting to bank off the goodwill that Halloween III finally earned from the fanbase after decades of being misunderstood and written off. \"Perhaps they'll accept Halloween Ends with open arms, too, no matter how bad it gets... just like with Halloween III!\" I can see the writers thinking, as they dream up some of the most nonsensical dialogue, character choices, and storytelling I've seen in recent memory. It's a rough watch and I had several laughs during scenes that were taking themselves incredibly seriously despite some absolutely bonkers circumstances happening onscreen.The one truly significant difference between Halloween III and Halloween Ends, however, is that this is not going to be a cult classic movie, and even if you pretend it's not a Halloween movie and just watch it on its own merits, it's still an objectively ridiculous piece of filmmaking. It will never be bad-cool in the Halloween III way, and it will never be so-bad-it's-good in the Troll 2 kind of way. It is not memorable, it is not likable, and it only serves to further tarnish the franchise that this new trilogy came thisclose to turning around.I look forward to the next Halloween movie.

Michael is taken down several times by normal people, after killing a group of 20 people in the last one. Michael survives shotgun blasts in the previous films, and then gets killed by Laurie and her granddaughter with knives. The Corey character was the weakest addition to this new run of Halloween films. After all the people Michael has killed, why would he keep Corey alive/team up with him. He is not scary at all, nor is he believable. In a series that has shown the effects of trauma and PTSD, Corey seems like a cartoon caricature. Wish they would've taken their time with these sequels, as they had potential. Any potential and momentum this series carried, is now dead and gone down the meat grinder they sent Michael into.

Laurie made quite a few amazing jokes and became the grandma she always should have been. Allison has a job at the hospital. Lindsay is a bartender, which is the one problem i had with this movie. She was only in like three or four scenes in this movie and i could have used way more of her. Great use of Bl\u00fce oyster cult's (don't fear) the reaper. Old people romance. Young people romance.

Unfortunately they tried something different here. Which could of worked if it was just half the movie, and built up to the finale everyone wanted. But it takes over the film. A film that's not even the slightest bit scary.They make the massive misstep of forgetting to get back to what the films supose to be quickly enough.

More like a normal saga than the overall episodic slasher saga.And he was doing fine...\nHalloween (2018) was the best Halloween film since the original one, and Kills was cool and enjoyable (even if the ending was anticlimatic and incoherent). But Ends was meant to be the \"End\" of the Halloween saga, and my god... I was hyped.My hype and my trust into David Gordon-Green ended on a unnecessary, lame, boring, dispicable, disrespectful, putrid and sad excuse for a film that ruined my whole October!!! It broke me so hard that I really hoped that this was just one big stupid joke, but it wasn't.Michael was barely a cameo, a sad cameo of an old fragile man who gets beaten up so easily, I still have my doubts considering \"that\" as the real Michael Myers.The AlissonxCorey subplot was unbearable, idiotic and a lame excuse to portray \"a new version of evil, in the shape of Corey\". Have you even watched Halloween 4 to confirm that as a H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E idea?And Jamie... poor Jamie. I feel so awfully bad about Jamie, she (along with Donald Pleascence) was the other half of Halloween, as crucial as Michael Myers can be. And she ended up making the worst possible \"finale\" of the saga since that stupid kiss in Resurrection.It pains me to see the most inspirational indie film ever made, to slowly die as the worst way possible.This ain't the end of Halloween, of course not. Greedy producers will always make Mike come back from the grave to squish and keep squishing his image till there's nothing left from him. But Ends was supposed to be special, to be something else, apart from the ordinary slasher formula.My october is ruined, I hope you are happy DGG... cause I ain't.

Who because of how he's treated by the town, becomes exactly what they say he is.

I honestly believe a lot of people who gave it a low rating were planning to do so from the start. Or they just won't accept ANY modern horror adaptation to the horror classics. Or they're just salty it's ended. Regardless of the bizarre reasoning behind the harshest critiques, it's a well made, honorable end to the series. And it is certainly the end, it doesn't end with a dot-dot-dot, it ends with a period.It's not as predictable as one would think. There are some good scares, and it introduces an interesting dynamic with this Corey character. The themes are rather blatant, which include bullying, transformation, mob mentality, and just good 'ol fashioned history between familiar characters. They do a great job introducing new elements while reliving some of the old.They really upped the brutality too, since the two previous installments. You get some savage moments with some rather effective gore effects to boot.Aside the character and plot developments, which isn't bad at all (including all the psychoanalyses of the characters), it's eerily romantic. And there are a lot of cool subtleties placed carefully in the movie. Like Myers' face in the rock, or a character grabbing a fireplace poker like they intended to use it (you'll understand when you watch it, it's an interested detail that really showcases the development of the nature of one of the characters), and even the use of a jack-o-lantern that looks strangely familiar.... There's even a moment early in the film, when characters are using tarot cards, a character mentions something about the old ending and new beginnings, which is a sort of statement on the series as a whole.The acting isn't bad, and you gotta love Jamie Lee Curtis, she does a great job. But it doesn't end up the way you'd think, they do a good job not making it entirely predictable. And regardless if it was intentional or not, it's a great cautionary tale about bullying, and how it can affect people.It's a great finish and homage to the series, and shouldn't disappoint any true fan. And I believe one of the moral takeaways of the movie, if one were to search for any, would be: Let's stop making people into monsters.Tip: Ignore the reviewers who gave it 1-4 stars, they don't know what they're talking about. It 100% does not deserve that low of a rating, and this coming from a TRUE horror fan who usually agrees with the majority of reviewers when it comes to horror movies.

Michael Myers has been missing for years - after being nearly murdered by a mob of vengeful, angry citizens, Michael is seemingly hidden away. But make no mistake - Michael isn't dead. At least, the idea of him isn't. The townsfolk cower at the slightest bump in the night; the fear is so thick in the air that some people commit suicide, not being able to live with the possibility of The Shape making a return; and with The Shape's absence, hatred is brewing between the citizens of Haddonfield, with virtually everyone ready to tear each other apart for even the most inconsequential slight. Laurie Strode and her granddaughter, Allyson, have moved on, however, and are finally ready to enjoy the Halloween holiday for what it is. Laurie bakes pumpkin pie, Allyson finds a new boyfriend, and all seems well in the lives of our main characters - until a very special someone decides to make his resurrection.I can confidently say that \"Halloween Ends\" is - bar none - the best film in the entire franchise; with a deep philosophical story that creates a rich social commentary regarding the very nature of evil, this film brilliantly subverts expectations by taking viewers down a journey that will have them questioning everything they thought they knew about themselves, this movie series, and the holiday of Halloween..... That paragraph is what I wish I could write about \"Halloween Ends.\" Instead, director David Gordon Green forced my hand; he directed one of the absolute worst installments in the \"Halloween\" franchise, compelling me to eviscerate this movie as best as I can through the power of the written word.Man oh man, was this movie an absolute travesty; I need to know what the writers were smoking in the writing room while working in this script so I can avoid their drug of choice because, clearly, it is not working in their favor. More of a bad fan fiction than a natural conclusion to the new \"Halloween\" trilogy that started with 2018's reboot, \"Halloween Ends\" - once again - promises one thing through its clever marketing while delivering something else entirely. The 2018 \"Halloween\" advertised a reversal of the slasher genre, one where Laurie would become the predator and Michael the prey. Instead, we got a rehash movie, one that did nothing unique with the premise it promised; Laurie doesn't even go after Michael in that movie, with their final confrontation occurring due to nothing more than happenstance. In 2021 we were treated to \"Halloween Kills\" and, once again, the trailer teased a vengeful Laurie hunting down her would-be killer. And once again, we got nothing of the sort. But surely \"Halloween Ends\" would break this curse and finally give us what we've been wanting to see since 2018?Oh, how the mighty have fallen - \"Halloween Ends\" destroys the good will that Green and writer Danny McBride have earned from the well received 2018 movie by, once again, not giving audiences what they walked into the theatre to see. Sure, Laurie and Michael do have their inevitable throw down, but the majority of this movie is focused on an entirely new character that you do not, and will not, care less about. Played by Rohan Campbell, this new character, Corey, is the epitome of poor writing. While at first awkward and sympathetic, any positive feelings you'll start to have toward the character will begin to fade away like wisps of cigarette smoke on a cool winter's eve, not because of anything the character is doing on screen, but because of how god awful the script is. Amateurish is one word to describe Corey's dialogue; horrific is another. Every word and each sentence out of his mouth gets increasingly worse to the point where audience members started to laugh at him - and that's always a good sign of a beloved character.And it's not just Corey's dialogue that's awful but also his story. Focusing on Corey instead of on Michael and Laurie, \"Halloween Ends\" tries to subvert audience expectations through a plot that wildly differentiates itself from the previous two films in this series. My only question is, why do this? No one came to see Corey, or his story. Everyone came to see Laurie face off against The Shape. And, obviously, I wouldn't be complaining if Corey's story was well told, but it isn't. The movie rushes through its plot points to get where it wants to go while simultaneously spending over an hour doing not much. My friend described this as a \"nothing movie,\" and I can't help but agree; for a film that's so laser focused on telling a specific narrative, it spends too much time meandering, showcasing a character and a story that do little to draw interest.\"Halloween Ends\" was supremely disappointing. Yes, if you want to see Michael and Laurie finally go toe-to-toe, you will get that. But first you'll have to sit through an hour and thirty minutes of cheesy melodrama, romance, and murder that echoes the worst aspects of the Hallmark channel. The direction the filmmakers decided to take this movie is no unbelievably bizarre that by the time the credits rolled I was convinced I had just witnessed a fever dream; I turned to my friend and said, \"When does the real movie start?\" I would never tell anyone to avoid a movie, as taste is subjective. However, \"Halloween Ends\" defies taste - it is a movie so bad that no one of sane mind could possibly think it's of high quality. See this if you must, but be warned: This movie is not what you're expecting in the worst possible sense.",

I don't want to spoil it as it is opening weekend as of this being written... I recommend just going in blind and not reading what the story exactly is, just that it is very different and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as usual and the grand daughter character really comes into her own spotlight in a highly enjoyable way. This was great.

            "content": "Where to begin? In a movie that should have been frightening, suspenseful, and aggressive, the director decided to go with a character-driven drama-suspense movie, because that's what everyone who enjoys Michael Myers has always craved...a horror movie about a well established serial killer barely appearing on screen and being nothing more than a sub-plot.This plot would have been fine if it was a stand-alone feature that was not tied into this franchise at all. You could take Michael Myers out of the equation of this movie and still have a story that would make for an interesting drama. The acting was fine as far as I am concerned. But what was done as the plot to this film undermines fan expectations and leaves the viewer unsatisfied.The Halloween movies (excluding Season of the Witch) are at their best when they center around Michael Myers being creepy, violent, and creating an atmosphere of suspense and dread. Halloween Ends does none of that and attempted to give viewers a Halloween movie they did not ask for. As absurd as it sounds, I almost believe the director approached this movie like he was trying to produce an Oscar contender.I actually enjoyed Halloween: Resurrection and Halloween III: Season of the Witch (two of the most disappointing films in the franchise) more than this film. Arguably, it is just barely better than Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, and I say that because I have talked to people that hated that one and thought it was better than this most recent outing. So glad I watched it on Peacock and did not spend money on a ticket...so glad!",

            "content": "I am glad that I watched this in theater because there is no way I could have stayed focused enough to catch all of the Easter eggs in this movie.So this is supposed to be the third film of a trilogy, but the film leaves you confused which is not so much a problem with this movie but actually the entire Halloween franchise never really tells you, it shows you. That is exactly what this film did, it showed you the end instead of telling you what you should have known already which is the biggest downfall of this film.The lack of a recap and backstory is where this film falls short. I see very little connection between this film and Halloween Kills other than Laurie Strode and her granddaughter Allyson Nelson. This film incorporates a lot of different aspects from the entire franchise, but more importantly from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, Halloween 4: the Return of Michael Myers, and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.The Halloween Ends plot focuses on showing you the alternate path of Michael Myers' ability to unlock evil in others. Remember Halloween 4 when Michael unlocked evil in the young innocent Jamie Lloyd that led her to stab her stepmom once she put on her mask? Myers does the same to the main antagonist in this film, Corey Cunningham. Myers unlocks evil in Corey after he suffered years of bullying for a mistaken murder he committed as a babysitter years before. Corey puts on his mask and becomes a killer, much like how Jamie Lloyd did in the end of Halloween 4, and how the children in Halloween 3 did once they were activated. Myers activates the evil in Corey as a sort of passing the torch which is what the Halloween franchise flirted with in Halloween 6 when Danny Strode was marked as the next candidate of the Thorn curse that gave Michael his powers.Halloween Ends is a masterpiece only if you have seen the first six films and already know the lore of the Celtic curse, Sam Hain, the Myers curse, the death of the Thorn cult who controlled Michael, and the Michael Myers origin. Without prior knowledge of those stories, this film will make zero sense to you. This film is not for the casual fans. If you missed even one of the past movies from parts one through six, then you won't catch the Dr. Loomis Easter Eggs and references made throughout the dialogue by Laurie Strode or understand the ending which mirrors the beginning of the franchise.One thing I can tell you that is great in this film is the acting. All of the actors did an excellent job. The movie was visually perfect in theater. The music was more modern, so for the old heads out there you won't be too much into the modern music. I'm an old head myself and thought there were music themes that were a bit off premise, but that is why I consider this a masterpiece as well because this particular film took the approach of an off-premise story to show you rather than tell you the story.The action in this film is lacking. Corey Cunningham and Michael Myers work in tandem with each other but for the most part there is not a great deal of gore like past Halloween movies. Most of the kills were quick kill scenes which is unlike the past movies where suspense is built through a slow scene as Michael patiently preys on his victim. The kills seem too rushed.To end this review, my recommendation is if you have not seen past Halloween movies then you should watch all of them before watching this one because there is no other way you will understand the connections between them all.",

It's kinda a legacy film, that deals with the aftermath of the slaughter Michael did when escaping from the Mental Institute. It's kinda a social study of how fear and trauma changes people, how they react to that, and it's also about the evil lurking underneath the surface. Very interesting questions are asked and however they are answered, nothing is too on the nose. The movie has really interesting and brave twist, because it's a legacy movie, and many people dislike this twist, but I personally think it's a really exciting choice. All in all it's a very human, but bizarre, emotional, but cruel movie. It's not a real Halloween movie, it's more like a drama, and a social-phsychological study. I loved it.",

That being said, Michael has been withdrawn to a cameo in this movie where he's only seen for probably 10-15 minutes throughout the whole run time. Instead it focuses on a new character, Corey. And his tragic backstory blah blah blah, His relationship with Allyson, Who's strong, Smart character has been abandoned completely in this movie, Corey happens across Michael and begins developing psychotic tendencies, After teaming up with Michael on a couple of murders (YES, TEAMING UP) Corey feels the need to take the mantle as Haddonfields new boogeyman, promptly beating up Michael and stealing his mask.MICHAEL MYERS who was last seen in Halloween Kills being shot, stabbed, beaten with bats, pitchforks etc and still rising to take out an entire mob, gets beaten up by a 20 yr old kid.Continuity from the previous 2 installments is non existant, Officer Hawkins who we see for maybe 5 minutes and who vowed to kill Michael is now retired and seems not to be bothered by it at all now,\nLindsey who I was so glad to see brought back to this franchise has a blink and you'll miss it scene,\nWhy bring these much loved characters back if you do nothing with them,\nThere is also no metion of the previous movies tragedies,\nNo mention of Karen, Ray, Tommy, Lonnie, Cameron, Brackett, or anyone else who fell to Michaels onslaught.Finally the huge showdown between good and evil is just a complete anti climax and was sold to the fans as the ultimate end to this trilogy. Its not even worth writing about.I'm a massive Halloween fan and will defend all the movies as much as I can, Even the bad ones that critics pull apart (Resurrection) But unfortunately there is no defending this awful awful mess and DGG has done all of us fans dirty.After such promise on the previous 2 installments and getting so much right, how can it go so wrong.Shame on you.",

It really just has to be felt, so you'll have to watch it for yourself to really know.The negatives could be spoken on for hours, but I for one have to wonder just how small is Haddonfield and is there no town large enough to afford a transplant relative anonymity nearby? Ya know so kids being changed by the \"evil\" that has infected Haddonfield could get out but still see the fam on holidays? Nope, no one thinks of that. Just stay there, be hated, degraded, and humiliated... it'll all be worth it when you get yourself a girl willing to turn on her last living relative for you after three days, one of which ended with you screaming at the girl in self-pity and storming off. On top of that Michael Myers will partner with you for a couple kills and then just as quickly turn on you.Really, that's where were at with this franchise. And the thing about the \"evil\" infecting Haddonfield, that's not me. That's the writers. What a gem, absolute diamond.Like I said, the 4 was generous.

The shift in focus to Rohan Campbell's character (Corey) in the first two acts added a level of insight into the creation and development of a monster. It was a more realistic take on the typical compulsive killer, born of tragedy and waging war on the rest of the world. Strangely, whenever they returned to the trilogy's central story, I felt slightly cheated. I understand that the majority of fans went to see Michael Myers, so their disappointment is justified, but I go to the theater for great storytelling, and I believe Corey's story was the better of the two. Jamie Lee Curtis even seemed to turn a corner playing Laurie at the start of the film, bringing a jaded levity to the role that had been missing. But that was simply too good to be true, seeing as she eventually relapses back into the stale \"bad ass\" role she inhabited in the first two films. It's a shame her character's arc was so underwhelming throughout the trilogy. Laurie barely changes or evolves over the course of the three films. The killings are limited at first, but once the blood starts flowing, it doesn't stop until the credits roll. It's certainly a film that could be watched in the context of the other two films or as a standalone story about how guilt can taint the soul.",

Really?The movie has some good kills, dialogue and scenes but overall there's far too much \"What the...\" in between those moments to make up for what feels like the result of studio fan service demands clashing with an alternative artist's view.Better than other Halloween sequels but don't expect anything like the other 2 in DGG's Trilogy.",

It is definitely better than Kills (no more \"evil dies tonight) but was not on par with Halloween 2018. While the pacing was off and some of the editing choices were interesting it took a step in a new direction which I appreciate. We get to see a young man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a child he babysat turned into a monster and become the new boogeyman. While the didn't follow through with that in the end I believe it still worked, however, it would've been nice to establish Corey in previous film. We get to see Laurie much more through the movie but sadly we don't get enough of Micheal. The finale is what really made this movie for me, while it wasn't a scary film more of a thriller the last 30 minutes had me blighting my nails.",

This is a movie that will cause you to reevaluate yourself and take a good hard look at the person inside.

            "content": "Just to get this out of the way, I know this movie has issues, and there's so many indefensible problems with the movie that definitely pulled me out of itSo let's start with all of that. Yes, this is Halloween Ends for about 10 minutes of the movie, and that's towards the end. It's really bizarre that they chose to make Corey the main antagonist is immediately writing themselves into a corner. I kept leaning over to my brother and joking with him \"Halloween Ends: Starring Norman Bates.\" It's not a good idea when you're talking about making a conclusion to a 40 year rivalryThere's also no defending a lot of the dialogue. It's not surprising to see bad dialogue in a horror film, but 4 writers really couldn't make it work? It felt like I was watching a movie written by George Lucas, without the creative storytelling to make up for it. It's kind of embarrassingAll of this could probably be forgiven if Michael was in the movie more. He was still a lot of fun to watch and it was cool to see him slowly regain his touch. But the fact that I was questioning if he was even in the movie at all before the halfway point is a testament to how unforgivable their lack of focus on him wasSo this begs the question, why do I like this movie? Well it's for a couple reasonsOne, it was far more enjoyable to me than Halloween Kills. I still think the message was wrong for the universe and consider good kills to be the standard for this franchise, not the exception that gives it's movies a silver lining. It was cool to see a movie that built tension and went back to the subtleties the franchise thrives onMore on that, I actually really like Corey. Yes his story doesn't blend well into this universe, but it was cool to see him pushed down a dark path while I still maintained hope he could be saved. But once he stole Michael's mask and went on his rampage, which was awesome, I knew there was no going back for him. It reminded me of stories I love like Batman the killing joke, which explore what drives someone to madnessI also think a lot of what you leave off with in terms of your impression of a movie is the last 15 minutes, which were incredible. Not just the showdown between Laurie and Michael, but also Corey's dark path coming to a close in the pinnacle of his destruction catching up with him. The boogeyman was destroyed once and for all, and so was any trace of his legacy embodied through his 2nd coming. It was dare I say, satisfyingSo yes, clearly this movie has problems and I'll be the first to admit I wouldn't consider this movie as holding a candle to the first film or even the 2018 sequel, but at the end of the day I had a good time with it. I imagine I'll be in the minority for the rest of time with this, but every now and again something comes along that we feel attached to seemingly without explanation. And I'll stand by that opinion even if what people see behind my eyes is purely and simply evil.",

The idea to follow this unlikeable grimly scruffy Corey character as a type of \"mini-me\" Michael Myers clone is a terminal mistake and the doomed romance with dumb Allyson just dragged it down even further that you'd hope the real Michael Myers would do away with her. The lack of presence of Michael Myers was painfully absent for at least 50 minutes into the film, just how do the filmmakers make and agree to that decision which would also include the legendary horror master himself John Carpenter??? The final showdown between Michael and Laurie was at least well handled, but if you're going to try sell me the idea that an aged grandmother can go hand to hand combat with a hulking 6ft plus killing machine beggars' belief. Classic use of plot armour. It's all a pity that they all couldn't stick the landing for this modern day retelling of the big screen's greatest monster icon. It's also very telling that the filmmakers didn't take at least a few years like they did after 2018 to 2021 and treat this second sequel to the same timeline and space it out. Just finishing this film within a year after Halloween Kills was a huge mistake and as a result it's ruined what could have been a very memorable horror trilogy to match the original old films. As it is, Halloween Ends winds up being the worst film in the entire franchise, Halloween 3 Season of the Witch is no longer the series' worst film - now that's scary.",

Their lives become entwined mostly because of Laurie's granddaughter who has become attracted to Cory.The second half of the movie brings the return of Michael Myers in an intriguing and unexpected way.If viewers were looking for blood and gore and scares, there is plenty in the second half.

This isn't a mindless slasher film, if anything, it is a psychological, Shakespearean tragedy. The acting was absolutely outstanding all around, by the entire cast. The score was brilliant, and not reliant on the old classic John Carpenter score.I can't believe I did not miss the classic score in this movie. It was included, but very sparingly. Most of the music in the film was original and produced for this film only, and it was really dramatic.The final result was a a story riding on a pitiful villain; one that you feel bad for....and I'm not talking about Michael Myers, but instead, one of the main characters in the movie that falls victim to his demons. The movie is a sad but beautiful metaphor about our inner struggles and what it takes to overcome them.Michael Myers was both depicted as a symbol of evil and everyone's inner demon, but also the real, physical person, an old man, who ran out of steam and ultimately meets his fate.Kudos to those involved in making this film, it was a passionate production and not just a cash cow.",

            "content": "I know I am in the minority here when say I never did care for Halloween 2018. So when Kills rolled around and received mediocre reviews, I wasn't expecting this movie to be the miracle to renew this series. But based on the previews and trailers I saw, I started to believe maybe I would be surprised in a good way! It certainly turned out to be much different than I expected after seeing it, both as what story I expected as a movie and dashing my hopes of a good film to close it out.The goods about this film: the music score and cinematography were good. So was the locations used and costuming. I even liked the story of the new character Corey. But it feels like it came a movie too late. Like the story should have been developed with him in the second film and developed into a climax in this last film in the trilogy.This movie had decent character development of some of the town folks this time. But then next to none for the people who were supposed to be the film's focus! I found the connection that supposedly nearly instantly developed between Corey and Laurie Strode's grand daughter, totally and utterly unbelievable. Nor did I invest in it. It was absolutely about as weak of relationship development as I have ever seen. They went dancing in costumes. And all of the sudden were totally inseparable. Give me a break!So the development of Corey as so connected to Micheal in this film was also shallow and pointless. Him taking over as the shape for a time was pretty cool. And could have been spanned over two movies so, so, so much better! It was like they came up with this great idea a movie too late. And tried to cram it all in at the last minute. If you are going to see this for a worthy FINAL conclusion between Micheal and Laurie, you may as well forget it. And the sheriff and police officer that have been in the series since the original movie, basically are lifeless afterthoughts thrown in, just to be there. This movie is an absolute mess! The more I think about it, the worse it is. I actually get mad enough thinking about it, that I feel like these producers and directors owe the public a huge apology for this garbage and a refund! And they deserve to be fired. Yes, I would go that far. They took an incredible character and series and destroyed it. It pi**es me off! And the scene where the tongue of the DJ is skipping around on the record player made me almost laugh out loud in the theatre. It was THAT bad! Looked fake as can be. The pumpkins in front of the store scene? Super fake! Cob webs in the house? Super fake! I mean tens of millions spent on this film and they have effects that look like a grade schooler did them???Like I said already, the score, cinematography, costumes, set locations all top notch. But the most important part, the story falls flat on its face. And is an absolute insult to this series as a supposedly true ending for the original players. I lived on the street where they filmed Halloween 4 and 5 as a kid. And actually watched while they filmed around my neighborhood at night. So this series always has had a special spot for me in my horror category. And the original Halloween 2 is likely my favorite horror movie of all time! And in my opinion the best movie of the entire series.SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE... This movie closes out a trilogy of utter disappointment! The directors and producers of this film DESERVE every single bit of criticism thrown at them. They ruined this film trilogy start to finish with all three movies! Give me the original movies and he**, even the Rob Zombie ones don't look so bad anymore! Telling everyone I know to skip this dumpster fire!",

I just hate it when a record skips. It's every DJ's nightmare in more ways than one.Goofs: In the radio station the DJ is talking with his Dynamic microphone in the wrong position. You don't talk on the side, you speak into the end of an Electro-Voice RE20 mic.It would seem given this movies title this logically will be the end of this 44 year old franchise.But we all know it won't be the last one despite the clues in the movies title and against all odds to what happens to Myers when the villagers get angry.There is plenty of foreshadowing as to how this Ends badly for Myers, but nothing prepares you for the kitchen scene that \"Iron Chef\" never expected.It will however be the last Halloween under the Blumhouse banner with the rights of the film series reverting to producer Malek Akkad following the release of Ends.Evil never ends it just takes a different shape.In the immortal words of \"Laurie Strode\" he's \"Not Dead Enough\"",

It's a progression from Halloween 2018's story centered around post-traumatic shock and generational trauma and Halloween Kills' story about mass terror leading to vigilantism and mob violence.I really wanted to like this movie but both the script and the directing lack finesse. This movie seems like a rough cut of a rough draft. Something happens in the very beginning of the movie with one character becoming so attracted to another in a way that is unmotivated and makes no sense. There are attempts to explain it but they falter because of weak writing. It's like green is constantly falling all over himself to get to the next plot point and the next, without slowing down to carefully construct each one of them to move more effectively to the next. This creates a weird kind of incoherence in terms of character development and story development. It even negatively impacts the thematic development because again, everything lacks finesse.There's been a lot of attention paid to the level of gore and graphic violence in David Gordon Green's trilogy. In some ways I guess I can understand what he's doing, kinda sorta. The problem with what I would call giving into current sensibilities around graphic on screen violence, and deciding to style these movies as entries in the modern Creative Killing horror cycle, which, ironically, started with the original Friday the 13th, which is self was a byproduct of Carpenter's Halloween, is it doing so makes these movies seem just like everything else that's out there now. Carpenters Halloween is often thought of as gorian violent, when in fact they probably used about a cup of fake blood. That was interesting and showed that Gore isn't necessary for effective horror. In fact, it can detract from it and become the center of attention.That is I would say one of the greatest weaknesses of Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. Green decided to Tarantino Halloween. I get using this style and sensibility with the middle film in the new series. But using that style so freely throughout the entire trilogy moves this new series too far from Carpenter's sensibility.By the time we get to the very conclusion of the movie I found it to be anti-climactic even though green actually ends it in kind of a cool way and really the way everyone has been saying for decades really needed to happen in order for there to be any coherent logic to the whole series of Michael Myers Halloween movies.This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's just really disappointing given that it would not have been difficult to tighten the script and the directing in a way that would have elevated it to 3 stars. If someone else with more objectivity had given the script a full reworking Halloween Ends could have been as good as Halloween 2018. It's a drag to see such a missed opportunity and one which will never come around again.",

I didn't read any reviews but I heard a few people who were already calling this movie trash.If you're not horror film fan, there's nothing wrong with that. Even I don't care for a lot of the scary movies that are out there. I say the Halloween movies have been my favorite cause they seem a little more believable than most of the others except for Michael Myers seeming near invincible.In recent years they've made new Halloween movies with a new time line. It goes Halloween 1978, Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills 2021, and Halloween Ends 2022. All the other movies are no longer cannon, just these four movies make up the story now. I think this may trip a lot of people up watching these current movies cause the story has changed.In my personal opinion, this is my favorite Halloween movie out of the new trilogy. The classic 1978 one will always be my favorite but Halloween Ends comes 2nd for me.There's plenty of callbacks and references to the original 1978 movie that are not overdone but just enough that they're rewarding for those that notice them.Jamie Lee Curtis did a fantastic job as well as most of the other actors. It kept my attention and the plot threads were interesting.1. There were returning characters but also new characters and they managed to make me build care for them.2. Even though the other Halloween movies no longer have any connection with this current storyline, they still used a bit of an element from Halloween 4 into the plot of this movie.3. The beginning of the movie is well setup in my opinion. The middle act is where you have to pay attention and I was wondering where the different plot points were headed. By the time of the final act came, I felt rewarded! Jamie's character wore similar clothing to when she first faced off against Michael in the first movie. That added touch made it clear that this is Jamie's last performance as Laurie Strode.",

Her role in \"Halloween Ends\" may have been redeeming, emotional, and long overdue. But the movie itself failed to give horror-genre fans the milestone we were anticipating.Remember, it's been four years since the characters in this movie last saw Michael Myers. The story made more sense when I kept this timeline in mind. Also, Laurie was being accused of provoking Myers into killing in earnest after he was caught and thrown in an asylum (in previous movies). These points enriched the plot of \"Halloween Ends\" in interesting ways. Sadly, the writers' decision to focus more on other characters for a major slice of the movie did not sit well with me, who has been a fan of this franchise for a while.Director David Gordon Green balanced old and new elements but ended up disappointing viewers by not giving us the courageous and determined Strode we came to see until the last twenty minutes of this 2-hour movie (!).Writers Paul Brad Logan, Chris Bernier, Danny McBride, and David Gordon Green did notable work scripting this multi-generational masterpiece in Horror. However, they did not quite attain the 'gold standard' I expected with \"Halloween Ends\". This was probably the last we were going to see of Strode and Myers yet the plot felt surprisingly imbalanced, and miserably so.Between Daniel A. Davies's musical scoring and the classic old-school tune from John and Cody Carpenter that has come to define this IP, \"Halloween Ends\" captured a little bit of the spirit of the iconic franchise. Michael Simmonds' cinematography was outstanding. He framed clear views of various sequences involving all the core characters. Great work all round by the editing, production design, stunts, and VFX teams. Set decoration and art direction were noteworthy. Good sound effects too. Nostalgic costume design by Emily Gunshor. The soundtracks were also good. The movie had little else worth praising.The single biggest name to remember in this movie was the iconic Laurie Strode, played by the amazing Jamie Lee Curtis. She gave her character a good redemptive arc that has to be seen to be appreciated. She was both bold and vulnerable, fed-up and tired, enraged and protective. Of all the movies in this saga, this was the most meaningful version of Laurie Strode I've witnessed. Sadly, her best scenes came in the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. Any comment on what all that media hype was about, Miramax and Blumhouse?Nick Castle and James Jude Courtney both reprised their roles as Michael Myers, aka The Shape. I'm sure they wanted to make him appear doubly dreadful and twice as frightening, but alas. 'Minimal Myers' became quite the disappointment for me. They barely showcased his character until the last thirty minutes, maybe less. This inadvertently allowed the original 1978 \"Halloween\" movie to hold on to its horror-crown.Will Patton as Frank was a good addition to the cast. Allyson (Strode's granddaughter), played by Andi Matichak, was memorable. Corey, played by Rohan Campbell, was outstanding. Mrs. Allen, played by Candice Rose, had good screen presence. Jeremy Allen, played by Jaxon Goldenberg, showed promise. Mr. Allen, played by Jack William Marshall, was notable.Terry, played by Michael Barbieri, was good. Billy, played by Marteen, was also good. Margo, played by Joey Harris, was captivating. RJ Willy the Kid, played by Keraun Harris, was great. Joan, played by Joanne Baron, was interesting, though she did over-do her character a little. Jesse C. Boyd as Mulaney was good. Deb (the nurse), played by Michele Dawson, was great.All other crew and cast did frightfully 'okay' work in \"Halloween Ends\", now showing in theatres and later streaming on Peacock TV. It was nice to experience the movie in theatres, though, especially since the only real entertainment came from overhearing people draw sharp breaths, mumble, laugh, giggle, or focus on doing other things, sometimes with each other.It took a while but Haddonfield eventually came alive, in a manner of speaking, when a certain masked baddie we all know and love, again in a manner of speaking, started doing what he did best. Why 'manner of speaking'? Because the writers apparently decided to pass the baton, of sorts, and focus more on Corey's cracked psyche than Myers' terrorizing rampage.It has been four years since Laurie last saw the 'boogeyman', but he was back to haunt her reality if only one last time, and that too as...wait for it...Corey (!). This became a self-destructive decision, especially since fans like myself sat through an almost 2-hour movie only to see Myers in action for all of fifteen or so minutes. That knife of his might as well have been driven through us.Then there were all those scenes through which the writers let us know just how much \"West Side Story\" apparently inspired them. Corey and Allyson's 'forbidden' relationship was great, but this was not the movie for it. The more they prolonged it, the more I felt Halloween better end, and soon.To be fair, the storyline felt nostalgic thanks in large part to the inclusion of several yesteryear creative choices, including that brilliant theme song and various Haddonfield settings. Also great was the way they used a few unaltered clips and snippets from the original movie. These decisions thankfully lent \"Halloween Ends\" a small sense of dedication to the classic Michael Myers story.Back to the truth... The script's empowerment angle was indistinct and imbalanced. Strode was supposedly a badass who was ready to take on Myers, if the movie's promotional hype was anything to go by. However, in addition to barely focusing on her character in this movie they also led her to almost commit suicide following her granddaughter's elopement with Corey.How did she even see Myers in Corey's eyes?! After all she has been through, why go out that way, and why go out when not even an hour had passed since Allyson left?! And why, for goodness' sake, did she pretend to take her own life for all of fifteen seconds before somehow spotting and firing a stalking Corey-Myers?! She even called the cops and alerted them to 'a suicide' in her home. (grips head in sheer confusion)Somewhere along the way, I had forgotten I was sitting through what was meant to be one heckuva curtain-call for Strode and Myers. It was such a let-down. In all honestly, I liked how this movie was not exclusively about Myers and Strode. The way they captured the blooming bond between Allyson and Corey was praiseworthy. But, like I said before, it was a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.There was also a deep psychological angle at play in the movie, and this was one of the few positive things about \"Halloween Ends\". The town of Haddonfield was still healing from the wounds that Michael Myers had ripped open in their community. Corey, on the other hand, was gradually succumbing to the townspeople's constant belief in his guilt concerning the accidental death of the kid Jeremy.His unplanned encounter and consequent misalliance with Myers was a result of people making an outcast out of him for a crime he wasn't intentionally responsible for. Myers spared his life, because he saw in Corey's eyes a killer, much like himself. There was no precedent for this, and no real conflict or motive either! Mr. Allen figured all this out, but then he disappeared off the plot-map. Also, the way they had Corey encounter Myers in the sewer felt like a Pennywise ripoff.It was also strange to see 'zombie Myers' behave so unlike himself for the better part of the movie, especially when he allowed Corey to take so many liberties in his presence. It made little to no sense, especially since good old Mike simply appeared from inside a crack in the underground sewer wall.Seeing the convenient almost lazy way in which the writers scripted Myers' role in \"Ends\" made me believe the Shape decided to turn numb to all logic and (here's my take on what unravelled) astral-project himself into Corey so he could use the boy's younger body to wreak havoc in Haddonfield, eventually leading to his face-off with Laurie (!!!). That's what it looked like, to all intents and purposes. And when the real Michael Myers finally decided to please stand up, he belatedly killed Corey who'd technically driven a frikkin' knife through his own throat a while ago and should've bled out by this time. Corey can't have missed his own brainstem with the knife he used and the angle he chose.Removing the mystery of Michael Myers wasn't the problem, but ridding Myers of his mystique most certainly was. Sigh, I really wish this movie was at least half as good as the hype said it would be. \"Halloween Ends\" was a criminally imbalanced farewell to one of the most beloved horror movie franchises (and characters) of our time. Corey died in utter vain, Myers was wielding previously unestablished paranormal powers, or so I think, and Laurie's (sweet Laurie's) age-old character arc was dishonored. And what an entire squad of local police did near the end, well, case closed.The anticipated end of Michael Myers didn't happen. Four writers worked on this project and together proved that too many cooks indeed spoil the broth. I wish a more fan-conscious team works on future projects in this IP. I don't know about Halloween ending, but the hopes of millions of horror-fans sure did. This movie was all tricks and no treats.Jamie Lee Curtis was unforgettable, which made me feel that much worse watching the atrocious sendoff she received in this movie. Maybe a future title will be \"Halloween's Dead\". I don't know who the next young Laurie Strode is going to be, but if I were her she better start getting in 'Shape'. Crappy Halloween, everyone.",

            "content": "Like the two previous installments in the new Halloween trilogy, I am also recommending Halloween Ends. Yup, I have David Gordon Green to mostly thank for that. I like the cinematic worlds David creates, the way he ties previous storylines together, and just the overall look of his flicks. He's a meat and potatoes filmmaker but he's a darn good meat and potatoes filmmaker. No camera tricks and some treats along the way (ha ha).With Halloween Ends, director Green creates another subplot, another spicy angle if you will. Otherwise \"Ends\" would be just another matinee slasher populated by brand new ways to off or be offed. The subplot just mentioned, is about a male character (Cory Cunningham played effectively by Rohan Campbell) who befriends Michael Myers, turns to the side of evil, and does some slaughtering himself. Trust me, there's some complexity to it, a sort of entanglement that matters until the windup of \"Ends\" doesn't fully matter at all.Halloween Ends is the first sequel I can remember where the main antagonist (in this case Myers) is almost in the backdrop or a virtual non-factor. I mean I've seen it before but it's been a long time ago (in a sequel galaxy far far away). Over and above, don't go into \"Ends\" thinking it's another requisite Halloween pic. Halloween Ends is more along the lines of being a knife-edge combo of Christine and some James Dean vehicle from '55 (it's that coming-of-age-stuff).Look for The Shape to still get his murder on (there's less of them but he's always on the job), look for another solid performance by Jamie Lee Curtis (obviously), look for some tight editing by Tim Alverson, and look for plenty of fast cutting flashbacks by Davey Green (he's feeling it people). Halloween Ends is one out of the box \"coda\". Natch.",

            "content": "I came into this movie with high expectations. Halloween 2018 was a masterpiece, Halloween Kills was confusing but fun, but I expected them to give us a memorable send off to an otherwise great trilogy. Safe to say, we didn't get that at ALL. Michael Myers, the MAIN antagonist of the entire Halloween franchise, was semi-present the entire film. Not only THAT, but he played second fiddle to Corey, the primary killer in this film. That's right, a completely NEW character in the trilogy had a higher body count than Michael FREAKING Myers in his own movie. Having multiple killers may have worked for franchises like Scream, but in a Michael Myers film?? NO one asked for that. For a killer that's supposed to transcend with each kill, they surrree did give Michael justice by having him appear weak in almost every scene he was in. I was just about to cut the film off after seeing Corey, a much smaller and much weaker man, overpower Michael and steal his mask, something that even the TOUGHEST of Michael's foes was never able to do. You'd think Laurie and Allyson would get MOST of the screen time, but it was mainly dedicated to Corey and HIS story. Fast forward to the \"highly anticipated\", and \"final showdown\" between Laurie and Michael, and that's where the movie REALLY began to stink something awful. The climax of the fight lasted no longer than 5 to 10 minutes tops, with Laurie dominating Michael for most of it. A slit throat, slit artery, and trash compactor wheels later, they killed off Michael Myers for good. The film was boring, the story plot went absolutely nowhere, the kills were PG compared to the previous two films, and it's easily one of the worst films in the franchise. As a huge Michael Myers and Halloween fan, this film was a low blow to diehard fans.",

His essence is still haunting the town. He may not have physically killed during that period, but the mental and emotional damage he left behind was deadly.Laurie's final confrontation and the town banning together to finish the job of destroying The Shape was a moment that just struck a nerve with me.

I know we're exploring her memoirs which is helping her heal but narration always seems lazy.There are zero likeable side characters which was one of the highlights of the last two films. From the over-the-top high school jock bullies to Allyson's two faced friend who was sleeping with the boss although she somehow wasn't on first name terms with him. You could be forgiven for utterly despising literally every character you were introduced to. Corey's mum, the doctor, the DJ, the sister of one of the survivors of the last movie, a homeless dude....even Allyson becomes unlikeable in the end.Lindsey Wallace and Frank Hawkins are completely wasted here. Honestly I don't know why they had Hawkins survive the first movie. He was stabbed in the neck and run over. Two further movies and he offered some vague love interest and a reference to Ben Tramer.Half the kills were offscreen so this film barely even meets the criteria of a decent slasher and falls well short of what fans ought to have expected.The one interesting theme about Corey being pushed over the edge by a paranoid and unforgiving townsfolk was completely undone by the inclusion of a team up. A TEAM UP! So what, Michael Myers recognised evil in Corey's eyes and let him go? I'm not having that any more that Laurie or a grieving father also judging Corey's descent into psychopathy with a single glance. It's just not believable.Additionally that descent took about 4 days. The same amount of time it took Allyson to decide she was so into this guy that she was ready to turn against her grandmother, despite everything they had suffered together, pack her bags and run off with him.I'm going to watch it again to see if I'm less angry 2nd time around but I'm going to struggle with the fact that the ultimate climax of this film series involved two pensioners fighting in a kitchen.I am glad they veered away from anything supernatural which seemed to be hinted at with Laurie's monologue at the end of the last instalment. Michael Myers is just a man and is completely and unambiguously dead.Just like this franchise.",

Nonetheless the movie serves as a somewhat satisfying conclusion to an overall good trilogy, although you are left griefing for what could have been. The ending is a bold but welcome move, seeing as Laurie Strode doesn't succumb to the all too common all trauma survivors must die trope and by letting Michael Myers die the movie conveys a message of hope, that although you may have to fight very hard for it, evil doesn't always win. Laurie finally being able to put Michael Myers behind her and live a somewhat happy life is a nice and satisfying conclusion to Laurie's struggle as a trauma survivor (and repeated endurer).

Until Michael makes another appearance and causing havoc with the killing sprees yet again.The film is different. It focuses on the new character Corey majority of the film. Watching him struggle with his insanity after dealing with a tragic night. Also the film struggles with its pacing and its very slow until things slowly pick up towards the end when Michael shows up. For a Halloween film with Corey and Laurie dealing with there struggles eighty percent of the film and the rest is Michael making an appearance does make it one disappointing finale.The cast is okay with there performances. Rohan Campbell did okay playing Corey. The kills are brutal and gory. It does hold back compared to the previous film. The climax with Laurie and Michael is a bit tedious. Which could have been better.Halloween Ends is a fair film and it struggles with its pacing, horror thrills, and its new direction does end it feeling very indifferent compared to the previous films.",

            "content": "I appreciate the filmmakers' attempt at something different with Halloween Ends. After all, this is (supposed to be) the end, and it should be both emotional and satisfying. This film was neither. It does tackle some pretty big issues - evil, love, bullying, forgiveness - but the script isn't up to it. It's a poet's heart with a tin ear.The introduction of the Corey character could've been interesting, but not for this film. It simply muddies the water. As I mentioned earlier, it's a daring approach, but none of it worked. There's almost zero emotional connection to any of the characters, including Laurie, and that disconnect is the kiss of death for any movie.Halloween Ends isn't a horrible movie. It's well shot and the acting holds up. It just doesn't complete the story arc (like it thinks it does), and that leaves it feeling misplaced and hollow.",

            "content": "I'm not a huge horror fan, as I got older my appetite for gore has decreased so this movie was a breath of fresh air.I've watched the Halloween franchise movies for many years but I do enjoy the movies with Jamie Lee Curtis the most, and this particular trilogy has been the most enjoyable. In my opinion the series had the ending it deserved. Throughout the years Michael Myers was elevated to this mythical undying ghoul who terrorizes people leading up to halloween, but this movie gave him his comeuppance. I liked the fact that it was an actual movie and not just a gorefest like many of the previous movies. I liked that blood wasn't the main character making an appearance every other frame. Many people criticize the movie saying Michael came off as geriatric and slow but that's exactly what he is. If you take into account Michael was about 21 when he made his first appearance then he would be around his 80s. So yes he should be geriatric, slow and wounded cause he was wounded last time we saw him plus he's old and old folks don't heal as fast. He did retain some of the supernatural factor but bottom line, he is just like Laurie said, \"just a man.\"\nI really enjoyed the ending he received so that there is no bs about him surviving. His end was very appropriate in saying without saying that he bleeds just like any other human, and yet in the end it is Michael's blood which spills the most. He was the boogeyman man and that boogeyman was given the end he deserved.The story line about Corey makes sense in the fact that we see so many stans obsessing over him and wanting him to be real. Corey became what he became because that's what he was in the eyes of the town and he was never gonna be anything else. His story was also given the end he deserved by Michael because there's only 1 of him.So if you like horror without the gore you will enjoy this particular end of an era.",

I mean, I gotta hand it to them, they actually committed to killing him off. But come on, we all know the one thing that could bring him back. Anyway, it had some decent ideas, however, it had a lot more just baffling ideas, and all in all, it was just so poorly executed. I mean, there are chunks of this movie that doesn't even feel like a Halloween Michael Myers movie. The last half hour is written like a sitcom. No more Halloween movies please, unless it's the long awaited sequel to Season of the Witch, which even then, I don't want Blumhouse or David Gordon Green near.According to the director, rather than being an over the top slasher film like Kills. Ends is a \"intimate coming of age story\". This is the wrong franchise to do that with man. It doesn't work. This movie is just a big f you to how this trilogy started. Michael Myers survived a fire at the end of the 2018 movie, and you're telling me a single snap of the elbow is going to kill him off? How anticlimactic.There really isn't a way or reason to do more sequels, reboots, or whatever to the traditional series. I'm just so done with Michael Myers. Laurie Strode became one of the most annoying slasher movie characters between Kills and Ends. This is a trilogy I don't plan on ever watching again. I mean, I think 2018 movie is okay, Kills was kinda fun, but I just don't know about Ends. Just watch the original three films for your Halloween fix.",

            "content": "There's movies out there that sometimes take bold chances and go against the viewers expectations. Halloween Ends is one of those movies. This will no doubt be a very divisive movie for many and it will all depend just from what the viewer is looking for. It was an extremely broad and yet bizarre decision to do for the third and final film of this trilogy. I personally enjoyed the concept and found it to be pretty ambitious with a decent payoff. It still explores the big theme that has hovered over all three of these movies, the embodiment of Evil. It also helps the film stand out and not just feel like another run of the mill slasher. Especially given the fact it's the 13th film in this whole franchise. What I was really hoping mostly was a satisfying conclusion to this Laurie and Michael Saga & I'm pleased to say by its last 15 minutes I don't think it couldve ended more satisfying. Jamie Lee Curtis leaves her mark one final time as Laurie Strode with her most compelling take on the character. Andi Matichak is still excellent as Laurie's granddaughter Allyson and newcomer Rohan Campbell as Corey makes it tragic and believable as a broken wing character.Although the suspense couldve been greater and some aspects couldve been more fleshed out, Halloween Ends still manages to make for a real nail biter of a conclusion while also being ambitious. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but as a lifelong fan of this series and seeing everywhere it's went, it's definitely been in much worse places than this. Thank you David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as everyone else involved in this Trilogy for breathing new life into Haddonfield's Boogeyman as well as never demystifying him. Now let's bury this franchise in the ground already.",

This movie wasn't scary and there was very minimum kills and gore compared to the last two. Everything that could have went wrong... DID. I walked in the theater with low expectations and still was dissatisfied at the end of it. The movies a mess and there's too much to point out that was poor. As much as we all want this serious to die, I really hope this isn't the end of Micheal Myers because it is the worst possible end imaginable. After all the gnarly movies this is what it ended on...

I incorrectly thought that people enjoyed Halloween kills as well and was looking forward to seeing it. When I saw Halloween kills I was amazed at how absolutely horrendous it was. I can suspend disbelief when it comes to stupid decisions made by characters but the level of stupidity that the director allowed in the film was mind-boggling. I thought it was horrendous. When I saw the ratings of this one I was bummed out because I was hoping it would be good but I think that this film is critically underscored. By no means was it a perfect film but it was hands down the best of the three sequels in my opinion. Spoilers absolutely coming right now so if for some reason you are still reading and do not want to be spoiled, I would suggest leaving. I have been saying for years that I just want them to put him in a wood chipper or something. When they actually have the opportunity to kill him do something that he can't possibly come back from. And for the first time in the history of halloween, when they had him they followed up. I enjoyed the side story of the boyfriend slowly going crazy as well. I love to how gory the film was and I think it was a good conclusion to an asinine amount of films. I mean we have basically three separate groups of sequels that take the film in different story lines. I like Halloween H2O despite its flaws and I hated Halloween resurrection. I enjoyed Halloween for and five was okay but not as good as for and six was horrendous. But as bad as Halloween kills was I think Halloween was really good and Halloween ends was a great conclusion. I know this is not a popular opinion but I personally do not care. I thought that this movie is exactly what it needed to be and was a fitting end to Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis as Lori strode. I do not want to see any more with Jamie Lee curtis. I love her but I think this is it and needs to remain it. Not that they could really bring back mashed mush Michael but I think the Halloween franchise just needs to not be touched or a decade and if they can think of a way to reboot it in a way that it will be good then fine but this may not be a popular opinion but I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that they ended it the way they did.

It's more of a slow burn psychological horror like The Shining or John Carpenter's Christine with some Romero and Juliet elements. This movie is ballsy af and I applaud them for this new direction.First, I absolutely love David Gordon Green's direction and imo this is his best out of the three films. This is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's best performance as the iconic Laurie Strode and the character's best arc in the trilogy as well as her onscreen granddaughter, Andi Matichak whose character finally got the great amount of development I've been asking for since the 2018 film. James Jude Courtney as the Shape/Michael Myers has won me over as the best Michael since Halloween Kills and just like in Ends, he still proves himself as the best. Last, newcomer, Rohan Campbell gave a fine performance as this new character, Cory Cunningham and people will have some opinions over this character and I've heard mixed responses but I lean a little more so on the positive side.This is an unique, bold kind of ending but I welcome it. The kills for you gorehounds are there but they aren't as gory as last year's Halloween Kills (maybe except for one particular kill which I was surprised they got away with from the MPA) but definitely more story and character driven. There are a few negatives that I can't discuss without spoiling.This is a satisfying conclusion to the Laurie vs Michael saga and the end of an era. Watch this with an open mind and you will appreciate certain aspects of it whether you end up liking it or not. Lastly, the epic fight we have been waiting for is absolutely brutal, intense, and bloody (it makes H20's fight look tame). This is must see theater experience and not a streaming experience.",

I'm aware it's not for everyone, but it is for me.Obviously I've followed the franchise through its sequels and remakes. And while there have been some highlights there have been many, MANY more disappointments.The half-hearted \"Halloween II\" from 1981 - which Carpenter didn't want to write and it shows. The decent \"Halloween IV\" followed by the inane \"Halloween V\" that bottled out on the ending set up by IV. The enjoyable H20 followed by the absolute disaster that was \"Halloween: Resurrection\". The interesting Rob Zombie remake followed by the WTF Zombie sequel.Halloween fans are used to having our hopes raised, then dashed, is what I'm trying to say.And now we have the conclusion to the new trilogy. Sadly, it's a familiar sinking feeling we're left with. After the superior 2018 movie, my hopes were high indeed that THIS time we'd get good, coherent sequels to finally finish out the story.And despite the spotty and inconsistent \"Halloween Kills\" I still held on to hope. It was a middle part after all. David Gordon Green and Danny McBride could still bring it home for \"Ends\".But.Sadly.Not.I've read DGG's comments that the plot of \"Ends\" was always intended. Maybe it was. But it's a sad reflection on the story that ends up being told here, that it FEELS like the writers were fired after \"Kills\" and replaced by someone told to do a complete 180 on what had come before.The complete change in character on the parts of Laurie and Allyson is the most jarring problem with \"Ends\". Laurie goes from guarded survivalist to unguarded optimist. The reason, we are told, is that she has learned to move past fear.I mean. That's lovely for Laurie. But hard to swallow when it happens offscreen in between a movie which ended in tragedy and slaughter and this one.Allyson is even worse. From an intelligent, open-minded young woman who wants to understand her grandmother's trauma, she has now regressed into a whiny, irritant who refuses to listen to her grandmother's (understandable and reasonable) warnings.There is seemingly no reason for their character overhaul other than the story needs them to be different people than the ones we met in earlier films.I didn't have so much of a problem with Corey and at least his character journey did make some sort of sense. All the same, it did muddy this movie's intended (I think) message about letting go of fear. Actually it contradicts that message entirely.It's not all bad news. There are some parts of \"Ends\" that I enjoyed. But that's the frustrating part. I can't like the film as a whole. I can enjoy it only sporadically.And there it is; the story of the whole franchise. Hugely enjoyable in parts, massively frustrating at others. It is no wonder that we Halloween fans constantly come up with new ways to watch these films - (Halloween 78, Halloween II 81, H20) or (Halloween 78, Halloween 2018) - and pretending those other movies just never happened.I'm afraid that \"Ends\" ends up in that same bin - and along with it, the middle part \"Kills\" as well. They can be filed alongside Busta Rhymes's kung fu, Rob Zombie's white horses and Silver Shamrock's masks.",

I'm shocked John Carpenter wanted his name associated with this mess. I'm glad they made money on their opening weekend, I can't imagine that will continue once the real reviews become available. This is proof that you should just stop making insane sequels and try and squeeze more revenue out of such a beloved original.",

Also, the guy was a terrible actor and it just made no sense. Sure, he was exposed to some bad stuff, but to all of a sudden to want to become a serial killer?And for that new guy to be able to be around Michael, fight him, and not be killer himself for the majority of the movie was completely ridiculous.I really hope a directors cut, or different version, comes out. This movie put a stain on this whole franchise. What a complete and utter disappointment on every single level.",

And while a TNG sort of franchise builder is acceptable, this is not the way to segue in. This is more a random ending to the old guard, minimizing them in the cinematic universe they built.The Corey story line is not without redemption, however. It's a sort of Christine/Stephen King wannabe plot of a geek turned wrong.And maybe (maybe) if I'd gone in knowing it was a TNG focus, I wouldn't have been so salty about what was done.On the other hand, some of the humor felt forced to me.

            "content": "Halloween, the original 1978 one is a movie I love. I think it's fun, it's well-paced, it's just a great slasher movie. I never watched any of the other Halloween movies until the 2018 one. I think the 2018 one is a fine movie. I was ok with it because I thought \"Hey, this is a new team of creators. This is their first try. I'm sure the others will be better.\"Then, Halloween Kills came out. I think it was mediocre, at best. Weird mob thing, side characters becoming main characters; it wasn't the movie I was expecting. And I was disappointed. But I was ok with it. Because I thought \"Hey, they wanted to do something new. And we will get the Laurie vs. Micheal movie I was expecting this to be in the next one. I'm sure Ends will be better.\"I can't believe it, because they had one job. ONE job. ONE! Laurie vs Micheal. I gave you a promise not to spoil anything and I will keep that promise, for sure. Don't worry. But I need you to know that this movie only has 15 minutes of Laurie vs Micheal. They are promoting it like this is the ultimate showdown. They are promoting it like that's the main story. It's not. It's definitely not.What is the main story? Well, I can't tell you because it's a spoiler. But here is a basic summary of the beginning of the movie. 4 years has passed after the events of Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills. Laurie and her granddaughter Allyson are living together. Allyson is having a difficult life. She doesn't have much friends. And she has become an outsider to the people of Haddonfield. But one day, she meets a boy named Corey. And her life changes.Yeah, Allyson and Corey's relationship is the main story of this movie. Then in the last 40 minutes, this movie remembers that it's a horror/slasher. And in the final 15 minutes, it remembers that it's the movie that ends Laurie and Micheal's stories. Jaime Lee Curtis is not the focus of the movie, again. But as always, she does a good job. Andi Matichak is playing Allyson and she is one of the characters that the movie focuses on.While I liked her in 2018 and Kills, I unfortunately don't think neither the actress nor the character is good enough to be in a starring role. But she isn't the star of this movie either actually. The main character of this movie is Corey, played by Rohan Campbell. I really liked his character at first. Campbell was great in the role and the movie really introduces this character. Unfortunately, both the romance and a twist in the midpoint of the movie regarding his character is very sloppy.These 2 are not bad ideas, but they are so rushed, so sloppy and so different from what you expect this movie to be. I couldn't believed my eyes. Nick Castle and James Jude Courtney are playing Micheal Myers AKA The Shape. They are good as always but I just wished they were in the movie. They have 10, maybe 15 minutes of screen time max. I am not joking.The movie is not scary. There is literally nothing scary in the 40 minutes. And up until the 1 hour and 15 minutes mark, the killing spree doesn't start. So yeah, pacing is horrible. The movie is directed by David Gordon Green. It's fine. The writing though is horrible. And I am not even talking about the fact that the writers came up with a Laurie-less story for the final Halloween movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis. That's a whole another, thing.I am talking about this story, the one they came up with. I already talked about how rushed it feels. Dialogues are also not good in most cases. And the ending, while it made sense in a way; because of the short final confrontation, I think it didn't make the impact the writers thought it would. These writers are Paul Brad Logan, Chris Bernier, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green himself. Good job guys, keep up the good, actually terrible, work.Halloween Ends is horrible. It's a disaster. It's a romantic comedy about a character you don't care about and a character you see for the first time; promoted as the final chapter of a long running, genre defining horror movie featuring a character you deeply care about and a character, a monster you have been watching for 40 years. Halloween is over. It should be over. Maybe it should have been over a long time ago.",

The stars of Halloween are Michael and Laurie but they become sidelined for some reason and the plot tends to spend more time concentrating on mini Michael and Laurie's granddaughter love affair and how mini Michael becomes a killer. Don't get me wrong these aren't bad ideas but they're timing is all off, it would make much more sense if they explored this stuff at the start of the trilogy and then it wouldn't feel so out of place in the final movie of a trilogy. Nothing really makes sense and doesn't really follow any of the logic created in this universe, why is Michael so weak at times but so strong at others? Or why is Laurie so strong? Is Michael supernatural and does he have powers? Also the movie takes itself far too seriously, the narration by Laurie which serves as a reference to the fact she's writing a novel is just so corny and doesn't work. The movie is so full of itself and completely forgets what people watch Halloween movies for and that's to see Michael kill and to see how the his and Laurie's arc finish and while we get that it's pretty much an afterthought, something the writers decided to just throw in at the end of the movie to validate them making this movie and keep fans happy but it was ineffective as the movie was spent exploring a bunch of new stuff that fans aren't really going to care for as it's far too late in the trilogy for people to invest in any of it. Seems like there's far too many writers with too many different ideas and it just doesn't gel together, it almost feels like a movie that wasn't supposed to be a Halloween movie and was written to be something completely different. I'd honestly like to see somebody else take a crack at the franchise one last time as I feel the fans deserve an end to the story.",

I mean he was already hated, discriminated against, and feared so why not make him the next source of absolute evil? This would have been the perfect time to do so as we are saying goodbye to our original beloved characters, Laurie and Michael. Their stories should have ended that night. Michael by Laurie as he had been the bane of her existence, and Laurie by Cory - his new protege - and someone who Laurie would have not seen coming. The story should have followed Allison and her new love/rilvary with Cory. The end should have had conflict between them and more horror within the town throughout the movie.Bad storyline, bad script and terrible used of Kyle Richards who should have been a bigger part of the film, either as a final girl or a final victim.

The Halloween series of films has definitely been a bumpy one, to say the least, but I really enjoyed the 2018 continuation that lead to this new trilogy. It was that film that kept me hanging on to see where they were going with it. They almost lost me with Halloween Kills, being a very mediocre film that didn't really serve a purpose, but I hung on for one last round, but I'm really not sure why I did. I was holding out hope that this franchise would end up with some very cool conclusion, but it really doesn't. Whether you're a fan or not, here's why I believe Halloween Ends isn't worth your time.It has been four years since the return of Michael Meyers in 2018, and while Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is sidelined throughout the majority of this film, we begin to focus on a new character. After Corey (Rohan Campbell) experiences a very traumatic event, he does his best to recover but seems to begin having feelings for Laurie's Granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). The two of them form a bond and a lot of the run time is devoted to their storyline. The character development of Corey is the entire point of the film, but I kept asking myself why. For a final film that's all about wrapping up the story of Laurie and Michael, I don't quite understand how that's barely a part of this film at all.The entire first and second acts of this film are mostly about new characters, which makes no sense when audiences are clearly waiting for Michael Meyers to appear again. Laurie seems to have moved on from everything when this film begins and since it's four years later, we don't even really get to feel any of the aftermath of the previous film. I'm baffled by how this film plays out honestly. Much like my thoughts on Jurassic World: Dominion earlier this year, it's a finale that doesn't even focus on what the one promise of the film is. It's also barely filled with tension or any moments of terror in the slightest.In the end, I kept asking myself why this film was even made. The point was to wrap up this franchise, and even though I would say it does, it just didn't feel like a Halloween movie. It feels like you're watching one by the end, but that's only in the last 10-20 minutes. This franchise had lost its way a lot in the past, but I was thinking it was back on track when that 2018 film came out. Sadly, I had my hopes way too high. This review may seem like less of a critique and more of a rant, but that's honestly because nothing of note even happens in this film to talk about. David Gordon Green does a fine job directing these films, but this film just wasn't what every Halloween before it was. Halloween Ends, considering how much I liked 2018s Halloween and how much I was looking forward to a real conclusion, is very, very disappointing.",

Generally it works fine, other times it descends into cut-and-paste TV movie recyclables.There are some nice moments, and the third act puts the train back on the tracks, but it's too little too late.Overall the bulk of the story buildup to the finale felt like absolutely the wrong direction.I'm all for changing things up to keep it a bit fresh, however in this case I feel that they went overboard with that and should have stayed closer to the tone of the first two in this trilogy.Which is kind of sad because up until now I was all-in with this new storyline.",

The writers and the director actually went with \"hey, do you know what would be a great finale to a franchise spanning 40 plus years with now 13 films to its name?What?Making the entire film about a brand new character that no one's invested in or will care about. Yep, and that's what we got. I feel like this trilogy had the sequel star wars trilogy output, in that they didn't actually have the trilogy mapped out.This film is nothing like the trailer at all. Michael is barely in it and when he is he's barely doing anything.Instead, 90% of this movie is about Corey. Who? That's right no one knows or cares\nSo, Corey is this young guy who gets really unlucky, people mistreat him and turn on him, so he slowly turns into this monster they all think he is but with increasingly cringey dialogue and acting.

It can therefore be said that nothing within is all too worthy of running home about. That being said, the last few sequences of the movie are enjoyable in spite of the corniness accompanying their execution. There is an additionally good score, which is unfortunately the only element of the picture that works. What holds this movie down fittingly resembles much of what held down not only the previous endeavor, but also the other middling to atrocious films of the franchise. This is epitomized by the detrimental lack of focus on both Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. These characters have essentially no real direct influence on the plot until the very end. From the beginning, then, the film actually feels to belong to a separate franchise and pre-established premise altogether. This is not helped by how unlikable every character besides Laurie and Michael are, leading to a product that drowns out any hints of a good performance. Matichak's Allyson particularly suffers as her character ridiculously begins to embody a clich\u00e9 teenager while no longer being a teenager. The central role is additionally somehow none of the three aforementioned, the writers choosing to introduce a new character nobody in the audience would come to care all too much about. His storyline simply does not correlate to Michael's or Laurie's in any really significant way, even if the filmmakers want the audience to believe it does. There are also simply too many worthless characters thrown into the story, and a lack of development that does not justify bringing back others from the trilogy beyond face recognition. The dialogue throughout is awful, too, with multiple characters stating lines that make no sense in any capacity. On the technical side, the production is bland even if crisply shot and the soundtrack utilized is hilariously unfit to the \"crafted\" atmosphere. This plays into the middling tension-building that spoils many scenes, as the audience could not care less about most of the characters placed in danger.

Halloween Ends is the end of a trilogy, so they had to wrap things up and \"deal with\" Michael, of course. The dark fantasy I was initially promised disintegrated into self-referential sentimentality by the third act.But all in all this movie was a respectable end to the modern Halloween arc. It made me want to go back and rewatch the whole trilogy. So, I give it a respectable 6/10.",

I get how a true Halloween genre fan might not like this movie since it doesn't fit the cookie cutter Halloween franchise. But, honestly it was different in a good way. I liked how it ended. So with that said I gave it a higher rating because I just feel like it was unfairly rated so low by so many reviewers. The opening was unexpected and good. I don't honestly know how Michael Meyers was living in a drain? Was that his retirement home? I don't get that part. All of a sudden Michael stopped his murder rampage and lived in a drain. Honestly that part made no sense to me and I feel like that could have been thought out better. The rest was a go for me. Just don't go into it thinking it's gonna be like the rest of the Halloween movies.",

She wasn't even shown at the junkyard to witness Michael's death!Michael getting beaten up by a weak nerd before doing a Batman & Robin team-up that looked like something out of Scream with two versions of Ghostface running around, vintage Michael Myers!Why kill Michael so beyond definitively when it's a known FACT that the franchise will be rebooted again? Now it's a guaranteed \"boy who cried wolf\" scenario where everyone will instantly bash and make fun of the reboot. \"So he's back AGAIN after getting SHREDDED in Halloween ENDS????

            "review_title": "Halloween was never about Myers, it was about the evil that took his shape.",
            "content": "Where do I begin.First off, it seems like a few decades ago, a bunch of psycho obsessed basement dwellers was having a similar conversation about another third instalment of a Halloween movie for not having Myers in it as much. But I don't seem to recall. This is literally the Season Of The Witch thing all over again. The series was never meant to be about Myers from the start. You all just wanted him to be on the same vein as Jason or Leatherface and even then you got them wrong too.Where to even begin. Whenever you see the actor that plays Myers in the suit and mask, he's not referred to in credits as Michael Myers. His unmasked adult form has his full name on it, but not any one of them wearing the suit. He was often always credited as \"The Shape.\" Why? Because he stopped being a human being once suited up and started being a representative of the very Evil that gave him power.People seem to forget that when people like Loomis or Laurie or anyone that doesn't buy into the BS that Myers is a human being that needs to be understood and referred to down to the pronouns of he/him as opposed to them saying \"It.\", dismiss him as pure evil for a reason.We don't know exactly what kind of Evil fuels Myers and gives him power and even the first two movies of this trilogy gave only vague clues of what it can do. Such as give Myers strength and durability, corrupt Sartain in his failed attempt at figuring Myers out, cause a town to form an angry mob out of sheer panic and anger, which is misplaced not once, but a lot of times from Halloween Kills to the end of this movie.At this point you're all confused, you're wondering why I am describing this Evil as if it's it's own character. Because it is. It's a mysterious, possibly otherworldly entity, that feeds on fear and gives strength to it's emissaries. People were focused on one main bad guy since 1978 and they failed to realize there are two. Myers you can see, this Evil you can't and that makes it all the more scarier. Even the things that seem to be out of character from characters we've grown to love like Allyson, that to me is just an example of that evil at work. Using Corey to influence her and corrupt her.Myers may be gone for good in this continuity, but as shown with Corey and by Laurie's account the next potential Boogeyman that will eventually come to this town, as long as Evil is still alive, there is gonna be more shapes.Few things the most distasteful reviewers failed to realize is that words are everything. When David Gordon Green said that he wasn't gonna make Myers supernatural he did exactly as he said. What's that you say? He shrugged off, gunshot wounds stabs and a beat down from an angry mob, then got nerfed? Hahaha no. First off, Green said Michael Myers isn't gonna be supernatural. He didn't say anything about the Evil that fuels him. Myers was never supernatural because he wasn't the one causing his abilities. Second off, Myers is old, he's been in hiding for 4 years living off whatever food he could get his hands on and all the injuries starting with the ones Laurie inflicted on him in 1978, are finally catching up to him. That's not him getting nerfed, that's the Evil realizing that if it keeps up with it's current shape, there won't be a current shape. It's why Myers was able to further corrupt Corey, the Evil was already leaving and once it found a younger host in Loomis' words \"The Evil is Gone.\"To put it plainly. Myers didn't really do anything throughout the franchise proper. The Evil did. The Shape. Same with Corey, had Laurie and Myers not stop him in his tracks, that Evil would have made him just as strong, if not thanks to his youth, stronger since he's younger than when Myers started the 1978 spree.The movie is not too bad at least to me. I was able to understand and respect where they were going with this and honestly, I think at this point since Carpenter is returning to the director chair once more, he should probably greenlight his other \"Halloween Anthology\" ideas. By the way if Carpenter approves this trilogy which judging by him still doing music for all three movies, then it's canon. If it's canon, then you all have no right to complain because you'd be insulting the very guy you claim to be defending the merits of. If you all, honestly think that after all these decades that Halloween is strictly about Michael and Laurie, then you never understood this horror in the first place. It's way above the typical slasher shlock you all crave endlessly.",

I'm immensely confused as to why there needed to have been a third film in the series, it truly didn't add anything to the conclusion of the story. I feel like two films would've been good enough, maybe if the third film was good I would have a different perspective. 2 hours of this film was was too long, it felt like they had way too much going on and the directors were trying to convince us that there was need for a third film. Some of the scenes didn't make sense or weren't cohesive with what followed afterwards. Michael was weak, then started mentoring a new generation Michael only to end up killing him, regained his strength from somewhere and eventually ended up in a grinder. Laurie was happy, then became suspicious of her nieces new boyfriend, pretended to be suicidal only to trick 'Michael' and Michael then actually was suicidal but for a split second because she had to kill the real Michael. The only reason I'm giving the film 5/10 is mainly due in part to the fact that this will be the last time we see Jamie Lee portray Laurie Strode, and because the few jump scares that were there genuinely caught be off guard. I can't with full confidence call this a proper ending to a film nor would I call it a Halloween film. If it weren't for Laurie and Michael this would genuinely be a run of the mill horror film. I would suggest people skip this film, but that's just my personal opinion.",

It gave the story a way to mature properly. It shouldn't be expected to be a non-stop thriller. Expect a story to get the characters where they need to be.

Whoever it was, obviously doesn't watch horror movies because they tried something similar in the Friday the 13th series and it was met with similar condemnation. People tune into Halloween movies to see Michael Myers, not a copycat.The audience is left with so many questions. For example: at the end of Halloween Kills, Laurie tells Michael she's coming for him, but four years later she goes the complete opposite route and tries to live a life with her granddaughter. Michael is still at large, albeit for four years.The character of Allison SHOULD be a great character, but instead she get pigeon holed into falling for terrible people (Cameron, Officer Doug, Corey). In the span of four days she falls hard for Corey, who wear a facial expression that shouts \"I'm a serial killer\" throughout the whole film. While on the subject of Corey, are we supposed to feel bad for him? He legitimately did kill that kid. The very moment he realized the kid was playing a prank on him, he should have tempered his reaction and not gone ballistic on the door, hitting the kid and sending him over the railing to his death.To get back to Michael Myers, in the last film they established that the more he kills, the stronger he gets, so I was expecting the film to progress with Corey feeding him victims and he gains strength and return to his former power. Unfortunately this never came to be. Instead we get pretty much nothing until the very end of the film.Who among the filmmakers thought this was good?

I also loved the flashbacks to 1978 too, it made me feel nostalgic and made sense for the plot and fir the fans. And Michael being injured and the newbie working w him because he saw the evil in him was a great story point. ( I thought going into this that Laurie would kill Michael and then this guy would become the new shape ) I was half right. But good triumphing over evil 44 years later is really what we all want to see, isn't it ? Laurie is the protagonist and it has to end somewhere after almost 45 years! Not more Halloween Kills which was almost worst in the franchise next to the Resurrection. Gore galore. That's not what the first Halloween movies was about. They used next to no blood and it was super suspenseful, like a Hitchcock film. Nothing has been as good as the original and it's because it's never been explained why after all these years is Michael hunting Laurie Strode. Why? Because she approached his childhood house and her friends yelled at his speeding car??? Since Jaime Lee Curtis insisted on erasing the sequels there was no story reasoning. At least the brother / sister storyline made some sense. But years of being a fan, I wanted some answers that alas didn't come. It feels to me that maybe JLC had too much influence as a producer about how her time on the series and the franchise would end. That's never good but that's probably how they lured her back to do this trilogy w the promise that she could have final say on how it would end. Obviously, reading these reviews, not a fan choice.

Don't get me wrong these aren't bad ideas but they're timing is all off, it would make much more sense if they explored this stuff at the start of the trilogy and then it wouldn't feel so out of place in the final movie of a trilogy. Nothing really makes sense and doesn't really follow any of the logic created in this universe, why is Michael so weak at times but so strong at others? Or why is Laurie so strong? Is Michael supernatural and does he have powers? Also the movie takes itself far too seriously, the narration by Laurie which serves as a reference to the fact she's writing a novel is just so corny and doesn't work. The movie is so full of itself and completely forgets what people watch Halloween movies for and that's to see Michael kill and to see how the his and Laurie's arc finish and while we get that it's pretty much an afterthought, something the writers decided to just throw in at the end of the movie to validate them making this movie and keep fans happy but it was ineffective as the movie was spent exploring a bunch of new stuff that fans aren't really going to care for as it's far too late in the trilogy for people to invest in any of it. Seems like there's far too many writers with too many different ideas and it just doesn't gel together, it almost feels like a movie that wasn't supposed to be a Halloween movie and was written to be something completely different.

The thought of killing Laurie may be what's keeping him going. Michael is coming to the end of his tragic, violent, senseless life. Corey provides him some comfort, albeit briefly. Michael may see Corey as a much younger version of himself, or perhaps nearing death, Michael allows Corey in for the purpose of human connection. But that respite is short-lived, the emptiness returns, and killing Laurie becomes the last thing on his to-do list (again).Loved the leaves blowing around, the trick or treaters, the reflections of the Boogie Men appearing throughout, the kills similar to 1978, the music, Lindsay, Blue Oyster Cult, and of course the Jack o Lanterns \ud83c\udf83, it all works!",

They meet, yell at each other for a day and a half, then decide to run away together.There's zero suspense, there's no explanation for why any of the characters do the things they do, say the things they say, or act the way they act.The movie is nothing more than people pretending to be human, a killing spree that literally happens just to happen, then a final confrontation that's there just to end the movie. Nothing is ever set up to drive this non-story forward. Which is a shame, because the new trilogy had such a fantastic start with Halloween 2018 and yeah, Halloween Kills was a thematic and visual mess, but at least it continued the story from the previous movie. Halloween Ends barely does that if it even does it at all. Halloween 6 and Halloween Resurrection at least had the decency to carry on from their respective predecessors.Halloween definitely ended. As should any and all consideration to let Blumhouse and Danny McBride have any future involvement in this franchise.",

            "content": "This is my movie review for Halloween Ends expect spoilers throughout.After a tragic accident involving the death of a boy whilst in the care of babysitter Corey in the pre credits scene before we return to the main characters of the film.Allyson is living with Laurie and working as a nurse. Laurie is writing a novel about her experiences in Haddonfield and Michael Myers.It is not long before newcomer Corey gets to know Allyson and a disturbing romance develops, along with the deterioration of Corey's mental health.Towards the midpoint of the film Corey comes across Michael Myers who has been living in the sewers strangely enough. He is attacked and before you know it Corey becomes a copycat killer who murders anyone who has done him wrong.Allyson seems almost oblivious as to how dangerous despite numerous warnings from Laurie. The film continues to revolve primarily around Corey's murder spree and closeness with Allyson. There are scenes here and there involving Laurie and the survivor of the previous film Lindsay plus limited appearances of Michael and even less of him killing the townsfolk.Events come to a head when Corey and Michael separately arrive at Laurie's home for a confrontation. Corey's one is minor although it is the final one with Michael that viewers have been waiting for!When all is said and done, the film did not reach or surpass many peoples expectations, mine were not high to begin with.The character of Lindsay was greatly underused when after the first half of the film viewers never see her again without any explanation. She is not killed off and she doesn't reunite later on with Laurie or Allyson, no more scenes with Michael in the film. This lead me to believe if another film for whatever reason was made her character could brought back yet again.I do think for the most part Laurie's character was done justice and had more screen time than what she had in Halloween Kills. She also had some prominent quotes to say in her book which makes certain things regarding evil make sense.It was the use of Michael's character that bothered me the most. He was just completely different from before with the exception of a few scenes. He was clearly weaker and more vulnerable that before and hiding away in the sewers didn't really seem plausible. To see him in only a few scenes before his fight with Laurie was lackluster.I understanding that the writers were trying to do something much different with this storyline although it deserved a better conclusion than the one it received.I can see the Halloween franchise returning one way or another to commemorate the 50th anniversary in 2028.I would rate this film 5 out of 10.",

The more we know about him, the less effective he becomes. This severely limits the type of stories and plots you can put the character in.This movie is similar in concept to Friday the 13th part V: A New Beginning, and Jason Goes to Hell. Both of those movies tried to do something different with Jason Voorhees, and both failed.Considering this is now the 13th film in the Halloween franchise, David Gordon Green made a brave decision to change things up a bit. A better option would be to simply stop making Halloween movies. Halloween (1978) is still the best, and tells you all you need to know about Michael Myers.But don't worry, if you love 'The Shape', just wait a few years for the next mindless reboot.",

He doesn't feel like an \"unstoppable force\" anymore as he normally does in other installments.Sure, one can make the argument that he may have serious damage from his injuries in the prior films; preventing him from carrying himself as he normally does but that shouldn't matter with Michael. He always gets up and he's always filled with unmatched strength.Michael didn't seem like a main character to this movie at all.. he felt like a random side character that got a few minutes of screen time.Not really a good sign when the main character of a franchise is so watered down you start to pity them...",

How ironic, that truly sets the stage for the absolutely muddled mess of a plot that surrounds Michael Myers.The film borrows concepts and tropes from both Christine and Friday The 13th Part 5: A New Beginning, and they are so poorly executed that one would be better off watching those films instead. And like Halloween Kills this film wishes to push a social/political statement into it's story which is fine under most circumstances however \"morals\" and \"statements\" have no place in the slasher subgenre. People want to see Michael Myers killing people in creative ways for 90 minutes and go home, they're not lining up outside the theater to hear your message, David Gordon Green. They don't want something fresh and edgy, they just want to see a film that's closer to the 1978 classic than any of the sequels have been, and that's why Halloween 2018 was so well received.The overall plot of this film would have served the filmmakers better as a follow up to what this film should have been, a script focused on closure of the two characters of Michael and Laurie. The introduction of new characters that take up the majority of screen time was a fatal error at this point in the series, Halloween Ends should tie up loose ends and give the characters a honorable sendoff, not footnote mentions and cameo appearances.What a waste of time.

The movie becomes rather lazy and ridiculous as Michael is not seen often at all. The real turning point being a shaky collaboration between certain characters, which is of course, completely out of character for one of them. The film slowly progresses towards a climax that is sort of satisfying but not really. I will say that the movie has a consistant tone but the characters do not and the story is more psychological than anything we have seen before.

The parents walk in just as it happens, thus leaving them to believe that Corey killed their son on purpose.As the new outcast of the town, Corey is bullied, and looked down upon by everybody, of which leads to a physical altercation, where Laurie strode (seriously, you don't need me to say who this is) confront the bullies, and, Corey accidentally cut his hand, leading to Laure take him to the hospital where she introduces Corey to her granddaughter Alyson (Andi Matichak).Alyson, starts to really like Corey, and vice versa, until they go out for Halloween night at the bar where Corey is confronted by the mother of the son that he killed in the first act.Corey leaves the bar and then is confronted by the bullies , is beaten up and thrown over the bridge, where he meets and be friends, Michael Myers. As the new \"bogeyman\" Corey goes on a terror spree, killing some people and us rebirth of Michael Myers.I really enjoyed this plot. I felt that having Michael Myers, which logistically he is in his late 60s, is a little bit laughable that he would still be terrorizing this town. Having a new person being the outcast and then doning on the outfit is a great idea. I really like the unspoken pact between the two of them and killing people together (a La \"NBK\") was a fantastic idea.Where the movie falls apart is when we kill off Corey. We are introduced to a new killer, then he immediately dies. Then we have the big showdown between Laure and Michael, bloodbath on bloodbath, and Michael is ultimately killed by literally being thrown into a shredder\nHowever, we know that this is not the end, because when Laurie is writing her memoirs, she says that \"evil never dies, it just takes a different shape.\" Which is a great tongue-in-cheek line to the character of Michael Myers being referred to as \"the shape\" but, we also know that someone else will become the new Michael Myers.There's a lot of inconsistencies, and a lot of bad dialogue, but, how many of these movies actually do have good dialogue? First, we have Michael Myers, being pure evil, and he's into Celtic witchcraft, and then he's back to pure evil. Also, we have the character of the dark man who doesn't go anywhere, unless you've read the scripts.Granted, this new trilogy is one for the toilet, but, this third one started out really well and very strong, and ended in a direction where you're not really wanting it to.It's definitely a lot of fun, but, for the right audience.",

It's done in such a cheap way and not subtle at all. Barely anybody is likable in any way, you've got people going out of their way blaming Laurie for everything, bullies, weird parents and your typical characters who are just there to get killed. It's not a film that seems to care about lore or closure, it's just really messy and acts more like the start of of a trilogy than the finale. This movie should have been about Laurie getting closure and ending her ongoing battle with Michael but it ended up spending more time concerntrating on her clueless granddaughter and some guy that killed a kid which set off a chain of events which maybe turned him into a new killer in the vein of Michael. All of that stuff could have worked if it was implemented into the start of the trilogy but it just seems like it was a throwaway idea from a earlier movie that they decided to throw into the final movie of the trilogy. It's just extra stuff that people don't have enough time to care about because it doesn't matter as the movie has never been about any of those characters and it's far too late to just decide to throw them into the movie. It just takes away from the main characters of the movie and it loses focus. It's just a weird and absurd end to a trilogy and barely anything works, it's just so hard to get through and the only good thing is that there's a few good kills but that really doesn't warrant wasting any money to watch it. If I'm being honest I'd like to see somebody competent take the reigns of Halloween again as I feel the series deserves so much better than this. I feel there's too many writing influences, each pulling it in a different direction, all trying to put their stamp on the movie but it just falls flat and completely disregards the movies that came before it and decides to take the trilogy in a new direction at the worse time you could possibly decide to do that.",

At one point in the film I thought \"is this even a Halloween film?\"\nThere was no edge of your seat stuff in this film. There was very little slashing or actual scary parts.It baffles me that this was even released. The writing was so cheap and uninteresting.The legacy of Michael myers has to say with the last film.

Michael hardly made an appearance, is he not what these films are supposed to be about? Blumhouse seriously, what happened? It makes no sense whatsoever, it's so random.

            "content": "This film has some really interesting and thought provoking ideas and concepts here. Shame that all of those ideas and concepts are used in the \"final\" film of this franchise and not a different one. Having someone else start to become Michael Myers because of how the town treated them is great but really shouldn't have been the idea for the final film as Michael Myers just feels sidelined here. He has his moments in the middle and end of the movie but for a \"final\" film it's definitely disappointing to not see him as much as I wanted to. That being said, this film is hilarious just like the other 2. There are some really funny moments here that aren't supposed to be funny but it made me enjoy the film so much that I can't hate it. The opening scene is genuinely great though. It plays with the concept of Michael Myers always being around and twists it on its head in an interesting and surprisingly hilarious which definitely wasn't supposed to be intentional. The characters here are definitely more developed here than they were in Kills but their development definitely feels shallow. It's strange seeing Andi Matichak and Rohan Campbell's characters team up because they don't really work together very well in my opinion. The deaths here are once again great. They are all really well done and sometimes really funny as well. Michael Myers feels oddly nerfed here. I know he's been in hiding for 3 years but to come off of both Halloween and Halloween Kills like this, it definitely leaves a lot to be desired. The final confrontation between Laurie and Michael is also very anticlimactic in my opinion. None of them have a ton of energy in their fight and how it ends just feels boring unfortunately. The music from John Carpenter once again is great and while I definitely prefer the look and style of Kills, the look and style here was definitely better than the 2018 film. This film is definitely the weakest in the trilogy in my opinion but all 3 movies are movies I would watch every Halloween. If you want a laugh or like the Halloween movies then I would check this out.",

On Halloween Cory (Rohan Campbell) a geeky looking teen is babysitting Jeremy (Jaxon Goldenberg) a smart alec kid who disappears when Cory turns his back. While Cory is locked in a room, Jeremy gets killed by Michael and Corey gets blamed. Apparently acquitted, or not charged, Cory is out and badly treated by the town. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) moves into a new house which for some reason is in the same town, the one that hates and blames her for everything. She lives with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) who works at a hospital where she meet Cory. The two share horror stories and hook-up. Cory gets dumped off a bridge and somehow ends up in a drainage pipe with Michael Meyers who doesn't kill Cory.At this point the killings start. This is not the best script for a final film of the series. It was weaker than fan fiction.

But this was a good addition to the Haddonfield deterioration that we saw from Halloween Kills.I find that 2018's Halloween was a 9/10, Halloween Kills being about an 8 and this film being a 7, which is still a passing grade in this Boogeyman-fanatic's book! :DIf you didn't find the conclusion of End's satisfying, just remember that Halloween 2018 had a great conclusion to the story we all know and fear!We've seen Michael 'die' before, but this definitely felt conclusive as there is no coming back!This was indeed: the END!",

Second, I felt that the movie's climax needed to be \"expanded more\" because from my point of view, it was too fast.But these flaws won't ever prevent me from saying that I liked Halloween Ends and the ending to the story that started in 1978 that it delivered.

The part in the prison where the journalist holds micheal mask and yells at him while all the mental patience are screaming is insane.Saldy Halloween kills was bad and i mean real bad... yet this one Halloween's end i am not sure, of course there are great ideas, the addition of Corey a bullied kid who (vote is still out on that one) accidentally killed a kid while he was babysitting him on halloween night was pretty good. But Corey got almost no character development, got pushed by some young punks fell in a raven got into a canal and met Michael Myers.. who looked at him and saw the killer in him.After that they form an unusual tag team of killers and go on a rampage.... there is a love story between Corey and main girl he tells her he killed and she still dates him... that was beyond bad.I guess if you can turn your brain off for 2 hours because this movie is 2 hours long and enjoy it as it is entertainment and not take it too seriously nor base your expectations too high its an ok way to pass 2 hours.",

If you're into slashers for the creative kills, there are maybe 2, and neither of them was from Michael, who has apparently been retired in a drain like Pennywise (only not nearly as threatening) for 4 years for... no apparent reason, other than perhaps to get rolled by the nobody antagonist and get his mask stolen for about 30 minutes before coming out for fresh air to get it back, only to get staked to a butcherblock kitchen table, stabbed a bunch, and then tossed into the junk yard car chipper, killing him once and for all.This wasn't a Halloween Movie (hush Season of the Witch Fans).

I read a lot of reviewers stated this one was by far the worst Halloween movie ever but I have to disagree with that. For me it was Halloween Kills, but everybody is entitled to his opinion. Halloween Ends is certainly not of the same level as the very first one but then again none of the others were either. This franchise has been milked until the last drop and I'm glad it's finally over. But I did enjoy watching this last one even though it's again all very far fetched and not as scary as in the beginning. Jamie Lee Curtis, who declared she never watched a Halloween movie before, will always remain the name in this saga, whether she wants it or not. Her character Laurie Strode is as famous as Michael Myers himself. Overal the acting wasn't bad, the story wasn't the greatest but it's watchable. The soundtrack, which is always very recognizable in Halloween, was good again, even the songs were well chosen. The Halloween tune will forever remain in our minds and whenever we hear it the first thing we will think of is that scary mask of Michael Myers. But tonight a legend died, for good...",

I think the idea behind the Corey Cunningham character COULD have been great but why are we introducing this idea when we're at the finish line?! This movie is supposed to be about the final showdown between Michael and Laurie and yet we spend the majority of the run time with Corey. There is no build up to their confrontation it just kind of happens. I feel like the last 20 minutes of this movie should've been added to the end of Halloween Kills and it would've worked better. I'm disappointed with how this turned out. The original Halloween is my favorite horror film and I was looking forward to this. Not sure why they chose to focus on an entirely new character instead of the franchises legacy characters. 5/10.",

Honestly would recommend the Rob Zombie Halloweens over this, and even then Rob Zombie couldn't even write a female character correctly. For some reason they made Lorie a writer, even though a year ago in this movie's timeline she was in her own \"prison\" as she states in the movie. Trailer made it seem better than it was.

            "content": "I got a chance to view this in theater and upon it's end there seemed to be mixed reactions about it. I will break this review into three parts (back history, plot, and shortcomings) and it will have some movie spoilers from the franchise and spoilers from this film. If you haven't seen all of the Halloween films then I highly recommend you do before going to see this one.Back History\nThe movie starts off very slow and doesn't really give off that Halloween vibe, but there is a great deal of importance in it that ties it to past films.I believe John Carpenter did a great job in piecing together the entire history of the Halloween franchise into this film, but to deliver them to the audience as Easter eggs to the viewers was not a good idea. If you decide to watch this film, then I absolutely recommend watching every Halloween film up to this point because you need to understand some of the major points of the franchise beginning with the Michael Myers and Celtic curse origin story as hinted and explained in the first three Halloween films and Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. It is absolutely crucial to watch Halloween 4 and 5 to understand the spiritual connection and relationship between the character Corey Cunningham and Michael Myers in this film and the passage of evil or transferring of evil (the film never fully explained this in previous versions or in this movie and you're left guessing for yourself which is it). Halloween 4 and 5 shows a similar relationship between Michael and his niece Jamie Lloyd but that story goes a different path. I won't spoil that for you if you haven't seen it, but if you have or plan to then pay attention to the details of those two movies because it is reintroduced in Halloween Ends.Also you should watch Halloween Kills so you understand who Allyson Nelson is in relation to Laurie Strode and get caught up with what happened to Michael in the end of that movie.Halloween Ends Plot\nThis film is the conclusion of the story between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. It tells the story of a young man named Corey Cunningham who accidentally kills a boy he is babysitting and gets let off. Corey meets Michael Myers and sets off on a dangerous path to free himself of his bullies while building a relationship with Allyson Nelson (Laurie's granddaughter) who returns after surviving the Halloween Kills movie.Shortcomings\nThe shortcomings I noticed in this film was that like most franchises that come to an end, they have to bring the story to an end which the fan base is not going to enjoy. The ending happened too soon and Michael Myers did not have much screen time.Michael and Laurie are old and they are presented as such. Michael is presented as the same old killer trying to complete his mission to end the curse, but he's not as superhuman as past films showed him to be. Michael was made to be more vulnerable and human than ever before which is not a bad thing, but what turned out bad was that he was not given much screen time to pursue Laurie even though he was literally in the same town.Michael's lack of screen time I believe was strategic to show a passing of the torch from Michael to Corey to possibly a new form of evil if the ending words by Laurie holds true and the Easter egg they gave us of Allyson turns anything to be like Michael's mother from the perspective of the town's Celtic druids. This was not so obvious to everyone that watched the film with me just like many parts of the film left people confused.The biggest and probably only major shortcoming was the story. Sometimes you have to retell a story so your new audience learns the past so they can understand the present. The director and writers failed in delivering a proper backstory and adequate plot.The story is lacking explanation which is something the story should have incorporated since I am sure a lot of those that were confused had not seen all of the films. Even I had to look up bits and pieces from past movies to confirm the Easter eggs that should have just been explained straight away. So the audience is not left clueless.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying I thoroughly enjoyed Halloween 18 and Kills. So I had pretty high hopes for Ends. I just have a few short thoughts to share.There are a few things that I need to talk about. First off, Michael has been hiding in the sewers for 4 years since the events of Kills. Why? Well it's never fully explained but I guess it's because he's too weak to be out and about killing people. Which is why we get Corey as a character. Now I think Corey is a decent character with a good acting performance behind him. But that doesn't make up for how the movie portrays either character. Michael basically brainwashed (?) Corey into helping/killing for him so that he can re-gain his strength to go and do something. It's not said by anyone so I guess we will never know. Now at the end of Kills, Laurie mentions Michael gains power through killing. So one would think after he takes out a dozen people in the span of 2 minutes he'd be good to go for a while. Nope. Michael can barely stand, as he stumbles around in the sewers, waiting for Corey to kill people or bring them to him. I think he gains power through Corey's kills? They have some weird mental connection that's also not explained. Corey eventually steals Michaels mask after knocking him down (yes some random college-age kid beats up. Michael Myers) and begins dressing as him and killing people. This was actually interesting and done decently well enough to enjoy. But it also doesn't make any sense. Why does Michael need a sidekick? Why is he so weak?To summarize, this is basically Iike Halloween 3 with 10 minutes of Michael Myers cameos sprinkled within.If I was put in charge of right in this movie I'd actually keep the imposter side plot.Cory would have been an imposter Michael from the beginning of the movie. Using the trauma from accidently killing the kid he was babysitting and the town turning on him even after he as let off on all charges.Have Corey be walking somewhere and finding Michael's mask. Make the first half the movie about Corey pretending to be Michael, killing random people. And then somewhere in the middle you have the real Michael show up and kill him to reclaim his property and be the one real Myers. It's simple yet follows the plot they wanted.",

This movie is the third and \"final\" sequel of the 2018 \"third reboot\" Halloween produced by Malek Akkad.Jamie Lee Curtis stars. She is not using a cane yet, but she is getting there. My math suggests she would be over 65 in this film. A couple of other characters reprise their roles as well. Added into the mix is the somewhat interesting character of \"Corey\" - a college age socially awkward local boy whose life \"intersects\" with that of Michael Myers in an unusual way. Without saying more, that \"intersection\" of two lives was the most creative angle of the film. But otherwise, it was more of the same, boring, laced with cringey humor, and at times stupid (even for a slasher flick).There is such plot variety out there in the last couple of decades within the horror genre, I think that the traditional 'resurrecting' slasher film is becoming a relic. To be current, slasher films will need something \"new\". And no, I don't mean \"Freddy vs. Jason\". Of course I am not a writer, producer, or director. So I don't know what that \"new\" could be for the slasher plot. But, this movie sealed the reality of how \"over done\" and \"over with\" traditional slasher plots have become.

It has been fascinating to witness the myriad attempts and \"Ends\" is no exception.So what should have the perfect final entry in David Gordon-Green's bumpy roller coaster of a reboot trilogy have looked like? A final epic showdown to end all showdowns between Michael and Laurie ala Halloween H20 and H18? More callbacks to the original? Less Laurie? More Allison? Laurie and Michael finished off for good? One thing is for certain: none of us got what we expected. All the same, 'Ends\" has proven to be the most divisive of the three, and seems to have amassed more detractors than admirers.But we must give credit where credit is due: even though its narrative departure does feel like an insensitive bait and switch on the part of the filmmakers, 'Ends' is an admittedly ambitious and relatively refined piece of filmmaking compared to the previous two installments. The cinematography is gorgeous (possibly the most \"Cundey-esque\" since the 3rd film) the score the most 'old-school' Carpenter, the acting ensemble possibly the best of the franchise, political commentary undetectable, pacing just right, and the callbacks rewarding but sparingly utilized. Storyline controversy notwithstanding, there is much to appreciate here.I also maintain-and this no doubt will be a controversial opinion-that 'Ends' might actually show more DNA with the original than any of the follow ups. David Gordon Green has proven through his filmography that he understands the rhythm and flow of life in small-town America and has been able to effectively incorporate this into the Halloween universe. This quality, which is what made the original feel so grounded and intimate, is prominently felt here. The characters in 'Ends' feel like real people (even more so than in the previous two installments) and watching Laurie and the supporting characters grapple with their bizarre set of circumstances makes for some compelling stuff, replacing the conventional scare factor with a palpable tension rooted in moral ambiguity and existential anxiety. Had Green's approach to the material been at the service of a more traditional Halloween film template, he may have been able to match the level of terror and suspense achieved in the original and ended his trilogy with a bang.I certainly understand the disappointment and frustration 'Ends' has caused viewers who were anticipating the type of film that the trailers misleadingly promised. Maybe after all the dust has settled, they will be able to revisit it with a fresh perspective and discover its positive aspects, for which there are many. For all intents and purposes, 'Ends', like 'Halloween 3', really should have been its own standalone project.I am confident that someday we will get a \"Halloween\" film that hits every checkbox in one fell swoop. Until then, we should be grateful to Gordon-Green for treating the beloved property with the artistry and respect it deserves. At least he brought the series back into a respectable light and proved that audience's standards were not as low as reputed. Hopefully this will encourage the studio heads to seek out the type of talent that is capable of creating the \"Halloween\" film for which fans have been so patiently waiting.But hey, we finally got a \"muzak\" version of \"Don't Fear the Reaper\". That's some consolation, right?",

I can't get over the absolute disrespect done to Michael in this film. This is supposed to be the final showdown and ending to the Michael and Lori story, so why does it feel like this fight was not only rushed but did not satisfy me in any way. I like the idea of Corey in this film, the idea that Michael either saw something when he looked in his eyes or even transferred evil into him. I say this because the film tells us nothing about what happened when Michael looked in his eyes, I don't need everything spelled out for me directly but you have to tell what happened in some way. Another aspect the writers just didn't talk about was the idea that Michael was somehow gaining strength from killing people. Cool idea that even Lori was talking about in the previous film, but the Corey just overpowers him and takes his mask. Possibly great ideas where just left out in the open and truly meant nothing in the end. Corey goes on a killing spree where it seems he is able to vanish like Michael and somehow gained the strength like Michael but again how would we know. Then final act starts where the character we have been following the whole movie just kills himself for really no apparent reason other than shock value so his character had no arc and was just another reason to get Michael to Lori's house. Then I'm thinking we are at least going to get this final epic showdown between the two but again you would be wrong as Lori gains the upper hand and cuts his throat, but then Michael grabs Lori and I'm thinking are they really going to finally say that Michael is truly a supernatural being but no just another cheap moment to try and make it more exciting. Michael is then thrown into a nest grinder of some sorts and the film is over. I really love this franchise and Michael Myers so this film just felt like a disservice to me, I think this would have worked as the second film but not the FINAL. As the title suggests this is the final film in this universe with Michael and Lori. Now I will have to patiently wait for this franchise to be resurrected once again to get the sour taste of this film out of my brain.",

            "content": "After the chaotic mess that Halloween Kills was I had very low expectations going into this movie but I was not prepared for just how much of a disappointment this supposed final installment would be.Michael Myers, the malevolent unstoppable force of nature that we've come to know and love over the years has been reduced to a feeble old man hiding away in a sewer shaking like he has Parkinsons disease and at one point is easily overpowered and mugged of his mask by his scrawny protege (I guess?) Corey. Wow, that really makes me terrified of Michael Myers seeing him as a frail OAP. I'm surprised they didn't go the whole hog and have him defecate himself through old age induced incontinence. Michael does manage to get a couple of half decent kills in but overall this is a very lacklustre send off for such an iconic slasher icon.But to give credit where credits due the movie does deliver on it's promise, the death of Michael Myers. Personally I feel that Michael died two deaths in this movie, one by the bizarre creative choices of the writers rendering him a weak shell of his former self and his actual death by the hands of Laurie Strode at last.The movie certainly made a point of showing that Michael was truly dead by having the whole town of Haddonfield transport his corpse to the scrap yard and pushing his corpse into a car crusher.A definite end but one unbecoming of such an iconic character as Michael Myers so I surely hope that this really is the end for the Halloween franchise as I have no desire to see more at this point but I highly doubt it.",

But, what I saw was a really well paced and quite original take on the Halloween legend, which built really nicely to a conclusion which left me really satisfied.

I have watched every sequel multiple times and have my opinions about them all. I know this movie is going to be divisive but if people look at the story as a whole (Halloween and the H40 threequal) and they aren't the type that is there to just see Michael Meyers unleash brutal kills right and left, they might really enjoy this.What sets these four movies apart, for me, is the narrative we get about how individuals are affected by evil. This is Laurie's story, not Michael's. We see the initial fear and on set of trauma in Halloween (1978). We see the after effects of 40 years worth of post traumatic stress in Halloween (2018). We see how dangerous revenge is in Halloween Kills. Halloween Ends not only shows us guilt and redemption, but how damaging evil, trauma, guilt and revenge can be.In this movie, see how Corey gives into the darkness that a traumatic event can bring about. We see him consumed by all the hurt and despair that his trauma has caused him and they way he is ostracized by everyone. On the other hand, we see Laurie struggle with her own guilt that the community puts on her shoulders, coupled with the decades of trauma she has endured. And when she sees a kindred spirit in Corey, she initially tries to help and spare him from all the she has gone through. In the end, Corey gives in to revenge. In failing to redeem Corey, though, Laurie is able to find both redemption and resolution to her decades long battle with \"the Boogeyman\".Halloween Ends dares to be different and, in my humble opinion, it did an amazing job closing out the franchise.Happy Halloween \ud83c\udf83",

            "content": "--Spoilers--I haven't been to these message boards in years, I had to reset my IMDB password for this, but I am so annoyed by this experience I just had to post before I exploded. The other horror franchises of the 80's (I realize the original Halloween was in the 70's) all fizzled out with terrible films, but this has got to be the worst only because what came before it was at least serviceable.2018 Halloween I thought was decent, even though it made almost no sense. At least it felt like a Halloween movie. I rememeber hearing friends talk about how good it was. Not for me, but it was watchable and had a decent ending. Same for the 2021 even though that one was far worse. But this?Anyone remember how mad Jason Goes to Hell was? Very bad movie and fans were annoyed that Jason wasn't actually Jason in that movie until the end. What poor decision making it is to have a fan-favorite villain become something totally different in the grand finale (sound familiar yet?). At least in that movie it was self-aware that is was cheesy, goofy, and was trying to be a setup for the Freddy V. Jason movie eventually.This film? It makes the same mistakes but *thinks* it's a good movie. The plot make almost zero sense and the characters themselves behave in nonsensical ways after what was laid out in the previous two films.And now for Michael Myers himself. It actually could have been cool to see this unstoppable killing machine start to age-out and have all his injuries catch up with him. But this is done in such a clumsy way with almost no plot that it's laughable to that it even made the final script. The killings are supposed to make Michael stronger. But after he kills a couple of people he basically gets mugged of his mask by a bruised kid for no real reason. Then, when the showdown we all wanted finally happens... it's just \"blah\". Laurie cuts Michael's throat and wrist and... yay? We were already told and shown that brute force cannot stop him. They should have at least made him still twitch or grab for Laurie one last time before he was turned into dog food. What a waste.So even though I remember having somewhat negative feelings about the 2018 film, that might as well be Citizen Kane compared to this. What a piece of garbage.",

So for that reason, I am partial to this franchise and decided to cut it some slack by giving it a 5. But overall, this was a disappointment. The movie mostly follows a new character named Corey that I guess we are supposed to care about somehow? He starts out as a quiet guy being harassed for accidentally killing the kid he babysat, then in the span of two days decides he wants to become the next Michael Myers. Even rides his stupid bike down to the sewers where Michael has been living for the last three years (?) and asks him to \"teach him how to do it\". This was the stupidest possible thing they could have done in this movie in my opinion. Like what? So now Michael Myers has become Corey's Yoda and tag teams it with him to teach him how to kill. There is a lot more wrong with this movie. The serious lack of Michael in his OWN final movie, the character annihilation of Allyson who becomes a complete idiot because she's fallen in love with crazy Corey after knowing him for all of two days, the fact that roughly 30% of the movie is just the townspeople harassing Laurie and Corey, the list goes on. The last 30 minutes were a pleasant surprise only because they headed in a different direction than I thought they were going to, and for that I am so thankful. I thought for sure they were going to end it with Corey becoming the new Haddonfield Boogieman and reatreating to that abandoned house just like Michael did in the very first film. Thankfully, Corey dies, yay finally! And we finally get to see the final showdown between Michael and Laurie, which is what we all came here for. I know a lot of people were underwhelmed by the final fight, but I enjoyed it. Compared to the rest of this dumpster fire movie, that scene was Academy Award gold. That should tell you something. I just do not understand why the writers and DGG took this direction with this horrible Corey character. You feel bad for him for all of 15 minutes before he becomes the most annoying antagonist possible. They couldn't have come up with anything else? Really? No wonder it's ending, it's pretty clear that they are completely out of ideas. I don't want to say that they didn't pay tribute to the fans, as there were some cool references and scenes with Michael. Overall though, it just felt like a disservice and I'm glad that other fans feel the same way. Jamie Lee Curtis was great (as usual), and I liked that they included her a lot more in this movie than they did in Kills. Scenes with the real Michael (not the wannabe copycat) were fun. I'd say those sum up the positives. The rest was garbage.",

            "content": "Halloween Ends is appropriately named as it ends the latest trilogy by David Gordon Greene. If only he could have delivered a dying scream instead of whimper.It's four years later after the Halloween 2018 and Haddonfield is still recuperating from the awful stigma it has from being the town where Michael Myers has created havoc over a 40-year stretch.And we have a new problem that is established in the beginning. Young Corey, played by Rohan Campbell, is babysitting a young boy. The child plays a trick on Corey who ends up accidentally killing the child. He is now the new Haddonfield pariah - and is shunned by the town.Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), meanwhile, has been trying to restart her life in the town with her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). Laurie uses writing as a catharsis to her pain while Allyson moves into the medical field as an RN.Laurie takes a shine to Corey when she witnesses some band members torment and taunt him for being a child murderer - even trying to implicate him as a pedophile. She takes action to help him. Still, he has hurt himself and must visit the hospital and meets Allyson. Laurie likes the idea and encourages them do date.However, the irritating bullies return and kick Corey to the curb (I love alliteration). What happens, though, is a mysterious person takes Corey to his lair in the city sewar systems. You have one guess who this \"mysterious\" stranger is. It is Michael Myers who glares at the boy long enough to project the murderous personality into him. Corey goes on the rampage.In the end, Laurie realizes Corey has become unstable and wants Allyson to stop dating him. Yet, the story gets worse as this drives a wedge between Allyson and Laurie. When Corey returns to the house, he is ready for murder - and it's tag-team wrestling for serial killers!Michael (James Jade Courtney and Nick Castle) now pursues Laurie for the final showdown. This scene does not disappoint - but it comes way too late.The movie did have some good ideas - but having four screenplay writers was the first sign of a meandering and incohesive plot. The plot is spread so thin there is no clear direction. At one point, Corey is the main antagonist, then it is Michael. Then it goes back to Corey.Moreover, everyone killed by Corey or Michael is a huge jerk who deserves it. We have seen Michael kill people who didn't deserve it - even children in some cases. On top of that, the character has so little screen time, tension and scares are not as palpable. Audiences might it forget they are watching a Michael Myers Halloween movie.At the end, in the final conflict between Laurie and Michael, the audience finally gets satisfaction. Real tension and scares exist - but it feels a bit late. It's almost as if the writers started with that scene and then realized they needed another 90 minutes to lead up to the final showdown.Halloween has always been my favorite franchise, but writers and producers have maligned the name with multiple timelines, hackneyed stories. They have fully yielded to Jason Vorhees and Friday the 13th as the better and more consistent movies (except Jason X).The latest Halloween trilogy is reminiscent of the latest Star Wars Trilogy: it tries to offer fan-service amidst a haphazard storyline with no definitive plan. This is very ironic considering Halloween had the same directors and writers instead of tag-teaming writers and directors.Halloween Ends is not a total washout. I really wanted to like this one, but - despite the ending - it left me feeling hollow and lukewarm.",

However, I adored the fight scenes, as well as the showdown between Michael and Laurie at the end. Definitely kept tensions high. Wish we saw more character development from Alyson, and I hated the so called \"chemistry\" she had with Corey. I just hated the Corey addition all together. It's pretty hard to look past him lifting the mask off Michael, it just made him seem powerless. The ending scene was pretty good tbh, it definitely wrapped up the movie franchise, but left a lot of unanswered questions...lots of missed opportunities, and sloppy directing for most of the movie.In the end, Laurie Strode remains our final girl, and Jamie Lee Curtis's performance is what prevents this movie from being grinded up(pun intended).(PS...where tf was Lindsey during all this mayhem?)",

It's a great feeling and your body goes into a state of pure bliss.The movie:\nIt took me forever to finish this slaughtering of an already dying franchise. It was more of a Halloween montage with a boring and soulless Jamie Lee Curtis as a voice over then it was a movie. To say it's a horror is a stredge and a half. More a never-ending drama with a storyline that could have been told in 15-20 minutes. Yet they manage to stretch this \"horror\" to a nearly two hours eyesore.They nailed one thing though and it's not a good thing. The lifelessness of the characters. Not the dead ones, no the main characters. It's like watching a two hour special of \"Zombies Act\".It just don't make sense:\nA total disrespect to the viewer is the fact that not a single event in this \"horror\" isn't completely rediculous and farfetched. Of course, it's a \"horror\", things don't always need to make sense. But it would be nice if there was at least one storyline during the movie you could hold on to.

But David failed to deliver the amazing Halloween ending that the vast majority of Halloween fans were looking and hoping for. He detailed the script out like a novel. There are a lot of scenes that run way to long and are overly detailed. The most important questions that Halloween fans wanted answered, like: why did it take 4 years for Laurie to kill Michael Myers and why has Michael been living underground for 4 years, were both left unanswered. David and his writing team which includes, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kyle Richards have given Halloween fans and horror fans alike a very confusing storyline and a subplot that all of us can do without. I'm not gonna spoil the ending or anything. All I'm gonna say is that the ending is terrible and it's an ending that if I was one of the producers of the movie I would've made David Gordon Green, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kyle Richards change it completely. The kill scenes are brutal and violent, but that's very much all we get in this movie, like with Halloween Kills the violence is very graphic. But that's all we get with Halloween Ends, a very confusing storyline within the screenplay for the movie that should've been scrapped, a bunch of blood, guts and unnecessary long scenes. The dialogue and how it's delivered sounds like it was written by a first year film student and it wasn't professional at all. All of the cast members give us an amateurish performance. David Gordon Green was soft on this Halloween movie, and when he filmed it, it wrapped up in 2 months, which I knew at the time back in the summer wasn't a good thing. The filming was completely rushed and I'm guessing that David didn't even re-read the screenplay for his final Halloween installment. My take away from Halloween Ends is this, when you have famous people with a lot of money, sometimes they forget where they came from. I just hope that real Halloween fans will remind the filmmakers that as the fans we hold a lot of power and we decide if a horror movie, like any other kind of movie, succeeds or fails. To me Halloween Ends is not only a complete failure, but is also a huge disgrace to the original Halloween that John Carpenter made back in 1978. Jamie Lee Curtis said that this is her final time playing the role of Laurie Strode. I can tell everyone that she didn't go out with the groundbreaking performance that the majority of us expected her to give us. I hope that over this weekend no one will see Halloween Ends. That will prove that we are serious fans of the Halloween movies, filmmaking and movies in general. And that we won't put up with horror films that have confusing storylines and nonsense filler content within very long scenes. From beginning to end Halloween Ends is a huge disaster. In every way possible, it's just as bad as Halloween 2 (2009), only a tad bit better.",

For about five minutes the idea of him having a prodigy was interesting but the possibilities were soon lost in a rush to unmask and kill Michael at the end. Jamie Lee was amazing as always. I also really like seeing Kyle Richards. Super disappointed in the plot and execution of this film.",

There's also the issue of how Haddonfield apparently always wants someone or something to view as the boogeyman.Basically, it was what I expected. Nothing great, but nothing terrible. I'll be eager to see what David Gordon Green does after this.I still wonder if Mike Myers saw the original movie when it first came out, and if so, what he thought of his name getting used for a killer.",

I felt like the writers tried to give the drama more depth, but somehow it backfired. All the events that happened in the movie were very sporadic and had no specific purpose.

The storyline follows Laurie four years after Halloween Kills as she raises her granddaughter and writes her memories of her crazy life. When her granddaughter starts dating a young man with his own murderous past and mannerisms that remind her of Michael, Laurie believes Michael's evil may still be present.This movie is directed by David Gordon Green (Your Highness) and stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog), Will Patton (Armageddon), Andi Matichak (Assimilate), James Jude Courtney (Far and Away), Kyle Richards (Halloween, 1978) and Candice Rose (She-Hulk).I will say that I actually liked the new character introduced and felt he had potential. The relationship between the granddaughter and the troubled young man was good. I didn't really like any of the scenes Michael was in. The cave scene didn't work for me. Even the Laurie vs Michael scenes were blah. I will say the \"if I can't have her\" scene was tremendous and surprising.Overall, this another very average sequel and addition to the horror genre that had a few elements with potential but not enough to make it worthwhile.

I agree that it did take away a lot of the \"Laurie/Michael\" conflict that we all were used to seeing by this point, and that takes a few points away for me.All in all, though, the final showdown was worth the bogging down and the wait.

She has stuck it out through most of this franchise, even some really lame entries, and her performance is top drawer as always. The Halloween series has deviated from straight-up slasher status in the past and taken a few chances for better or worse. And this is not just a film dealing with Michael Meyers going around killing people. For quite a while it looked like Michael was only going to be a symbolic idea for the evil inside each of us, or some such psychobabble. Maybe not even really there at all. But then the final act comes, and we get what we are expecting.The film takes place a few years after Halloween Kills. Haddonfield remains on edge, as Michael was never brought to justice back then. Laurie Strode is trying to get on with a new life as a writer while living with her granddaughter. A new character, nerdy Corey is introduced. A terrible accident (or was it an accident?) happens to a kid he is babysitting. Corey becomes an outcast, yet somehow starts up a relationship with Laurie's decent-looking granddaughter. Bodies start piling up. Is it Michael? Corey? Both??Overall I'd rate this a little higher than most. Mostly because I'm a sucker for this series. The pacing is awkwardly slow in the first half. Top billed people from the previous films hardly appear at all. This Corey kid is mostly the central character and he's neither likable or that interesting. Kind of looks like David Koresh. Sure it's a nice callback to the original film to cast Kyle Richards, but there just isn't much for her to do here. Not even get killed. Will Patton is a welcome sight too but again he really isn't needed. Once the gore starts flowing, we get a decent payoff though it's easy to see who will be on the chopping block. Endless annoying characters and Easter Eggs to older horror films are not really a substitute for a good story. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

The writers did well erasing the events of Halloween 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, H20 and Resurrection, all while giving the storyline a fresh look that was exciting to see. The story made sense, it was edgy enough and was a good set up for Halloween Kills and what was to come next.Halloween Kills was great for the first 15 minutes, and it really filled in a major blank on what happened that original Halloween night in 1978.Then, the writers insert unneeded storyline with characters that just aren't exciting or necessary.The film concludes with a very bizarre climax that leaves the audience wondering..what could really come next and can they make up on some lost ground between film 1 and 2?? Can they reconnect the excitement of what the story should be about?The answer to that last questions is, 'no, they cannot.'Insert Halloween Ends.. the writers added a totally unnecessary protagonist and made Michael Myers the secondary focus throughout the film. Especially for how Halloween Kills ended..it made Halloween Ends truly STUPID to anyone involved in the development of this concluding chapter to this Halloween trilogy.Really hard to imagine that Laurie goes from being incensed with ending her nightmare with Michael to a woman whose just 'moved on.' Especially realizing the death of her daughter, son in law and numerous others she cared for AND for Michael never being found after what took place at the end of Halloween Kills.Major ball drop to the writers. I'm baffled with how anyone involved in making this said, 'Yep! This is the winner and this is the story we want to produce!'An utter poor effort concluding a rewritten story that seriously could've and should've been so much better than what was produced.It's like the writers made Michael seem super natural in Halloween Kills, for what he endured and how it ended..then didn't want to challenge or make light of that idea. Really, really, really odd on how they chose the story to transition.. and really makes no sense to what we already know about Michael.Lastly, this is officially the worst Halloween movie of them all.

The music is mostly good, the original Halloween composition holds up very well and is distinctive and haunting. The ending theme doesn't work though. Characters, acting and direction are good. Technical aspects are fantastic and the practical/visual effects are flawless. There are some good kills and impeccable gore which is not so extreme that it is distracting and doesn't ruin the impact. The movie is ruined by really bad writing. There are some interesting ideas although they are lacking any real substance. It hugely deviates from the Halloween formula. This movie is full of dumb character decisions and everyone always seems to turn up at the exact right time for no reason. It is slow and boring.

Halloween Ends had all that budget and no ability to write a followable plot.The best part of this movie was the beginning. Great cinematography. First kill scene was actually very surprising. Really gave me that \"Wow! Did that just happen?\" feeling. Also, showing kids being killed is still taboo in cinema. I can appreciate the bold move there.Corey is a ridiculous character. He was a supporting character at best, though the movie made him out to be a main. I'm unsure why he was allowed to live at the hand of Michael in the first 75% of the movie - even working together.

Imagine a restaurant writing steak on the menu and you get served salmon instead.Not sure what they were thinking here but if it was ruining the franchise by tainting this character through lack of plot, fights for nostalgia and pulling random Halloween parts out of a bin to fill out a Mad-Lib script, consider yourself a success.There's so much to unpack in this film. It wasn't 100% bad, but it was 80% bad - generously.",

For a franchise this big what more do you expect?

            "content": "Nothing felt Halloween about this film. This is actually a more loaded statement than one would think. There are two meanings of this term \"Halloween\" in the context of these films. One is the actual holiday and season of Halloween. Second of course is the name of this entire franchise \"Halloween\" which gives us Michael myers and all of his escapades. Starting with the actual season, it felt like this could have taken place on a rainy Thursday in April. Nothing about this movie gives off in the spirit of fall or that time of year. There is very little autumnal imagery let alone Halloween decor. It is very hard to get into the mood for a film like this when it already comes off lacking a sense of identity. This is troubling considering atmosphere really helps to make the successful films in this franchise work. It also lacks the essence and spirit of the Halloween films, thus the second definition of Halloween.Michael felt like a shell of his former self, not only in the sense of his normal physical abilities but his actual use as a plot devise. He is the shape as implied by every single other film. He is supposed to be spooky, menacing, sneaky-the boogeyman. Instead he's reduced to an old fool in a mask. In a standalone film not about Michael Myers that's fine, but it doesn't work here give what we saw in the previous films. I don't even care about how it ended, or about myers' fate. Everything that he does and what happens to him just felt out of place and the mood didn't match any of the previous movies. It just seemed sloppily thrown together. This was a chance to take some great creative risks and if people didn't like them so what? Instead, the producers took no risk and the very easy way out and it comes across as hollow, and soulless and as result people still hate it.This as a stand-alone film not about Michael Myers is probably an average to below average slasher containing bad dialogue, a plot lacking direction and purpose, and a finale that feels rushed and uninspiring yet totally inoffensive. If one takes the franchise name and it's two main characters out of this film (myers and laurie) you have a perfectly average albeit unnecessary slasher flick. Being a Halloween Michael Myers film though, this may very well go down as the worst installment not due the aforementioned faults(which seemingly all but one film in the franchise are guilty of) but because it is surprisingly a totally pointless and likewise vapid experience that feels completely disconnected from all of its predecessors. There is nothing Halloween feeling about this film both in terms Halloween as a season and Halloween the movie franchise. It just feels like a very bland slasher flick that could have gone straight to video in the 80s.",

Ambiguous opening is a precursor to shift the focus onto some new characters, perhaps in an attempt to infuse life into this interminable series, problem is they're not that interesting, meanwhile Laurie and her effort to live a normal life remain mostly in the background.

Over the years I've learned to enjoy the eery atmosphere of many of the sequels and to not take them as seriously as or expect them to rival the original film. Rob Zombie's Halloweens were bad, but they were a novel route for the franchise to take and they were able to capture a new audience and bring fresh attention (and tons of revenue) to the series. Most Halloween films, regardless of how poor the dialogue (RZ's Halloween) or how cringy the acting (H2O) still manage to include some memorable scenes, kills, or lines. With Halloween Ends, it somehow, inexplicably, fails to do anything- it is almost a non-movie.When I went to see DGG's Halloween I was ready for a reincarnation, the second coming of a groundbreaking horror film- what I got was a poorly written, goofily acted, badly directed mediocre horror film. I tempered my expectations for Halloween Kills, and in the time between Halloween and Halloween Kills, I realized that his Halloween wasn't all that bad if I wasn't so serious and hopeful and just took it for what it was. So needless to say, when I saw Halloween Kills, even with my expectations set low, I still thought it was a pathetic, silly, self-serious movie. After another watch, I was able to find some redeeming features, but the deficits in the script and story were still unmissable. It is a mediocre movie.And that brings me to Halloween Ends. Wow. I skimmed the reviews and sensed it was probably pretty bad, but I was not prepared for the (anti)horror that awaited me! Halloween Ends was 95 minutes of instantly forgettable interpersonal drama between characters who we wouldn't care about even if they were played by decent actors. Everything about the movie is bad. Everything. I am sitting here trying to remember something I liked and I can't. It felt like the writers had different set pieces they wanted to include or thought were cool and shoved them all together into this movie. I guess this is what happens when there are too many cooks in the kitchen. Or maybe just the wrong cooks, because the first two were awful as well. Either way, Halloween Ends- and it's definitely over for this round. They beat it to death.",

She told me she hated it. Then she told me why, and I couldn't disagree with any of what she said, and the more I thought about it, the angrier I got with the film.Half decent opening, then all downhill. Horrendous script writing, no character development, absolutely devoid of trademark Halloween suspense, and I think Michael might have been in Season Of The Witch more than he was in this. Considering he's the franchise's main villain, the underutilisation of him is criminal. His scant screen time in the film couldn't come close to saving it, especially when part of it finds him inexplicably teaming up with the town outcast in a slasher tag team like a discount Scream rip-off, then getting the crap knocked out of him by said new kid on the block who then mugs him for his precious mask. Couple this with utterly unlikeable paper-thin characters poorly played across the board, the nonsensical idea of Allyson abandoning Laurie for a guy she barely knows, a story arc almost unconnected to the rest of the franchise, and several dozen other things, and you have probably the weakest film in the whole Halloween universe. The makers of Resurrection must be breathing a sigh of relief.Even the small details, like callbacks to the original film, are insignificant glints in an otherwise drab bigger picture. The idea of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Michael is just ridiculous, detracts from what we actually watch these films for, especially a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who upstages and outkills him, and his old nemesis in Laurie is played in sub-par manner by Jamie Lee Curtis.There's so little to like about this film. Like so many trilogies, the third one pales in comparison to its predecessors - and Kills wasn't even that good. The lack of screen time for Michael - he's in it for ridiculously little of the film - and total absence of Carpenter suspense or even hackneyed jump scares are probably the two things I'm maddest at. I've never walked out of a cinema screening before, but I'd urge you to do yourselves a favour and not bother walking into this one.I'd say Halloween Ends with a whimper, but it simply isn't even that good.

The majority of the killing and film takes revolves around this early 20 year old kid, who accidently killed a child. Mike seemingly transfers his evil into this kid and the kid goes on a killing spree. The first half of the film is more of a tedious romance drama, whilst the second half is more of a slasher.This really isn't a horror at all. For what it was, it was an okay film, but as viewers, we're expecting a Halloween film, not just a random slasher origin with Mike Myers making a cameo. This is like making Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 8 but focusing the film almost entirely on Hagrid (RIP Robbie Coltrane) .",

Also, it didn't make sense that the kid would disappear and then lock the babysitter in the attic and then have him break the door open. It seemed like a forced death. Michael Myers wasn't in it for very much. They should've either made Cory the new villain to open up a spinoff or kill Cory earlier. Myers seemed almost irrelevant to the story. It seemed the filmmakers wanted a different take, but made it two different movies that didn't come together.",

Shifting focus onto new character Cory proves to be a frustrating waste of screen time, taking the kernel of a workable idea and running with it in the completely wrong direction. This is the story of the entire project, taking a few interesting ideas and squandering them entirely (e.g. Haddonfield becoming a town of paranoia in the wake of Myers' disappearance, the threat of his return looming around every corner and with every tragic event). What's even worse is that so many of the new characters are utterly repellent any time they're on screen due to slipshod writing and characterisation (e.g. The gaggle of teen bullies roaming around in their car, the doctor and the nurse, etc). Even carry-over characters are lumbered with woeful dialogue and moments of completely illogical thinking, at times to a degree that their actions simply don't make a lick of sense.If you're only here for kills and gore, you're going to be sorely disappointed as there's only one good kill in the entire movie, with the rest proving to be boring affairs that are as welcome to the eyeballs as a fart in an elevator is to the nostrils. Even the climax feels limp and clumsily staged, once again wasting a good idea.The film's story and characterisation is also riddled with utter nonsense and plotholes galore, boasting a level of carelessness that leaves a truly horrible taste in one's mouth. The screenwriters should be ashamed of thinking this would be a fitting close to the 'H40 saga', and Blumhouse needs to look at itself in the mirror for not only approving this script, but paying for it to be made.Halloween is a franchise that has been rebooted and retconned more than any other, pretty much (aside from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and here we are again, once more in-need of another retcon that would expunge Halloween Ends from existence and give us the closing chapter in the 'H40 saga' that the fans wanted and deserved. This is Halloween Resurrection levels of terrible, and I'm really disappointed to be saying that.",

            "content": "Twin Terrors for Our Times: Playtime and Grosstime in Halloween Ends and The Curse of Bridge HollowTwo current Halloween features, The Curse of Bridge Hollow (Netflix) and Halloween Ends (theaters), exemplify the different poles of our culture. The former is a kid-friendly spook fest, clean and manageable, with laughs and animated Halloween decorations leaving no dead bodies and tooting about the need for loving families.The latter film, while the title has no question mark, suggests the greatest, goriest mainstream horror feast, John Carpenter's Halloween trilogy, may have come to an end in a blood bath too stark for the little ones and sometimes too graphic for the elders. While Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie dominates the Halloween franchise as a woman survivor certifying gender equality in these gender-questioning times, Michael Myers still represents the durability of bad battling good to occupy the human condition forever.Bridge Hollow's annual celebration of Stingy Jack gets a boost when a new family arrives in town and proceeds to resurrect the old boy's magical shenanigans, this time setting alive the myriad decorations around town. The film has plenty of racing around with decorations hounding civilians, giving pragmatic dad (Marlon Wyans) a chance to team with ghost-believer daughter, Sydney (Priah Ferguson), to put that bad boy back in his pumpkin. The adventure is almost bland, if not downright family-friendly by contrast with Halloween Ends.The curious difference between the two horror shows is that Halloween's End carries on the chef's knife tradition by resolving through blood letting with little brainy work, notwithstanding Laurie's smart way of luring Michael into her den. Syd and Dad, on the other hand, use his science-teacher knowledge and her curiosity to defeat Jack, a modern and almost bloodless resolution to a tricky problem.Judging from these two popular scares at 2022's Halloween time, the Bridge has the smarter moves while Halloween Ends is still dimwitted and blood-centered to guarantee its part of the genre is intact regardless of the smart modern tactics. In a meta way, as we look at disruptions world-wide, head competes with heart for resolution.",

(I'm talking about the fact that Jason kidnapped that one girl & held her captive, bc she reminded him of his mother. Cuz Jason Voorhees totally has feelings & mommy issues, right? Who didn't know that??)Anyway. Halloween Ends (just a movie title; i assure you, we have not seen the last of Michael Myers) seemed to test audience's willingness to continue to go see garbage films just because John Carpenter's Halloween is mentioned.You want to try something new? Send the franchise in a new direction? Okay, great.I mean, you waited until the \"last\" film of the new trilogy to do so. And you had The Shape doing things & acting in ways that are completely inconsistent with what we've been watching for FORTY YEARS.And then, you undid everything you'd been setting up in the previous two films!!The whole \"evil dies tonight\" tagline of the last Halloween movie, coupled with the fact that Michael has survived being shot dozens of times; being stabbed multiple times; being beaten with baseball bats & 2x4s; being burned alive; etc tells us (as was the filmmaker's intent) that he is not human. Laurie made a point to say \"he transcends!\" (Whatever the f**l< she meant by that.)\nThat's why he can't die. That's why, instead of any of the above mentioned acts killing Michael or even injuring him enough to slightly slow him down, it seemed to give him fuel to keep killing in ever more creative & gruesome ways.But all of that, every last word of what I've just mentioned-which all happened ONE MOVIE AGO-is abandoned!!Imagine watching Empire Strikes Back, & enjoying that movie; then watching Return of the Jedi & having Yoda say \"yeah, Darth Vader never had any children, so he can't be Luke's father\" kinda dismissively. Like, that's not a small unimportant detail, bro. That's the underlying theme to the WHOLE PREVIOUS MOVIE.So ONE MOVIE AGO we had an angry MOB of people beat Michael in the street; kick, punch, stab with a pitchfork, etc & after a brief pause he gets up, grabs his mask, & easily dispatches every single member of Said mob. (Bc he's not human; he's pure evil; he transcends; etc. Yadda yadda) but in THIS film, a nerdy ex babysitter (with zero discernible physical or athletic prowess, btw) is able to wrestle Michael & successfully steal his mask.The f?@l< WHAT???!!?!It Pretty much goes downhill from there.If this had been the first or 2nd Halloween it might've actually been a decent movie. If the filmmakers hadn't so adamantly shoved the whole \"Michael isn't human\" idea down our throats in the last film, this one might've been enjoyable.But they did, & the film suffered for it.My rating: 4 out of 10 stars. Don't bother if you're anything more than a casual fan of Michael Myers/Halloween movies.",

Like the two previous films, this film is again directed, partly written and produced by David Gordon Green.The film is set four years later after Michael Myers was last seen. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) now lives with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and tries to cope with their rough times with Michael Myers and his brutal action.Laurie tries to process these times by writing a book about it. Trying to just get on with her life, Allyson meets Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) who she starts dating. Despite nothing coming out about Michael Myers, Laurie knows he's still out somewhere. As she continues to prepare for this, Allyson learns that Corey has had a dark life and doesn't really seem to be that stable.With this third film of the new Halloween trilogy, they manage to end the battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers in a good way. Unfortunately for this ending you have to go through a completely different movie about the dating life between Allyson and Corey. These two teenagers go through their own problems together, leading them on the wrong path. This relationship comes across as a bit too forced, so that it doesn't really interest you as a viewer and you keep waiting for Michael Myers to finally reappear in the film.Unfortunately, Michael Myers only really comes into the film after about the first 40 minutes and then unfortunately gets little to do. He manages to provide a few brutal and bloody scenes, but otherwise the film is filled with faint jump scares. For example, if a door closes, an unrealistically loud noise can be heard.Jamie Lee Curtis probably knows how to portray her last time as Laurie Strode in the film in an appropriate way, but also has to wait because of the story of Allyson and Corey. Andi Matichak and Rohan Campbell portray their roles in an appropriate way, but their characters come across as a bit forced and predictable thanks to the story.",

Much to my surprise its a whole lot better than the other 2. Pretty decent story, solid attempt at developing the characters and a resolute--if not maybe a little overly dramatic--conclusion.I won't give any spoilers, but IMO this is a vast, vast improvement over Halloween Kills--and better than the Halloween before that--and WAY better than the Rob Zombie atrocities.I would say give it a try. Watch with an open mind. Its a decent movie, great for a Halloween season watch.",

            "content": "A REVIEW OF A FILM, NONE BUT THE DELUDED APPEAR TO HAVE\nWATCHEDBefore I launch into my diatribe, allow me to make a few observations about myself. It's relevant!Many years back, I contributed a plethora of reviews to IMDB - mainly pre-Amazon ownership. I ceased writing them, on account of the insane vitriolic feedback I increasingly was receiving - principally from one-dimensional, uneducated, class A morons, who objected to my comments and assessments. The confrontational abuse I could tolerate - the sheer cranial and awareness limitation of these fruitcakes - I couldn't!Back in the 70's and 80's I was a film critic for a major Australian newspaper as well as several magazines. They didn't hire me for my incompetence or skewed opinions of film generally. Sure, I have opinions, like everyone else, but they are based on considered observation, not knee-jerk adrenaline-flow.Before I offer any critique of \"Halloween Ends\" I want to admonish the many reviewers who have lodged idiotic ratings of \"ones\" and \"twos\" for this film......clearly voting with their emotions and not with any intelligence. Ratings of three and below should be reserved for films of no merit whatsoever - amateurish direction, acting, cinematography, editing, FX and script. Films such as \"Shark Exorcist,\" \"Dracula 3000,\" \"Anaconda 3: Offspring,\" \"Beware the Blob,\" \"Adam & Evil,\" \"Alien 2: On Earth,\" \"The Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf,\" and so many Asylum movies. \"Halloween Ends,\" may not have been what you wanted or expected, but neither is it a work that plumbs the depths of unconscionably bad film making. A movie rating should not take into account or even be influenced by, one's personal dislike of it. Many of the comments \"It wasn't even Haddonfield,\" \"Michael Myers only had a cameo in it,\" \"Barely nothing happened the whole film,\" \"It was unfathomable,\" \"Acting is horrendous,\" \"The worst Halloween movie ever made,\" are totally incorrect. For starters \"Halloween: Resurrection,\" remains by far the worst of the franchise.Whilst I do agree that the relationship between Allyson and Cory was both mismatched and bordering the insane, totally flatlining Allyson's integrity, inner strength and common sense, as we understood it to be, Rohan Campbell's performance as Cory was truly outstanding. Their relationship however is the whole cause of the hatred unleashed at this film. You all wanted to see Michael striding around Haddonfield one last time - slashing, stabbing, mutilating - all the things he does best! I must admit - I did too, but I respect David Gordon Green's attempts at taking an alternate route. This was the first Halloween film to show us a real story (however misplaced ultimately) outside of the Michael Myers universe. If you had all just tried to go WITH IT, instead of jacking up about what you figured you should be watching, you might have seen a different movie.Allow me to quote the words of an internet film critic who wrote just recently, \"Green made some bold choices (and in doing so) ultimately delivered some of the best Halloween content we've ever seen!\" I totally agree. A shame 98% of you didn't notice that!This was by no means a great film but nor was it the 'loser' so many of you want to believe it was.",

I feel like they made Michael Myers who is portrayed as this unstoppable entity of evil and they made him a \"wuss\" that couldn't finish what he started. Looking at Halloween 1- Halloween resurrection the Story line is clear. From The 2007 remake on I feel like the storyline wasn't clear and they made it seem like Lori was the only one left until 2018 when there was other that stood in his way who was \"connected\" to Lori. Halloween was set to be Michale killing off his blood line and I think they lost focus on that.",

This was a complete and total let down, easily the worst film of the whole franchise. First off, you have to sit through like half the movie before Michael even shows up, and then he's not even the one doing the killing, because he's apparently too weak. In previous films we find out that Michael is cursed and that's why it was so hard to kill him in all the other installments. In the last film, we find out from Laurie what needs to be done to end all of this, and that is to kill herself because Michael and her were connected somehow. So it's very bizarre to me that Laurie is able to kill him just by slicing his throat with a knife. I mean really, that's what you guys came up with!!! How is it that easy? How is it that you can completely ruin a whole franchise with all that is available to you technology wise and informationally? How is it when they grind him up at the very end, we see rubber-looking bits? Where are all the cool special effects? Sad and, quite frankly, disappointed in every way, shape and form. I feel like it was a waste of time and money. I understand that Curtis is getting old and she wanted out but this was crappy.

            "content": "Looking at HALLOWEEN ENDS purely as a movie - as opposed to a HALLOWEEN-movie - I thought it was technically the best of Green's trilogy. That's not a popular opinion and it doesn't mean I think HALLOWEEN ENDS was a good movie but I do think it was better scripted than the previous two with far less quota of stupid characters acting irrationally in absurd situations.To say it's the best of the three isn't exactly high praise as I thought Green set the bar very low with the first two.I think they made a conscious decision here to make this movie the black sheep of the trilogy - like HALLOWEEN III:SEASON OF THE WITCH - by building a story that reduced Myers to the distant background.This is strongly hinted at from the off with the opening credits font very closely matching that of H3:SOTW. This deviation has upset a lot of your rabid Myers/franchise fans because they wanted their quota of Myers on the usual rampage with a pumped-up climactic showdown with Laurie Strode. In the end, Myers is a figure very much on the sidelines throughout and is even forgotten about for long stretches of the story. This sidetracking of their beloved villain will be a bitter pill for many Myers fans to swallow. When the final confrontation with Strode arrives, it too is kept brief and fairly low key.None of this bothers me because I'm neither a fan of the franchise nor a Myers fan. My admiration has always solely been for John Carpenter's original film.I do however have a certain amount of admiration for the makers here for deciding not to spoon feed the masses the expected three-course menu of mindless mayhem. Instead they've tried to tell the story of a town, injured by it's past and the scars this has left on it's residents.Despite this game attempt at delivering a HALLOWEEN movie outside the box, there are still the kind of lapses from Green's pen that have blighted the earlier entries in his series. The failure of what would have possibly been the biggest ever manhunt in the US to locate Myers hanging out in the local sewers is a big ask of any audience to digest. One would imagine this might be the first place they'd search. Also, Myers' fluctuating strength and weakness is conveniently manipulated to fit individual moments of the story. This is a character who finished the last movie taking out half the townsfolk mob after being shot, stabbed and clubbed, yet is here overpowered by a nerdy youngster and dispossessed of his mask and later completely owned, one-on-one by a Me-Too empowered now Granny Strode as we reach the climax!This after still being able to lift a character off their feet one-handed and impale her to a wall with a single thrust of a blade.The unexplained connection between Myers and a random youthful misfit is also something you either just accept or you don't. Green relies on Laurie's written musings to get around this by giving us the throwaway line, \"evil changes shape\". Again, this seems a quick, convenient fix around having a character suddenly exhibit traits that were completely absent in the earlier instalments.I'd like to say, having deviated so markedly from his first two offerings and the franchise as a whole, Green here has given us something original but judged outside the HALLOWEEN universe, HALLOWEEN ENDS has a familiar ring to it throughout.A nerdy young misfit named Cunningham falls under the influence of a sinister evil, uses this evil to exact revenge on his tormentors but is eventually killed by the evil that has consumed him. John Carpenter himself gave us this yarn with CHRISTINE back in 1983. As in CHRISTINE also, the nerdy troubled youth somehow forges a highly unlikely romance with the kind of knockout girl who might not too long ago have been crowned prom queen.We even have Michael Myers and the '58 Plymouth Fury sharing a similar fate involving a junkyard crusher in their respective stories.For all this, I would place HALLOWEEN ENDS above its two predecessors because above them, it is far less absurd and has a more linear - if unwelcome by some - character focused story. It is definitely not what the hardcore HALLOWEEN franchise community expected and is therefore likely to rub large numbers of fans up the wrong way.My main complaint would be that Green here, has again given us a horror film that is largely bereft of scares and suspense - surely the essential ingredients for this type of film.Pound for pound however, it is the least chaotic, brutal and plain silly of Green's series and for me, this makes it the better of the three.For many however, it will be the worst.",

There's some good to say about it. It's certainly a well-made film. The acting is great, the characters and scenes have real emotion. They did a great job portraying the effects of the trauma on the town and its people. On how people turned against each other, throwing stones in misdirected anger and despair. The psychology is certainly there, and Laurie delivers some memorable lines herself. They really could have built towards a great sub-plot of Michael regaining his power. There are some downright despicable characters in this film who die, but I still felt bad when they (well, at least some of them) get it. That's how you're supposed to feel when people are killed.But I downright hated this screenplay. Yet another story that might have worked in another film, but just doesn't work in the Halloween universe. They borrowed one of the most controversial elements of one of the Friday the 13th films, and I fail to see why they thought they'd make it work. In fact, they might have had a chance, had they better utilized Michael Myers to begin with. They really had a chance to build on something with his scenes. For those of you who saw Halloween Kills, you remember what Laurie said about where he gets his power. They had a golden opportunity to display that here, and they didn't. They teased it, but then veered off course. It was inconsistent. And Allyson's characterization with Corey felt so shoehorned, and definitely inconsistent with her development. Most of the action scenes feel so stunted, lacking of the suspense and adrenaline of its direct predecessors (and overall in many other Halloween films). They made the character so inconsistent, but generally not intimidating. So how were we supposed to care about this finale?Everything they set up for regarding Michael in Halloween Kills was disregarded here. They'd have done a better job to shave 30 minutes off of that movie, and add a (definitely re-written) grand finale from this film. A finale that would have suited its predecessor. At least it would have made more sense.In fact, actually watching the film made me WANT to like it. But there were so many better ways that they could have made it work. Definitely better ways that they could have ended it. This film isn't as entertaining or scary as its predecessors. The gore was certainly there, but it made it feel cheaper and low-rent. It just feels like they missed so many opportunities to give the Michael Myers story arc a proper send off. He's not even a focal point of the story, and that's how this film was advertised.It's not the worst film in the series. Rob Zombie's Halloween II is definitely worse. I can at least recommend this as a generally well-made film. Watch it just to see the absolute finale of the Michael Myers saga. But this screenplay was just bad. It didn't give us what it advertised. It just limped along to the end. That's the best way to describe it, and it's the worst way that it should have felt.",

I can count 4 other times that i saw Michael (the real one) in the movie. In total, he maybe had 15-20 minutes of screen time and that's generous and the most you saw him was near the climax.The climax however was very weak and it proved that he wasn't a normal man but he died all too easily. The climax and final showdown was over in a matter of minutes. The whole movie focused on Laurie's granddaughter and Corey. He was accidentally killed a little boy he was babysitting and it was actually the kid's fault. Then he finds Micheal in the sewers and follows the dark path after the town ridiculed him for the death of the boy. He lures a bully into the tunnel and Michael kills. Then Corey tells Michael to teach him and he snaps and starts killing while getting cozy with Alison. Laurie catches on to his madness and tries to tell Alison and she doesn't listen. This sums the first-second act. Corey then goes back to the tunnel and wrestles with Michael for a few minutes and he steals Michael's Mask then starts killing as of Michael was doing it. His plan goes wrong. He tries to kill Laurie but his plan fails. Michael follows him back to Laurie's new house and kills Corey after Laurie shoots him. Michael puts his mask back on and him and Laurie hash things out in the kitchen for about a minute and a half before anchoring Michael down to the kitchen island with butcher knives. He one of Michael's hands got free and began to choke Laurie and then finally Alison shows up and slits his throat and wrists, they tie him to the roof of her car and drive to a junkyard with the town following behind and they grind him up. In the final frame, Michael's mask is seen on Laurie's home office coffee table.And that's it in a nutshell. Pretty boring stuff right? Michael died too easily and too shortly.I'm glad I bought a year of peacock for $21.34 instead of spending the exact same amount for the movie tickets for me and my wife.

Now that I've had a night to think about it, I do think that it's somewhat admirable that the filmmakers were trying to do something unique and ambitious, but they didn't pull it off.Ultimately, there were two different movies here, and both would have been better off on their own. The first movie, which is what most people want to see, is the final showdown between Laurie and Michael Myers. That part is good, but really not much more than a short film given how shockingly little screen time it's given.The second movie is about a brand new character named Corey. There are a lot of moments in this portion of the movie where you go \"huh?\" It was ambitious, and there's some kind of commentary in there about how it's ultimately society and a lack of empathy that creates monsters. But that commentary has no place in the Halloween franchise. This is a franchise that started with a psychotic child in a clown costume killing people, who grows up to be an immortal serial killer. Whatever thematic importance the filmmakers are going for in this movie, they picked the wrong franchise for it, because it doesn't line up with the original movie.In my opinion, they should have picked one of these two movies and committed to it wholly.

A \"reimagining\" of the mythology established in 1981, was completely unnecessary for me as a diehard for the original film and sequel. So, I'm sure I am biased to a degree.The conclusion of Ends was the only part that felt like a Halloween film. What a mess and misstep this Friday the 13th V rendition was. A substitute Michael, with a bloated backstory, garnered little sympathy and certainly no fear from me. It was the antithesis of the spirit imbedded in the Halloween franchise.

You can nod at past sequels and throw in fan service, but I ain't buying it.I cannot conclude what theme or message may have been intended about trauma, or mob mentality, or whatever they had in mind, and I don't care. I'm here for a slasher. I'm here for a new installment in the Halloween franchise. I got a giant gamble and it did not succeed.A good friend of mine made an interesting point. Was this their idea of a big nod to Season of the Witch? Did they intentionally give us a third film that flips on our expectations? A beaten down, hermit Michael? Was this a joke? I honestly don't know.I love horror films, and I'm typically not entirely picky. I can suspend disbelief, I can take a level of cheese, but I was utterly bored, confused and disappointed the entire time after the opening sequence. That was a welcome surprise, although it was the backbone of a character arch that, for me, ruined this film.Highlights:\n1. Darcy the Mail Girl's cameo!2. The soundtrack & original score.3. The DJ dressing down our protagonist turned villain. That dude was hilarious.I genuinely don't like to completely dismiss movies and writers, directors, actors, etc. I've tried to write a screenplay and I can't finish. They got it done, so, respect. But boy oh boy is this one a stinker.",

Then it just seems to jump around with Corey's different character interactions, focusing mainly on ones who bully him or people he cares about. Looking back, it was somewhat predictable, as Corey works at a junkyard and wears a mechanic suit like Michael does. It also makes sure you notice the grinder machine that they use at the end, foreshadowing. The first hour though really dragged, as I was expecting a movie more centered around Laurie and Michael.*There's a good 30-60 secs of strobe lights in case of anyone with photosensitivity.*",

Not only are the surviving characters from the previous films completely sidelined and barely shown, but Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are essentially guest stars making cameos in their own film.The biggest flaws with this film are the lack of continuity from the previous two films and the personalities of established characters doing complete 180s. Storylines, character motivations and established canon are thrown out the window.This is probably the worst film in the franchise. As bad as Halloween Resurrection, Rob Zombie's H2 and Halloween 6 were, at least Michael Myers behaved like Michael Myers; he was ruthless, unstoppable and pure evil.

            "content": "Unbelievable. If you are a fan of the saga, you will not enjoy this movie. An ending as cowardly and disrespectful as Resurrection was.This trilogy did something, really, that hasn't been done so far with others (Nightmare, Friday, Childs Play, etc.): it brought back the '78 villain, with all the characteristics of Michael Myers, and made him scary again. At least in the first one (2018). Unlike many, I enjoyed Kills. We saw a brutal Michael, pissed off and on the loose in the streets; moreover, that movie promised a few things: a possible supernatural response to Michael's physical \"immortality\"; what did Michael see through the window?; and the 78 flashback, which, for me, was excellent.However, money always speaks louder than any affection, respect, courage towards the movies and the fans. What was done in Ends is nothing more and nothing less than a cowardly exit to guarantee future sequels - which clearly won't work. Everything that was punctuated and promised in Kills is absolutely ignored and forgotten here. What is given to us, disguised as a \"deep and reflective idea about trauma and violence\", is the cowardice of the writers, directors and producers in the form of an extremely poorly executed, poorly edited and poorly produced film. The entire movie is an argument to try to convince fans that the Halloween series can go on in different ways; and no, it cannot. It can't, and the long-awaited finale just doesn't happen (or does, extremely poorly constructed in the last 20 minutes), and still manages to take away any merit that Halloween Kills had. In some way, it felt like Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Is it possible that directors don't learn from a mistake made 40 years ago?Disappointment, disrespect and cowardice sum up what this film is all about. We already know what to expect from the \"new trilogy\" The Exorcist. I recommend you watch it from home, and don't pay to watch it.",

Rohan Campbell does a really good job at portraying both his character's humanity and more unsettling nature.David Gordon Green's direction is pretty strong overall, there's some really striking imagery and framing throughout with a killer opening sequence but it can be heavy handed with its themes and cuts away from one too many kills.The music by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies is reliably great.

            "content": "'Halloween Ends' is the supposed final chapter in the 'Halloween' franchise, highly doubtful much in the same way that 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' or 'Freddy's Dead' weren't the end of their respective franchises. But I do believe that this marks the ending of the David Gordon Green trilogy which began with 'Halloween (2018)', followed by 'Halloween Kills' in 2021. I have been a fan of this series since I saw the first one many years ago and while none of the following sequels never quite captured the magic of the original, they were still entertaining as hell (for the most part) and even this trilogy with the first one being a clever reinvention of the franchise and the second had flaws but was still enjoyable.The plot begins a year after the tragic events of the previous movies where a young college student Cory Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) babysits a young kid and tragic accident occurs where Cory is accused of murdering the child. Then 4 years later Michael Myers has disappeared and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has now moved on with her life, living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). But when Laurie befriends Corey it triggers a cascade of violence and terror that will force her to finally confront and destroy this evil once and for all.This latest entry may not be what everyone was expecting, but I personally found it rather refreshing and doesn't play it safe like its predecessors by taking a rather different tonal shift, while its still a slasher movie at heart, it's not a straightforward one, it is more of a character driven story that explores ideas briefly touched upon in previous movies with the new character Corey Cunningham and his story arc to what he'd eventually become, which made for an interesting idea and it was the first time that I wasn't fully aware of where this story was gonna go and yes I do get that the lack of Michael Myers for much of the screen time will frustrate fans, especially given that there are certain liberties taken with the character, I find that it works for the most part and the slower pace doesn't always work, but there's enough to keep you going right until the very end.The performances are excellent with Jamie Lee Curtis in her 7th and final Halloween movie showing more range and a different side to her character that we've never seen before, she has always been fantastic in this role and it was nice to see the amount of depth that she brought here. Andi Matichax again gives a solid performance as Allyson for the 3rd time in this series and establishing herself as a franchise favourite heroine and it was nice to see Will Patton and Kyle Richards in their respective roles again and both providing great performances. However special praise goes to newcomer Rohan Campbell who gives a stellar performance as Corey Cunningham, he brings an impressive amount of range to the character and it's an intriguing addition to the story and his tragic circumstances really brings a new flavour to this franchise.Director David Gordon Green took a chance with this trilogy with each of the 3 films exploring a different level of how they brought Michael Myers back and while some fans have issues with this, the final film in this trilogy is a far more grounded with social commentary that's hit or miss at best. You can't deny that this entry is something ambitious that aspires to be something more and for that I was grateful and yes this will be divisive for many and what it is something unique and an unsettling way to explore a familiar story and for that it's a fitting final chapter to a trilogy.",

While I appreciate a big swing from the creative team and while I totally get the morality tale they were going for, I just wasn't a fan. With Laurie sidelined for much of Halloween Kills I was hoping we would get the showdown of all showdowns. Here we get a \"Christine\" type story about a newly introduced character. This would have been a great idea in any story but the finale. Michael and Laurie's final \"battle\" is fine...but super short. Allyson's character remains minimal and we don't see her get much once again. After the events of Kills this movie should have been her and Laurie's revenge and rebirth story.

It's a rarity in horror to have the same writers and directors for a multi-film sequel. Somehow David Gordon Green and Danny McBride took a great film with Halloween (2018) and totally abandoned everything that made it great by going in a different direction in Halloween Ends. In 2018, you would think this would be the greatest string of Halloween sequels since the first two in 1978 and 1981, but this film makes you wish they would have stopped four years ago.What it got right:Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was back for this filmThere are a handful of unique and new style of kills \"Michael\" has in this film.Classic song to end the film.Where it missed:Intro music got this film off to a bad startMichael doesn't appear until the movie is half over and he's barely a character in the filmThe story and flow of this film is bad. Doesn't feel like a Halloween movie in line with the franchise.Since when are kids in the HS band the bullies?You would think Laurie and Allyson hate Halloween at this point, not celebrating it considering all the trauma that's happened on Halloween night.Why does Corey's mom have such a thick New York accent when Haddonfield is in Illinois? Why is she so unnecessarily aggressive?If your son dies on Halloween would you really be hanging out at the bar on Halloween night with a bunch of college kids that are dancing?The high ceiling sewer under the bridge that nobody knows about?A new killer is such a bad addition to this storyThe parade of people lining up at the end is nonsensical.Overall, this three part sequel crashed and burned. It started off so well with the first film, Halloween (2018), and somehow made this film not even feel like a member of the Halloween franchise. It's the worst one of the twelve Halloween films. Maybe it fell victim of so many horror sequels and just ran out of new ways to take the story.

The descent into madness of main character Corey. This by itself would've been an excellent movie, the coaxing of a tragic character into a deep murderous madness. The thing that leaves such a terrible taste in my mouth is how EXCELLENT the opening scene was and how many of Corey's scenes he knocked out the role of a tragic character who can't shake the stain of accidental blood on his hands.2. The final battle between Laurie and The Shape. Michael's barely in it, and provides a rushed last minute battle. Michael takes a back seat to a character who tries to \"become him\" for reasons entirely unrelated to Michael. Last second they throw him in as a near after thought, the directors finally remembering that Michael NEEDS to be in a Halloween movie.Lesser gripes about the movie include a lack of attention to important details that make/break horror movies- there was no attempt at utilizing scenery, lighting, and background imagery to raise tension.Characters were assassinated and two dimensional with the distinct exception of the murderer the director WANTED to do a film about.There's nothing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth so much as failed potential, and this movie has much of it.",

But, every scene with Jamie Lee Curtis, I DID like.Jamie Lee Curtis is such a hero as Laurie Strode! And I must say that despite some elements being worse than ever in this latest Halloween movie, her character itself has actually improved since the first movie of this rebooted franchise.I have a mega-crush on Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode! She's my type, and I want to hug her and cuddle her and just be with her! She's got that certain something! And I hope that her character gets her happily-ever-after with that sweet guy!In case you can't tell by what I've said so far, yes I do believe there will be another movie in the franchise. Only Michael Myers as we know him has ended, the franchise itself, I doubt has. Yes, the ending of this movie hints at the horror continuing through a new character and Laurie's granddaughter- who will become the new protagonist, replacing Laurie as the main woman in the series. Yet, should the films take this direction, which I think they will, Laurie will still be there in reference, and as a supporting character sometimes. So yes, I hope that the next time we see her, she's married to her sweetheart and finally living in peace. If the horror has to continue, I'll watch as a fan of the Jamie Lee films of the franchise. So, filmmakers, please be good to her and her character! I love her so much!In short, the Halloween movies are horror for horror lovers and non-horror lovers alike. Even though I am not a big fan of horror in general, I do like these movies. Even the ones I don't like, I still appreciate on some level, because the leading lady is so likable, as well as the theme music and other elements. And, if another in the series IS made, I will watch it too. I just wish we'd go back to the simplicity and minimal gore of the earlier films- because blood and gore is NOT why I watch these- I watch for the thrill and suspense, which is not dependent on blood and gore- ad I watch for a character that I love, who truly deserves her happy ending.",

            "content": "This movie is nowhere near as bad as the reviews are saying. But the negative reviews have a point. The movie suffers from two big problems - the name, and the audience expectations. Both are obviously linked.After Halloween Kills, knowing that the next one was Halloween Ends, fans are filled with expectations of a big finish to the series. Dialogue had suggested that there was a possibility that Laurie Strode and Michael Myers had to kill each other to bring an end to things.Instead, we get an exploration of the role that the town plays in creating a monster. Michael is relegated to a supporting role for the vast majority of the movie.Thematically, this makes sense. A big chunk of Halloween Kills was about the way that the town has been dragged into making things worse out of their fear.And that's fine. But it doesn't fulfill the expectations. It's interesting - but it feels like we never reach the fireworks factory.Because so much of the movie is given over to this other plot, the big finish fight with Michael seems like an afterthought. It's not a bad fight. In fact, attached to another movie, it would be a satisfying final battle.The plot that fills most of the movie has value. But, since there's a bit less time than a full movie devoted to it, there are things the story needs that aren't developed as much as they need to be. The strong opener leaves us feeling for Corey, but that goodwill is wasted by him being creepy or violent the rest of the movie. It's very hard to believe that Allyson would have any attraction to him. Maybe if they didn't have a romantic attraction? If she found him interesting or compelling, I might be able to buy that.Released under a different title, maybe released as a spin-off, this could have been a pleasant surprise.I think there's a chance that this movie will have a better reputation in the future. It's interesting, and it's less like most of the Halloween movies. And that has value.",

I was very surprised how much David Gordon Green and crew changed it up, but why so late in the franchise! I think the horrific flop of H-Kills was a silver lining! I'll give a few pros and cons I had with this movie:Pros:Corey Cunningham! I loved this character how he was the new protagonist turned antagonist he had great character development and transformation. His conflict and love with Alison gave her a better character arc as well!The shift in power/soul from Michael to Corey was so creative and felt so fresh in the lore of The Shape. I know its a Halloween movie but we don't need Michael Meyers its the manifestation of evil that lives within Michael that's the true threat. I loved the team-up kills and possession aspect where weak old Michael is using young-strong Corey to kill and try to regain strengthLastly the kills were so fun and not extreme CGI Rambo/John Wick kills like in the 2018 reboot. It felt like horror back to its roots, practical effects and fun gore not cringe inducing gross out shock horror.Our fun prankster friend Michael returned! (Opening fall, pinning the nurse to the wall and the record store tongue kill were things of beauty **muahh kisses handCons:The ending, why wedge in yet another Laurie/Michael fight. And they didn't follow through on Corey's arc! Kill Michael and have Corey sit up at the end of the movie (He's the new Shape, the transformation is complete!) I know this suggests sequel bait but I think that would have been a fitting ending.Less boring a** Laurie strode please. And what was with that half-a**ed love story with Laurie and the old man who we're supposed to know.Overall I thought this was a great finale and change up in the trilogy, people complain they want something different and then they get it and complain it's not more of the same! Get off your high-horse people it's a Halloween movie that delivers! Enjoy!",

            "content": "Both Carpenter and Curtis have, at various times, expressed their loathing for the Halloween franchise. That might sound insane since the 1978 original firmly placed both on the Hollywood map, but after watching Ends, I'm convinced the pair has let their hatred come full circle.As for Green and McBride - who the hell knows. Were they ever Halloween devotees or just slick posers who somehow huckstered their way into the Blumhouse boardroom?What's unfortunate among a sea of unfortunates is that Rohan Campbell is genuinely great as the doomed Corey. The circumstances surrounding his fall from grace are admittedly ridiculous and hamfisted, but once done, you know this kid is fodder for the abyss and Campbell really, REALLY sells it.Another luckless aspect of the movie is that the writers actually had a terrifying premise, but threw it into the trash. While Myers subsisting in a drainage tunnel is a stretch, it could've been overlooked had said premise been fully realized.And there it was, just waiting to be easily grasped as one would a juicy and ripe apple from the produce aisle. Yet, once again, these Hollywood types continue to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory because of...well, I don't have a clue.What's even more baffling is that this premise began to take shape in the form of street billboards documenting missing Haddonfield residents. Oh, I'm sorry - ONE billboard. Why just the one? Hey, I'd pay good money for an equally good answer.It was so obvious how the film should've played out to deliver true terror. Perhaps too obvious, but it certainly would've been better than what we got. In short, Corey should've led a parade of victims into Myers' drain domicile for grisly dispatch. And as Michael killed, he should've regained his supernatural strength and resolve, climaxing to becoming The Shape we all know and love. Such a mesmerizingly horrific montage could've been a celebration of the latest in gory practical effects, some of which being homages to past kills from all the Halloween films. This would've put the entire town on scared-to-death edge, as more and more billboards are erected, while the eyes of Haddonfield are leveled at Laurie as the catalyst for another series of murders courtesy of a likely source.Once at 100%, Michael could've delivered his coup de gr\u00e2ce by luring both Laurie and Allyson back to the still-standing, but haunted house-like 707 Meridian Avenue on October 31st in preparation for their slaughter. Corey could've then had a glimmer of redemption by realizing his evildoings and fondness for Allyson, thereby teaming-up with the duo to defeat Michael in a bloody and action-filled sequence that left the door open for Michael's survival, a la Halloween 1978.Oh, the possibilities. Instead, what we got was a 95% Lifetime movie about mentally damaged young adults, with the remaining 5% a lukewarm effort to instill some degree of fear into a hitherto listless audience.I could go on, like the unengaging murder of the slimy doctor and his mistress, one of the victims of Kills having somehow miraculously survived (apparently, Michael has gotten sloppy), an all-steel radio transmitting tower on fire, the lack of any scope to the proceedings, and Lindsey (yes, she's in this movie) not even being present while Michael is turned into hamburger, but the film has so many odd and inane story choices that they almost disappear into the background.Look, I understand the desire to be profound and to do something different with these characters, especially since this is the capstone of a (celebrated?) series based on a beloved spooky franchise, but this is Halloween, not Dostoevsky. It shouldn't be burdened with trying to say something complicated about the human condition. All it needed to do is be gripping and fun for two hours. That sort of narrative weight isn't there, nor is it expected, so why the writers and director thought they had to perform a pointless deadlift that ultimately yielded zero results is...well, I got nothing.As with the Hellraiser reboot, Ends ends in deep disappointment. Both Curtis and Carpenter need to make the final break from what made them famous and put Halloween in the rear-view if this is all they can come up with. That said, I give it around five years before the studio can't help itself and commissions another bleached Shatner mask.Boooooooo!",

The additions to the lore make me think no one involved understood the appeal of the series or the Michael Myers character. Michael should never intentionally spare anyone, for example. There were shockingly large chunks of this film devoted to uninteresting bland side characters where no horror was happening at all. The ending feels like a parody of itself, where they have made certain characters so invincible that they have to go to laughable lengths to ensure the audience knows that certain characters are well and truly dead.

It is very different from what I think we all were expecting, and I hoped there was more showdown action, but overall I think it's an interesting way to conclude the story. Great soundtrack, some good old school gore effects, and an evolution of Michael we've never seen. This movie was good for what it was, but no it's not your typical Michael slasher terrorizing the town story. From the get-go this movie teased and referenced a metamorphosis of Michael - right in the opening credits we see the pumpkin transforming over and over again (something that's never happened before in the title credits). I think this movie was poking fun and being aware of itself and it's many variations of sequels. That even with Corey (that's all I'll say) and all new versions of Michael and stories since 1978, nothing will be able to replace Michael or replicate him no matter how hard they try to. Michael can't \"give the torch\" to a new generation of people, because Michael IS the torch, and we saw that come to play here. The biggest homage and plus for me was the intense feeling of \"he's somewhere lurking\" throughout the movie, something I haven't felt since the OG in '78. That even when Michael wasn't present, we feel his presence. Halloween 2018 dealt with personal trauma of Michael, Halloween Kills was community trauma of Michael, and Halloween Ends was everlasting trauma Michael continued to cause, even if he didnt do anything.",

I bought the tickets well in advance as I love the Halloween franchise and I actually really enjoyed \"Kills\" last year so my dismay when I started to read all the bad reviews saying it was worse than \"Resurrection\" was off the scale.Luckily \"Halloween Resurrection\" is STILL the worst of the franchise. Ends kind of falls along side SOTW in that it could've worked as a Halloween anthology film like they tried back in 1983 but they didn't have the nerve to leave out Myers all together.Let me try and explain this. The story isn't bad - it's just a complete misfire as the concluding part of the new trilogy. As a stand alone film if you take out the franchise character names and the guy in the sewer is a towns alleged urban myth then it's actually not that bad a premise for a decent film. The towns wrongly accused outcast is pushed until he snaps and uses the towns mythical boogeymen fear to extract revenge on those who wronged him.The trouble is this IS the conclusion of a Halloween trilogy and has been for 5 long years billed as the trilogy that was going to correct all the mistakes that everything post Carpenter's 1978 original had made.There's a lot of window dressing (and I don't mean fake spiders and pumpkins) to try and weave this film to the previous two. The sheriff - he has one 20 second scene and speaks 3 words. Hawkins, completely unneeded cameo. Lindsay Wallace, again 2 minutes tops and adds nothing.I understand it's set 4 years later, but it comes across as though the events of Kills happened 20 years ago. The story and characters are that disconnected from the previous film. In fact EVERYTHING they set up in Kills is abandoned.Having said all of that, I don't completely feel like the film has zero merits. There are some nice homages to the 78 movie and there are some decent kills. It's just a shame they took so long to get to them.Overall it's inevitable that Halloween Ends now can't be the end because it's such a misfire that they need to carry on. Although I doubt they will let Green anywhere near it again, which is bittersweet as he undeniably gave us probably the second best entry in his 2018 film and Kills is ok too.",

The setup has potential, but the execution is far from satisfactory. The pacing of the film is slow, and the characters lack the depth and development that would make them interesting to the audience.One of the biggest problems with Halloween Ends is its lack of scares. This is a horror movie, after all, and one would expect that it would have some spine-tingling moments. Unfortunately, the movie relies too heavily on cheap jump scares and predictable twists, and fails to deliver any real suspense or terror.Another issue with the movie is its lack of originality. The plot feels like a rehashing of previous Halloween movies, and the characters are archetypes that we have seen countless times before. The film lacks the creativity and inventiveness that made the original Halloween so memorable.Despite its shortcomings, Halloween Ends is not a complete waste of time. There are a few standout moments, and the acting is solid across the board. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a particularly strong performance as Laurie Strode, bringing the same sense of determination and strength that she brought to the role in previous films.In conclusion, Halloween Ends is a disappointing addition to the Halloween franchise. While it has its moments, the film ultimately fails to deliver the suspense and scares that fans of the series have come to expect. With a lackluster plot, uninspired characters, and a lack of originality, Halloween Ends falls short of its potential. If you're a die-hard fan of the series, you may enjoy the film, but for the casual viewer, it is best to skip this one.",

            "content": "I had low expectations for this, and it came in as about as expected. I rate this one higher than Kills though. Mainly because Kills was such a disappointment after 2018, but also because it contained lower than usual amounts of political-socio dreck. I thought the opening scene was great, I liked that Laurie Strode was a little more normal and not a total caricature strapped to a hospital bed the entire time. Even the flip to victim-blaming was portrayed decently here. So it starts out solid, but the film morphed into a snoozy melodramatic piece laced with shallow symbolism- which didn't land well. Overall: Fairly anti-climactic, but also confusing in plot, with unremarkable kills, scares, or gore (minus the opening scene). There could have been some good ones with the bullies, but little was shown. No risks taken. It's too bad that it started out good and drowned in its own pseudo-philosophical writing. It could have been a fresh, and spooky flick.",

CRINGE!!! Lol). I'd been looking forward to this since the release of the 2nd one and boy, it was like being hit with a freight train full of disappointment. Random guy who killed the kid he was babysitting by accident gets bullied by high school idiots. Gets roughed up and chucked over a bridge. Michael, at the end of the Halloween Kills, gets up and murders all those who beat and stabbed him etc, then murders Laurie's daughter. Somehow, he is now old and decrepit and has supposedly spent the last 4 years hiding in a sewer/storm drain. Anyways, the drain just happens to be under the bridge Corey is chucked off. Michael drags him into the pipe but doesn't kill him. Like, what? Corey wakes, Michael grabs him and they see into each other minds and pow, a murdering tag team is born. Really? All the while, Corey is falling in love with Laurie's granddaughter Allyson, who is every bit as annoying as her mum was. Laurie tries to warn her off Corey, because somehow she can \"see the evil in him\". One minute Michael is grabbing nurses and pinning them to the wall with knives and the next he's weak again. Michael and Laurie are hardly in the movie. Spend over an hour on developing Corey's character, only for Michael to snap his neck like a twig. I could go on, but whats the point? A steaming pile of garbage inside a dumpster fire. If you have insomnia, this will cure it.",

It's been 4 years since Kills & from what we were told in those films then Michael shouldn't of still been that weak to be beaten by the same guy who had been beaten twice by students... It took about 40 minutes before you even see Michael. This is not a Michael vs Laurie film. It's a Corey film for the most part. The final 30 or so minutes are a bit more enjoyable but can't save the rest of it.

Every 5 minutes there was a \"jump scare\" that had nothing to do with anything. It's so bad.For instance, a character will be eating and then a piece of food will fall from their fork to the plate and an explosion of sound/music will occur. Wow so scary! Genius filmmaking! Or for instance, a character will blink and it will be a \"jump scare\". Any director who uses this lazy, talentless hack method to \"scare\" the audience instantly loses my respect.Other than there being no suspense or atmosphere, the story and acting was unbelievably bad. This is why you dont ever have more than 2 writers work a screenplay (let alone 4), especially for a Halloween movie. It's a Halloween movie for God's sake, how many brains do you need to come up with a cohesive story about a dude who kills people with a knife?! Apparently way more than 4 because the story was so bad it makes Rob Zombie's H2 seem good! You could tell each writer tried to get their own ideas in, which ended up as an incoherent mess that plays like random scenes slapped together.I like 'Halloween' 2018 and I may like 'Kills' more, even though it gets a lot of flak, but oh man, if you were one of the people that thought 'Kills' was bad, you are not prepared for the awfulness that awaits you in 'Ends'. 'Kills' dialogue and character choices would be questionable at times, but at least it had Michael at his angriest and most violent. You get none of that in 'Ends', where 90% of the Kills are off screen. I even bought the burnt Michael mask last year for Halloween and went as him, so you could imagine how sad I was once the credits rolled for the dumpster fire I saw last night.Anyone who scores this above a 3 is lying to themselves.

Allyson was all of a sudden a made for tv version of Juliette Lewis in \"Natural Born Killers\" because of the passion she felt for a lonely nerd who is bullied by high school band members.Then we finally see Michael...who is wrestled to the ground by the same kid who has been bullied by the above mentioned high school band members. Just takes his mask away.If Kenny Powers and his pals wanted to tell that story, it could have been a sub-plot that took up MAYBE 20 minutes in \"Kills\", but to not only take away what we as fans have been yearning to see in a battle between Michael and Laurie, then replacing it with this Cory/Allyson mish mash of garbage, was just insulting.If I'm being honest, you could make a few edits to the end of 2018, add in the end of \"Ends\" to it, and we would have had another amazing and fulfilling story. Instead, we get an insufferable Tommy in \"Kills\" and some side mission with a last minute \"crap, we forgot about Michael and Laurie\" fight at the end.Know when to take a chance on something different and when to service a loyal, decades old fan base.This is an embarrassment.",

Even with all that she's done, she still winds up losing her daughter, son in law, and friends. All she has left is her granddaughter, but instead of doing all she can to protect her, in this film she's just \"living\". Lindsey has really bad bangs, why? Because she had them as a child? A completely different actor that looks nothing like the child played Tommy was cast as adult Tommy but Lindsey needs to have her childhood bangs? The whole town united against Michael Myers in the last film, finally seeing the truth and proving Laurie right. They all saw first hand what supernatural psychokiller Michael Myers can do, but just 4 years later everyone has forgotten. They mock and have turned on Laurie, they even blame her? This makes no sense. Laurie has had some kind of psychic connection to Michael Myers all this time, yet now he's living under a bridge in the sewer or something underground just blocks from her home and she has no idea? Michael Myers is a well established super-natural unstoppable force but now has aged like a man, has stopped stalking and hunting and just stays underground, waiting for opportunity kills? We never find out if he killed the kid Corey was babysitting. We think yes he did, with the knife disappearing, the door left open, etc. But if he did, that makes even less sense. He came out and killed once, then just disappeared into the sewer? The father of the kid says he thinks Corey was a good kid who didn't kill his son, but looks at him years later for a few seconds and says he could tell Corey was not the same person by his eyes. Really? Again Laurie talks about Michael's eyes, and the connection, but still has no idea. At this point though so much of this movie contradicts what's been established in the last two movies, that we just accept nothing makes sense. And that \"teach me\" stuff from Corey? Teach him what, how to shove a knife into someone? Now Michael Myers comes out of retirement finally and kills at the doctor's house. Corey purposefully smacks his bloody hand on the glass. Why? To leave DNA?Halloween movies are about Michael Myers. This isn't a movie about Michael Myers. It's about Corey, and his screwed up mother, and his poor father, and the girl with baggage he likes, and the pack of bullies that chase him, and the psycho in the sewer he connects to.Rohan Campbell is an intense and gifted actor.

I was about to type up an angry review out of spite, but decided it better to sleep on it, and when I woke up I had to ask how much of my disappointment had to do with a genuinely bad film versus how much it went against my expectations.As the title suggests, I don't think this is a bad film. There's a lot here to like once you get past the fact that this is not the story that should be chosen to cap off a trilogy-but unfortunately, that's what we're looking at and it can't be denied that after the setup of the previous two films, it should be understandable for fans to have a certain expectation on what a third movie will focus on. I can't fault anyone who outright hates this movie because it does swing for the fences and aims for greater heights than its reach can grasp.I won't get deep into spoilers, but Rohan Campbell has a very thankless job here. Suffice it to say his character plays a very prominent role in this movie and while the actor himself does a very good job with what he's meant to do, it's the mere inclusion of his character that's going to divide a lot of people. It's not at all his fault, but there's an early sign of trouble in the opening credits when four names are listed for coming together on this screenplay, and the movie certainly plays out as though there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen. I don't know at what point in the filmmaking process that this movie became more about this specific character and I don't know who is responsible for that, but while I personally can find enjoyment in his character, people hoping for more Michael Myers vs. Laurie Strode are going to be understandably disappointed.That's not to say there isn't a satisfying showdown between Michael and Laurie to be had, because once the film finally gets to that point, it's stressful. Jamie Lee Curtis gets to run through the gamut of emotions in this movie and whenever she's onscreen the film shines. Thankfully she's more present here than in Halloween Kills, but fans will still likely wish they had more of her. Also unlike Halloween Kills, this film has a very deliberate pace and the death scenes (with one really jarring exception) are toned down compared to previous entries. There is a body count yes and you will get some carnage, but the movie does take a while to get there.I wish I could rate this movie higher-and maybe on a rewatch some time down the road, knowing what I'm getting myself into and fully prepared for the road this movie goes down, I probably would think of it in a better light. It's very fitting this film uses the same title font that's used in Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. Just like that film, this movie is probably going to get a lot of hate for quite some time, but down the road when the dust settles and people look back on this movie, I can definitely see this gaining a cult following.",

So, why was she walking out of the hospital in absolutely no pain holding a knife saying I'm coming for you Michael for you to leave that idea and move onto a nonsensical movie about everything else but Michael Myers?

I ended up actually really enjoying this direction, and it ended up being uniquely enjoyable. The only bad part is they decided to end the movie with the same tired Myers vs. Strode thing, except it was super lame and underwhelming.

Michael Myers is barely in the film, they set up a brand new character as a copycat killer, they introduce some odd supernatural element to Michael's evil which somehow makes it contagious. Laurie is no longer paranoid even though Michael is FREE IN THE WORLD after Kills. Her granddaughter goes from liking and respecting her knowledge (you know, since she's been right for the past two films), to distrusting her because she likes a boy. Just so many baffling and confusing decisions made. This would have been fine as a standalone non-Michael Myers movie.

It had so many clich\u00e9s right from the beginning like love at first sight and American bullies who physically abuse our main character. In my opinion the beauty of Halloween movies has been the fact that they are slasher movies where the murderer comes from the shadows and just silently kills his victims and moves on to the next victim. In this movie the killer did the exact opposite. The scene where the radio host died made me roll my eyes to the back of my head. It did not match the style of the previous movies at all! And why in the hell would you write a new serial killer just for the last movie? And why was the character of this new guy so badly written? The story line itself made no sense at all.But I think this is what dissapointed me the most: if this was the last Halloween movie (at least before they make a reboot) I think it should have been about Laurie.

            "content": "Halloween Ends is a profound disappointment, but at least no-one can truthfully be surprised after the previous offering. The bar was set so low after Halloween Kills that I only wanted to watch this to see David Gordon Green's trilogy belly-flop onto the mat, knock the wind out of itself and be disqualified by all judges. However, this final instalment somehow manages to discover new lows seemingly right from the off and it was a supreme challenge making it to the end - words I am pained to write.So, what is wrong with it?Well, essentially, it is the writing. The cast are solid in terms of getting what they can out of what they have been given but the script is as poorly constructed as a novel written by Dean R Koontz if he had Alzheimer's, Long COVID and had also experienced a traumatic brain injury. Or if he were just simply Dean R Koontz.I will not go into much detail about the character of Corey. I wish to avoid explicit spoilers and feel certain that many here will already have expressed their outrage at the ill-conceived introduction of the character and the numerous reasons this not only failed, but also cheated fans of the series simply in terms of Michael's significance to the plot. Suffice to say that Corey is dreadful, but through no fault of Rohan Campbell's performance, which is solid: the idea for the character is misguided and simply another rehashing of a well-worn device in order to introduce musings-for-dummies on the nature of evil. This is handled so poorly it makes Rob Zombie - with his own efforts to explore the same terrain in his entries in the series - seem like he may be one of the 21st centuries greatest minds.Everything that is wrong with Halloween Ends is related to the writing. The film is built around a script that fails to engage and frequently irritates. It is simplistic yet seems to lack cohesiveness and is stultifyingly repetitive, even so far as in terms of word choice, as demonstrated by the book being written and narrated at turgid intervals throughout by Laurie Strode herself - now more reminiscent of Laura Ingalls than Sarah Connor. This voiceover as a device in the film is itself, heavy-handed; not dissimilar to a no-budget production hammering exposition into audience heads through everyman psychology. Laurie's over-reliance on the use of the word 'evil' - as well as perhaps the pacing of the film itself - is so extreme as to make me think of a 'David Gordon Green's Halloween Trilogy Drinking Game' in which the audience have to...well, this should be self-explanatory, right? However, were the game to include all three films as three rounds, the likelihood of anyone being able to physically survive the second round of the game - with the vigilante mob's chants of ''Evil dies tonight'' - would be so low as to render the third round obsolete. Anyone making it that far would probably already be experiencing renal failure. Halloween Kills? Indeed! Halloween Ends? It doesn't even get to pass go and collect $200.Finally, what is a Halloween film without Michael Myers. The unfairly derided Halloween III: Season of the Witch removed him completely and that choice was more respectful to both the character and the audience than the bit-part role in which the character operates here in terms of both centrality to the narrative and actual, physical time on camera. The depiction of Michael in Green's previous film of the three seemed the diametric opposite of that in the first by once again making him an unrelenting, unnaturally strong, unkillable killing machine. This was probably the most egregious of the missteps taken by those responsible for that script - possibly South Park's famous 'Family Guy manatees' - yet once it had been decided to set-off on this tangential route, it would surely have been better to at least continue on to the logical destination and the conclusion of the film series. Instead, one is left to wonder quite why The Shape of the final film would seem more suited to a rocking chair and a cup of hot-soup in an elderly care home than on embarking on yet another rampage. I am fifty-four years old and in spite of having had surgery on both shoulders and knees over the years, I watched Halloween Ends suspecting that even I could possibly now take Michael Myers in a fight, or at the very least, least give him a wedgie. There can surely be no greater indictment than this.Green's first Halloween outing, while flawed, at least gave the audience hope for something really satisfying to come. Halloween Kills put paid to that optimism and the final instalment has left a very bad taste in the mouth. Indeed, these three films collectively have felt very undeserving of the use of the term 'trilogy'. On reflection, 'scatology' might have been more appropriate.",

He deserved so much more than he got.After watching the first two of the Blumhouse Halloween movies, I did not expect the acting to be any good, and I expected more dumb dialogue, although I feel they did dial it down a half notch. I got what I expected even as I tried to shed any expectations for this movie, I only managed to succeed on one front.Considering that John Carpenter had originally intended Halloween to be an anthology series with different stories based on Halloween night, I honestly viewed this movie with an anthology theme in mind. If we didn't know Laurie Strode for everything she is known for, this movie succeeds. It would get a 6.5/10 rating and earn every bit of it.The problem is that when brought back to reality, it's not an anthology. This movie had no room for a new character to take over the entire story just to tell Michael \"okay, let's squeeze you in here at the end and get you killed, come on, only got 10 minutes left\". That narrows down the send off that they felt was appropriate for Michael. I'm insulted on Michael Myers' behalf. Some may feel that 3/10 is being pretty generous, but there were some good moments in the movie. It wasn't a terrible movie, it was a terrible sendoff for 44 years of horror.",

It was the anticipation, the music, and leading up to the fright part. In the Halloween Ends, it just was not scary at all. It was off track. The director missed the mark completely.",

He kills a drunk, off duty cop while the kid watched. Then the kid is able to out man handle Michael to take his mask???. In what world??? Michael has always had super human strength. We all wanted to see Strode kick some butt and she kinda did. But leading up to the last 5 minutes it was so predictable. I will watch the other two Halloweens since they at least stayed true to the franchise. I love Jamie Lee but girl, come on, the writers should have been fired on this one.

            "content": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Halloween Ends; here's the breakdown of my ratings:Story: 1.00\nDirection: 1.00\nPace: 1.25\nActing: 1.25\nEnjoyment: 1.25TOTAL: 5.75 out of 10.00.Halloween Ends is not the best movie in the franchise, though it's better than Michael's last outing. And this comes down to a slightly more bountiful storyline. However, that storyline is full of inconsistencies in the Michael Myers mythos. I find the whole forget the sequels, except for the new sequels, concept highly amusing. If you're going to be so bold as to do that, then you need to make the \"legitimate\" addendum movies better than the \"illegitimate\" ones. And, for me, they've failed.Paul Brad Logan gives the audience three intertwining plots. The first is the love story of accidental child killer Corey and Laurie's granddaughter Allyson. Corey, like the rest of the town, has been brought up in the shadow of little Mikey Myers. Unable to get a babysitter on short notice, Corey steps in to help one of his gardening job clients. Their kid is a complete arse and makes Corey's night a misery. He opens the front door, runs up the stairs, slams the loft door, and starts screaming. Corey runs to the rescue after seizing a knife from the kitchen, thinking that maybe Myers has returned. But once upstairs, the kid cons his dimwitted, but heroic, minder into the loft and locks the door behind him, taking the proverbial out of him for the next few minutes as Corey becomes more irate and begins kicking at the door. Just as the nasty kid's parents return, Corey finally boots the door open, right into the waiting face of his charge, sending him over the bannisters and down to the hardwood floor three storeys below. So from now on, he's a pariah and a freak: Giving him something in common with Laurie and Allyson. This commonality leads to the underlying second plot - Haddonfield's mistrust of any and everyone, as most residents see a vicious masked killer around every corner. Their blinkered vision strengthens the bond between the unfortunate trio. After witnessing school kids bullying Corey, Laurie helps him out of the situation. She drives him to the hospital for stitches and introduces him to her granddaughter - never let granny choose your love interest; it never turns out well - Romance blooms. Regrettably, nobody knows how broken the poor lad is, and we watch as Romance follows the blossoms onto the compost heap of life. And this is when we get to the third plotline - Little Mikey Myers becomes Corey's Yoda. And that is where the story fell apart for me. Loner Myers takes an apprentice in the not-so-fine art of slayerising people - yeah, right! Even disregarding the previous films, this notion doesn't work. There's no reason for the great masked one to hook up with anyone. I can accept that he's kept himself hidden in a storm drain, and kills any poor unsuspecting passing stranger, as the hobo states; but then to leave Corey alive? It doesn't jell. Not without some decent story writing. And that is where the rest of the movie falls flat. The complete item needed more: more in its characterisations, more in its structure, and more in its reasoning. At the picture's end, I was left wholly unsatisfied by the telling. I was hoping, when I saw Blumhouse's new opening branding, that the story would be decent. Sadly, it's as poor as their Invisible Man - You guys should start choosing your projects better.Then we come to David Gorden Green's direction. And it starts well, but quickly falls into feeling half-arsed as he throws in tributes to the original flick. Lamentably, these comparable scenes lack the power of the original. For example, there's a shot where Laurie looks out her window and spots Corey, standing by a bush. Of course, her mind flashes back to when she first saw Michael: Standing ominously half-in and half-out of the hedgerow. Sadly, Green's version lacks atmosphere and menace, which the original exuded in bucket loads. But to add insult to injury, Green throws in a cheap and impossible jump scare. Laurie stands centre screen in a letterbox format, which provides the viewer with space to her right and left. Impossibly, Corey is behind her, which we see when she suddenly spins around and the soundtrack blares. To get behind her, he would've needed to move through the emptiness on either side of her. It's a tacky scare, not required for the scene. And then it gets worse as Green walks us down memory lane - because, maybe, the story's not making us feel too reminiscent of Laurie's bad old times. So we have one of the most-scorned items to ever grace the movie screen: The Montage. In the 80s nearly every film played a montage - Even Rocky. It became so commonplace that people grew to detest them, as they were merely time-fillers. If you couldn't remember what transpired mere minutes before or in the previous movie, then it couldn't have been that good. But when the film is good, you remember the iconic moments, and the Montage becomes monotony. I think Green tries to use it to add more oomph to his offering, but it doesn't work; this is sad because Green isn't a terrible director. He delivers some fine compositions and lighting effects throughout the film.Haddonfield is a sleepy little town, and the feeling must be catching, as most of the cast, even the seasoned performers, come across as a tad lethargic. However, the worst of the bunch is Rohan Campbell. For an easygoing soul who steps towards the dark path Michael Myers walks, Campbell's portrayal of Corey lacked power. There's one segment where the dad of the child Corey accidentally killed remembers seeing him on the street one day. The one thing that stands out is Corey's cold, lifeless black eyes. On the screen, we see Corey looking like Corey. There's no threat, no menace, no dead eyes. I felt sorry for Will Patton, who's proved himself an actor of skill. In Halloween Ends, he stumbles about, looking and sounding, like he's ready for his afternoon nap.Okay, so the story could've been much better, the direction slightly better, and the acting considerably better, but it still isn't the worst Halloween movie I've watched. As such, I'd recommend it to Mikey Myers fans around the globe. But only for the one watch, and only if you've completed your watchlist. To the newbies, well, go and check out the original two films. These are great if watched back-to-back. And are still superior to these final flicks.Michael? Are You Listening To Me Michael? I want to learn the ways of the dreaded masked Jedi, but before we get started on Slasher101 can you read my IMDb lists - Absolute Horror and Killer Thriller Chillers to see where I ranked Halloween Ends?Take Care & Stay Well.",

As controversially the original wasn't as good as everyone makes it out to be, a lot of poor acting and visual effects but Jamie Lee Curtis it what made the 2018 so good, now Halloween Ends is a prequel to the 2018 one and it has plenty of jump scares suspenseful very gruesome deaths with creepy moments and is overall a very good Halloween film, the only thing I disliked was a random man never seen before with little story becoming Michaels 'sidekick' but luckily he is killed and doesn't take away Michaels effect on the audience at all, Michael is a lot more fragile in this film which is good as the story line fits him to be 65. I didn't like that he was living in a sewer, but I think the final showdown with him and Laurie was actually very good and smart, michael has one of the most grim deaths ever, even before grinding him all his veins are slit, it's horrible and in away you feel a bit sad seeing the most iconic man in horror die, he puts up a good fight and I think the film wouldn't be good if it was just the final stand down, I did like the way that the wannabe Michael is formed but it just wasn't right for the finale, the acting and cinematography is top notch and has that classic Halloween vibe, and when Michael is chasing his victims it really relates to the original, overall I think the reason it has been rated so poorly is because mega Halloween fans wanted the finale to be the best film in history which in reality was never going to happen, So do I think it will actually be the finale? No, but when they make another one it will be horrendous, as much as I love Michael his legacy has been going long enough, it's definitely worth watching if u like horror but isn't for the light hearted.",

I liked Halloween (2018), and Halloween Kills (2021) was not great, but it was entertaining leading up to this final movie in the franchise.The movie focuses on this character named Corey and his progression into taking the evil from Michael Myers and being the next killer in Haddonfield. Which would be fine if you built it up in the earlier 2 movies, but his progression to being like Michael Myers is not setup well even though they gave him a backstory in why people do not like him.Jamie lee Curtis as Laurie Strode is nice seeing and she gets more screen time than what she had in Halloween Kills (2021). It is weird that Laurie Strode is trying to live a normal life 4 years after the earlier movie even though she knows Michael Myers is still out there on the loose.Laurie Strode's granddaughter Allyson has a romance with Corey that I did not think went anywhere. She also does not have an encounter with Michael Myers in the movie, even though Michael Myers killed her parents and ruined her life.Michael Myers has been hiding in the sewer for 4 years since Halloween Kills (2021) and is not in the movie that much. From what I remember he kills one person, and the rest of the killings are from someone else being as evil as Michael Myers.Even though the 3rd battle between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode was cool to see it was not built up right through the entire movie, because we were focusing on Corey from the beginning. The way they lead into the ultimate battle did not make sense.The kills are brutal, Corey was interesting until they made him worse throughout the movie, and Michael Myers is barely in the movie like Laurie Strode in Halloween Kills (2021). Also, there were unnecessary funny scenes that will happen along with scenes that do not make sense and are not well put together.Halloween Ends (2021) was frustrating, the way the earlier 2 movies that built up this was good but then this movie decided to focus on something else until we got what we wanted to see in the first place. This movie will be divisive to lots of people and if you have seen the earlier 2 movies you might watch this movie just to see how it ends.",

While I feel it had some clunkiness to it, the Corey subplot was a lesson in how evil doesn't just emerge from the darkness to kill you, it can also emerge from within yourself and kill others. It's a take on the idea of society creating its own evil, and I can appreciate that, given the United States' current social and political climate as of this writing. Kills also had a similar sublot, showing that evil thrives in chaos and vigilantism, but the script had to spell it out. One gripe I have was the lack of Michael Myers himself. He's mostly sitting back in the shadows (ironically) while Corey does most of his dirty work for him. I think it would have been more interesting to see Michael and Corey out killing in separate locations and confusing everyone, realizing there were now TWO killers on the loose but like I said, I can appreciate what we got.

They should've learned from the side story disaster of The Curse of Michael Myers (the whole \"Thorn\" debacle). They didn't. The team behind this trilogy disconnected from the Halloween purist fan base of the franchise. They seemed to believe they could create a new cult following for the franchise, with a new unexpected storyline. The original movie had horror down pat.

Michael takes a back seat in a film which forms part of a franchise HE is the face of. Not to mention he's portrayed far weaker than he is. Disappointing.

Personally I feel like they had no idea where to go with it after Kills. What fans got was a piss poor ending from the minute it starts until the credits rolled. The story was so forced, week and unbelievable of the characters that they try to make you root for all while just stealing yet again tropes that we're done in the franchises past much better. 4 stars for the kills and I think that's generous.

We have all accepted the fact that Michael is pure evil and immortal, but to have his mask taking from him that was a low blow. Plus he was barely in the movie. It was like they're trying to get a movie made, and they threw the name Halloween on it for marketing purposes. The story line with Corey was ridiculous. At least if they would've made him turn serial killer at the end, that would've been some kind of interesting twist. And everyone in the town were absolutely horrible people. It was like a town full of Walmart shoppers. ( What was with Corey's mom) They were awful awful people and I wanted Michael to kill them all. Michael Myers, the character deserves respect. He's up there with Darth Vader as far as villains go and the whole town follow behind her car to throw him into the wood chipper??? This movie was not clever or enjoyable to watch. There's nothing about it that was good . I really like Danny McBride's humor. But his Halloween movies have been a disaster. In fact, the whole NEW trilogy was bad.

Thankfully, this film did end on a fun note and I give it some credit for that.It's not a good movie. Halloween Ends at least delivered on what I assume most people want- the kills.

They tried to do the whole \"evil lives within us all message\" but they completely contradict themselves by showing that Corey obviously is not as strong and as capable as Myers and instantly shows pain and emotion after getting shot twice. So no, obviously it doesn't live within us to the extent as it does with Michael thats why he is \"the shape\" he was never a man. To completely nerf his character and the whole element that makes Michael special is Ludacris. We literally seen him as a unstoppable machine in halloween kills, then we decide to take a full 360 and completely contradict the last two movies by making him a weak joke? Some final thoughts, this movie simply tried to do way to much. From the simbalism of Lori \"creating Michael\" and Allyson \"creating\" Corey, to Michael passing the mantel, Corey individual struggles, Allysons, Loris they just tried to do way to much and lost what halloween is. Halloween is about a shape, evil with a name that is Michael Meyers. You cant kill Michael how you cant kill evil in the world. And this message just got diluted in the other clutter.

In this film, for the first time, Michael trained a student. It was the first time he had the mask stolen. It was the first time he was beaten by someone else. It's the first time he's killed fewer people. And for the first time he's left without a mask. But for the first time, I can't say he died. Because he died dozens of times. He cannot die no matter what \"he lives in our hearts\".I'm also very curious how Michael sneaks into the houses.

Does he run away with his heels hitting his butt at that time?Going back to the movie, I think it was a simpler-than-expected ending for a phenomenon serial killer. I would have expected a more striking and satisfying ending for a series that lasted more than 40 years. He nearly died of natural causes, and Laurie would be paranoid from waiting year after year. Before I finish my writing, I cannot help but say that I have always been a fan of the soundtrack of the film. I got goosebumps when I heard it after the opening scene. I am a fan of this movie.There is no sex or nudity in the movie.",

Ago, even the fonts used refer us to the classics, and of course, another point that is good is the soundtrack, one of the few aspects that has always stood out in more than 7 Halloween films is that its soundtrack is always very good. Another negative point is the bad use of \"Shape\" -the assassin- and Jamies Lee Curtis, both characters have a magnificent screen presence but here they are really used in the final 10 minutes, which is the best moment of the film, it's like we've seen an hour and a half of nonsense until we get to what really matters. It is true that throughout the film there is an attempt to carry out a philosophical reflection made by James Lee involving \"Shape\" and \"Correy\" but that doesn't work as it should, the text is weak, the scenes are turbulent and without impact, we have some games of cool cameras and good references to the classics, in addition to a great conclusion, but it ends there, a sad end - at least for now - of a very important franchise for the history of cinema. 6/10.",

            "content": "The best way to describe Halloween Ends, is that it feels like the filmmakers were trying to make a remake of the 1978 original, but realised half way through it was supposed to be a sequel, so they added Laurie and Michael as cameo characters.The movie takes place a couple of years after Halloween Kills, with Laurie somehow settled down and adjusted to her new life, as she's writing a memoir about her experience with Michael. Sadly, Laurie has been sidelined yet again, only getting a chance to shine in the final act. Allyson solidifies herself as one of the dumbest characters in the franchise, as it's largely thanks to her that this monstrosity takes place. Michael has also been sidelined in favour of Corey, this movie's secondary antagonist. Corey himself isn't a bad character, but the writing makes him feel completely unnecessary when fans were craving more screen time from Michael.After 42 years in the making (or 4 years, depending how you feel about these movies), it delivers a wholly unsatisfying conclusion that answers zero questions the loyal fanbase has accumulated decades after the original. Why was Michael evil? Was he human? Was he supernatural like Kills implies? What drives him to kill? What does he look like? What does he sound like? Unfortunately none of these questions are answered, but it succeeds in raising a strikingly important question..... what did I just watch? Whilst Game of Thrones is often regarded as having the worst ending on television, this movie takes the title for being the worst ending to a horror franchise of all time.Despite having some good gore, kills and two solid performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and newcomer to the franchise Rohan Campbell, Halloween Kills is a convoluted mess that ends a lackluster and forgettable trilogy on a whimper. Whilst Halloween may finally be ending, I couldn't wait for this disappointing and forgettable movie to end.",

The film is a thoughtful follow up to the Halloween Kills' frenzy and blind panic in Haddonfield. It is set 4 years after Kills and picks up with Laurie and her granddaughter, both having made attempts to move on from the slaughter wrought by Michael Myers. Another main character is introduced and what unfolds is a study in the effects of evil and in my opinion, gives an incite into what may have caused the young Michael to snap, although of course, we will never fully know. But we do see the effects of hate and pressure effected onto a fragile mind. The film is brutal and gore-filled in places, but this isn't a slash-fest. It's a more balanced story and feels deliberately more controlled in terms of the frenzy we saw in Halloween Kills. The re-telling of the story from Halloween 2018 is better and more thought provoking than the dire \"Michael never dies\" outings that have since been cast aside. Watch this with an open mind, it is a more satisfying conclusion and gives the usual characters more depth.",

Michael Myers is never truly dead, his legacy would be paced down to another then another. In this case I do believe that Laurie put a resolve to the killer that haunted the town and everyone on it however, evil will prevail it just need to be contained.This movie isn't completely worthless, I think this movie made it point, resolve, and end.But it could have been even better!

The Halloween film franchise is loved by a very devoted fanbase (myself included; the original Halloween is my all-time favorite horror film). With that said, no matter what artistic choices director David Gordon Green made for this supposed final entry in the Michael Myers vs. Laurie Strode cannon, there was bound to be unhappy skeptics and intense scrutiny. Here, Green makes bold choices. Instead of following the prescribed playbook for all things slasher film, Green takes us deep into what feels like a dark character study, exploring the psychology of the hunted and the hunter. It's one major downfall is this: the plot feels like a hodgepodge of never fully realized story ideas and this weakness almost derails the film (it's predecessor Halloween Kills was dreadful and ranks as the worst Halloween film made - my opinion). Yet. Green knows these characters, their lore and legacy. He knows how to tell a scary story. What works here is the mesmerizing world we're submerged into (underscored by an awesome soundtrack). Lives are crossing and lines are blurring. We have super survivor Laurie Strode (played with a sweet intensity by the Queen of Scream, Jamie Lee Curtis), settling into a peaceful existence and leading a seemingly healed life. We also have bullied teen Corey Cunningham (played with fantastic complexity by Rohan Campbell, mostly known for his leading role on the recent TV adaptation of The Hardy Boys) sinking into a violent pit of no return. Both of these characters serve as great juxtaposition, each reflecting the impact violence and victimhood can have. Some of the production elements in the film are masterful, including the cinematography and the editing. Green takes his time exploring space and place, allowing the visuals to build and sustain the shifting moods of the movie. While Green gives us the battle we've been waiting for, when Michael Myers and Laurie Strode finally face off for a final time, the film is layered and offers commentary and thoughts on the often brutal society we've become. While Halloween Ends won't make everyone happy, it's a unique horror film on its own, brimming with an artistry rarely seen in contemporary horror films.",

When you are a diehard fan of Michael Myers/Halloween, you want to see a movie that is supposed to be mainly about him and Laurie ...not a glimpse of him here and there. And to those who are giving the movie great reviews-that is absolutely great....just stop criticizing those of us who expected more from the original-as you say in your great reviews that it is a beautiful compliment to the original movies-well, what we craved from Michael was also from the originals so...how are we a bunch of whiny babies for wanting the same beautiful compliment?Now for my review...I gave one star because it at least had some original cast members in it, and another for the shocker scene at the beginning.After anxiously waiting for a year to see the big finale to what I believe to be two very decent renditions of Halloween I and II, I can strongly say that I was absolutely disappointed with the garbage I saw tonight! It was such a cop out just to end the saga! In the first one you learn that Michael Myers waited for over 40 pain staking years to get the one who got away (Laurie), brutally and savagely killing those who got in his way as we would all come to expect of Michael, in the second one he's fending off a mob of people with knives and guns who try to end his life- again our expectations were greatly met, all for this final chance at Laurie to have him portrayed as a crippled old senior citizen who was nothing short of a Boogeyman that Walt Disney would have created. HE HARDLY KILLED ANYONE IN THIS MOVIE!!! Cory did all the killings and then Michael kills him near the end! I'm not a film maker by any means, but If they were going with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 route, they should've made it so at the very end-after Michael kills Cory and then Laurie kills him, they should've showed Michael getting destroyed by the scrap wreckage machine and then Cory opens his eyes to insinuate that the evil from Michael had gone into him, and then roll credits..even if they didn't want to make another movie, it would have been better than what they did.The rest of the storyline made no sense in this film either because they didn't stick to it-it jumped all over the place and was hard to really get into, not to mention that again, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 thing was just plain bulls*** for them to go that route especially when there was no inclination or sense of it in the first two movies.I was definitely anticipating and hoping that all the stops would be pulled out when they were making this film. It should have been a roller coaster ride of terror from start to finish, but all it was was a Merry-go-round. I am a HUGE Michael Myers/Halloween fan, but I feel so let down by this movie. I truly hope that this movie was just a joke of a precursor to the real Halloween Ends because they screwed over the billions of fans who were expecting something great.

I see What they Went For With the \"Apprenticeship\" but in my opinion it Just Doesn't Work.2. The Apprenticejust isn't Terrifying Enough. If this is the Angle they were Going for, He was Miscast.3. There is Not Enough Michael at All.4. It Just Isn't Scary.Other Things That Were Not Strong Enough -1. The Thing about the Whole Town being Scared about a \"Boogeyman\" out there was a Great Idea, why didn't they Play into that more and have More Peripheral Cast Members? They had a Good Element of it with the Radio DJ, but Even that Wasn't Used Enough.2. The End felt Completely Undercut and at the End with the \"Parade\" it would of Hit more Strongly.One Scene I Particularly Liked -1. The Kitchen Table Knife Pin Down and Refrigerator Pin Down was a Great Scene. And Jamie Slowly Brings The Big Knife \"Mirror\", I thought that scene was Great.Overall, as Usual, this particular movie like Most Other Movies of All Genres, had Great Elements in there that Either didn't Work as Strong as they Could of, or Didn't Work at All.As a Result from of all of that, this isn't even at the very least a Good 7 out of 10 Movie.Were left with a Below Average Rubbish Movie.",

Corey channeled the spirit of Michael who still sought to destroy his sister. It was Michael who wanted to \"burn it all down.\" Corey was just the willing, unfortunate vehicle for Michael.

The music score alone kicked up the scary scale not to mention being in a hospital on Halloween night is creepy alone.) ....and the message is: Michael's nights of 'Coming Home' you cannot replicate over and over and over again. The 1981 sequel was on the cusp of the sequel bandwagon at the time it was released (being one of the first horror films to do so) and that's where it 'ends' for me. The storyline that Michael is Laurie's sister was a good connection. (I never understood why it bothered so many when I find it's the 'glue' that kept the suspense together.) The reason why Michael targeted her in the first place. It all made perfect sense.After the 1981 film trying to get the story reconfigured and rearranged in timing and characters is not only confusing it's manipulating. So I Look at these 'other' films as an entirely different movie altogether.You have to care about the characters in a film. Especially a horror film. You even have to care about the villain in terms of fear and you don't really care about these characters. Some not given enough time to develop and some overdeveloped, like Corey. Michael Myers story is lost in much of the picture and not explaining how he got where he ended up and stayed there for four years crippled the plot entirely. Laurie Strode doesn't even have much character development in this chapter. Lindsay Wallace was \"Totally\" a missed opportunity here as she's in this film so infrequently it makes very little impact or sense. Being the last two surviving characters from 1978 this was a huge mistake to not have these two ladies on screen more.That being said, you can try and try and try, and they did for over 40 years-but you can't 'go home again'-not even Michael Myers.",

That's why I'm so confused. This movie is bad. Like cmon fans of this have to admit it's bad. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I gave it 7 stars! I had a really good time watching this, but it was also so bad! I guess I'm going to try to review this, but I'm probably going to end up repeating what majority of the other reviews say, but who cares? Not me, that's for sure.The storyline in Halloween Ends is a mess. It starts off super strong with a really good opening and sets up Corey pretty well. It's a good way to build some sympathy for his character right off the bat, but after this opening the movie turns into a..... Melodrama!?Ya. A melodrama. You're going to be in an hour into this and you're going to be wondering if you're actually watching a Halloween movie. I don't understand why they took this movie in that direction. It's painful to watch. The interactions between Corey and Allyson are so uncomfortable and weird, but so entertaining. Watching this chaos unfold was such a delight for me. I really can't comprehend the fact that someone saw this script and thought, \"I like it. Let's make it a movie.\" I just can't fathom that, yet it happened. But I'm also glad it happened considering how much fun I had watching it.The character of Corey is a weird one. He started off sympathetic and interesting, but quickly started to fall apart. Some of his \"serious\" scenes just become funny because of how goofy it is. And that's not a problem with the actor, the problem comes from the script he was given. The whole Corey character had potential, and falls apart, and this isn't because of the ideas they had, but how they executed those ideas.The biggest problem with this movie is that is starts to become pretty boring when you go 80 minutes with only one kill. And another problem is the kills themselves. We get like two actually good kills, but the rest are either bland or don't show anything. Halloween Kills had a horrible story, but was really entertaining because of how extreme the kills were, and they could've done some really good kills in this, which could have made it more entertaining, but they decided they didn't want to. And it's not like they didn't want to make it violent because the two best are extremely violent.The climax of the movie is the best part. You get some interesting scenes, but of course, the best part is the fight with Michael Myers. It's short and sweet. I'm happy they didn't drag it out because we've so many Laurie Strode VS Michael Myers fights already. The ending itself is a bit goofy, but it wasn't the worst. I do believe that they could've made Halloween Kills the final Halloween movie. The final fight in this would have worked perfectly if they put it in after Laurie Strode's daughter dies (I forgot her name lol) and I think it would've been really good. The setting makes sense and you could say Michael Myers is weak due to him getting beat up by the residents of Haddonfield.Overall this movie is bad. Really bad. But that doesn't mean it can't be a fun time, and that's exactly what it was for me. I really enjoyed myself watching this, but I'm still just shocked that the Blumhouse executives thought this was a good idea. It had some strong ideas, but why are we following a whole new character's story instead of Michael's? Did they not have enough ideas to make a whole movie with him? If so, why did they make this a trilogy in the first place? I don't get it. Well, if you have Peacock you should check this out. Don't watch it in a theater like I did. It's not worth it lmao.",

            "content": "Halloween Ends (2022, dir. David Gordon Green)Post-Watch:I fully understand why this is so divisive, even with the division leaning hard into the negative. I'm pleased that I'm not on the other side of the fence here. Though the feelings aroused in me during and after witnessing the end of what has been, for me as viewer, a nearly lifelong battle against evil are not entirely those of satisfaction, I'm more impressed by the continued and mostly fresh curiosities this new trilogy of films inspired in my brain than I am disappointed with the filmmaking team's less successful creative decisions. Also, there's much to be said about the parallels in audience/critical reaction to Green's new trilogy, as they've somehow mimicked the same reaction to the original first 3 films of this now 13-film franchise. Do I need to be the one to say any of it? Eh. I'll just say I'm not only impressed with Green's unique trilogy of films and the heady themes he at least attempts to tackle in resurrecting this series (again), but also in his clearly planned foiling of audience & fan expectations.I will say without reservation that folks claiming this is the worst of the franchise may need to seek professional help.Halloween Ends opens with the introduction of new characters on Halloween night 2019, one year after The Night He Came Home Again in Halloween and Halloween Kills: 21-year-old Corey Cunningham arrives at the home of Dr. & Mrs. Allen to act as babysitter at last minute - he's normally their gardener - for their son Jeremy, a sassy and mischievous child. A prank goes terribly awry, and little Jeremy is accidentally killed.Corey is absolved of guilt legally, but instantly becomes a pariah. With Michael Myers having disappeared, and with the effects of his violence still radiating through the town and its people, Corey becomes a new more tangible and benign monster for Haddonfield to despise, and to torture, and they feel justified in this because they're blinded by their own pain and guilt, and their own sense of justice.And how could they not be?Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield after being locked up for 40 years, added over 40 of their friends and family as victims to his list, and disappeared back into the night.Michael killed more of Laurie's friends, and he killed her daughter.He killed her granddaughter Allyson's friends, her boyfriend, and her parents.It's been 4 years with no sign of Michael, and likely because the townsfolk had already received and started to spread their own insidious infection of Evil in the aftermath of The Shape's return.I, too, initially balked at reports on how this film approaches its hefty charge as Final Film: a lot of new characters, including a \"new\" villain, and Michael not showing up until almost an hour in. What Green and his team have done, though, is removed the personage from the central force, hearkening back to what original creators John Carpenter & Debra Hill intended; they hoped to make a film about proper-noun Evil, not a man, and not his reasoning/motivation. It has never been about Michael the man, but the loss of the human beneath that name's flesh.I said this in my review of Halloween Kills last year:\"Maybe Michael is a being like what the religions have called \"demons\" - an unknowable and ever-evolving natural entity, latched onto and poisoning a human body and using it to for destruction. A psychotic monster with the mind of a child, and whose playthings are living beings. Evil, yes, but without reason, and therefore without explanation. Moving toward this idea and away from the brother-sister storyline introduced in the first sequel is exciting, as true fear is born from the unknown.\"This film I think confirms my assertions therein, as here we see Michael seeming to transfer some of his remaining evil, the evil that - left unfed, and his aging and mangled human body undernourished - had no place to go but inward. The Evil was feeding on Michael's body in that sewer, with the evil within matched by the evils growing throughout the town, and therefore stuck, and festering.There's some vampiric lore at work here, then, and the film also pays homage to various films, from the classic monster vibes of Frankenstein, to the infectious mental & emotional poison infecting the town as it emanates from the lair of It, and even vehicular/mechanical fetishism & headlight-lit vengeance of John Carpenter's Christine.Corey's growing pain at his ostracism is met by the similarly-felt pain of Allyson - she and Laurie pariahs of a somewhat different kind - and this meeting of pains brings them together as kindred spirits haunted by evil. Allyson thinks she recognizes herself in him, but what she sees that seems familiar is the evil that's haunted her through her grandmother's trauma and the town's myths and legends about it her whole life.This whole Corey story might also be a what-if in and of itself, but for Laurie: Laurie was also a young woman with a bright future, her parents had been killed when she was a child, and she desperately wanted a connection, a lover. Her crush was Ben Tramer. We never saw Ben's face, but we did eventually see him: he was The False Shape in Halloween II, brutally rundown and burnt alive, mistaken for Myers in a similar getup on Halloween 1978. I'm sure this is no accident.I loved a moment from Dr. Allen, the father of the boy Corey accidentally kills at the film's start. He's discussing his son's death, and expresses that to a certain degree he empathizes with Corey, and that he feels puzzled that his pain was appropriated by the townsfolk, inexplicably made about them. We don't get lines or emotions like this in most horror films, this questioning the nature of Evil stuff, and this moment in particular really struck a chord with me. I immediately said aloud, \"It's an epidemic with that s***.\" And it is. Perhaps the main reason horror films like this are so popular, and why folks are so emotional about their villains, is that we need a face at which to aim our frustrations and distaste with the world (or, for some, a face to dole out what we feel the world deserves).There are some problems. I felt the romance between Corey & Allyson could've been given more scenes establishing their intimacy, as while it doesn't necessarily feel \"rushed\" (unhealthy people rush into romance all the time), it does feel like we miss a scene or two. I was also disappointed by the 2-3 \"flashback\" sequences, in which they rapid-fire scenes from 1978, 2018 & Kills, and which looked weirdly cheap and goofy.I must, however, comment on some folks taking issue with a group of Corey's bullies being marching band kids. Now, I don't know what sort of fantasy land these folks are living in or came from, but band kids were the biggest bullies aside from the jocks at all 3 of my high schools. So, there's that.I also saw lots of complaints that Michael is only in this final installment for about 10 minutes. While describing his presence physically on the screen, this is accurate, but his being - his Evil - permeates the entire experience. I'd say the same about the 1978 film, and in that one he was physically on screen even less of the time. So...?I'd really encourage people to sift through their feelings of disappointment with this new trilogy, and to definitely give this one a revisit with a new perspective. All three of these films have some clunkiness to them, but this is some smart & interesting stuff. That it raises more questions than it answers is appreciated, and thematically appropriate. I can't think of other slasher pictures - let alone latter-year sequels - that have had my brains reeling this much after the first viewing, and there's so much meat to chew on here I feel I've barely scratched the surface. This is definitely a strange, beguiling entry that continued to win me over throughout, even when I scoffed at certain turns in the story.If this really is how Halloween Ends, it feels right. I still hold Laurie's one-on-one with Michael in Halloween H20 in high regard (and damned if that ax decapitation isn't still so beautifully satisfying), but this one has more to it. It's not just about Laurie & Michael, but about Evil, about its rippling effects, and about the unending search for meaning and answers in a world that refuses to provide them.Don't be surprised if this receives a positive reappraisal down the road. It deserves it.Grade: B.",

            "content": "Wasn't the best Halloween movie but wasn't the worst. It was good and it made sense but was a little bit of a disappointing ending. I'm torn on whether we should have seen Michael's real face or not, I assume not seeing keeps that mystery of Michael Myers and shows he still has that power. However seeing Laurie Strode and other people from Haddonfield see what he looks like was somehow enough information for me and I liked that it gave them that chance to now move on with their lives. Knowing the person behind the mask sort of made him weak. That power taken away. But evil still remains. And I really liked that effect it had on me. The chapter may be over for Laurie and her family but it's definitely not the end and I can see them bringing Michael back but having his evil passed on perhaps to someone else. I do kind of wish that wasn't an option(that they have left it open for another movie)because I don't want to see them overdo it and ruin Halloween.Overall, I wouldn't watch again out of all the Halloween movies but I certainly would recommend it and say it's worth watching. If it wasn't so slow to begin with(I understand why it was slow)but if it wasn't as slow as it was then I think this movie would have gotten more attention. A lot of people were on their phones and talking because the movie was just taking so long and also didn't have the big BOOM effect that fans will be looking for. It doesn't really show much between the end of Laurie and Mike, the fight scene between them was alright but I think it needed more just to give the \"Halloween Ends\" title a bit more. It should have had a bigger ending in my opinion.",

You can feel the pressure he was under to deliver the \"perfect ending\" as you watch it.The plot is filled with endless holes that never get filled. Hell, half of them don't even make sense. I didn't even realize I was watching a Halloween movie until over a half hour in. (Yes, it takes around the 40 mins mark for Michael to appear). Allison's boyfriend is pointless. A complete waste of a backstory. Nobody is here for a backstory. We all want Michael Myers and Laurie.Well, when Myers does take to the screen, it's like a WWE character making an entrance. The kills are gruesome, fun and plentiful. The final showdown between Michael and Laurie did leave me satisfied but wanting more.If there is anything that is right bout this movie, it gives Curtis a proper send off. Have we seen the last of Michael Myers? Probably not. How will they \"reboot\" this? I don't know. If anybody does attempt to reboot it they sure have a lot of work ahead of them.3/10.",

            "content": "As a big fan of Halloween, Halloween II, and even Halloween III, I can truly say that I hated all of the sequels that followed. As far as I'm concerned, Michael Myers burned to death in Halloween II. You just don't come back from that...not even the Shape.One after another, these garbage sequels showed us just how bad a poorly written and executed a script can be. So on the heels of the truly awful Halloween Kills, I was not expecting to be entertained by Halloween Ends. Halloween Kills was so unbearably bad that I had to fast forward through most of it.On that note, I was surprised that I sat through all of Halloween Ends. While the premise of Michael's evil rubbing off onto another killer (though accidental) was completely moronic, I didn't find Corey to be as annoying as everyone here made him out to be. Rohan Campbell seemed to be a pretty good actor given what he had to work with, and the dialogues of Jamie Lee Curtis and Andi Matichak (Allyson) weren't as cringe-worthy as I was expecting. Thankfully, Kyle Richards and most of the other Halloween Kills cameo appearances were kept to a minimum.I particularly enjoyed Corey's bullies. They reminded me of those jerks we all went to high school with and you just knew they were going to get offed in horrible ways. Speaking of getting offed, I thought it was lazy for the writers to reuse John Carpenter's famous \"hanging knife\" kill from the original Halloween. It didn't quite have the same effect as the original, with Michael admiring his work in dark silence. That was a classic scene in its day and the rehash of it just didn't work. I did get a good laugh out of the DJs kill scene though. The tongue on the record player was hysterical, though I'm not sure why he was killed at all, except for being an annoying a-hole.One thing I particularly did not like was Michael Myer's weakness. He was easily knocked over and beaten in a minor scuffle with Officer Mulaney. I know it was meant to be some kind of \"fresh kill will restore his power\" scene, but no one knocks over Michael Myers. It was also too easy for Corey to steal his mask later on in the film.The final showdown between Laurie and Michael also didn't work for me. Michael still seemed weak and allowed himself to get put into vulnerable positions too easily. However, the disposal of Michael Myer's corpse in the grinder was particularly satisfying, only because you know there was no coming back from that and we won't have to sit through another one of these horrible sequels.Did you hear that, Rob Zombie?

Laurie Strode is trying to live a normal life with her granddaughter Allyson, but of course you know that ain't gonna last. There are also some local punks who make trouble for Allyson and the aforementioned young man. Add to all this the fact that Michael is still out there somewhere, and you have the ingredients that make up a good horror movie, with unexpected twists and a satisfactory denouement.Satisfactory, that is, for viewers who may not be big fans of the \"Halloween\" franchise (like myself), as this works nicely as a standalone movie, if you'll have it. Purists and fanatics who take the series too seriously might have issues with what is done here, but it gave me what I wanted to see, and more! No spoilers here, but if you read my review for \"Kills,\" you'll know what I wanted to see, and \"Halloween Ends\" provides a reasonable approximation of that.Now, regarding the title (\"Ends\")- is it really the end?

This becomes truly obvious in the Characters of Laurie Strode and Allyson which feel as though their character development were left on the cutting room floor.But my biggest gripe of this movie is the focal point of Cory Campbell. Without giving away any spoilers, Cory gives no lasting impact to the franchise of Halloween which makes him inconsequential in a movie based around the events of himself. You can tell where they wanted to go in this movie but due to poor decisions, the direction is lost.The Movie does however deliver on a few of the death scenes, the first death in particular is pretty impactful and changes the energy in the cinema. It's a shame that wasn't continued throughout the movie.If you haven't seen the last two movies and don't want the illusion of the Halloween franchise ruined for you, I suggest only watch Halloween 1978 and Halloween 2018.",

If I were one of the newcomer/bandwagon fans that have spent the past four years screeching how much better David Gordon Green's fan fiction is to the original timeline I'd be FURIOUS. Since I'm not, I'm numb to this. \"Kills\" irritated me so much I literally walked in the theater with my expectations on the FLOOR and somehow, SOME WAY, DGG and company kicked them straight through TO THE EQUATOR. I knew it would be different that's what I've heard all season long and I was well aware and open to it. And no lie, for the first hour (I guess) I enjoyed the heck out of the movie. It took a while to gather the direction and then a light bulb popped in my head (or so I thought) and I said \"Ooooh, so Michael is going to train up a new generation.\" I was totally there for it, but then the movie kept plodding on, Michael was involved in less and less kills and finally at the junkyard scene with the band geeks I threw up my hands. My hopes had been dashed. And it was downhill from there.My brother actually had a better script in his head on the spot than the writers. He turned to me and said, \"They should have made Laurie and company mistake Corey somehow for the real Michael Myers, kill him and only realize after she removes his mask in the junkyard before throwing him in the grinder that they've made a serious mistake and the real Michael is still out there.\" To me, that would have made SO much more sense. But that didn't happen.In conclusion it appears that the Halloween film we're looking for remains in the minds of everyone but those with the means to make them come to fruition. I mean there wasn't ONE scare in the whole darn thing. No suspense whatsoever. Literally every single scare was given away in the promos. Every last ONE. They did the fans so dirty on this one. 44 years led up to THIS? I'm so glad I wasn't able to see it on the premier in IMAX like I had planned. Nope, a 30% off matinee at AMC was FAR too much to be perfectly honest. My only saving grace was that I know the REAL Michael Myers lives on so I'm at peace. As for all of you who have adopted this storyline as the official story, somebody owes you an apology and probably a pretty penny in ticket fare. \ud83d\ude10The end. 3/10.",

Michael, after all these years and decades of self-rejuvination, seems to have finally aged out of the merciless killer business and appears to be falling apart on his own.There probably is no good way to put an ending on something like this, and they don't even try to answer the question of what was driving Michael Myers all this time other than just using the word \"evil.\"After so many years of reboots and sequels, there's finally nowhere else to go with this. We've finally managed to paint ourselves into a corner, and I think most will agree now that it's time to give this series a rest.",

            "content": "Don't kill me... but I actually enjoyed \"Halloween Ends\"! I was surprised, especially considering I went in with extremely low expectations. I was not a fan of \"Halloween Kills\", I thought the movie was pretty dumb, repetitive and a step down from the 2018 \"Halloween\". This offered something new, something fresh! It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it took the franchise in a few different directions that I wasn't expecting! The film is surprisingly character driven, and while Shakespeare it is not, I thought it was pretty interesting. It's about the nature of evil, and may not have had as much Michael Myers as the other films, but showed how his shadow still looms large over Haddonfield.I really liked that the movie showed the effects the mass killings had on this town and how it scarred so many of the people. I really liked the elements focusing on Corey especially, and his story after society turns on him was probably one of my favourite parts as it really showed how true evil can grow in a person. Don't get me wrong however, the film did feel rushed and didn't take the time to flesh out Corey's story. Plus I'm almost certain this is what long time \"Halloween\" fans will not like about the film; the lack of focus on Michael and instead his lasting effects. They for sure won't like what happens to his mask either.... but I hate to say it, it worked for me! And while there isn't a lot of Michael, the scenes he does get are awesome! It does make you want more of him, but what we get is good. He almost doesn't fit in the story, even feels shoehorned in at times to speed up Corey's character's journey. Laurie and Michael's big final showdown shown in the trailers, while exciting, even feels quite obligatory, like they had to stick it in for the fans. I'm glad they did it though. This was a sort of \"Joker\" in a \"Halloween\" movie, they stuck the \"Halloween\" title on it to sell tickets but really had the Corey story in mind. It's like a \"Halloween\" spinoff that remembers it is supposed to be the conclusion of Laurie and Michael's story at the very end.What I did like about this film as a conclusion to the new trilogy was that it made me realize this whole trilogy has been about Haddonfield, the town, the people, and how a killer on Halloween night changed everything and everyone in the following years. It is quite an interesting idea, and makes me appreciate the trilogy more. I also loved how they left off Laurie's story throughout the film, it felt like a natural place for her character to be. Jamie Lee Curtis was also pretty awesome in the movie, reprising one of her most iconic roles. She even has some great, brutal, action scenes. Her character's dialogue- all the dialogue for that matter- wasn't very well written however. The dialogue never sold the character's feelings, and dialogue scenes would shift tone really quick, one going from understanding to anger and tension with one cut. It felt like they cut a lot out of some scenes, but at least the film did sort of work in a way. I also loved how the edited in clips of the original film at times, it had a really cool effect.It does feel like it was missing something, and is not the great horror film you'd hope this iconic franchise would end with, but I liked it! Do not mistake me, it is not a great film, and heck its not scary at all (even the few kills are pretty PG-13), but I came out of it satisfied. I can't explain it better than this, it is a divisive movie that I came out of liking! It's a weak film with so many missed opportunities, but the new direction re-awakened my interest in this 45 year old franchise! And of course, that iconic John Carpenter theme was awesome to hear one last time!",

It was about some other offbeat character we NEVER heard of before! FAIL! Upon watching this on Peacock, hoping to still watch it in the theater, I decided not to waste my money. In my head as watching most of the movie, I gave it 3 stars. Then towards the end, the movie started to FINALLY pick up and action was really happening! It then became all about Laurie and Michael. I waited the whole movie to see this interaction. I thought the whole movie would have them both together, or at least Mikey wreaking havoc as usual. Blumhouse made Michael a TOTALLY different character than what he has ALWAYS been. DID NOT LIKE THAT! They made him weak! As I said, towards the end, the action picked up, therefore I'm giving it 5 stars because of that. In the end, I actually had tears in my eyes for Michael for what they did to him because I realized this is the end of an era. And what a great era it was! The most hated movie for me in this series is Halloween 3. It's annoying and has NOTHING to do with Michael Myers or Laurie Strode. I rate this movie just above Halloween 3.

The last few films have built up Michael to be a supernatural killing machine, and they immediately throw that away in this film. Michael took on crowds of 20+ in the last few films, survived shotgun blasts to the face, survived a raging fire, and much much more. In this film, Michael is bested one on one numerous times by normal humans, before being killed with knives as if that makes sense. The Corey character is the weakest addition to the new trilogy, in a series that has focused on PTSD and trauma, Corey seems like a cartoon caricature of how somebody would act. He is not scary in the slightest, nor is he even a believable antagonist. After all of the people Michael has come across and slayed, keeping Corey alive makes absolutely no sense, and siding up with him like a wrestling tag team makes even less sense. This is a true, flat out, utter disappointment. These new additions to the Halloween series had some potential, but any momentum they had was forced down the meat grinder with Michael Myers. I could go on for hours longer about how bad this movie is, and I'm glad to see it getting the negative reviews it's been garnering. Maybe next time they won't rush and make everything about the money. But on the other hand, I would also be completely fine if they let this series rest now.

I'm very grateful.Although this new trilogy is very polished to fit today's audiences, there's definitely elements missing and that's spook/scare factor.I rate this new trilogy very generously because of how much a fan I am of the franchise.I definitely enjoyed ENDS the most on an asthetic level.But having all three of these films come full circle as it has, it's been more of a story of Laurie strode than Michael Myers. And I get it and I love her ending.But this latest film brought me to tears by the films' conclusion.It's bittersweet.It's heart warming but wrenching at the same time.It makes them less likely to be replayed as they are so triggering and emotional and I prefer my horror/slasher movies to scare me with subtle (if necessary at all) social commentary.But as a trilogy connected to the 1978 original, it is all in all, well done. There's been some writing and charactor issues along the way.I think the writing in ENDS is by far the best with a much more subtle approach to its social commentary.But these latest films just don't hold a candle to the days where these movies had one motive only, and that was to scare the audience.When I find myself crying, I feel like I'm at the wrong movie.Have a good life Laurie. \u2764",

Don't expect a good story, don't expect some some quality/creative kills, be prepared to hate every character fiercely (Laurie included). Allyson got worse with each movie - what a waste of a half decent character to begin with. Don't even get me started on this Corey Cunningham flop. The atmosphere is so far removed from anything Halloween. I felt like I was watching a boring coming of age film about a couple of derelicts finding their way to one another abruptly. There was zero chemistry between the cast. The dialogue was incredibly unauthentic and the whole cinema was cringing. This was a stupid idea that a below average 10 year old conjured up in English class when they were asked to come up with a creative writing piece in 5 mins. When Halloween 2018 came out I was so excited about the trilogy. That movie was fun, albeit I will stick to my opinion that disregarding ALL the other movies was the worst idea. Halloween Kills came out and it was kind of fine but also frustrating and wide of the mark. Ends should never have seen the light of day as a Halloween film. I have never felt so unfulfilled after a movie. It's an absolute piss take to the legacy of Michael Myers, who is left to rot in the background of this pathetic subplot for the majority of the film. I'm sick of these new-age directors turning legendary franchise into a joke. Go ruin your own movie, but don't you dare turn our favourite slashers into a steaming pile of excrement. It happened with Texas chainsaw massacre, nightmare on elm street, scream... now Halloween. But this one... the foundations were there and it has failed miserably and David and co should be deeply, deeply ashamed. There'll obviously be some people who don't mind this film (likely very, very few) but judging by a lot of the reviews here and all over social media, I think David Gordon Green owes the rest of us a public apology, because Halloween 5 is a masterpiece compared to this. This wil be the only one I don't add to my DVD/blu-ray collection. Someone please make a film that retcons this because I won't be able to sleep at night again.

Instead, it's about Corey, a young guy that accidentally killed a boy he was babysitting (hilariously bad scene btw).He gets bullied by the town and then meets Michael who puts \"Evil\" inside him in a Charles Xavier kind of way. Laurie's granddaughter falls in love with him because why the hell not. Plot happens and he kills himself so the character of Corey becomes irrelevant and useless to the plot while he was supposed to be the main protagonist throughout 90% of the movie.At seems that at the end, the writers almost forgot they had to find an ending to Michael Myers so they put him in a grinder and the movie ends...Everything in the movie is either uninteresting, nonsensical or right bad. It didn't know where to go most of the time and found the most boring ending possible to the franchise.I would have much preferred seeing Laurie and Michael wrestle during 2 hours instead of seeing this crap...",

But back to this one, I liked what they did in Halloween Ends, even with the copycat/possessed new killer. I was kind of thinking it would be like Michael Myers who knows how to work on cars and use tools more efficiently to kill people.It wasn't perfect. Halfway through I was getting a little bored, but I really enjoyed the ending. I wish it could be the end of the franchise, but like Godzilla, Frankenstein, and Dracula, there's too much money to be made.Definitely worth watching if you're a Halloween nerd.",

Halloween needs Michael Myers....and a lot of him. This film, in an attempt to differentiate itself and tread some new boards....failed miserably. And...maybe unintentionally, repeated a trope of earlier Halloween sequels that were nowhere near as good as the original.The best performance in the film was from the kid in the opening sequence. Everyone else was just a massive bag of cringe...including the beloved Jamie Lee Curtis.

            "review_title": "The final piece of the puzzle",
            "content": "This film continues the saga about Michael Myers and takes it to a satisfying end. To fully appreciate this entry in the Halloween universe You have to consider it not as a standalone episode but as the final part of a story that encompasses the two films prior to this one.The 2018-2022 Halloween trilogy is not just a repetition of the original concept - John Carpenter already delivered everything that ever was to say about that. This iteration of the myth seems to be about evil, how it survives in the modern world and how we can deal with it after being victimized.In Halloween (2018) we see Michael Myers, an old evil from a time long gone, and how he reemerges from containment. In Halloween Kills this old evil is abandoned by the community of Haddonfield. As more and more people stand up against Michael, he stops being the mythical boogeyman, that everybody is afraid of.The trilogy also deals with how victims, represented by Laurie Strode, react to evil. In Halloween (2018) Laurie has stopped being the victim and retaliates. In Halloween Kills Laurie includes the Haddonfield community in her experiences with evil. And four years later, in Halloween Ends, she even tries to come to terms with it. She tries not to let her life be dominated by Michael Myers anymore.This seems to be easier said than done, because of what happened in Halloween Kills. The community of Haddonfield has seemingly agreed upon Michael Myers not being the boogeyman, but simply a man with brain damage that had been provoked by Laurie. Yes, they totally ignore how Michael survived even the most severe wounds and hold Laurie responsible for all the mayhem that had occurred. Talking of a scapegoat...That's the situation at the start of Halloween Ends. We learn in the first scene, how even the children are not really afraid of Michael Myers anymore. One uses his myth as a means to trick his babysitter Corey - only to meet his untimely demise. Although it was ruled as an accident, Corey is shunned by the community of Haddonfield and labeled a child killer.The first forty minutes of the film are used for his story and how he falls in love with Laurie Strodes granddaughter. After a party that did not end well for Corey, he finally encounters Michael Myers, but Michael doesn't kill him as he recognizes a common spirit in his eyes. This isn't the Michael Myers we know from before. He is considerably weakened and recognizably old. For the last four years he has been hiding in the sewers of Haddonfield, occasionally dragging some easy victim down to his lair - although he can still nail a body to the wall with his knife and cracks a neck like a twig the formerly.After Corey escapes Michaels lair and accidently kills a local bum that attacks him, he seems to accept himself as being kin to Michael. He returns to the lair in the sewers and asks Michael to show him how it's done, which he gracefully does. After that they both start to slaughter the people that did Corey wrong. At first, Corey wears his own scarecrow mask, but after he has to admit, that this mask doesn't grant him immortality and invincibility he returns to Michael and wrestles him for the infamous Halloween mask. He manages to obtain the mask and from that point on preys on his victims as the new Shape.Of course, we witness some gruesome killings as a transition to the finale, where Laurie tricks the new Shape by imposing as being suicidal. Although some may find it important to know how exactly Corey, the new Shape, is killed, I find it suffice to say that all the important characters have a go at him, and he is dead at the end. Michael has followed Corey to Laurie's home and reclaims his mask. The final battle between Laurie and Michael ensues, and Laurie manages to overcome the weakened Michael and kills him with the help of her granddaughter. Just like someone that has been victimized finds additional strength to finally overcome his own fear after sharing his experience with his community and family.Knowing that killing isn't enough to shed the evil from her life, Laurie stages a kind of procession, by tying the Michaels body to the top of a car and presenting it to the whole of Haddonfield's people.Now everybody sees, that the terror, that haunted Haddonfield for all the years, is finally dead. No myth may survive the final abandonment of the body as it is torn to tiny shreds.The story of Michael Myers is over, but Laurie talks in her book about evil, and how it never dies but always finds another shape (or Shape?)A final scene showing the infamous mask on the table in Laurie's house, reminds us of that. It just waits to be put on again.All this put together the three Halloween movies make up a pretty good story. There is enough depth to it to hold all the pieces together and everything makes sense from the right point of view.Although I don't want to discredit my fellow reviewers here, I have to mention, that they probably did not see the whole (motion) picture.",

Kills was a meandering mess that barely advanced the overall narrative of the trilogy. You could skip Kills and go right to Ends after 2018 and not even know it.Ends tries something new, and to give it credit, it is quite bold with its direction. However, it mostly fails at everything it tries. I can't imagine many fans of the franchise were happy with the way this film turned out.I thought Halloween (2018) was fantastic, maybe even the best sequel of the franchise. It's a shame that two extremely flawed and subpar sequels had to follow and ruin a horror trilogy with so much potential and hype.Oh well.......

Halloween 2018 brought realism and suspense back to the series, Halloween Kills threw all of that away (but was still a fun slasher) and Ends's attempts to bring the series back to reality is really admirable.I understand why people are upset as this is a very different Halloween movie but I think it moves the story forward in a really clever way. That said, the film was mis-sold, the trailers misrepresented what the film was which I think has fed into the backlash.Halloween Kills was a mindless slasher whereas this is a more thought provoking film. I would recommend going in with a completely open mind, and take some time to think about afterwards to let it sink in. I think you'll be positively surprised. This isn't a masterpiece but, for me, it's a fantastic sequel and a good film!So, my brief overview of this new trilogy is, Halloween 78 is a masterpiece, Halloween 2018 is, IMO, the best sequel, a good horror film and a great companion to the original, Halloween Kills is a good 'Halloween' movie but a poor film and Halloween Ends isn't really a stereotypical 'Halloween' film but is a really decent film.I think in years to come, Halloween Ends will be viewed in much the same way as Halloween 3 is now.",

The first half of the film which doesn't even feature Michael Myers and Laurie Stride's final build, but choose to follows someone who we just met which should've been established throughout this new timeline. Although you do realize that the character Corey Cunningham is a plot device to service the overall theme, which is evil never dies especially when society plays a huge role in it. Halloween Ends, for me does have redeeming qualities like the nod to Jamie/Myers' psychic connection in the form of 'Myers sees the trauma' Corey mistake, the nod to Halloween 3: Season of the Witch with the opening/end credits being in blue and the opening sequence where the pumpkin began as one normally carved only to have a more sinister appearance with each one, providing a foreshadowing for the audience of events in the movie. Yes, those are my redeeming qualities for the movie. Aforementioned, the movie's screenplay did it no favors and the hype of the final encounter only lasting a few minutes just didn't deliver with majority of the film focusing on a character we had no idea about until now.

It's actually a clearly directed slasher story, with an end in mind and a means to get there. It's definitely watchable, and being available for streaming was a great call.Now...with all that being said...for those die hard and true Michael Myers / Halloween / slasher fans, I don't think this is the film you're expecting, and it just might leave you underwhelmed because everything I assume you love about the Halloween franchise doesn't really take place until the last 3rd of the film.There's almost a \"first film\" vibe about it, as if introducing Michael Myers for what's to come even though the ending says otherwise, and this can possibly come off slow and annoying to some viewers. Very much a #WeveBeenThereAndDoneThat attitude.OTHER THOUGHTS:\nHighlights: Rohan Campbell, Rohan Campbell's lips, the second half of Act 2 and all of Act 3, the Act 3 junkyard scene, the \"ending decision,\" and thematic followthrough.Could've Been Better: A different approach to the thematic followthrough in relationship to Mike Myers (felt like too much of a creative liberty due to this being the last film in the sequel trilogy), more meaningful purpose with the character Allyson, and a more logical community response to Rohan's character (I would think there'd be more fear and avoidance than there was).",

I understand why people are upset but if you want to see a unique Halloween movie that explores different concepts other than Michael killing nameless people, you'll have a good time.Spoilers:\nI didn't care for Halloween kills the first time I saw it, I thought some kills were mean spirited and the victims were all insufferable. After watching this film I still don't care a whole lot for Kills but I do appreciate it more. The mythology it establishes that Michael gets stronger the more he kills sets this film up perfectly. We get plenty of kills in this film and the plot develops in such a way that we can see Michael in a weakened state and also see some kills.Also I personally really enjoy the idea of Michaels evil infecting a damaged soul, someone who is down and stepped on and that's how he spreads his evil, not only is it unfortunately accurate to real life but it also adds to the presence of Michael Myers.",

When the original Halloween came out in 1978, it became an instant classic. Sequels ensued over the next decade, each progressively worse. Then it was announced they would reboot the franchise. Halloween (2018) was good. It had good acting and a great score. Then came Halloween Kills, and that was okay with an absurd ending. Halloween Ends was supposed to wrap the franchise up and offer closure. They would have been better off stopping after 2018.In terms of this franchise, there have been worse. Halloween Resurrection and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers are two stinkers that are way worse than Ends. This is easily the worst of the trilogy. 2018's version feels fresh and has an intriguing story. Kills is not very good, but it falls into the category of it's so bad it's good. My biggest complaint is the reason I watch these films, Michael Myers. Michael does not do anything for the first 45 minutes. How are you going to make a Halloween without Michael? Now yes, Halloween 3 doesn't have Michael. The thing with that movie is that Michael wasn't supposed to be in it. Halloween Ends promised Michael; we got Corey. Corey is also my other complaint. His situation is terrible and was not his fault. Itas if they wanted Corey to be the main protagonist and turn him into the antagonist. Except his character is so bad you never root for him like a regular protagonist. The only redeeming quality of the film is Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis has been in nearly every bit of the high points of this franchise. I just wish they could have given her a better send-off than this.4.5/10 A sad rap-up to an already dying trilogy.

Other reviewers were disappointed with how little screen time Michael had. I disagree. Sometime's too much of something minimizes the affect. Getting a glimpse of something maximizes the suspense.The producers & directors of this film were very creative. The cinematography was outstanding. The angle shots, the jump scares, the sets (Jack O' Lanterns) were brilliant. The music score was spot on!! You guys nailed it, in my opinion.And Michael Myers was the bomb! Very, Very well done to his likeness, his mannerisms, his stance, appearance, physique, all on point! Again, very creative in content and visual appearance.I also really liked the \"Easter egg\" throwbacks throughout the film!! Very clever!!!For those who gave this film a poor rating, I suspect you watched them at home TV. You did not get the full affect. Please, re-watch at the theater while you can or watch a second time to catch some of the things you may have missed.I really enjoyed the entire trilogy reboot and hope another one gets created.

In the pantheon of Halloween movies, it lands below Halloween III. In Halloween Ends, we are introduced to Corey, a new character, who is actually the star and subject of the movie. Halloween Ends is part of the new trend of horror movies that seems more interested in dealing with the moral messaging (in this case, what makes someone do awful things) then actually trying to scare you. This movie is not really scary, there are only a few good kills (which is a HUGE let down after the gore fest that was Halloween Kills), and ultimately does nothing to satisfy the true Halloween fans and horror movie fans. I expected way more from everyone involved. I was all in on this re-boot trilogy, thought they were doing an amazing job with creating a new story while still honoring the original. There were so many ways they set up this movie to end, and chose to do none of them. How does the end of the trilogy basically ignore the core story line and dramatically change the characters motivations? It was like a completely different team came in and crapped all over what had been done. Very disappointing.I can't believe this is how the creative team decided one of the most legendary horror franchises should end. Michael goes out with a whimper. He deserved better. Laurie deserved better. And the fans deserved better.This is not a Halloween film, this is not the conclusion to the first two, like Halloween III, this movie has nothing to do with the franchise. In my opinion, we are still owed the conclusion to this trilogy, because this was definitely not it.Spoilers Alert:You can't have a Michael Myers movie and have him only make a cameo. They billed this movie as being basically a more extreme version of Halloween (2018), and gave us a movie that can only be called Halloween because someone is wearing that mask, not because Michael Myers is in it (because he's not in the mask most of the time).",

Each kill seemed to make Michael stronger and I believe had Laurie not killed him when she did he would have regained all his strength. It was a very interesting twist on the franchise. Corey has way too much screen time and on his best day should have not been able to take Michael's mask on him so easily. Lots of great Easter eggs in the movie however, the movie just wasn't very well written and thought out. Not for the typical Halloween Fan, but not bad either.",

This one was definitely different, a bit long, and with quite a few unnecessary scenes. So many times I thought these scenes were going to fulfill some importance, but no luck.

Couple that with indecipherable character decisions and baseless story beats, and you have a film that looks like it was written on the back of a playing card 10 minutes before the first table reading.This film's intentions are indecipherable. What little subtext there is so close to the surface that it's practically poking you in the eye.Character motivation is out the window - even by slasher standards! The other entries in this franchise aren't exactly nuanced tales, but this really falls very very short of being a worthy entry. I much prefer the since-decanonised sequels - heck, I'd take Rob Zombie's Halloween over this.After watching it I was genuinely dumbfounded as to how this passed through the hands of many talented artists, writers, and creatives.

            "content": "So I have just watched Halloween Ends at my local cinema with an old friend who also loves the franchise and this was not the finale I was hoping for. I have been building up my excitement for this film for the last year and was really hoping for an epic conclusion.Michael aka The shape was nowhere to be seen for the majority of the film. The character Corey who is seeking to be Michael's Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 throughout the majority of the film, was unrealistic. Having Michael passing the torch to a younger unhinged person was never on his agenda. What next? \"The Myers school of evisceration\"On a side note, they tried to play with this idea at the end of Halloween 4 when Michaels niece. Jamie murders her mum at the end as if to say she has caught the infection of evil or curse. In Halloween 5 Michael recuperates in a sewer too. I guess there aren't that many places for a masked serial killer to hide at the end of the day.JLC was of course the gel that bonds the characters and story together and without her, I would have given this three stars for simple death count and death scene screenplay.Yes, I am glad they didn't go down the supernatural path as that would again be a rehash of Halloween 5. They used flashbacks of Halloween 1978 and the last two films to piece the puzzle together but it just wasn't enough for me after watching the Halloween films since the mid-80s.This was always going to be a hard conclusion to portray as the original concept of the three films was all about continuity. Having all three films immediately link to each other was a great idea but we can thank Covid for the disruption that created in breaking up the last two films. The previous two films were definitely on the right lines in terms of storyline, characters and tension. Alas most of them were wiped out at the end of Halloween Kills.This was a slow film and should have had the pace the last film lived up to if not more. Sure they used the four year gap for everyone to heal from their wounds including Michael. But come on, some wimpy kid is going to steal Michaels mask halfway through and simply crawl away with it and go on his own killing spree. And then focus half the film showing his acts of retribution to those who were cruel to him. If they were planning a future TV series with Corey then I could get that but he killed himself towards the end anyway.In terms of sound, for those who get their kicks out of jump scares then you will get a few. There is very little original incidental music that everyone has come to love about the films over the years, tweaks and all and they help the films develop that sense of dread.Michael Myers has always been one of my favourite horror antagonists and I don't think they have done him any justice in this film. Where is the stalking? Where are his famous comical death stages that are always present in the previous films. That's the only humor you get in a true Halloween film but it is substituted with this mini love story going on between Corey and Allyson who have coincidentally been introduced to each other and realise that grief and trauma love company.This film should have had more focus on Michael Myers and less on a completely new character in Corey. More focus on Laurie Strode and less on her grand-daughter.Instead of having flashbacks of actual film footage from previous Halloween films, wouldn't it have been cool to have had some retro shot scenes of Dr Sam Loomis and Michael when he was younger in session at the mental institution?No-one knew Michael better than Sam Loomis, not even Laurie Strode did. It could have been in the form of Michael's dream or a fleeting realisation when he let Corey live after seeing in him what he had done when they were man hugging in the sewer. After all they had an actor for Halloween kills who looked a lot like Donald Pleasance who was working on the sets.Now that Blumhouse have had to give the rights back, I just hope they don't continue the franchise using the grand-daughter, Allyson as the new shape as she has now inherited the mask.

I thought the 2nd was unfairly judged and that it's much better than most give it credit for. My tolerance for bad horror is pretty high and I can forgive quite a bit. All that being said, this finale is the absolute pits. I won't spoil it, but Halloween Ends is a complete let down from the previous two films. The characters here are totally different in every way, with motivations that don't make sense, actions that defy logic all culminating in a clunky showdown thats just a big wet fart. There is one great kill, something almost parodical of Looney Toons cartoons, while all others are relegated to being offscreen or simple stabs in the chest. The level of violence here, outside of that one kill, is honestly broadcast TV level violent. There are several recycled ideas, including another closet scene, that work because they always have, but at almost every other turn the movie fumbles over itself. It seems like in an attempt to quickly churn this sequel out, they took a preexisting script and wrote a Halloween story into it. That's the only reason I can think of for the disastrous decisions made by the writers. It's just NOT a Michael Myers Halloween movie. It's a weird amalgamation of Friday the 13th Part 5, The Curse of Michael Myers and Season of the Witch. Almost nothing works and its safe to say that I absolutely hated the entire thing.

This movie thankfully had less cheese, more appropriate laughs, better dialogue and deeper characters and a mystique that was up to date and not trying to replicate John Carpenter's original in modern times. John has said himself the story was OVER after the first one. I'm not one to argue that but I'm so glad this crew finally took a chance. It was much better with a modern story. The music from Caroenter was spot on for the film. Good dream score like sequences for the budding yet unholy romance of Corey and Allison with classic Carpenter hard hitting beats mixed with high spooky tweeter synth. I loved seeing flashes of the old Laurie. Loved seeing Allison as vulnerable and stuck in a small town with not many guys to choose from as her choices have been and continue to be awful. There was enough political theater for both sides of the isle keeping it more on the objective line so the movie's story was more important. The kills in this movie were also a massive highlight. Michael got his swan song with only killing people that mostly deserved it in this film but full forgiveness was not on the alter,\nMichael was. His was an unholy sacrifice on Laurie's chopping block to release Haddonfield from the evil that seeped from underneath the town into everyone's lives.

It seems to me that the last 2 Halloween movies of the reboot trilogy the film makers were more concerned with making money and rushing to get it done than caring about their product/art. The original was done with little money and it's the best of all of them because it left you with the feeling that the boogey man is still out there -now I saw it when it was first in the theaters and I was a teenager and at the time it was a very scary movie, an instant classic -to todays viewer it may seem a little lame as it's not super gory or bloody but still better than all the Halloween movies they did later since Michael Meyers became a caricature (like Jason) that couldn't be killed regardless of what you do to him to the point that it got ridiculous - he wasn't even scary anymore just stupid.

But ok they are both troubled and drawn together.The final third of the film. It is revealed that Michael Myers was in fact killed at the end of the last movie. If we have to have the ridiculous scene of the townsfolk parading Michael's body through town and throwing his body in a car crusher, this is where that scene should go. So in actuality, that happened in the past. This would explain how the town, and Laurie, were able to move on and live a somewhat normal life.It is also revealed that Corey was there that night, and had a hand in killing Michael. Perhaps he dealt the fatal blow. And somehow in all of the confusion he managed to get away with Michael's mask.Final reveal, Corey isn't so innocent after all. The kid wasn't being a brat, he didn't lock Corey in the attic. It was the other way around. Corey puts Michael's mask on, maybe to scare the kid. He throws the kid to his death, it was not an accident. Corey has always been a psycho. Killing Michael just triggered it. (no coincidence that Corey looks very much like Michael Rooker in \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer)Michael was never in this film at all. It was in Corey's head. He was never in the sewer.

I won't spoil too much but, it takes the PURE EVIL concept, and gives it a new demention which was actually very cool to see. It was very much in line with John Carpenter's other works.Now, I feel it is important to mention. These mythologies were introduced in Halloween 2018, when Dr loomis' replacement went on a murder spree, which baffled me. Having seen this film, it makes a lot more sense. It was something that should have been present in all three films in a more precise manner. But I have a feeling it wasn't fully realised back then. Which is a shame.That however is my only gripe. Everything else was very good, character development was solid. The kills where brutal and Jaime Lee Curtis gave a performance that flattens the previous two films. Where I think I enjoyed it for its pace, it may be too slow for some as it does tell a new story and introduces new characters.All in all, I think a third is a charm here.",

Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job as the main character again, but the movie fell off towards the end. A kid named Corey babysits this kid and accidently kill him and michael myers sees vengeance in his eyes and spares his life initially.Jamie Lee Curtis has a grandaughter who is cute and ends up falling in love with the child killer. Michael Myers barely gets any screen time and any kills which was disappointing.Overall, I would say it was funny more so than suspenseful. The kills toward the end are ridiculous especially when this guy gets his tongue falling on a laserdisc player. That was stupid.

It is not a direction that was foreseen by many fans of the franchise, but it was exactly what we needed. It may take Michael Myers enthusiasts a while to accept this, in my opinion. He was pushing 70 in the film, and a vessel for evil can only go so far. Therefore, Michael was not the focal point. Did we still get a formidable story with plenty of deaths and gore? Yes. Were parts a bit interpretive and unnecessary? I could also partly agree to this, yes. In the END we were promised a Laurie Strode/ Michael Myers showdown, and we were not deprived. However, to me, it should have been the meat & potatoes of this new trilogy of films. One final major climax. But it emanated more of a soft subplot. The conclusion of our Final Girl should have had a larger climb. It started with Laurie and it ended with Laurie. Michael was just along for the ride. \ud83d\udd2a",

People complained about a lack of Michael's screen time, but we actually saw Laurie and Michael represented through Allyson and Corey. Michael corrupted Corey the same way he corrupted everything in Laurie's life. When Laurie was losing Allyson to Corey, she was actually losing Allyson to Michael. Michael's darkness is parasitic, like the infected wound on Corey's hand, the evil within mentioned in Laurie's dialogue. Michael infected the whole town with trauma, fear and hate. That trauma was turned onto Corey who was tortured by his community after the accidental death of the boy. But even that death is the result of Michael Myers. The child's choice to scare his babysitter on Halloween with his knowledge of Myers, and his total lack of fear of Myers due to growing up around Michael's murders, and so being desensitised and lacking in empathy. Corey's fight or flight response was triggered by his genuine fear of Michael Myers.Laurie dressed for that final battle in the same clothes she wore in the original, showing that she actually did 'secretly wish for Michael to come back' as Corey said. She wanted to fight her boogeyman, even embraced death by his hand. That's the power of Michael's 'infection.' It hurt to see Michael churned up like that, but at some point we have to stop rooting for the killer, because the whole point of this trilogy is about healing from trauma, specifically the domino effect of acts of violence. People were thrilled to see Michael fight off his attackers in Kills but complain that Michael is completely messed up from it in Ends. Michael is a human being. Human are the monsters. Whether it's Michael or what he turns people into. The trauma a human can inflict on another. A supernatural explanation simply doesn't cut it for this timeline. Laurie had the choice between cherry blossoms and letting evil win. She chose cherry blossoms and for that, I'm happy.",

            "content": "To make my views on this franchise clear: the original Halloween is one of my favourite horror films ever, as well as one of my favourite John Carpenter movies, who is one of my favourite directors, so it has all that going for it. Aside from 3 and 4, I hated all the sequels (even then, 3 and 4 are just OK), until we got to 2018. That wasn't great, and had logical errors aplenty, but it was a fun, nasty back to basics horror film that mostly worked for me. Halloween Kills was a step back, a mindless gorefests that bored me to tears. So when I call Halloween Ends my favourite entry after that original, you know that's a mixed message.Halloween Ends is a thoughtful, entertaining love letter to the explanation films of the 70's, the slasher films of the 80s and is in keeping with the themes of the original film. And sadly, it is pretty hated across the board for it.The story goes that Corey Cunningham accidentally killed a kid he was babysitting. The town is still reeling from Michael's rampage, so instead of helping Corey they brand him a killer. Years later, Corey comes across Michael and becomes infected with his evil. Corey loves Allyson, and will use his new found evil to make sure they both get what they want.It's an interesting story, a very good story about evil, and how it may be inherited or perhaps its all circumstance. But if themes are not what you're after (they weren't what I was looking for), then don't worry, it's still a great slasher movie. The kills are awesome: creative and very very gory. These are some of the best onscreen kills in recent years.Its well filmed, with great acting and good use of neon colours. John Carpenters music is great as usual, and it's some of his best since he stopped directing. I'd get the soundtrack separately, and that's rare.Sadly, without wishing to spoil, the final 15 minutes or so suck. The story ends early and it's just a random action scene that 'had to happen' because the title says Ends. It is such a shame, it knocks the film itself down. It doesn't ruin it, but it's a huge let down after such a solid run up to it.I feel that, much like with Halloween 3, time will be kinder to this film. As it is, there is a lot of hate coming it's way. I think it is a shame, but then again, I am hardly a fan of this franchise. I was glad for something interesting and different, but there are a lot of people who aren't. Still, maybe if we come back to it in 3 or 4 years...or whenever they decide to make another one.",

The writing for this is so awful and has no continuity at all with (the almost as bad) Halloween Kills from last year. At the end of that film we see that Michale is not actually human. That he's definitely a supernatural force who can't be killed with fire, knives, guns or being beaten with baseball bats by an angry mob. He kills all of them after the attack and walks away. Yet in this films he's WEAK all of a sudden? And Laurie kills him with her basic kitchen knives set she ordered on Amazon?Overall, After watching this GODAWFUL movie, I almost wish that I was the pumpkin in Laurie's writing room.Would give a zero out of 10 if I could.",

Good actors with good acting too!Great vibes, great atmosphere, this movie is going places!Then about half way through, the big reveal happens and just literally lost all interest. Was shocked in disbelief how they could do something so cringe, so eyeroll, so ridiculous, so unbelievable, even for this type of movie.It just got more goofy as time went on, and literally zoned out until the end.On a side note, the omniscient, omnipresence killer just doesnt work in modern film, as its hard to imagine them not being glued to the 'gram.If you want to see a movie start off well, and then take a total nosedive into a complete joke halfway through, youve found it.",

Now, the one's that followed only ignited something within. There appears to be an ode to Prom Night 1980 staring JLC, if you seen that film you'll know it when you see it.

This movie is a miss for both Michale and Laurie fans.The last two movies spend so much time establishing, that Michael is literally an unstoppable killing machine without emotions, just for him to hide in a sewer and let some guy go, just because he looked in his eyes?I think the ending is a good ending for the series, but everything except the last 15 minutes felt like filler.

Well the title screen gives the game away for a start, plus the type is blue as opposed to the traditional gharish yellow-a nod to that Friday the 13th movie no doubt.

Much of the film (including the bewildering prologue) centers on a new character, Corey, who has an unfortunate babysitting experience which leads him to be ostracized by most of the local townies. He also has a run-in with some awful shape from the distant past.Much of this film is exciting and will have you waiting for a) some deeper explanation for Michael Myers and his reanimating powers, b) a showdown between Laurie Strode and Michael, and c) Michael's mask to be removed: suffice to say, you may be satisfied with two of the three above expectations but disappointed by the ambiguity, yet the film ends with a powerful, bloody climax and some relief for a certain character who has been put through the wringer in life.

The story takes place four years after the events of the last sequel Halloween Kills, Laurie Strode, terrifficaly played with an intense conviction by Jamie Lee Curtis which is the best thing about this film, now lives happly with her granddaughter Allyson, nicely played by Andy Matichak, but trouble soon begins when Allyson becomes involved with a troubled young man named Corey Cunningham, superbly played by Rohan Campbell, who was falsely accused of killing the boy he was babysitting, the towns people of Haddonfield ridicule and look down on him, so he goes looking for Michael Meyers who he knows murdered the boy. He finally finds and confronts him in a sewer outlet a few miles out of town, what follows is a bit surprising as Meyer's evil contaminates Cunningham and he goes on a killing spree with him. Where this film really pays off is in the heart-pounding final and chilling confrontation between Michael Meyers and Laurie who is a tough-as-nails badass, it ends the film with a satisfying conclusion, but like Laurie says in the film \"Evil never dies, it just changes Shape.\" Overall an enjoyable and suspenseful film in most places, but it could have been so much better.",

First off the writing is some of the worst I've have ever heard it was corny and sometimes just flat out stupid. Next the fact the most of the movie focuses on the character of Corey I did not like the actor that played him and this movie should have instead focused on Laurie vs Michael not Micheal taking help from a guy that got beat up by band kids. I also hated the fact that Michael had 2 kills in this movie. I have never been more bored during a slasher. The cinematography was also awful. Another thing in the long list of thing I hated in this movie is that it put Laurie in the backseat to a brand new character. There is also the fact that this movie feels so disconnected from the last 2. And then there is the out of character moments from Laurie. Like when she has Corey who has started murdering people at gun point and she doesn't shoot him. And then there is the fact that at the end of the last movie Halloween Kills Laurie states that Michael gets stronger with every kill and they can't just shoot him and expect him to die. Yet the way they kill him is by stabbing him!",

It's not a typical Halloween movie, and if that's all you wanted then yea, you may be disappointed.This however, adds so much and many psychological elements to it, rather than just being a quick cheesy slash and dash like Kills was.The story is different and was certainly a risk to take, but it pays off.It feels like when Rob Zombie tried to add a psychological element to His Halloween 2 (failing miserably), but this one really succeeds in doing that.There are a couple of plot holes, and Ofcourse the story is entirely far fetched and unbelievable, but this film does not deserve the hate it's getting.It wasn't your typical Halloween film, and going into it knowing that, I thought I'd be massively disappointed, but I was wrong. The 2018 one is superior to this, but this is far superior to Kills.Left the theatre pleasantly surprised and rather impressed at what was pulled off here. 8/10.",

            "content": "Hmm this one had big boots to fill and unfortunately it came up a little short. Halloween End is a step up from the train wreck filler movie that was Kills, but that's coming from a low bar.I found the first 20mins bar the opening scene to be a little chaotic and rather choppy. An example is a scene a Laurie's house which then cuts to a shot of the character Rohan then a cut to a fuel bowser and then a group of frats abruptly join the scene.There's a lot going on and not enough time for the viewer to digest what's going on in the screen at any one time. I wasn't a fan of the car yard killing scene which gave me SAW 3D Car trap vibes nor were some of the kills, which felt unoriginal and an afterthought.Michael in this movie seems to be on a pendulum of mood swings going from being down in the doldrums on the ground to surviving a cut to his throat and still able to grab Laurie with his hands. It's so weird to watch and seems more inconsistent than any of the other entries I've seen.Jamie Lee Curtis and Andi Matichak do a terrific job and John Carpenter's score of the movie also earns praise. Unfortunately, that's the only positives I found.Being the last movie in the trilogy, I was expecting big things in terms of an ending. The result was lacklustre. Considering the movie runtime is 111mins, only around 10mins would be of the showdown between Laurie and Michael. The fight scene was good, but the aftermath death scene was a little cringey for my liking.If I summed up Halloween Ends, I'd say it's a movie that had a lot of ideas thrown into it, but nothings really executed properly. Halloween Ends is definitely a step up from Kills but ultimately it lacks the cohesiveness and finesse that Halloween (2018) brought to the series.",

The relationship between Corey and Allison makes no sense at all and is I kid you not developed within about 15 minutes trying to make us care for him. Laurie did nothing significant besides a predictable trick at the end of the movie. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just rambling but I am generally frustrated on how hard they dropped the ball with this franchises. Halloween 2018 was a flawed but great start,Halloween kills wasn't the best cause of the bad decision making and the whole evil dies tonight thing but atleast it was enjoyable watching Myers go on a rampage.

            "content": "When I was in high school, we had the traditional grades you could earn (i.e. A, B, C, D, F) and there was also an \"E\" grade. Getting an \"E\" meant the student was legitimately making an effort to understand the course material, but just couldn't produce satisfactory work. It was meant to show that the instructor knew the kid was trying and shouldn't necessarily be considered a failure.Well, that's pretty much how I felt about this film. After the blood-soaked overkill that was Halloween Kills, I was quite surprised by the more subdued direction they took this time around. But while the producers deserve kudos for trying something different, it never really works out, and the result is an ultimately unsatisfying \"conclusion\" to this four-decades-old franchise.(I say \"conclusion\" because we all know darn well that if there's any chance of making a few more dollars for some studio, this likely WON'T be the last Halloween film, even though the well has long since run dry.)The original Halloween was built around a simple premise. Michael Myers was an unstoppable force of evil who inexplicably decided to hunt down and slaughter three teenage girls who happened to cross his path. The subsequent sequels added motives to explain Michael's malevolence, built mainly around the conceit that Laurie Strode was actually his sister, and he was determined to kill her (and any children she had) just as he had killed his first sister, Judith.The new trilogy, however, abandoned that storyline and returned to the idea that Michael is just plain pure evil. Ends tries to inject some new blood (sorry) into the formula by suggesting that his evil is contagious, and under the right circumstances even the nicest folks you meet can head down that dark path. The problem is the film just doesn't work.To be sure, there's a lot of potential here, but ultimately there's too much going on. Once the story picks up steam, a lot of different threads come into play, but none of them are ever really fleshed out. As a result the film's final reel doesn't really make a lot of sense, and the finale is ultimately unsatisfying.Halloween Ends is far from the worst film in this beaten-horse franchise, and it definitely stands out from some of its siblings. But in the end the whole thing seems half-baked and could've used some more time in the oven.",

Some kid named Corey teams up with Michael and turns into a slaughter duo, c'mon man. Michael should've been the one to kill Laurie, would've been a 10x better ending that's for sure. I was actually starting to laugh when I saw that guy Corey kill someone in a Walmart witch mask. Also when Corey fell off the building and got up like Michael Myers would. Made it 1000x more cheesy. Michael got hurt when some random dude kicked him in the stomach and couldn't get up. That's not what I call Michael Myers. Michael Myers also isn't the type to hide out in a fricken sewer like Pennywise would. Overall, this is just a total disrespect to Michael, also known as one of the most popular serial killers in history. I'm really really disgusted of this movie.

There was no suspense or thrill in this movie and the fight scene between Laurie Strodes vs the shape was so not worth even talking about. How is Laurie who was always running scared in every movie all of a sudden in this movie, have the strength to take out Micheal Myers all by herself. No, what the directors should have done was use Corey's storyline as the next Micheal Myers buildup or something. Do not go into this movie believing all the hype.",

Halloween 2018 was better than it had any right to be, and while Halloween Kills was deeply flawed it at least had a unified and cohesive story (even if it wasn't the best) but this film...I think the term \"train wreck\" fits it nicely. The pacing was all over the place, the cinematography couldn't decide whether it wanted to be Halloween, Sid & Nancy or a David Lynch homage and it didn't do any of those things well. The Laurie and Michael stuff was fine and I liked the Laurie and Allyson scenes, but the rest felt like a completely different movie. It felt like the studio took a different film and shoehorned the Halloween trappings into it. And it certainly didn't feel like a fitting end to a \"trilogy;\" it cheapened the shock end of Halloween Kills while adding nothing. Closure should feel earned; this closure felt more resigned.",

This is when the movie finally begins feeling like an actual Halloween movie. We get a solid finale between Laurie and Michael which redeems the film enough to raise my score from a 3 up to a overly generous 6.Overall, the film lacks the feel of a Halloween movie. At times it feels like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer instead. I personally felt that this movie reminded me more of Halloween: Resurrection than Halloween 2018 or Kills, let alone Halloween (1978). Whether you liked Kills or not... personally I felt it was under appreciated... but Ends does not expand upon the plot. You'll even question if Laurie recalls Michael killed her own daughter in 2018.Unfortunately, this movie drops the ball up until the finale of the film.

When us true horror fans, major Halloween fans, come into the theater to watch the FINAL battle of Lori and Michael, we come to feel what Halloween 78 and Halloween 18 gave us.We want all out war. We want horror. We want MICHAEL. We want the eerie vibes that we loved so much from the previous. The feeling of \"Michael is on his way home\" \"somethings coming\" feeling!! I do appreciate the opening scene, very dark and unsettling. I thought it was going to go in a completely different direction? I thought they were going to showcase the next generation Michael. But it ended up being completely different. I feel as if this just didn't have the spice, and the fireworks that the final film should've had?I appreciate them going in a unique direction here.. but I feel as if this would have almost been a better middle film rather then the grand end to a legacy.

I love \"Halloween\" so much and have dedicated so many moments to this franchise , it's close to my heart so I can't dislike this film. But it just was extremely random to me.

The guy can kill on his own, I saw absolutely no point in adding this kid into the mix.The last hour of the film would've been okay if this random character wasn't killing with Michael, like come on man who's damn idea was that?! Whoever wrote the script should be fired. The ending of such a mega Halloween film needs to be well thought out and executed to perfection to leave fans satisfied, it also needs to make sense to the fans.So much random garbage was mixed in it was so unnecessary, the characters spend so much time building up this new killer in the film over shadowing Myers completely only to die in the end by stabbing himself in the neck. They gave Myers like 3 kill scenes and they were all weak, it took forever for the action to start not to mention. I was literally getting so bored I started veering off into my phone, I stopped paying attention to the movie that's how much of a joke it was.I have no clue why they turned Michael into a softy, it's as if he lost his strength randomly to old age. But in every other film he always had superhuman strength, leave his strength alone. They were trying to emphasize Michael becoming weak so much, we get what you're doing...we get it. It's stupid, the man is a un killable demon trapped inside a human body. Leave it that way, don't all of a sudden turn him into a regular killer.The ending when they dump him in a meat grinder was so stupid I couldn't take it, literally killed off a legendary Halloween killer in such a stupid way. As they attached him to the roof of the car, they should've had Michael rip through the ropes like the beast that he is. Stab Laurie in the head killing her or something, then Michael dies slowly after that from a massive loss of blood and he dies peacefully knowing his obsession is dead with him.That would've also opened the door for fans to maybe expect another film in the future giving us hope, hmm maybe Myers didn't actually die maybe he rises again and finds a new obsession to stalk, maybe Laurie's grand daughter could've been the new obsession for Myers. Throwing him in the meat grinder was weak as hell, I'm convinced a kid with a crayon wrote the ending to this one.

No point, no plot, no suspense, no horror. I spent more time waiting for it to be over than actually watching the movie. There was so much potential for this last and \"final\" showdown and considering its a Blumhouse film I expected a lot more!There was potential to tie up loose ends: They discussed Ben Tramer in Kills. He could've resurfaced for this film. Lindsay was filler for the past two movies and didn't really serve any purpose. She and Allyson could have helped Laurie bring Michael to justice for what he had done to their families and friends. However, it WAS nice to see Sondra, Julian, and the sheriff who joked about \"canceling Halloween\" but again, they were just filler. The sheriff made, maybe a 5-10 minute appearance in each of the three movies and could have done more. He's such a great actor. In my opinion, Aaron should have survived Halloween 2018. He could have resurfaced in Kills or waited for Ends and been helpful in some way. Why bring in a new main character? Now, for the next hour plus, I'm stuck trying to feel empathy for Corey. A whiney young man getting bullied by Haddonfield High marching band jerks while Allyson gets sexually harassed by the 40 something year old cop.Most times i didn't know if Michael was fighting or if it was Corey. It was like watching Friday the 13th part 5 except no one ate Michael's heart. The fact that Sondra survived was completely unexpected but it definitely was not Laurie's fault that her \"boogeyman\" attacked her. And then, accusing Laurie of taunting her brain damaged brother and that's what started all of this?? Does anyone in Haddonfield read the paper? He escaped! No one listened to Dr. Loomis and everyone's looking to blame Laurie.I understand that they were looking to finish Michael off for good but damn. They could have done a better job. And let's face it, decapitation was hard to come back from but they managed in H20 so who knows if he'll bounce back from his death in this one.I wanted to feel something other than boredom. I felt bad for the characters in Kills: Mr. Trovoley who committed suicide. Big John and Little John, and even Karen. But this film, I simply felt bad for the thousands of people who've waited patiently for this final film for over 44 years, who paid to go to the theater or wasted their time watching it on Peacock. Jamie Lee Curtis got her redemption and that's the only thing that was good about this film. I always rooted for JLC. And always rooted for Michael killing those around him.I'm hoping it's just a prank and this isn't possibly the big finale we've all been waiting for. It's Halloween...everyone's entitled to one good scare.... and furthermore, the residents of Haddonfield should have moved out many, many years ago!",

It should have ended at least with Myers to be getting away Or Lorie Or Maybe Both Dying .

If you expect an old fashioned slasher narrative, think again. But I really appreciate how they tried to make something different.",

She didn't have much screen time in Kills. Here I like that we can see more of her but now Micheal is missing the whole movie.So their story ended. In a terrible wrong way when they decided that this movie was going to focus of a new character instead. The story isn't bad but it's not a Halloween movie. And not much is actually happening. It's more like a drama now.The unstoppable Michael is now weak. Laurie who wanted to put Michael to to ground so badly has now moved on. Despite that he killed her daughter and she knows he's still out there.The climax is good but to short and to late in to save this movie. I needed Laurie and Michael the whole movie to make it great.So if you like Jamie Lee Curtis. Watch this for her. If you are here for Michael don't watch because he has nothing to do here.",

David Gordon Green did a great job with Halloween 2018 and honestly even though Kills isn't well liked, I thought it was a blast and brought Michael Myers to Jason levels of brutality which was awesome.But this movie is out to offend the fans, seemingly on purpose. It just doesn't feel like a proper continuation of the trilogy (or the entire franchise for that matter). The characters from previous films don't behave as you would expect them to and this includes Michael Myers. The mythology Green builds around him in \"Kills\" is just forgotten about. And as terribly misguided as it is to center the story on a complete nobody instead of characters we've come to care about, what's worse is the wimp Michael Myers is reduced to. At a point, a character half his size just walks up to him, wrestles him to the ground and steals his mask. It's just a slap in the face to the fans who love this character.And imagine this, Michael Myers is barely in the movie to begin with and still the filmmakers manage to disgrace him the few times he's on screen.What a complete shame this movie is, it's worse than Resurrection and Revenge and I truly don't understand how no one in charge when this was being made stepped in and just said \"no\". Do yourself a favour and put in Halloween 4 instead, I know I'll have to after watching this trainwreck.",

I'll admit I'm biased because team Michael but, Michael's barely in the movie for maybe 7 minutes of screen time and I (like many others) watch these movies to see Michael do his thing. So for them to have a story full of needless plot points and narrative. It's so disappointing it's not a great Halloween movie you'd think they would learn from season of the witch (which is a great movie) but for a true Halloween movie to be great it has to have Michael.

This film however was a dumpster fire from the beginning, and quickly got out of hand into what became a confusing, unengaging, emotionless mess.First the Good:\n**There is very little good throughout the entire movie.Jamie Lee Curtis provides a solid performance, and while she does not get as much screen time as anticipated, her work still shines though and has more significance than the previous entry.The film does an \"ok\" job at maintaining continuity with the already established characters, and provides a weak but reasonable explanation for the current state of the plot.Unfortunately that is about where the Good stops.Now for the Bad:\n**There is too much to list especially without major spoilers\nThe plot is messy and really does not tell a compelling story.. At no point does this feel like a horror movie. While the kills are brutal and the tone is bleak this movie is a drama from beginning to end. No jumps, no suspense, no emotion.Without major spoilers, I would not be surprised if some have to double check to make sure they are in the right theater watching the right movie. This seems more of a disaster of a middle movie in a weak romantic drama then a slasher finale.Disappointing if not down right insulting ending to one of the most iconic horror characters of all time.

            "content": "OK. So I'm going to start right off the bat here with spoilers so please don't read if you want to avoid them.The concept is an interesting one and the film has a great cold open that leaves you wondering what exactly could they be building to. I like the idea to have a second killer on the lose but it also felt under utilised.The way that this trilogy seems to have gone is 2018 was almost supposed to be a requel of sorts. Reaffirming where the story fits and then repeating the same old story after that. It was very much enjoyable. Then they seemed to want to go down the route of \"anthology\" films again where Halloween kills takes an almost frankenstien tale and mistaken identity and uses Michael to tell that story.After the first film Michael appears to be used more as the vessel to tell separate stories. Halloween 2018 is about Michael, Halloween kills is about mob mentality and ends is about trauma on the community. They each tell there own separate story stapled together with the saga of Michael.When I came out of the theatre I won't lie, I felt disappointed. Mostly vecause of the huge ton shift. I didn't necessarily think it was a bad film (a messy film is how I'd describe it) but it wasn't the film I wanted to see. I think that is the important thing to know going in.Corey's character arc is an interesting one, and if you made that into a whole film in itself away from the Halloween franchise I think it would do well. The biggest issue I have with it is it slows right down. Its the finale it should be ramped up to 11. It feels like for me, this story would have been right at home in the middle of the trilogy not the end. It is busy explaining numerous aspects of the story before it can begin and then by the time the action starts its finishing. When Michael died I thought \"this can't be happening so soon\" before remembering that we have had a whole film of exposition and needless dates.Do I like the film yes, but do I think it was a misguided introduction into the franchise again yes.By far not the worst insert into the Halloween franchise but by far the worst film in this timeline of the franchise. Worth a watch to make your own opinion but be warned of the shift in tone. That may help you enjoy the film more.",

They didn't have enough material\nto be a true Trilogy. It could've been Halloween original, 2018, and if they merged Halloween Kills & Ends into 1 movie.

It recreates a full trilogy of title cards from the original trilogy. I loved the pumpkin animation.What makes Corey such a good addition is that he has a good motive and he's relatable, being shamed by the whole town of Haddonfield.Overall, this is a phenomenal conclusion to a phenomenal trilogy that acted as the end of a phenomenal series. Production value was great, this movie had me shivering, acting was great, and it had some light humor.9.1/10All the dislikes this movie is getting is from trolls who haven't seen it.

Instead Myers is living in the sewer like a mutant turtle and possesses a douche with terrible story line to bring ppl to him so he can kill them and grow stronger. I could eat a bowl of shrooms and come up with a better story line. I guess they did pretty much tells us in the second movie that evil dies tonight. I just thought that was a corney as hell pitch line but now I realize they were pretty much telling us they decided to destroy the franchise.

I thought about the plot, the connection of the movie to the rest of the \"Halloween\" movie series and overall I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed as a person that has watched the entire collection of the \"Halloween\" movie series multiple times.\"Halloween Ends\" introduces an entirely new character whose name is \"Corey Cunningham\", the main antagonist of this movie besides Michael. Corey seems to get drawn in and somehow \"possessed\" by Michaels gaze and then goes on to be a poor imitation of Michael, a wannabe Michael Myers you could say.As well as that, Michael seems to have been shoved aside completely in this movie and has been portrayed as more of a \"side character\" and to be honest in some scenes he was even portrayed weak and pretty pathetic, not very much like our typical Michael.All in all to not spoil too much of the movie, a lot doesn't seem to make sense or add up to the previous movies or the story of \"Michael Myers\" and the progression of \"Haddonfield\" and the people living in it and the terror that has been caused by Michael during all of these decades in \"Halloween Ends\".The movie was alright, and it was a really nice experience to finally see a \"Halloween\" part in the movies for the first time but seeing as this is supposed to be the final of this movie series, I'm sadly a bit disappointed.",

This would've been better off as a straight to tv/streaming appetizer film (but shorter), not paraded with grandeur as being thee conclusion to an iconic series.I refuse to believe that this is the last & final film of the franchise. I will not accept this. They're wrong.",

The acting was good, the story flowed and the kill scenes were amazing. It's fit well as the final part of this timeline but also could be viewed as a stand alone with a little knowledge of the story.My only criticism is It's a shame that movies these days seem to write the episodes as they go rather than start with a fully lay out plan. It would have probably helped some people to accept the character and storyline a little more had there been an introduction from the off. Not telegraph it but just a subtle, in the background, with a few scenes for him.Enjoyable and I look forward to the next multiverse story of Michael Myers.",

This movie is horrible, it does not know what it wants to be and is certainly not a horror movie. What is it? Confused. There is no slow build, there are no memorable scares, Michael's presence is not felt in the movie, he is merely a vehicle for the flawed ideas the creators are trying to convey (a paper-thin rewrite of Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood). Jamie Lee Curtis is a great actress, but her bold lead-woman roll is vanquished. Andi Matichak is a good at what she does, but her character refuses to learn the lessons of her grandmother. In the end, as the credits roll the viewer is left wondering \"why?\" The so-called climax comes and goes with a whimper, perhaps this is because we were left so confused. Kudos to Rohan Campbell for doing a decent job with what he had to work with.

            "content": "Say what you will about Halloween Kills, I didn't mind it, but it certainly wasn't great. However we can all agree that Halloween Kills was undoubtedly a Halloween movie. Halloween Ends felt like a horror movie with references to the Halloween series.First of all, I didn't like how the movie was set 4 years into the future, and how it treated the events of Halloween Kills like \"Yeah, that happened but now we're happy for some reason even though we fully know that Micheal is still alive!\". At least have it set a year into the future, because that way there'd be a much scarier atmosphere. Like, the characters would be scared because of the fear that Micheal would return and kill again. However there is none of that in this movie, people act like he's dead but he isn't and they know it so it feels really weird.Second... Cory was just not fun to watch. At first you're like \"Man, how horrible that this would happen to him.\" but then when he essentially becomes Micheal, he just turns into a whiny kid with anger issues. It would have been much better to see him work more with Micheal and bring him back into the spotlight rather than become his \"successor\". And Cory also just serves to ruin the entire point of this movie. It was advertised as being the \"Laurie vs. Micheal\" movie yet it just ends up being 2/3's Cory vs. People he doesn't like and 1/3 Laurie vs. Micheal.And that brings me to Micheal. He finally shows up around halfway into the movie and does next to nothing. He has a few kills that Cory helps execute, but that's it. He doesn't feel like a threat anymore, or an embodiment of evil which is something that even Halloween Kills got.And I'm pretty sure kills weren't exclusive to Halloween Kills, but for some reason this movie thinks that they are. Most of the deaths are off screen which is really weird, and the amount of kills is minuscule compared to the massacre of Halloween Kills.I realise I keep comparing this movie to Halloween Kills but can you blame me? Kills gets so many things right compared to Ends, but Ends just serves to make Kills a filler movie which it easily couldn't have been if Ends was better. The ending for Ends was just okay, it was a nice little ending, but not the way Micheal should have gone out, not like the weak old man he was portrayed as in this film.",

I would like to think this is the end of Michael Myers, but maybe only the Myers we currently know. This film actually has depth, not just mindless killing.

The 13th film in one of the most iconic franchises of all time, demoted to a lame ripoff of a Stephen King story form 40 years ago, with everyone's favorite slasher in a William Shatner mask replacing the titular 1957 Plymouth Fury from that aforementioned Stephen King film.Corey is the kid, er, thirtysomething dude, from Christine. Awkward, dorky, shunned by his peers. No, not for accidentally killing a kid he was babysitting, he was already an awkward dork before that. He encounters Michael in a sewer, and begins to act more and more defiant and violent. There's even a scene in a junkyard, where the group of bullies got to get revenge, JUST like in Christine. Did I mention, this dorky thritysomething kid kicks Michael's butt and steals his mask. Cuz that happened.But, in the end, poor Corey was just a pawn. Used by Michael to get to Laurie, who, strangely , has \"put Michael Myers behind her\", after being obsessed and terrified of him for 40 years, and after he killed her daughter. Riiiiiight. We finally get that final battle between Laurie & Michael....at the end of the movie. Michael, who was stabbed, beaten , and shot dozens of times (with multiple shotgun blasts) in H Kills, is defeated by slashing his throat and wrists. WHAT. THE. ACTUAL?!?!. So, he can survive having holes blasted in him, but slit his throat and he's a goner. Alrighty then. This was a mess. It;s like the writers came up with a ideas for 3 different films and mashed them together into an incoherent mess.But fear not, for while the Blumhouse H40 trilogy has ended, the isn't the end of Halloween (yeah, just ignore the film's title), as the rights now revert back to producer Malek Akkad (son of original producer Moustapha Akkad), and he can, and will, continue making these films, if only to retain the trademark.

So... that start was unexpected but I liked \"The Thing\" reference. Then we have the classic Halloween intro as before and Laurie Storde starts explaining that \"The Shape\" has disappeared and no one knows where he is but she now lives with her granddaughter Allyson. And everyone in the town is somewhat happy again... but many of the people in town hate Laurie so no one likes her. Allyson works as a nurse in a wired Hospital where the doctor and nurses are a bunch of hideous people. But there she is and she hates her life because she has lost everything. And later we realize that Cory who accidentally killed this kid is free roaming in town because the judge forgave him. But he is a loser as well. 30min into the movie and we haven't even seen Michael Mayers or something. But what we see is that Cory is a loser and everyone bullies him even his mom. So if you have any intelligence you can realize where the film is heading that this Cory dude is becoming the new Michael Mayers. This random kids hurt Cory and Laurie rescues him to take him where her granddaughter works and this is where the wired stuff begins to happen cause Allyson falls immediately in love with Cory and starts being... wired... saying cringey lines and lines no one would ever say these days.This film was weird because Allyson and Cory fall in love... the two weirdos in town I guess... and we see Michael Mayers until 45min into the movie where Cory meets him and they become \"friends\"... so Cory starts now doing the killing and stuff and you may think okay I guess the Michael Mayers/Laurie arc is over.Cory and Allyson will become the new characters... but no... the director is a total dumba** and ruins what could become a new start for the franchise by making it slow pacing and just dumb... I give it a six because I had fun watching it instead of being frightened or whatever. The premise is so so so dumb and bad executed that is a fun movie to watch... so I mean I you don't have anything else better to see or to do. Sure go watch it.",

All is well and good until Corey encounter Michael Myers and the murders start happening again.There are tons of interesting ideas here, but it's too little too late in the final film of a trilogy to be introducing new lead characters and mythology. It feels like a last ditch effort to give meaning to this lackluster franchise, but the film, isolated from its trilogy, isn't too bad.

Some fans will love it and some will hate it, it's bound to split audiences. I enjoyed the welcome change to the typical hack and slash routine. What we got was actually a random, wacky sort of coming of age story. Don't let that put you off though, it's fun and doesn't leave you high and dry.The pros, This Laurie is happy and content. This is a pleasant change from the crazy paranoid woman that lives in the woods. It's nice to see our characters live a happy somewhat normal life untill Michael comes back along. When the action begins (a little late but that's in my cons) it doesn't let up, it's balls to wall gore. The kills are memorable and just as depraved as Halloween kills's body count. Also the final showdown DELIVERS! For me atleast, it was a great buildup and very tense! I felt more than satisfied when the credits rolls! I felt we got a weird badass Halloween movie to end them all!The cons, the change in direction will split fans, but not getting too far into that, the pacing is abit of an issue. Fleshing out storylines and arcs sort of grounds to a halt in the middle of the movie and you want to hurry it along to the action but just as you wish that it sort of kicks into gear! Also thank Christ all the evil dies tonight nonsense is gone! For having such a random sort of wacky story it plays straight forward with no silly messages and undertones!For the final entry, I'm glad they went down a different route! It pays off for me! This movie for me has a rewatch factor! A massive jump in terms of storytelling and quality compare to kills. The film looks good and it has fun! I was in a packed cinema and loved every minute!

I find it actually missed the essence of a Halloween film and use the character of Michael Myers as nothing but a costume for other killers. It is not the scream franchise where you guess who the killer is until the end. We know it's Michael Meyers, The Shape, a boogeyman. I am baffled at this movie. Until the last twenty minutes it feels like a teen romcom between a killers survivor and an alleged murderer in an emo, \"we're so different from the others, let's run away\"- matter. I mean it is not a predictable film but not a per se good Halloween film. I actually liked the new characters, and actor Rohan Campbell, he's great but I felt the new characters stole the focus off of Michael. Is this really a finale then? It doesn't feel like him. As I said this could have been any kind of film. The shape is not a Pennywise out of the sewers of Haddonfield. As a horror film with a lot of gore; especially in the last 20 minutes it's a good one with somewhat interesting choices and good acting. But it feels like it misunderstands its subject matter. I'd recommend anyone interested in watching it to be open towards it. You should watch it if you like the series itself and Michael Myers to see if I was right, but decide for yourself if it's a good movie or an immovable end of a classic horror franchise.",

The retro introduction set the plot for a movie to tie all the previous ones in. The camera transitions and attention to detail add the cherry on top, such as the reflection of Michael Meyers on the knife right before he's met with a stab. As the storyline progresses, Michael Meyers is 2 faced showing a warm side as you can gently see the darkness consume him. Laurie's instincts kick in sensing evil in Corey because she's aware of his intentions. While in theory, this all may seem cliche, it's far from it, they played out the scenes in such an original way, and character development was there, humor, gore, Storyline, and actors. Now can I agree that this ties into the previous movies not really but it was still easy to follow that's why it's an 8 and not a 9. Tying it all into my opinion that this is the best Halloween.",

I am at a loss for words after watching the final installment of this trilogy.If it were possible to give this film less than one star I would. This film is now up there with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, as one of the worst pieces of cinema I have ever had the displeasure of viewing in my entire time on earth.The direction these guys took the franchise in is just puzzling to me. I have been confused about where we were going with this since about the last 45 mins of Halloween Kills. With this new film taking the cake.One common theme of this trilogy was inconsistency. Inconsistency with the abilities of Michael Myers, and just the overall tone and plot of the movie.First, let's talk about Michael Myers' abilities and strength. In one scene Michael Myers grabs a guy by the head and squeezes his eyeballs out, in another scene he twists a guy's head completely around, yet somehow he's not able to out muscle a woman who is pushing 70 years old in a small kitchen, when she is armed with nothing else other than fear. What exactly is Michael Myers? At the end of Halloween Kills, Laurie Strode says \"the more he kills, the more he transcends into something else.\" Ok, but what is he transcending into, or is it just left up to the audience's perspective similar to the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction? I guess I can support that decision. I would venture to say the people who made the film and wrote the script don't even know, based on what they put together. Thats the problem, we never know and it is never explained. There are just too many inconsistencies with this logic.The other issue that I have is just the overall corniness of these last two films. It started with Halloween Kills and the whole \"Evil Dies Tonight\" thing. The entire plot line of Corey in this film is just bizarre and goes against the premise of the entire Halloween franchise. Halloween is about Michael Myers. He is the main character and the focus of the films, he is not a supporting role like he was in this film. There should not be another killer in this film, he he certainly should not be the main focus of the film. There's only one person that does the killing in Halloween movies and that's Michael F'n Myers. That should go without saying.All in all, this could have been two movies. This should have ended in the street with the mob of people who attacked him. Michael Myers should have died in the last film and left it at that. This was was unnecessary and just an overall disappointment.Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie. Go to your favorite streaming service, or go to the store and buy a dvd and watch the original Halloween or one of the sequels. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. You will be disappointed.",

They should have hyped us up to the limit and paid exceptional writers, honestly.Because the ideas are there, for example : in Halloween Kills; the whole survival guilt and revenge arc, where hatred leads you, people becoming a reflex of Michael... those were very interesting ideas !The same thing happened here. The idea of a second, not stronger but faster and character-driven killer was SO GOOD. They just needed better writers and more movies, honestly. There is no way of making a descent into madness character study without making the movie about him. ( unfortunately, a mistake in this case. Not because it was a bad idea, but because other characters mattered more here ) either make a tv show or a very good trilogy. They had time to either make a superb slasher or a compelling story, both would honestly be asking too much, i think.In conclusion : very good ideas, poor execution.I love Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael.The Mob scene against Michael was one of the best scenes of the franchise.The idea of a second killer or hell, even a cult of Michael was not even half bad if done right.The Laurie vs Michael last fight on Halloween Ends was super dope, i loved it.My final consideration is that they just need better writers, but to keep the people who had such iconic ideas, some heart is there, but it needed substance and more action.Btw the names : Halloween Kills and Ends are just honestly dope.

It's not the movie anyone wanted/expected/deserved, but I'd argue that it's still worth your time. The occassional lull in pacing aside, there's still plenty of psychological horror here to enjoy. Michael Myers is absent for most of the running time and Green focuses the narrative on new character, Corey Cunningham, who becomes the boogeyman of this particular story. Much like \"Halloween Kills\", \"Ends\" is about a community dealing with trauma. Rob Zombie did something similar with \"Halloween II\", but Green's film is more successful. Haddonfield is a town struggling to move on from the events/horrors experienced in 1978 and 2018, and we, the audience, are dealing with that too. What happens to us once there's no more killer to run from? Unlike \"Kills\", this latest entry is low on the brutal, relentless, bloody kills that slasher films are known for. Green drops the ball with the climactic showdown, the best part of which doesn't include Michael Myers at all, and although he misses an opportunity or two to thrill the audience, he sidesteps the obvious and presents us with a fresh and engaging entry in the long running franchise.",

It is a hard swerve into esotericism following the straight up, standard nature of Halloween Kills. It seems like the difference could have been split between these two final entries for more well-rounded experiences, but the disparate, almost contradictory progression manages to make Kills shine more in retrospect while offering a surprising, explosive finale to this Halloween trilogy.The obvious focal point of conversation is how much the attention is taken off of Michael Myers. In this way the film channels the spirit of Halloween III: Season of the Witch, an influence that is made clear in a comparison of their title card and credits. There is also a correlation to Christine - another John Carpenter project - assuring us that the movie is cognizant of its place in history and is wittingly making its controversial calls.It's difficult to sort through all of this to find what Halloween Ends is and how it stands on its own. Expectations or intentions aside, the fact is that Halloween Ends is engrossing, shocking, nerve-wracking, and surprisingly ponderous, with some memorable kills and great images of Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific once more and Andi Matichak and Rohan Campbell create some of the deepest characters in the franchise's history.Halloween Ends isn't afraid to polarize, in fact it strives for it in challenging what constitutes a Halloween movie. It is bound to disappoint many people in what it isn't but doesn't shy from carving a bold place in the legacy it inherited. This does certainly seem to be the end, as with this being such a departure in form, whatever comes next will almost certainly have to restart the clock.

No one on earth could have predicted such a random insert in the final installment. Despite this being a Halloween movie, Michael was barely in it. I believe around 10 minutes of screen time and when they ended with the town grinding him up, it felt like the movie was taking a metaphorical dump on the Michael Myers character. Replacing him with Corey at first was already an insult but celebrating his death with the whole town was the final nail.

            "content": "This entire trilogy seems to have been made by people who didn't pay any attention to the original Halloween. I think it can be summed up by two major mistakes.The first mistake. I really don't understand this whole 'we're going back to the original where Michael Myers was a mindless killing machine with absolutely zero motivation, because that's way scarier' line of thinking. You only have to watch the original Halloween once to note that Michael Myers was not some empty, thoughtless automaton. On the contrary, the character throughout shows consciousness, method, intent, playfulness and massive amounts of patience. He doesn't just kill whoever crosses his path. For the most part of that original Halloween he spends his time either at home, stealing a gravestone from a cemetery, breaking into a hardware store and/or driving around the neighbourhood, simultaneously avoiding detection whilst singling out his prey (a group of babysitters). He hides and watches from behind trees and bushes and toys with his victims. When he finally does get into gear, he does so in an extremely patient manner, often ignoring the first (and second) opportunity, waiting until he is good and ready to strike. He plays inexplicable little games (wearing the sheet and glasses, posing his victims etc) and, at the end, evades capture once more. That was the original Michael Myers, and that, to me at least, is what made the character so incredibly unnerving. Whatever it was that motivated him is a mystery, but there was definitely method to his madness.The second mistake. The original Halloween (1978) began as a very simple concept. John Carpenter and Debra Hill were given the task of creating a movie about a series of 'babysitter murders' set on Halloween. That was the depth of intellectualism involved. The execution (pun not intended) of the idea was sparse but brilliantly suspenseful and genuinely unsettling. With minimal backstory we were introduced to Michael Myers (aka the boogeyman), an escaped murderer who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to do away with a group of teenage babysitters. That's basically it. One of the reasons it worked so well is that it was originally intended to be a one off movie; the question asked-and somewhat answered-being: was Myers just a madman or something more supernatural (the actual boogeyman)? Halloween 2 (1981) worked well in my opinion because it was a continuation of the same night and it maintained that creep factor. Carpenter didn't like the film, considering it unnecessary, but it was still effective and Michael Myers didn't deviate from the patient, methodically creeping menace of the original. And whether or not you were a fan of the brother-sister angle, the mystery still remained (what is it with Michael and sisters?). It's being such a simple idea, from there on out it is no surprise that the rest of the sequels were going to struggle, and the more hokey-pokey nonsense of evil transference, possession, telepathy and pagan cults would emerge. A few years later and the once truly terrifying Michael Myers is taking orders from the Busta Rhymes and Corey Cunningham's of this world. In this latest instalment, he is depicted as a homeless old age pensioner who can barely defend himself against the town's resident wimp (the aforementioned Cunningham). He is finally defeated with haste by a granny, a microwave oven and a fridge. Seriously!The problem with the new trilogy is that it was sold as being something it wasn't. It wasn't a return to the original (at least not in a character sense). It discarded all the elements that made Michael Myers genuinely frightening. It removed the brother-sister angle, leaving Laurie Strode's inclusion in the trilogy nonsensical and pretty much redundant-she goes from ultra sensible, level-headed and resilient to an unhinged hermit living in a booby-trapped gun range (and this is a whole 4 decades after she had what was essentially a brief run-in with Myers, who, it must be noted, has been locked up safe and sound ever since. It may have been believable had they not ignored Halloween 2, but they did, so...). It depicted Michael Myers as just a normal man, an invincible, senseless force of nature who moves (with speed) from house to house killing everything in his path. To top it off, it also included the hokey-pokey mind-reading-evil-transference/transcendence rubbish. It was just a big dishonest mishmash of all the things that made most of the previous sequels so poor.If the franchise survives this and dares to return at some point in the future, it really needs to be handled by people who have actually watched and understood what made the original so eerily effective. It would also do well to pay more attention to John Carpenter's actual execution of the original idea and not what he might have said about it years after the fact. Finally, it needs to ditch all the phoney self-congratulatory intellectualising on the 'nature of evil' and the needless on-the-nose attempts at social commentary. It wasn't rocket science when John Carpenter did it back in 1978, and it isn't rocket science now.PS. I'm not saying that it's easy to write and/or create a decent movie, I'm saying that in this instance the basic ingredients were already there. When you say you're going to do something (go back to basics) you should actually mean it and at least try to stick to your word.",

The opening was good but the middle was like a slow thriller and at the ended it was more like a slasher. It feels like there has been to many writers giving different ideas.

If the movie had like 30 minutes more after like Corey's death in which there would've been more time for Michael, then it might have been better.At some point I looked at my watch and I was like.. Oh only 20 minutes left. Is there going to be a Halloween Ends Part 2? Because they can't fit the finale in there anymore. And yeah they couldn't at least not in a good way.

Halloween Kills was a complete disappointment then, showing us only splatter and gore and almost no story at all. The final chapter now is a satisfying conclusion for me. We get an interesting story change, an older Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis fighting with her trauma. She's much more present again than in the last one. Plus really great cinematography and sound. Even the gorehounds get something to see, although much less than before, which is good. The best Halloween of them all is the original from 1978 and had no gore at all.Love this and for all the gore kids who were expecting a slaughter fest - Halloween should've never been that.

I found the connection and storyline interesting.I do think there are several parts that are out of sync with what they've portrayed about Michael. Like how is a guy like Corey going to pretty easily overpower and take the mask of a man who has killed groups of armed people. Also, how is simply cutting Michael's wrist and throat going to put him down after everything he has lived through.However, I thought the ending to follow was meaningful and powerful (ie the processional with his body). I was also pleased to see him get killed in one of the very few ways that seem to be impossible to come back from (ground into pieces). If they had left his death with just the knife cuts from Laurie that would have been ridiculous due to prior movies, but I thought the grinder was perfect.Horror or not, I felt like after so many years of this they needed to give the people of that town Justice and closure, and they did.",

Did the Corey killer need to date granddaughter? The Corey concept was still unique and interesting to watch none the less could've been more realistic. I would've liked to see more Michael stalking with his classic killings, thats what we come for.

What does that mean, well if you've seen all the movies of Halloween in order. Yes I am talking about the 80's and 90's movies as well. Very interesting yet different side of Micheal Myers. Although 4 years have passed in this timeline. You see in the movie, how the people of Haddonfield are paranoid to the bone because of the horror he has caused over the last 44 years. A lot of origins play a factor in this film. Going back to the curse of Michael Myers's when he was born he was cursed by a cult to never die, and strike fear into peoples eyes. But also to change people, not just any person but somebody who understands what it feels like to be hated. He wanted to prove that he could turn anybody that had tragic in their past or maybe even was an outcast because of what they did. To the dark side. Yes I know some stars wars vibes here but this is exactly what comes off from the movie. He wants to teach somebody his ways, It's clear in this movie, that Michael is damaged and not the same. He's injured, old and weak. Especially in a lot of fight scenes, he can't keep up. When he was in his prime nothing would hurt him. He wants an apprentice to help him get to Laurie and sneak his way in and eventually replace him. It's a smart plan and I don't anybody saw this coming. It's a twist yes, but it makes sense that after all this time he's finally coming to an end. To take over his reign, but Laurie is more then aware and has seen it before.

But as something that was supposed to be the final chapter in the legacy of Michael Myers, I can see where all the hate comes from.I thought it was a good movie but not necessarily a good Halloween movie. It felt like they made an entire movie about Allison and Corey and then during the last 20 minutes they were like \"Oops, this was supposed to be the last movie in a trilogy. We should probably wrap up that whole storyline between Michael Myers and his sister.\"But my biggest issue wasn't even them shifting the focus onto a brand new character so late in the trilogy. What really bothered me was the total inconsistency with the direction of Laurie.Halloween (2018): Michael has been locked up for 40 years without even attempting an escape. Most reasonable people would assume that he's no longer a threat to the public. But Laurie is so paranoid about him coming back that she spends her entire adult life as a hardcore prepper/survivalist, training her body and mind for their eventual confrontation, becoming estranged from her family because he was unwilling or unable to give up her obsession, even going so far as to turn her house into a fortress/death trap for Michael.Halloween Ends: Michael has escaped and just went on a huge rampage. He is on the loose and presumably still hiding out in or around Haddonfield and still gunning for Laurie and her family.And NOW she wants try to live a normal life? What kind of sense does that make? It really threw me off.In the end I can appreciate them trying something different. They could have played it safe and made a movie that was 90 minutes of Michael Myers killing people followed by a final confrontation with Laurie before finally being vanquished for good. And that movie, while being predictable and boring, would almost certainly have gotten a better reception.Instead they took a swing. Some of it worked. A lot of it didn't. Overall it was a cool, entertaining movie but at the end of the day it doesn't fit into the Halloween franchise or even into this newest Halloween trilogy that it was supposed to be the culmination of.",

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of horror movies, but Michael Myers hasn't had a really good film since Halloween H2O, which now isn't even a part of the official canon because of this agenda-driven trilogy removing everything after the initial events. Everything since then, albeit not great, has at least been entertaining. This movie wasn't even that. They just keep getting worse and worse. I thought the Busta Rhymes \"Resurrection\" would be the worst of the bunch, but then we got Rob Zombie's redneck Mike, and now we get an ending to this trilogy that made absolutely no sense.Nobody in this movie acts normal at all. Michael was almost in this one less than he was in \"Season of the Witch.\" This movie revolves more around his new BFF killer friend and that friend's girlfriend, a.k.a. Laurie Strode's granddaughter. Apparently, Michael retired from killing four years ago and has been living the good life hidden down in a cave (sarcasm). Not sure how he's been getting nutrition, but I digress. Anyway, every time Mike's friend kills, Laurie's granddaughter gets turned on, which El apparently turns Laurie off, so she and \"Corey\" have at it in an EPIC fight (not really), after which Michael shows up and gets defeated in five seconds. This movie is one big-ass eye roll that should've never been made. I will pretend it wasn't and move on with my life now.The only good thing about this whole debacle is that I watched it for free on Peacock, so at least I didn't have to shell out cash to watch this train wreck.",

Corey took up most of the time of the movie. Does that cheapen this entry somehow? Not in this reviewer's eyes.Yes, the introduction of Corey seemed untimely as the end of one of horror's most icons loomed near. However, Corey just showed us the true curse of Michael Myers. The fear that is instilled in others as murderous rage is unleashed and is evident as it was in the eyes of young Corey.Michael wasn't front and centre as many thought he should be as his swan song was about to be played, however, the character of Corey served to amp up the awareness of Laurie and prepare her for what would be the ultimate showdown between her and her boogeyman.The studio indeed botched it when they made the infamous slip up in the trailer that was introduced to the waiting and hungry crowd after the whetting of our appetites in Halloween Kills. Instantly the comparison between this movie and Friday the 13th Part 5 ensued. However, this movie made no bones about who was doing what in this movie. As I stated earlier, the character of Corey was well used in this movie.In closing I would love to ask, did Laurie rid of herself of her boogeyman? Will she decide to stop inviting evil inside? Have a look and draw your own conclusions. I loved it. This Halloween killed and it ends nicely!",

Which this movie does a lot more than other recent horror movies as of late.Amazing kill scenes, tons of suspense and creepy-ness. An interesting plot and original take on the series rather than just the same old \"guy killing teenagers\".However, it was a pretty slow movie (which I am sure is also why there are a lot of bad reviews, people wanting Myers just slaughtering everyone like a snuff film the whole movie) , it did have a couple jump scares (but just a couple), and a couple moments where your like \"really...did they just say that...?\".But like I said it felt like an original take on the series that paid off with tons of suspense and horror. Just look at the lack of music in it when watching it, it really did create a mood or lack of one but in a good way.Although many fans just wanted a blood bath, I was happy with the suspenseful horror presented here.... Leave the unrealistic slaughter body count horrors to the freddys and jasons.So I'd give this film more of a 8/10But then again if you look at any good horror movie its usually a 5-6/10 on here.

            "content": "After the ridiculousness of Halloween Kills, I thought the writers and directors would have eaten some serious slices of humble pie, in a bid to go out with a bang, and end the series on a high.However, sadly this is not the case here. Yes this film is not as cringe inducing as it's predecessor; thankfully we are spared Tommy Doyle and his \"EVIL DIES TONIGHT\" crap, which was milked to death in the last hot mess. But, this time we are subjected to Laurie/Carrie Bradshaw's memoirs and her rather reductive narration on the presence of evil (yawn), which upon reflection could symbolise the problem with this particular instalment of the franchise.For me, this incessant reference to Michael being the personification of evil, and the not so subtle subtext throughout these last three films, only further reaffirms John Carpenter's initial decline to want to do a sequel after the original. Carpenter didn't want to make Halloween 2, as he felt the source material had gone as far as it could, which is why he added the storyline of Laurie being Michael's sister in part 2. And boy was he right! At least with the original sequels (which this series arrogantly poo-pooed) they didn't pretend to be anything other than what they were - simple slashers of their time and fun to watch. However, this trilogy thinks far to highly of its self at times and in doing so has sidelined what people love about the first film: Michael Myers stalking and killing with a heavy dose of suspense to keep us going. This film fails on all accounts.I appreciate with what they tried to do with the character of Corey and this story line. Maybe the writers did begin to realise that there wasn't as much as steam in this franchise or as much depth to this story as they initially thought. Sadly though, the film loses focus on what people are there for and 40 minutes in you're still watching some new character and not much else is happening and you begin to forget what film you're meant to be watching, and why you paid money to see a Halloween movie - that doesn't feel anything like a Halloween movie, or worse still like Halloween.There were also other pointless elements, like Lindsey being brought back for basically nothing except some cheap basic foreshadowing with a pack of tarot cards. Also, what was with the the local radio DJ? This felt cheap and was done in Candyman 2 and other films (of the 90s). Secondly, who the hell is listening to local talk radio, under the age of 60??! Tommy Doyle is also never mentioned (though I m not shedding any tears over that).You can tell the writers and the directors are fans of the original and they are trying to show love for it, but by the end I was very happy to see Michael get chewed up like a tin can, I was just hoping he was going to reach out one last time and take the whole town in with him. For me, the film could have been better if it hadn't been so boring and so when the end credits came up with Halloween Ends, I did think thank god!After the recent, heartbreakingly bad Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, and the reception that received then maybe Hollywood will leave our beloved monsters resting in peace, and give way to birthing some new ones for us to nurture. That said, David Gordon Green has gone and got his hands on the Exorcist Franchise, so one can only hope that he is reading the scratching comments from fans and taking heed.",

And for a split moment I thought it was actually going to half ass decent! But then the next 30 mins or so seemed like and hour! It got so boring. That's really where I lost interest, and lost it fast.It was cheap. And the writers of this movie did a awful job at scripting the entire thing. This movie gave me total low budget horror movie film vibes, The hack em up slash em up affect was definitely amusing!!!! Like could we have used our imagination anymore on different ways for Corey and Michael to kill people?! And you never saw them luring or hiding and watching the characters before they killed them. Maybe there was some parts like that! But it seemed like it was just jump to a scene of either Corey or Michael killing someone. Like caught right there in the act!!!! Weird!!!I will say this, watching Jamie lee finally taking his mask off, was like a moment I had always waited for!!!!

Long story short it advised 4 will do - Halloween (1978 original), Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends.Have now seen all four and have enjoyed them. As some people have said this is more a pop corn movie than a true \"slasher\" - I find a true sentiment of a good horror movie is one that makes you jump in the first 5 mins, and that sets the tone of the entire film going on. THIS wasn't that. The only horror movies that have REALLY made me JUMP were IT (original, and in certain parts the \"remake\"), Nightmare on elm street (but I was very young - teens- when I saw that {maybe now I won't find it so much, but just can't get myself to see it!!}. Maybe if they remade it (aka IT) that would make me??).Anyway, don't want to give too much away on this one. The one thing I did take (more my view than maybe movies intention) was that anyone could be Michael Myers ( thinking Batman) if the cards/events fall in the right order. As someone stated in their review, this should have been called \"Corey's Halloween\". This guy sees/meets the monster, looks into his eyes, and, as he says to Laurie in the film, if you had just lost yourself in him, how things could have been different.Very clever take on the whole franchise, if a bit convoluted.",

The movie was going great until Corey started seeing Mike Myers and going through some weird transformation of going into this villain role, due to seeing Mike.Corey's role would've been better if they had made a totally new villain out of him & made this a separate movie about a guy getting revenge on his bullies.Mike Myers was barely in the final Halloween Movie and then they had Corey all of a sudden develop into this Mike Myers wannabe.

This is not what you get with Halloween Ends.Michael Myers is THE rockstar, the whole Laurie Strode victim hood/curse/crusade arc should have ended in the 2019 film or, maybe in Halloween Kills; in this one, it feels like a stretch. Michael Myers has no purpose besides being a punchline to a lecture on the nature of evil that was sprayed so thickly, it was borderline insulting. While I like what they tried to do and say, the Halloween universe is the wrong place to do so; what's next, reboot Friday the 13th as a family tragedy.Please click UNDO or go re-watch the 1978 original, David Gordon Green's Halloween films are a six-hour reboot trying to mansplain Evil with CAPS locked.

It's like so many were expecting to feel the same scares they did with the first one, watching as a kid/teenager, but at the same time forgetting that the story had to evolve. For a massive horror franchise that spanned decades, this was on par with the story and definitely worth the watch. I thought Halloween Ends was a great finale, and am glad I watched it.",

Halloween Ends answers that question, definitively.I feel like many negative reviewers of this film may have failed to understand Carpenter's new Michael storyline. This timeline is more thought-provoking rather than a slasher, with Ends being the most psychological of them all. Many viewers got lost in the slaughter-fest of Kills and missed the purpose.Evil comes in many forms. This movie does a great job of highlighting how, given the circumstances, we all have the potential to show our own evil... even when we're doing, what we feel, is necessary.",

I was practically asleep and would have rather stuck my nose in a trash compactor. I definitely liked the first 2 movies in this trilogy better, especially the 2018 Halloween. But in Ends, We had almost no kills from The Shape himself. How is that possible in a Halloween movie? I don't get it. The writers gave a god awful script with incoherent everything. Not to mention the music in general was also bad, except for the Halloween theme. This will be the only time I ever watch this . I want my hour and 50 minutes back. 2/10.

Many issues to tackle there - being wrongly blamed by an entire town and media, the bullying, creepy family life with the mother, trying to move on in your life and redeem one's self....all had me very interested. There was actually a compelling and dare I say, original movie in there, and if they just stuck with that and ignored the whole Michael Myers thing and focused on Corey becoming a killer because of circumstances, they really had something there. And I'm saying that LOVING Michael Myers!!!! That's what made this so frustrating....you have a very good movie going, and it had me liking and rooting for the guy who was becoming a killer (almost in a Dexter kind of way), then they kind of lazily tie in Michael Myers toward the end, and unwind all the good and interesting things that they spend the first hour plus setting up,Anyway, still some satisfying and great kills, and I know I jumped out of my seat a few times.

            "content": "...unpopular opinion though it may be, I have to give them credit for trying something new. In need of a new catastrophe to chew in a year after the last two movies, Haddonfield turns against Corey Cunningham, a hardworking model college student who accidentally kills a kid he was babysitting (by busting open the door of the room the kid locked him I'd add.) Corey is ostracized by the town, which sends him down a dark pathway to insanity and violence. In walks, you guessed it, Laurie Strode and her entourage. He becomes involved with her granddaughter Allyson, who is also down a similar dark path due to being fed up with the tragicrafting antics of Haddonfield and her grandmother. Laurie initially takes to Corey, even going so far as introducing him to Allyson, but soon pulls a Dr. Loomis and realizes that behind Corey's dark cold eyes lurks something that is purely... evil.You actually get pretty sucked in to the predicaments of the characters. You feel for Corey, being declared persona non grata for something that was definitely horrible, but absolutely an accident. You feel for Allyson trying to move forward with her life and career but being passed over for promotions by the irritating, undeserving co-worker who is actually sleeping with the boss. There are even moments when you feel for Laurie Strode, watching Corey's gradual descent into madness, and knowing what she is seeing but failing to make her angsty, fed-up granddaughter believe her. These are the most interesting aspects of the film. Then Michael Myers shows up.While it is not the ending the Halloween reboot trilogy deserved, it's a big improvement from \"Halloween Kills\", and even some of the other sequels as well. The 2018 \"Halloween\" explores themes of generational trauma, moral ambiguity, paranoia, spectacle, to name a few. \"Kills\" attempts to explore mob mentality but fails due to its overabundance of exposition and the lack of sympathetic characters. More in line with the existential themes of the first one, \"Ends\" explores themes of how evil is created, and how good people can be nurtured to BECOME evil. That's mostly good stuff, but it definitely loses steam when Michael Myers shows up. You expect him and Corey to form an alliance and terrorize Haddonfield. While this is how it ultimately begins, their \"partnership\" kinda falls apart, making the final showdown between Michael Myers and Laurie feel more tacked on than epic. The best showdown will always be the end of H20, where she literally slices his head off with an axe. Instead here she drops a fridge on him, slits his wrists and chucks him in a compactor. Whatever works, amirite?Not the ending the trilogy deserved, but not the horrible piece of garbage most make it out to be. Many may be disappointed by the lack of Michael Myers (he only shows up periodically and in the last 15 minutes), but others will likely find the new premise intriguing in spite of the highly schlocky execution, and commend the filmmakers on trying something new.",

I think the idea of an aging serial killer \"mentoring\" an outcast who is in a relationship with the daughter of one of his victims sounds like an amazing concept and it felt pretty compelling at times.

Laurie Strode is much more balanced, steady and focused in her day-to-day life (and she's writing about her experiences). Michael Myers has not been in sight during all this time. Much of the film (including the bewildering prologue) centers on a new character, Corey, who has an unfortunate babysitting experience which leads him to be ostracized by most of the local townies. He also has a run-in with some awful shape from the distant past.Much of this film is exciting and will have you waiting for a) some deeper explanation for Michael Myers and his reanimating powers, b) a showdown between Laurie Strode and Michael, and c) Michael's mask to be removed: suffice to say, you may be satisfied with two of the three above expectations but disappointed by the ambiguity, yet the film ends with a powerful, bloody climax and some relief for a certain character who has been put through the wringer in life. Also, we learn a bit more about Michael's abilities, including a new one which was the most interesting revelation of the film.If you were at all pleased or disappointed with Halloween Kills, by all means get to the theater to see this last Halloween chapter.",

The fact that there is none is what makes Carpenters movie so brillant (besides the camera, the soundtrack etc). Speaking of camera. Gordon Greene is not able to pull of one good frame. The ones that are good are homages to Carpenters work. The writing is not bad but there are some embarressing scenes. The movie feels like: we need to make a third one but no clue how so we just theorize about evil. But still... it is a solid movie which brings smth that hasnt been there in the franchise.

Negatives: The biggest negative is spoiler alert this movie gets to a point where the twist is just like friday the 13th part 5: A new beginning, what i mean by that is the male lead by the name of cory who accidentally kills someone in the opening scene then runs into micheal myers looks into his eyes and becomes a homicidal maniac just like micheal and takes his mask and starts killing people he hates just like the mental patient in friday the 13th part 5 he is just a pretender killer. And the one other negative is that too much of the story is spent on Alison and cory and not enough on micheal and laurie which is the whole reason me and everybody else in the world watch these films to see what happens between the two people that have been after each other for almost 50 years. But in the end while halloween ends is better than halloween kills and has a better beginning and ending some of the twists and turns in the film leave a lot to be desired!",

Just that people get mad over the lack of the actual \"Myers\" character. Yes, the actual character of Michael Myers is less in this film. Does it make it a bad movie? No!*Spoilers*I love the idea of \"Corey Cunningham\". Sure, it comes from Stephen King and John Carpenters \"Christine\" but it works in this. \"Christine\" is a coming up remake film from the same producers btw. Do I miss Michael Myers. Sure I do. But fear not, he's there in person. But we also follow \"the Strouds\". The atmosphere is there. The scary moments is not. It has many kills but it's not scary, yet cool. And I appreciate the different approach. If you just overlook the actual M. Myers lurking in the shadows it's a pretty good movie. If there had been Mike doing his normal stuff it would have been the ol' stuff all over again. And then it would have gotten bad reviews from that. I like this movie. And again, M.

I watched the trailers, expected a massive bang, and did not feel the full bang.Issues:\nthey made Laurie too much of a grandma. She's too cool to be wearing granny sweaters and be too civilized.I get unmasking Michael because you want to see the human part of him, but seeing his face ruins the illusion of Michael being unkillable. You don't completely see his face, but you kinda do when they grind his body in the car crusher machine. It tales away the evil aesthetic, but I still get seeing his partial face right before grinding his body.I was glad they ended the movie with Michael being crushed by the car crusher machine because if he was to be lit on fire one more time, or stabbed a bunch of times and then left alone thinking he's officially dead, I was gonna scream.I found it strange that Michael was hiding out in the tunnels/sewer system. Also, none of the previous movies ever explained where Michael would go into hiding after each movie, but would come back to Haddonfield for Halloween. But in this movie, I jus found it strange that he was hiding in the sewers because we're not sure how Michael operates. We wouldn't consider him a normal human because he's a killer that can't die, so how does he look at survival and where to go to sleep if he sleeps. We don't even know if Michael eats food, so a lot of questions that don't have answers.BIGGEST ISSUE: Does anyone remember Hunger Games Pt 2? When Coin was made the villain and then axed off President Snow? Corey \"taking over\" for Michael was the EXACT SAME idea. It's annoying because it looks as if the previous villain is boring and continuing the evil through another conduit is more fun. It's not more fun, it's extremely annoying. It feels like people copying each other instead of finding new and exciting ideas. I was glad that Corey got killed off because the new villain idea was bothering me 1M%.This series started in 1978, which has a bunch of movies in the series, a bunch of fun chasing Michael through the masses wondering where the end will be, but it was good. I was wanting more of a riot kind of aesthetic in the movie because they had done it in the last Halloween movie, but they didn't band together until the end of the movie.Another question is that why did Laurie and Allison stay in Haddonfield? Because of all that they went through, they both should've left instead of just Allison, but it makes sense because they hinted at Laurie and Frank getting together.The whole entire movie was not horrible, but like I mentioned before, I hate the idea of making a new villain in a long growing anticipation for the main villain to be killed off. Michael is the ultimate villain you want to be killed off, so for them to bring in a new villain to conquer to me makes no sense and is very annoying.Honestly, I'm glad I watched the movie on Peacock because if I were to pay money for this movie, I'd be disappointed. Yes I am paying Peacock for the subscription, but the subscription is for more than that.As much as I'd want to say this Halloween movie was a good one, it does deserve a 5/10 because of the deaths of characters, the blood/gore, and the final death of Michael. The whole Corey character (lame additional villain) was annoying and didn't make sense in the movie, and the whole event of flashbacks throughout all the movies were kinda lame.Don't think I'll watch again honestly. I'm glad though that I saw it to say that I've seen it, but even giving it a 5/10 is me being nice. It almost deserves a 4/10 though.I would rather watch the other Halloween movies and have a good time versus watching this one, so I'll just watch other shows/movies on Peacock besides this movie.

No one was watching this for any other reason, except to see what happens to Michael and Laurie and while that is a pretty big part of the movie, it seems to be just as much, if not even more about the new characters.I actually think the Corey story would of probably made for a pretty good movie in and of itself but it really didn't fit with the original story very well at all. Luckily, the final battle between Laurie and Michael was at least pretty decent but it doesn't make up for the disjointed mess this movie was.I was entertained for the most part because most of the time I didn't know what was going to happen. Usually that's a good thing, but for this not so much. I also felt like the kills and the action was pretty tame overall.

Laurie tries to give the kid an intervention, but he refuses because he blames Laurie for starting all this crazy love, murder, and lies. Then Corey goes back to Michael (who lives in a sewer tunnel) and trains with him to learn his ways. I know right?! Makes no sense, thats what you will watch. How could they allow this crap to be released?! Whomever gave the green light to this trash of a movie needs to be fired! Thank god I didn't pay for this, just watched on Prime.",

The script gives your mind several rabbit holes to run down as you try to figure out how Halloween Ends. Some have said it's unrealistic to see some of the things that happened in this movie. Does anyone think Michael Myers still being alive after all that's happened to him is believable? Of course not.

I found the flash backs tiresome, the characters annoying, and it's gratuitous call backs to the original nauseating.Halloween Ends took all expectations and threw them aside. They created a new story. Honestly, for the first time in a long time while watching a Halloween movie, I found myself unsure of where the story would go. It seemed like a less committee-approved plot than the previous two pictures. If I may be so bold, it's almost as if the writers were given the opportunity to be inventive and original, as opposed to just checking off boxes on a list of what to include to please fans.I'm no psychologist, but If I had to guess, I'd say most of the outrage about this movie is based less on how ridiculous it very well may be, and more on those two factors: lack of safe nostalgia and originality.The people want what they know they like, but maybe that's not what they need.I gave this movie a higher rating than it might deserve in an attempt to offset the hyperbole.",

The babysitter reminded me of Michael from the lost boys, succumbing to his dark side as it progressed. The unity he then had with 'the shape', then had flickers of alien versus predator. And the ending... well if you enjoy Dexter and the Saw movies you'll love that.I feel a love - hate with this movie. I'm glad he's finally gone, but shaking my head that he didn't go long before this. Laurie Strode's fortress was the best opportunity.

Michael should have been more involved, and Michael should have died along with Laurie. With the main characters dead, we would find that Corey survives getting shot, and Laurie's daughter to find the bodies, and a wounded Corey dawning the Myers mask and disappear. Therefore, creating a full circle, and basically have a fresh Halloween start on the new age. Even the killing scenes were subpar at best.

            "content": "David Gordon Green's Halloween Ends is the final chapter of the retconned Michael Myers saga, and unlike the previous two installments, in which the story took place during one night, Halloween Ends starts off four years after the events that occurred in Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills.David Gordon Green definitely deserves props for bringing something new into this sequel. The film certainly goes towards a different direction than what one might expect, and it presents a new character and some interesting ideas that had the possibility to evolve into something unprecedented and fresh.The introduction of Corey Cunningham and the way his character arc is set up is absolutely refreshing, at least during the first two acts. Allyson, the granddaughter of Laurie Strode, who was sidelined during the majority of the first two films, also has an interesting character arc in this installment. The residents of Haddonfield seem to be more humane, and the film truly explores how trauma, followed by a brutal massacre, can fracture a little town, which was an interesting aspect we had never fully seen in a Halloween movie, or not since Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, at least. The relationship between Allyson and Laurie is explored better, and the chemistry between the two is excellent.However, everything that is mentioned above was never fully explored and materialized because of the film's messy screenplay. The film is about 110 minutes long, and Michael only appears 10% of the entire runtime. Compared to the three films in the retconned saga, Halloween Ends is the one that has least body count, gore and scares because The Shape was sidelined during almost the whole movie. Michael is also weak and fragile in this sequel, which makes it ill-favored for fans who expect Michael to go head to head with Laurie in a merciless, brutal and epic fight. Legacy character, Lindsey Wallace, who returned in Halloween Kills after forty years, also had very little screen time in Halloween Ends, which I found to be extremely frustrating.Since the previous two films took place during one night, the four-year-time-jump in this chapter, affects the film in a bad way, in terms with the creative choices, atmosphere, tone and storytelling-style. It surely feels like David Gordon Green directed Halloween 2018 and Kills, while someone else directed Ends. The pacing is, without a doubt, a major issue. The film progresses very slowly, as it struggles to keep the audience on the edge of their seats because of Michael's absence.The performances and dialogues have improved, and are more genuine in Halloween Ends. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Andy Matichak, who played Laurie and Allyson, have given powerhouse performances. James Jude Courtney still holds up as the best Michael Myers since Nick Castle, even though Green made him portray a weak Myers in this installment. Rohan Campbell, who portrayed Corey Cunningham has also delivered a stellar performance, while Will Patton and Kylie Richards have also given decent performances in the little screen time that was given to them.Apart from everything that is mentioned above, this is a gorgeous film to look at. Michael Simmonds' cinematography is magnificent. Every frame just look so poetic. The score by John and Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies, on the other hand, is absolutely fantastic and powerful that it keeps the film a little more engaging.Despite having low expectations after its messy and controversial predecessor \"Halloween Kills\", this concluding installment is yet another disappointment for the long running Halloween saga predominately because of the lack of scares, poor creative choices and the amount of absences from Michael Myers.",

            "content": "I totally get the disappointment die-hard Michael Myers fans feel toward this \"last\" installment. I've been one of those die-hard fans since I was 8 years old, watching the original classic in the movie theater... many many times.To me, none of the sequels, reboots or remakes have come close to the original. But I've really enjoyed some of them (The Return of Michael Myers, H20) and really disliked some (The Revenge of Michael Myers, Resurrection, and don't get me started on Rob Zombie's). I also never loved the whole \"brother/sister\" storyline that was introduced in Halloween II. So when I heard they were ignoring every sequel (including the beloved Halloween II and brother/sister storyline), I thought it was a very bold move... and had high expectations for this new trilogy.Aside from the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and a few other original characters, a big budget, some good kills and nostalgic flashbacks, I (like many others) found these new installments lacking. So I guess I had low expectations when I went to the premiere of Halloween Ends.When Michael didn't show up in the opening, I knew I was in for something different this time... and I wasn't wrong. Then I was distracted by thinking when and where is Michael going to show up? When he finally did, I understood what the filmmakers were going for... then I decided to just go along for the ride. Once I took this mindset, I got invested in the characters (yes, Corey too... who gives one of the strongest performances in all of the Halloween movies).One of the challenges of satisfying audiences with a Halloween movie these days is that we've had Michael Myers overkill. We've seen him kill and tilt his head hundreds of times. Well, the filmmakers gave us something different... and possibly the strongest character since Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis. If the beloved Paul Rudd had returned to play Tommy and was the main focus of the movie (over Michael Myers), I think audiences would've embraced it more.But Rohan Campbell delivers with his performance... and it's fascinating to see his character transition from a pathetic soul to a soulless psycho killer. His relationships to Allyson, Laurie and especially Michael allow each of these characters to be much more interesting than they were in the last 2 installments. Allyson finally became a three dimensional character. He made Michael a believable wounded monster that needed to be rescued and resurrected. And he helped make Jamie Lee Curtis become probably the most believable Laurie Strode since the original. These characters finally had depth and purpose.When I watched the movie a second time, it allowed be to accept and appreciate the strange route the filmmakers decided to go with this \"last\" installment. I started seeing it as its own thing... a solid horror/thriller with interesting characters and story arcs... rather than just another Halloween/Michael Myers sequel. Don't get me wrong. Michael Myers will always be the greatest movie horror villain of all time... and this movie will not change that.Was this movie the best way to end his or Laurie Strode's story? Probably not. But in the Halloween movie universe... I think it's one of the strongest films in the bunch.Still, every Halloween night I watch the original classic... and none of the sequels, remakes or reboots exist. When Dr. Loomis looks down from the balcony to discover that Michael Myers (The Shape, The Boogeyman) is gone... this is when Halloween Ends.",

He is no Michael Myers. His story is not interesting and seems more to be a pity party. I'm sure that he was supposed to act as Laurie's foil but he was unnecessary.

It's certainly not the worst one, but leaves a lot to be desired.This film assumes you're *really* interested in Corey's backstory and character arc (a character who is only introduced in this film and who we've never heard of before). Corey is blamed for a freak accident that results in the death of a child, which leads to him being an outcast in Haddonfield. 45 minutes into the film, Michael Myers finally shows up (it took so long that I was beginning to wonder if I was in the wrong theatre) and teams up with Corey to go on a killing spree. I was almost surprised they didn't go for drinks afterwards. Later, Corey decides he's ready for a solo career as a serial killer, beats Michael up, and takes his mask. Seriously? A Halloween movie where Michael Myers needs a sidekick to kill and is overpowered by an angry teenager. This is the guy who single-handedly killed an entire armed mob in the last movie?While we're discussing Halloween Kills (2021), props to the Haddonfield police department for apparently not bothering to check the sewers during their search for a guy who murdered 20+ people in the last film.I'll give them some credit for the ending, which sees Michael definitively killed, wrapping up the saga. After the last movie, I was expecting them to continue the nonsensical trend of making him invincible to the point where numerous gunshots, stabbings, and blunt force trauma wounds aren't enough to kill him.This was supposed to be a Halloween movie. Michael is barely in it, there's very few kills (compared to Halloween Kills and the 2018 reboot), most of the murders are just Corey dressed as Michael, it feels like a soap opera with two \"edgy\" teenagers trying navigate their lives and relationship, a few weak jump scares, and Michael sparing Corey's life and joining forces with him. It doesn't feel like a Halloween film, and it's a shame that this is how they concluded an otherwise entertaining new trilogy. Finally, the movie is nothing like the trailers suggested. The trailers pitch this as some sort of \"ultimate showdown\" between Laurie and Michael. The closest we get to that is a 5 minute scene at the end of the movie. It's shamefully misleading marketing from executives who realized that nobody would watch this if they portrayed the storyline accurately in the promotional materials.*sigh* I guess we just have to wait a few more years for the next reboot, maybe they'll get it right eventually.",

Even though I have my issues with the two previous films of this trilogy this film takes the cake not only worst in Blumhouse trilogy but worst Halloween sequel ever. This film is even worse than Halloween resurrection if possible. Now with that being said I was initially intrigued with the way Halloween ends started out, it was a surprising and shocking opening scene. But it was all downhill from there. With the lack of time Michael Myers actually spends on the screen and the fact that he is like an empty shell as compared to the two previous films. What happened to the Michael Myers that was theoretically transcending into something stronger and more sinister the more he killed? Not in this film.They introduce a brand new character that was never even mentioned in the two previous films and to take Michael Myers place was not only confusing but just poor writing. Not to mention Laurie strode being so happy go lucky throughout most of the film even though her daughter was butchered four years ago by Michael and he is clearly still out there is an epic fail for the character and her story. This film is so out in left field one could've actually considered this to be a standalone film, it certainly would've made more sense if that was the case. The bottom line is I can see why people are literally signing a petition to make them re-do this film, we sadly know it will never happen but I completely understand it. Thank God there are films like Smile that are coming out to give some hope to this genre, because this film was not only an insult to Halloween fans but to horror fans all together.",

The last film, Halloween Kills, was violently over the top for a Halloween film, so expectations were that Halloween Ends would have to set the bar higher.Instead it went in a whole 'nother direction, sidelining Michael Myers for a different serial killer within the first two acts and a somber story chronicling the aftermath of the 2018 Haddonfield Massacre.The secondary characters (and designated victims) are meaner and crueler than they have any right to be, like they are in a Child's Play film, and the newly introduced tritagonist we are supposed to invest in, Corey, a babysitter who accidentally killed his charge and suffers mentally, emotionally, and physically for it, becomes The Shape's new apprentice.You feel for the young man's plight and his plunge into darkness. But this kind of character development belongs in an origin story (Preferably Michael Myers? Although we had the Rob Zombie movies.) and not the tail end of a trilogy or quadrilogy where the main threat of this timeline still looms and needs to be dealt with.I don't mind the Corey storyline. But it feels like something that has been done before, and it drags the Michael Myers and Laurie Strode story arc down. Yeah, Halloween Ends wasn't the best ending to a franchise, and it delivers the standard slasher killer count, but at least it ended this particular story after 40 years of retcons and remakes.It could have been better. It could have been worse. All I know is that it feels inconsistent. But at least it's over for now.",

As a Halloween fan I wanted to see more of an homage to the original with him stalking and attempting to kill Laurie. Instead we got a story about Laurie's daughter and her new boyfriend with Michael Myers Cameos that are few and far between. The last scene I'm the kitchen with Michael and Laurie was Good but SUPER short and underwhelming. Over all the movie was very entertaining and genuinely creepy but if you're a true Halloween fan you'll leave feeling disappointed and honestly kinda sad that it's over and that's how it ends.I'd give the movie a 7/10 as a movie but a 6/10 as a Halloween movie.

But Michael is the pure definition of Evil in Halloween. So he tries to teach and protect and help Cory and get to understand the similarities between the two. Except the whole time it was Evil vs. Laurie. And having Laurie know what to do in every situation since Halloween 2018 and have Michaels character have perfect sense throughout 2018 to Halloween ends makes it so good.Watch the movie with an open mind about the relationship of Michael and His Evil to Laurie and her relationship with that Evil, it adds up so well and is easily 10/10.Lastly- Corey is a kid who was looked as a murderer and everyone hated, same as Michael. Michael wanted to kill Laurie and had built up hatred as such she has well, same as Corey and Laurie's granddaughter. So if you think about it every detail from Halloween Ends has such a great way of showing how everything adds up in the end, from Michael killing his sister in 1978 to Laurie after 44 years Kills him to end the series!",

I'd like to see a directors cut of this full franchise (4 movies) that's in chronological order (similar to what they did with The Godfather. And no, I'm not saying the franchises are comparable!). I'd remove the horrible \"Evil dies tonight\" mob chants from Halloween Kills (I'd remove much of the second half of Halloween Kills), and maybe add some cut scenes from the last 3 movies (it would be nice to get a bit more Michael in the last film). I think there's an absolute killer of a series that could be cut from the OG Halloween, along with the last 3. I'm hoping we see it in the future. I'm grateful we've had this new trilogy.

I give credit to the writers and director for actually trying something a little different, whilst keeping the final act as something they promised in the trailers and interviews - a face off between Laurie Strode and MM. The opening scene was excellent and together with the opening credits, set the film up really nicely. The introduction of a new main character was well done and although the romance with Allyson felt rushed, I still felt that both characters were well written and believable - when was the last time you said that about a Halloween movie? There are some effective jump scares, and at least one true gore moment, but unlike Kills, Ends doesn't go overboard with the carnage.It's not perfect, and it falls short of H2O in terms of that final scene, but it took risks and for that reason it's probably one of the few Halloween movies I'll go back to for another viewing.A final point, the trailers for all 3 of the Hallogreen movies have deliberately spoiled many of the shocks and surprises - I could understand it a little with Halloween (2018) as it was aimed at both fans of the series, but also newcomers so I suppose you had to flag up the violence and threat. Both Kills and Ends didn't need the same level of spoilers - is there a single random death not flagged up in these films trailers? I suppose this is the movie business today.",

He even has a fight with Michael which he wins, I mean come on.Halloween films is traditionally Michael trying to kill his sister and other family members and then a bunch of random people, but in this film he kills 3 people in total, either writers had lost their imagination or Michael was having a very bad day.If I could unsee this movie then I would.

Yes, it's a weird turn after the first two movies of the trilogy. And yes, the end hurts. BUT: From my point of view, this movie would have been a great one if it were a standalone Halloween movie! Probably the best addition to the franchise since H20. And that's why I'm not a huge fan of trilogies and of remaking/retelling everything. Seems like an unpopular opinion here, but I had fun watching this movie. A lot of my friends as well as my girlfriend were also positively surprised about Halloween Ends. The film is relatively progressive and I love the fact that it is not a slasher party from beginning to end. Also, the great intro including the blue title (yes, blue instead of orange) already gives you a little hint that this movie might be different. I also really dig some of the \"weird\" ideas. They just went a bit too far. Halloween 4, 5 and especially 6 also contained new ideas. I grew up with Halloween 4, 5, 6 and I like all of them. I even prefer them over Halloween 2 (while the first one from 1978 remains unbeatable). As an open-minded person, I'm open for new ideas and twists within a movie franchise. But tastes are different and I truly believe that those who dislike Halloween 4, 5, 6 (and maybe also 8, The Resurrection), will most likely dislike Halloween Ends as well.+ film score and soundtrack\n+ the first two thirds of the movie are great\n+ the movie is relatively progressive\n+ Laurie Strode is more vulnerable (less Rambo)\n+ some nice throwbacks, easter eggs and references (Corey standing by the hedge for example)\n+ scenes and camera settings that remind on earlier Halloween movies\n+ strong 80s vibes & aesthetics\nthe change/twist in this trilogy is too muchlack of depththe end hurtsthe original theme soundtrack rarely appearsthe small town feeling which a lot of the fans including me like so much was a bit missing hereAll in all a good Halloween movie. As part of the trilogy, I'd rate it 6/10, but I handle and view this one as a standalone movie. And as a standalone movie, Halloween Ends deserves a 7/10.Again, I totally understand and respect other views and other opinions. Some wrote great reviews with good points. I just disagree with a 1/10 rate. This is too low. My gf and I discussed this movie for about an hour and we both came to the conclusion that this is a pretty good addition to the franchise. We can't change the fact that we were positively surprised (maybe because we heard about the decent reviews before we went to the cinema).

The ending was just as bad, would have made more sense if Laurie jumped into the meat grinder with him, since he always comes back for her.",

Huh?Then, when Dr. Mathis and nurse Deb were killed, how the hell did Corey get Michael Myers to the Doc's house? Did Michael hitch a ride on the back of Corey's piece of crap 120cc Kawasaki?

First 10-15 minutes was good then after that it got pretty slow for about half way or a little bit over half way into the movie. Then the movie picks back up again. One of the problems I did have was that Laurie practically wasn't the main character at all it was a character name Corey who gets possessed by Michael . Laurie finally becomes the main character again towards the final act. Which was one of the problems I had. Laurie is the main character in the Halloween franchise, she should have been the main focus. But other than that the movie was still pretty good for what it was in my opinion. The ending for sure was the best part. It was very satisfying and had a great goodbye to the character Laurie Strode. I do think the final battle could have been a bit more fleshed out/ longer but that's just me. Overall I would rate it a 6.5 out of 10. Definitely better than Kills, but no where near as good compared to Halloween 2018.",

Michael, after all these films being strong and indestructible is now weak and useless? What was he doing in a sewer for 4 years? Why did Laurie become a motherly figure and live in the town it all happened in. Why did we have to wait 45 minutes to get into an actual Halloween movie.

This is a very well thought out end to a franchise.It focusses mainly on the grief and its own effects on Haddonfield. This is actually quite powerful and so much more effective than Michael Myers (just another franchise slasher) and his slashings from other sequels.Acting is great all round. Script is great.

My take on this film is that they were trying to portray that Michael is losing his power and looking to pass it on. So that is the reason he wasn't as prominent in the movie. Is anyone really that surprised? If this is the end of Michael Myers truly, are they not going to try to reincarnate his evil? After all, the character is \"the shape\". I think anyone who is a true fan will like this movie and if you're looking for the same silly slasher, this isn't for you. The reason Michael Myers is scary is not just because he kills people, it's because he has a vendetta and he'll do anything to end it. Anyone and everyone could be an innocent victim.",

The concept of Meyers' immortality, already laid out in the 1996 film (part 6) where they show the ritual slipped away, but nevertheless I was not disappointed by the film. The chaotic nature with which the events happened blurred the focus of the film and the interest was lost at times. There were empty lines in places that make you rewind a few seconds.

Laurie is still kickass but I've always rooted for Mike however I liked his \"end\"?. The isolation and fear concepts/techniques from the original 1 and 2 are still lacking, this is still an okay watch (for me, a bit better than Kills, seriously, respect to AMHall but his character/writing irritated the F out of me in Kills, still a fan though of DeadZone while JGreer's end hit me hard, hoped she'd be the torch bearer but not just AMatichak yet...she's got the appeal but JMCurtis is a legend one needs to build up to follow in due course as a performer..just my 02cents). I appreciated the hard work which went into the filming and overall decent and believable acting by all (yes even the supporting cast, WPatton was solid as ever) but the writing in this one, while layered, does come off as somewhat forced on film. Not a bad send off but not wow in any way. Some characters were irritating (maybe purposefully so, and got what was coming, then again murder is never the answer for decent folk, however Mike has never been decent or indecent...just the lack of goodness, well, that's it isn't it, as DrLoomis once said, \"soulless\". These takes, especially the 2018 one gave me hope (still love DGG's works, GeorgeWashington was fire) and I would still like to keep up hope that some day, a resurrection will happen (focused on cannon lore and the original 1 and 2's atmospheric style while keeping characters who fuel the love of Mike by fans...if they are to be killed viewers must want them offed to some degree..even if a very small degree). One can understand that maybe Laurie cannot return in future (Ms Curtis, you are one of my all time favorites but for me your best one was with Arnie, which I rewatch...no not like that, am no perv, just an Arnie fan also) but this was not how a legend like Ms Curtis should be sent off. If Mike has to end so be it but not with a whimper. I still have mixed feelings and will rewatch this maybe next year but for now, all I can muster is a good 6 stars.",

While Halloween '18 and Halloween Kills are a fun watch for a mini-reboot, the best of the Halloween franchise are the first 8 Halloween films in the franchise, minus Halloween III: Season of the Witch, since I revere that as simply the greatest Halloween themed movie ever made without Michael Myers. To end on a pun... in the end, even Rob Zombie's reboots were more endertaining than Halloween Ends.",

The rest of the film is a completely different film about some random ugly guy that that accidentally kill a kid got away with somehow and it wiredly trys to make you feel sorry for him. Then it's a weird love story were the girl is over pushy and falls in love in a day or 2 and is willing to give up everything to be with. Honestly hated this movie properly a great hate watch.

The first death scene gave me a hearty chuckle. However, the bulk of the film leaves much to be desired. The previous installment showed that the man behind the mask is backed by some sort of supernatural forces. To be fair, after everything he's lived through in most of these, that's almost a requirement. That's why the final blow to such an iconic character is such a massive disappointment. I won't go into detail about what unfolds, but I will say that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Not if you recall even some of the canonical climaxes.",

Micheal's body count was like 3 people his weirdo sidekick kills most of the the others Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 blows this out of the water and that's saying a lot.

The ending felt weak, it tried to send off an amazing story that has started over 40 years ago. Watching this movie felt like I was watching a film that shouldn't have the name Halloween. It tried to give us something else, lead us down a path in case there's ever a continuation. Yes Michael can't be the boogeyman forever and they tried to give us something new to show that evil can take on a new shape. They just ruined it after taking that away from us. Yes this is the end of a storyline and didn't want to lead down the road of Michael Myers being immortal which they did joke about in the film. I respect that, ending a character be means of humanity. We was told the ending would piss off the fans but I wasn't expecting something like this. I respect the effort but just something I can't truly back up. The amazing Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing as she always will be, not matter what material you give her, she'll master it. James Jude Courtney tried his best with the little material he was given as the shape but I would always love his performance as Michael Myers. The script was decently done with some great visuals.

            "content": "Little continuity between this and the other two in the sequel. Advertised as the last confrontation between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Michael Myers is only in the last act of the movie. He appears in a generous estimate of 10 minutes of the entire movie. He is weak. He gets pushed around by a young man that just got bullied by the HS band. It is disrespectful. We came to watch Michael fight Laurie, and see Michael have some interesting kills. Instead we get to watch an hour learning about a character we didn't want to learn about, who takes up most of the story. It then becomes a romance movie. A romance movie! It fails at that too because it does not make sense.This movie felt like it was going in four directions. It seemed to be going for a movie without Michael Myers, with the new character becoming like Michael, or a new a killer. That did not happen, but it went down that road. Then it seemed to hint that it was going towards a movie wear Michael is easily killed and the torch is passed on. That doesn't happen. Then Michael and this kid kill people together? Okay. However, we are all ready over an hour in... Then finally, and I mean finally we get to see Michael Myer's confrontation with Laurie Strode. This makes us wonder why we needed to learn about a brand new character for the first hour of the movie... The fight was not what it should have been. Albeit it was the best part of the movie. Michael still seemed weak. In the last film he was shot, stabbed, and beaten with a baseball bat many times and still managed to kill the group of people surrounding him. In this movie he is beaten almost entirely by Laurie Strode. Which would be fine, if it wasn't so short of a confrontation compared to the rest of the movie that was wasted.Personally I think this movie would have done much better without the new character. People want to see Michael not learn about a new character in the final film. Michael hiding out in the sewer made sense, but something else should have drawn him out. Without the new character we would get to see much more screen time of Michael, like we were expecting and hoping for.My main complaints with the movie is the focus on a new character and a romance between this new character and Laurie Strode's granddaughter, and a total lack of focus on Laurie Strode herself, and Michael Myers. Noted Laurie Strode did get much more screen time than Michael.Nextly, in Halloween Kills (2021) Michael was displayed as superhuman, and with super strength. He killed anyone and everyone that came in his path. No questions asked. No apologies given. In this film he was weak, he didn't not kill the new character when he could have. He let him go. It seemed like something Michael Myers never would have done. He also was slow. He fell down in a confrontation and struggled getting up. He was pushed over by a kid in his early 20's who then preceded to steal his mask...?!?! Is this the same Michael Myers that was shot, stabbed, and beaten with a baseball bat multipletl times, and stabbed with a pitchfork. Surrounded, he gets up and kills them. He kills them! Now he can't even defend himself from an unarmed kid. As I have said before it is disgraceful and disrespectful.The final confrontation was nothing special either. I think it would have been an obvious conclusion for either Laurie to go down with Michael. As almost happened. I think Michael killing Allyson would have been interesting much like how he killed Karen at the end of Halloween Kills (2021). What I was really expecting was a confrontation at Michael's house and he could only be defeated with his mask and home destroyed. As these were the only things he cared about.",

No stupid humour.

As I said it's wierd, the way that this random kid becomes michaels accomplice but then later on in the film michael ends up finishing him off?? And the way Laurie kills Michael before they go to the scrap yar. The fight between Laurie and Michael was just all a but strange like being thrown on to tables etc. Then after the fights over Laurie pins Michael to a table with a fridge on his legs and a knife in each hand so he is nailed down but he still somehow rips his hand out and still has the strength to strangle Laurie?? Well then they take him to a scrap yard and crush him in an industrial sized shredder I guess and to be honest, I really wouldn't have been surprised if Michael just re appeared after being crushed to pieces to kill everyone.... Truthfully though I don't think it's anywhere near as scary as the past films like the hunt for Michael and when he just appears out of nowhere in this one. And why just now bring in an accomplice just for him to die later on in the film? I think it could have had a lot more potential but the previous films are definately better. (Honestly the mom shouting for her kid at the start and then when the kid jumps out is the scariest part of the film)I'm not gonna say its a terrible film because it is not but its definately not a good one.I also think between halloween kills and halloween ends that it's been rushed. If you look at some of the other films in the past they have either has a like 9 year gap or a 2 ish year gap. I definately think it was rushed. Plus, I really do think that halloween was better on a 10million dollar budget compared to kills and ends with a 20million dollar budget.

Then, a another film was announced. I believe the negative reviews are a backlash because people may have been burnt out ala SAW.

How did he communicate with Corey to plan what they were going to do? Why did he even tolerate Corey to begin with? How did Michael go from literally murdering everyone as an unstoppable machine in the last movie to living in a gutter doing nothing for 4 years? It just doesn't make any sense! The whole movie was slow and felt completely out of character. Side note - Jamie Lee was wonderful as always. But everything else about this movie was sad and strange.

It felt like a full circle and I was engaged from the brutal opening to the unbelievable crescendo ending. Cinematically beautiful, and a frighteningly haunting addition to this franchise.I didn't know what to expect when we rented this, but it's fair to say I was not disappointed by this film.",

Those who are complaining that it's \"not a real halloween movie\" are clearly not fans who appreciate the originals. To illustrate this point, when they made halloween 3, Season of the Witch, (which I think is a masterpiece), they followed a similar formula, basically adding another factor, though that film was even more drastic. In that film Michael Myers is missing completely. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie had some great parallels with other works like Christine, (Corey's last name is Cunningham and he works in a junkyard, do the math haha). I felt that the premise of this movie worked extremely well, and I really thoroughly enjoyed this movie having really disliked the previous two. Strongly recommend folks.",

            "content": "Let me preface by saying... Halloween and Michael Myers clearly trends on the supernatural side. And it's better for it, I think. I'd like to think Michael as the actual embodiment of evil in human form. So why is evil only doing semi-small time evil stuff such as murdering people in a town while being obsessed with killing Laurie? Because... actually, FFS, it's a slasher with undertones of philosophy thrown in.Many people complain and whine that this is a horrible movie, but I disagree. Let's start with the point of contention...This movie largely revolves around Corey and not Michael Myers. That's a problem for most, but I'm okay with this. Now, why would they do that? Why focus on a new character for most of the movie and not on Michael? Well...I can't say I know the writer's intentions, but I truly believe it's to give Corey the needed backstory and character development to show off The Shape's coolest ability--and that is--you know it... the moment he looks in the eyes of Corey. That's what I truly believe is the intention of this movie...And let me say, I love this ability The Shape has. I also appreciate this movie for that sole reason alone. Even if not showcased in the future, this should canonically be an ability of The Shape, in my opinion. To unlock evil in others. You want the same static approach to Halloween movies? Stick with the first two. You want the series to add in a new, nuanced layer to The Shape? Here it is...It's not that The Shape can look into anyone's eyes and make them evil or do evil things. It's that it needs to be there in the first place, and then The Shape will dial it to 11 for them.The people Corey kills in the movie have all done him dirty (to an extent) and with The Shape's glare into Corey's eyes--I'd like to think--allows the resentment Corey has against his wrongdoers, to act on it. The Shape acts like a match kindling a dormant flame. The catalyst to making others do evil. I just think that's really interesting and gives The Shape a cool added layer of depth.This trilogy makes it clear Michael Myers is the embodiment of evil. Who, or what, is evil? It's humans. It's why The Shape is immortal. As long as humans exist, The Shape will continue to exist. Reshaping itself for as long as humanity exists. Michael may be dead, but The Shape lives on and will only return again and again and again. It's poignant. It's philosophical. This trilogy makes a good point of it. Or I'm reading too much into it, but I prefer to interpret it this way.",

If I were him I'd much rather just turn myself in and go back to the asylum.Halloween 2018 was awesome but then Halloween Kills left me feeling deflated. The '78 scenes from Kills were good (I give credit where it's due) but the rest of it sucked, especially the cringeworthy hospital scenes. Now we have Halloween Ends and it's the worst of all 12 movies featuring Michael Myers. Don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise.The sewer scene where a small guy overpowers Michael and takes his iconic mask is the low point of the entire franchise. I've never seen a beloved character treated in such a bizarre way. In the previous film they establish that he possesses supernatural power...and now in this film he's barely able to stand. That particular scene was a big slap in the face of the fans and an insult to those who brought Michael to life in the first place. They turned the boogeyman into the betaman.And he's in the movie for like ten minutes. Corey Cunningham is an entirely new character but he inexplicably takes center stage. He's not even a compelling character. We're given a subpar romantic drama with a few murders along the way. The moment when he says, \"I killed someone\" and his girlfriend doesn't even ask questions is the second worst moment of the entire franchise. Horrible writing.After rating 2,020 movies on imdb I finally had the urge to write my first review because of how atrocious this movie is. I signed the petition to have them shoot a new Halloween Ends and you should do the same. It probably won't be successful but we can at least get the message across that David Gordon Green is not to be trusted with a horror franchise. I won't be surprised if the new Exorcist trilogy starts out okay and then dips in the middle and then takes a nosedive at the end.",

I like it it was bettwe then kills but was over all a disappointment I don't think we need a second killer we should have just had Michael because then the end does not work as well and feels less impact full.

            "review_title": "One Of The Most Divisive Movies in This Franchise...",
            "content": "So this is my first review on this site and trust me, I will be reviewing the other films in the franchise and MANY others but I felt now is a good time to start my review series with this movie. (spoiler-free)Halloween Ends, the most anticipated horror movie this year and the conclusion to this trilogy that director David Gordon Green has given us, starting with Halloween from 2018 and then Halloween Kills last year in 2021, if I'm being honest, as someone who's mixed on those two films, especially Kills, I had low to modest expectations for this movie after just watching it, I'm now going to give my thoughts on it.The Positives.I think what they did with Jamie Lee Curtis was really good, my overall thoughts on this Laurie Strode have been mixed with the 2018 version being too much like Sarah Connor to me, it just seemed a bit much for what was three murders four decades ago, the Kills version has really bad Shakespearean dialogue that breaks the scenes she's in with every single thing she says is very heavy handed like how with every kill he commits, Michael becomes something else, it just didn't work for me but she really does feel like a human in Halloween Ends, the Laurie Strode that I know and love, she actually seems like someone who can process what's happened and move on like a normal person and her interactions with Allyson and Frank made her feel like an actual character and I enjoyed what Jamie Lee Curtis brought to this in the dramatic sense and weirdly some humour that I didn't expect. Being that this movie has been sold and marketed entirely of the word \"Ends\" and this was the end for these versions of the characters, I'm glad I got to enjoy my final moments with these characters, especially Laurie and I'm so glad they toned down the over the top dialogue that they've been shoving down our throats for two movies much to my gleeful surprise.One of my biggest fears walking into this movie was whether or not they were gonna have the balls to actually end Halloween or were they just going to do a little tease at the end that would've angered most people and I was satisfied enough with the direction they decided to go.Halloween Ends does indeed take some gigantic swings, it takes some huge chances and it does some extremely ballsy things that I think is going to divide people all around but I'm somebody who appreciates whenever these movies decide to do something brave (it's why I like Rob Zombie's Halloween II) and so I don't know what the overall consensus will be but I do like that this movie did stuff I was not able to predict.The Mixed.My main mixed aspect is the character of Corey Cunningham, those of us that have been online in the Halloween community have heard about this character for a long time, I've managed to stay away from spoilers but anyway, this is a major character in this movie, arguably the main lead of the movie, at least the co-lead with Laurie Strode and there was things they did with this character that I really enjoyed. I liked the performance by Rohan Campbell, I think that he is a very capable lead for this movie and I was engaged and invested in the story they were telling with this character and there's quite a few homages from one of my favourite Stephen King story's that frames the direction in which they take him which is something I enjoyed, something unique for this franchise...but unfortunately by the third act of the film, where they eventually take his character, I didn't like at all, to me it amounted to nothing and all of the interesting things they did with this character where he's the forefront of the movie, it felt like they forgot what they were doing with the character or stopped caring and so it feels like it goes nowhere and was very disappointing.This is the least carnage-filled of the three movies and that's quite strange to me, I didn't expect it to be as bloody or gory as Halloween Kills, Kills was obviously a middle chapter where they were allowed to go free with the carnage but I would say Halloween 2018 has better kills and more interesting kills than Halloween Ends and so I don't think there's enough gore for a lot of people and aside from one standout kill, there's a lot of it that's obscured and in the background.My final mixed aspect is this film feels very unique to the other two films in this trilogy and there's a part of me that likes it, as I've said I like it when these films go bold and has things that's unexpected but this feels very foreign to this DGG trilogy to me, you have Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills that certainly do feel slightly like different films but in terms of style they are very much bookended with each other where you can watch them as one giant film, this one feels like a completely different creative crew took over for the movie at this point and so it was interesting to see but at the same time it's going to make this trilogy a very weird, jarring watch when two films feel like one and the third is incredibly distant. I also think the time jump in this movie was a mistake, I understand what they were trying to do as far as where to place Laurie Strode but I feel like they created loads of questions and issues with logic in regards to where certain characters have been for four years and how events have transpired from 2018 to 2022 and I don't feel like the ends justified the means with altering your original idea to make all three of these movies take place in one night, I still think that would've been the better idea.The Negatives.I have no idea why they decided to go the direction they did with this move and again, I like when these movies try to take some risks but I don't know why they took risks with this, it confuses me why they chose to take these massive swings when all they had to do was land the plane and they would've had one of the most satisfying trilogies as far as fandom goes and they decided to go bold and go REALLY divisive with the choices they make, to me it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever why they'd risk the reception of the fan base and critics to do something unique in a trilogy that was marketed and sold from the beginning as getting back to the basics and the original vision, I just don't know why you'd get people on the ride of that and seemingly succeed with them just to risk letting most of them go in the concluding chapter. It really feels like this movie wasn't ever part of the plan, I've done research and and when they pitched Halloween 2018, DGG and Danny McBride originally wanted to pitch two films and film them back to back but they decided not to, just make Halloween 2018 and see where it succeeds and if it does then we'll start talking about the second movie and it really feels like that second movie turned into Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends and there's just not enough story in this storyline they're choosing to explore to warrant two films out of that because you had one movie that was all carnage, little story and very little character moments and then you have this movie that is just so weird and wild and strange that it really feels like you could mash those two movies together, take the best ideas from Kills, take the best ideas from Ends and you could have had a one-two punch that would've amazed this fanbase but they decided to go the greedy route and turn two films into a trilogy and there's huge casualties in this movie with the writing department for those reasons, you have some of the most intriguing and bold ideas that they bring about in this movie that feel unexplored by the end, they're just introduced and then they spend no time diving into them and then the thing we're actually here for, the thing they're selling movie off of with the posters and trailers, Laurie vs Michael and their feud coming to an end, that side of the movie feels like a tacked on afterthought. The third act of this movie is the weakest act of the film where you finally start to get some of your conclusions regarding the Corey Cunningham character and how this ties to everything, what answers they give to explain Michael and evil and the themes we've been talking about for three movies now and starting to get to the action with Laurie and Michael, that's where the movie took a nosedive for me and it's the most important part of the movie, the actual fight between these two iconic characters in my opinion is weak and anticlimactic, short. So, you have this concluding chapter, this ending to the timeline that I feel is an absolute mess by the end because of the big swings they take they don't fully explore or land well enough to sell us on a lot of them and then you have the actual central concept and the whole point of this movie that isn't entirely satisfying in and of itself because it's not the focus and not the main point of the story and when it does, it feels rushed.I do think this movie is going to find its fanbase and it's going to have a cult following overtime, this is one of those movies that is going to be divisive as hell right out the gate and then over time people will settle into their camps of love or hate and there'll be very few people like me that are able to sit in the middle to where there's loads of things you appreciate and like but at the same time there's so many things that are baffling and frustrating but regardless of where this movie falls over time, I'm pretty confident in telling you it is not the knockout final chapter of this trilogy that it could've been.Final Thoughts.This is a movie that I would I say enjoyed overall, I like some of the bold directions it took, I like that fact it went in places that I would of never predicted in a hundred years this chapter would take but I was just extremely disappointed that they didn't nail the landing with those new ideas or even with the central idea of Laurie vs Michael so it ends up being another messy chapter that I'm very mixed on in this trilogy.",

Let's be honest, most people go to see these movies to see Michael Myers killing off random people, nothing overly melodramatic like some of this movie is.I thought the opening scene was really good, but they didn't really back it up.

The reality is I'm sure we can all find fault in all of the 3 movies especially the last two however, since you have all jumped on the the band wagon and given your two cents. I will give mine.If you go back to the original 1978 Halloween movie (I was 16 and underaged for an R rated movie at the time) but saw it anyway. We saw Michael Myers get shot 6 times by Dr Loomis then when he looked after checking on Laurie, Michael was gone. (You 16 year old critics accept that?) The reality is that he had to have some supernatural or superhuman force to be able to do that to make that possible.Now when Halloween 2 came out originally pick off where Michael left off, my understand was the John Carpenter didn't really want a sequel. He ended Halloween the way it was open ended. That was his intention. If my information is correct that was supposed to be the end. However, fans wanted more but Carpenter had moved on to other projects so the rest of the second was made with his blessing and then of course fans wanted more.Then 2018 comes along, like all of you I was a little thrown off with the idea but because it was backed by Carpenter, I went ok we will see.Well, the movie was good, and we got the sequel Halloween Kills which took a different tact. It started to explore the aftermath of Michael's carnage. Good on the created team for that as no good horror survives this long without looking at it. However, you also still got your slice and dice and sadly Laurie's daughter was one of those victims.As for Halloween Ends, also another great movie because we saw quite a bit of horror and not just slice and dice horror. We saw the horror of what happens to a young kid who makes a mistake and plays practical jokes on a babysitter and how quick it can go wrong. As well as how a town can turn on you even when your not to blame. That kind of horror can be just as scary as any slice and dice. Yes the last two films were different but far from bad :)",

I believed the actions of the characters was dialed up to a 15 out of 10 on the dramatic scale for a relatively benign occurrence that took place 40 years ago where 5 people were killed in relatively docile ways-it is not very unlike many large events that occur every day in the news (as Laurie's granddaughter's friend stated in 2018's version). I believed the term \"jump the shark was invented for those films, actually as I believed Green et al had truly jumped way over the shark.Upon viewing 'Ends' the first time, with friends, we ended up shutting it off, resolving ourselves to the fact that the shark jumping had continued...I knew I had missed some important dialogue being half focused so I returned to it a second time and had a surprisingly new perspective. Let me start by saying this film is unlike Michael Myers' old usual habits and he takes a big sideline in this film to make way for newcomer Corey Cunningham, a sweet-natured, timid and goofy babysitter involved in a tragic accident of the boy he is babysitting for on Halloween night 2019. Corey is now town pariah much like Laurie whom takes Corey under her wing and nurtures this lost soul with an introduction to her granddaughter.Corey is still relentlessly bullied and the misguided anger and hate directed at him metastasizes....and he starts to embody the same characteristics of a Michael Myers but in a different way. The movie did a good job showing the effects of evil and it's generational hold on people (along with its effects). In Laurie, this evil caused her to become a basket case who wasted her life struggling with PTSD and self loathing. It essentially destroyed her family. But in true Laurie resilience, she comes to the light and finds her own path. I believe that is a concept many of us can agree who have suffered trauma and PTSD and I think Curtis does an EXCELLENT job in her portrayal of that suffering and resilience.... Corey represents how others can create and inculcate a state of evil in another by simply treating them as if they are lower than scum. He embodies this characteristic throughout the film and the actor also does a creditable job portraying that. And Michael Myers, while sidelined shows that evil can be present through psychosis or boredom as well.The weakest part of this movie for me was the non-explanation of Michael as Renfield to Corey's Dracula. And then a reversal of those feelings at the climax. Hence my rating above. But ultimately I did find it to be a fitting conclusion to the series. If you want classic Michael stabby Halloween that we all love this may NOT be your favorite film. But as an examination of the effects of trauma and PTSD and the evil that permeates society (and how that evil is born and bred), it definitely hits the mark.",

Cody's story a good movie by itself. Or if Cody had lived it would of been a great jumping off point for continuing the halloween franchise.",

            "content": "I get why there are so many bad reviews for this movie I truly do. I understand that a majority of the reviews point out this isn't a good ending to the series. I'm going to throw all of that away and focus on the actual movie.It's fine, it's a watchable movie, it does have some Easter eggs for its fans to find. The fault in this movie was Cory's story line. I actually liked his character and his connection to Laurie's granddaughter. It made me believe that this was the end of Micheal's story and the beginning of Cory's, and we soon find out by the end where they are going. It seems to me that the original premise of the movie was to start a new franchise with Cory and when negotiations fell through they had to find a way to salvage the story to finish this film. The movie had a certain vibe until we get to the scene of Laurie attempting to end herself. This vibe had a sharp turn and felt as if it was added in after the film was completed and not part of the main film. Many parts of this movie felt as if they were going to do something different but either time or money caused them to piece together different ideas. The acting was OKish nothing great and the bully had the worst performance, I don't know if it was intentional or not.If you've never seen a Halloween movie you can watch this as a stand alone, you might enjoy it more than us long time Halloween movie watchers as we are going to gripe and nit pick it to death (lol). Be aware this film does contain a lot of horrific death scenes that I personally was not a fan of, I liked how they handled them in the older films.Was this a good Halloween movie? No not really\nWas this a bad movie? No, it was watchable\nWould I watch this again? Maybe, it might end up being one of those films I only watch when I'm rewatching the new trilogy.So.... which movie did you like from the Halloween series then? The original and followed by Halloween(2018).",

And since michaels only goal was to go home to the myers house and it was demolished he had no home to return to so that's why he lives in a damn sewer, so go back rewatch this trilogy learn from it and maybe you'll love this trilogy even more.",

Now, i grew up in the 80's/ i watched the usual, Freddy, Pinhead, Myers, Phantasm, the 'age' of Fangoria.So, as a big fan of Halloween Kills, i was excited for this one.Now. Its a mixed bag. I feel they deviated from the Halloween formula for most of the story, sure, there's deaths. But its not what i expected.I was hopin for.. a continuation of 'H. Kills. Haddenfield vs meyers. But it isnt that way, not like in halloween kills.However, the ending scenes, are what i wanted to see, and made me happy.I wish they could have been longer.So .. it may not be what you expected, but it is the finale [?] so enjoy an give it a watch.",

            "content": "Not a bad movie overall in the general sense. It was obviously created to have an avenue to continue making Halloween movies. It's just not what the other films are. Just a bit of a reach overall in regards to the story line. Really terrible way to end the original Micheal Meyers. I can't decide if this one is worse than Halloween Kills or not. Halloween Kills was a total mess that leaned on all of the cameos. The Halloween Ends story line is a terrible way to wrap up it's predecessors. Again, wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy certain parts of the film but just not what I wanted see to end the series as a whole.",

            "content": "As a long-term Halloween fan from seeing the original on TV then old enough to rent 4 onwards from video stores, i know this series well.This is thankfully different to the previous trilogy entries... 2018 was a horror, Kills was more slasher and this is most definitely a character study. Slower with sporadic hits of brutality (created by the amazing FX wizard Christopher Nelson) this is far more character driven. There is no way it could equal the original or 2018, and another Kills would be just an uneccessary rehash.Yes, I agree that everyone wishes Michael was in it more but the tension to the finale is worth it and the fact that Michael was almost vulnerable. I loved this direction change and James Jude Courtney is easily my favourite portrayal of Micheal since Nick Castle in the original. Don't expect 2018 or Kills again and you may like this for what it is... a slow burn Halloween.",

            "content": "I was at first pretty shocked at how much hate this film is getting, but I really shouldn't be surprised. This is the first Halloween film since H2O that has really attempted to shake up the Halloween formula in a significant way, but I feel that they actually pulled it off. However, a natural consequence of this sort of change is that it is going to upset the viewers who are expecting more of the same. No, this is NOT your typical slasher film. Although there are some great kills and scares in this film, the focus is more on characters and themes than any previous entry in the franchise. To me, this film at its core is about how someone can become like Michael. Previous attempts to explain how Michael became evil (the cult and Rob Zombie's remake) fell flat for me, but this film does a much better job by instead showing how someone ELSE can become evil like him.I won't spoil anything here because I think this film has a lot of surprises that shouldn't be ruined for you. What I will say is that this Halloween movie actually has something to say, and for the first time in a while the characters actually feel like real people and you want to see what happens to them. It's not a perfect movie or the best Halloween movie but it's a very well made and thoughtful take on the Halloween premise and I hope more people give it a chance.",
