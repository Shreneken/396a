            "review_title": "Marmaduke is given the film treatment once again and is even worse than the previous attempt (ironically making it more watchable, in the same way as a trainwreck or car crash",
            "content": "When rambunctious great dane Marmaduke's (Pete Davidson) latest escapade of causing a tidal wave at a birthday party goes viral on social media, both Marmaduke and his family The Winslows are made infamous internet sensations with many labeling Maramduke as \"untrainable\". Legendary dog trainer Guy Hilton (Brian Hull) approaches the Winslows with an offer to train Marmaduke and turn him into a champion for the dog show circuit with a $1 million prize for the winner which Winslow family patriarch Phil (David Koechner) eagerly accepts. Following an intense training regimen, Marmaduke is ready for the circuit, but reigning champion Zeus (J. K. Simmons) has plans to sabotage Maramduke.Announced in 2017, Marmaduke is the second adaptation of the newspaper comic strip of the same name by Brad Anderson. The strip was written and drawn by Anderson from 1954 until his death in 2015 and is still syndicated with Brad's son Paul still writing the strip. The first adaptation of Maramduke staring Owen Wilson in the titular role was released to audience indifference as producer John Davis tried and failed to recapture the success of the Bill Murray fronted Garfield films. Having read Marmaduke I never found it particularly funny or endearing with the main schtick of \"Dog does something strange/destructive, family reacts\" not being all that amusing in the earliest panels and only seemed like it served as space filler at best. The 2010 film that adapted the character was anemic and barebones with lots of unconvincing CGI which was par for the course when accounting for Underdog, Garfield, or various other lowest common denominator talking animal movies. Frankly I didn't expect to see a second attempt at Marmaduke, and unlike the 2010 film which was stupid and bland, the 2022 film goes into full-on trainwreck territory.The animation in Marmaduke looks absolutely awful. The movie is directed by Mark A. Z. Dipp\u00e9 a former visual effects artist who cut his teeth making the ground breaking effects for the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and the T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgement Day before making the transition to film director with 1997's Spawn. Since Spawn Dippe has stuck mainly with children's films and is no stranger to newspaper comic adaptations having directed the trilogy of bottom of the barrel Garfield films Garfield Gets Real (2007), Garfield's Fun Fest (2008), and Garfield's Pet Force (2009). Given his career with visual effects you'd at the very least expect something visually pleasing, but Marmaduke is one of the ugliest and cheapest looking animated films I've seen since Norm of the North. The animation and models feel very plasticky and robotic with movement and flow feeling stilted at best as if frames of the animation are simply missing. The character models range anywhere from bland and uninspired to falling into the uncanny valley with the animation on the dogs talking looking grotesque to put it as nicely as possible. And then there's the effects for things like water or particle effects like smoke, haze, or a fart gas cloud (yes, seriously). Scenes involving any kind of fluid such as water, shampoo, or Maraduke's drool the fluid either clumps together like it's made of saran wrap or it's poorly integrated 2D assets overlayed on 3D assets in a manner that's only slightly less awkward than when Top Cat: The Movie did it.The writing in Marmaduke is just a mess, credit to the 2010 film: at least it followed a structure (bare bones and banal as it was). Maramduke 2022 however, you could watch this movie and have no idea if you're in the second act, third act, or what because narrative cohesion in this film is more a polite suggestion than a requirement. The movie has TWO third act nadirs with one happening just barely at the 40 minute mark where we get the major setpiece where Marmaduke embarrasses himself by eating too much and using the competition trophy as a bathroom. This is where we get the fart gas sequence featured prominently in the trailer, but the movie takes a dumb joke a step further and makes the scene apocalyptic with an extended freeze frame sequence where screams and anguished cries are heard as we pan over faces frozen in terror and we see a pile of birds who've fallen out of the sky into a pile who seem like they're dead. The last time I saw a gas scene in an animated movie portrayed to this horrifying of a degree, it was in the independently produced animated dog film Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero and that was a serious story that took place during World War I. The movie only gets dumber and more nonsensical from that point forward with Marmaduke somehow running around the world (don't ask), going to an international dog show with participants from around the world including a Chinese rapping martial-artist Shih Tzu who sounds like Confucius and has psychic powers (don't ask, and did I mention China co-production?), and a French Poodle love interest who falls in love with Marmaduke because.....I'll get back to you on that.Marmaduke plays like a funhouse mirror regurgitation of every bad animated children's film you've seen over the last 20 years. With all the time I've spent dumping on this movie you'd probably think you should avoid seeing it and if we're talking children's entertainment, yeah there's FAR better movies like this that you can watch (pretty much any Illumination movie is head, shoulders, knees, and even toes above this thing), but I will say Marmaduke is dumb but it's fascinatingly dumb. Every moment of Marmaduke features something stupid or nonsensical but I was never annoyed while watching it and found myself weirdly drawn to finish it to see \"how stupid?\". If we're talking rubbernecking entertainment, Marmaduke will suffice for your \"WTF animated misfire\" and you can probably riff it if you're not too ashamed of yourself for viewing it.",

            "content": "In a few years of animated movies we would see whether if it's in theaters or on streaming services, we have seen quite a few that are bad but couldn't consider the worst movies ever made. And honestly, I was praying we would have one decade without a disastrous animated movie from Netflix that's any worse than America The Motion Picture. Ladies and gents, we have found what may possibly be the worst animated movie of the decade. The 2022 Marmaduke is not just a disaster, but would probably make the worst animated Netflix movie you can find. Having nightmare fuel animation that makes the movie unwatchable is one thing, but the movie has gone bottom of the barrel of how basing off a comic strip series can go wrong. The story is absolutely broken. The inner hearted message is hammered down. The humor is some of the cringiest I've seen in my life. The characters are all unappealing especially the fact Marmaduke himself is really hard to root for because of how stupid and useless he is. And everything we see from this feels out of place. Please everyone, do yourselves a favor and stay away from this embarrassment. Seriously, I'd rather watch the 2010 film than going back to this. Sure it's terrible, but at least it's a little more watchable than this. Not only would this be possibly the worst movie of the year, but also one dog movie worth putting down using a poison shot.",

My God, I thought that new Ice Age movie on Disney+ didn't have some of the worst animation I've seen in a while, but Marmaduke manages to take that abysmal animation to a whole new level of awfulness!Everything about the animation is butt ugly, from the terrible color palettes to bland uninspired environments, poor lip-syncing throughout, and vomit-inducing character designs that are so bad it makes the two recent Addams Family animated films look like a Pixar movie. It truly does have a cheap feel throughout, even a old PlayStation 1 or NIntendo 64 game would look better visually than this trash.Please do yourselves a favor and stay far away from this movie, one of the absolute worst of 2022 along with Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild!",

            "content": "Most of what you really need to know is covered by most of the other comments. Yes, juvenile gross-out humor is taken to a tasteless, obnoxious extreme. The people, dogs, cat, house, etc., all suggest a downgraded Puppy Dog Pals. Designs can be almost grotesque (e.g. The mom.) From start to finish it's deeply unoriginal. The animation is horrid, stiff and stilted.Simmons sacrificed some pride for a relatively quick check. Like Sir Pat Stew, he must simply feel he has nothing left to prove. (I don't recognize the other two voice actors we're apparently supposed to.) At least his character is one of the better ones--a villainous Afghan hound with blindingly, hypnotically shiny hair. Typical do-anything-to-remain-top-dog type. My two favorites, easily, were Zeus (that Afghan) and Shantrelle (feels as if it should be Chantrelle?), the flirtatious hot-pink Standard Poodle with rather epic (for this animation level anyway) figure-skate-like dance moves. Aside from those two you had...\n-a \"Staffordshire terrier\" (presumably an American one), who looked something like a Bulldog/Cane Corso cross...whatever, your basic British-accented bully-breed type. Whose most impressive talent is lifting enormous multistory buildings full of people and dogs using his jaws.-+1 Spanish-accented Chihuahua, for whom you're just waiting to say \"Yo quiero Taco Bell!\" Which all but happens.-a wise mystic Shih Tzu who manipulates energy fields, performs martial arts, and...raps.For just once I'd like to see a realistic depiction of a dog show in a cartoon--one that demonstrates at least the degree of knowledge I possessed as a small child. You can tell they've watched Westminster by the use of the iconic green carpet and purple/gold color scheme. But then they just combine the gaiting aspect of conformation (the main event that includes moving around the ring) with other, separate competitions, pageant-style. The same group is then challenged to resist a pizza slice for 30 seconds in the silly \"obedience\" round. Failure means elimination. Next comes an actually very cool obstacle course that's part Agility, part Ninja Warrior, part Wipeout. (Get that contact zone, Zeus...good boy.) That's followed by the open-ended \"talent\" acts, as if this is Pet Star...somebody call Mario Lopez. The backstage bench tags are bafflingly inconsistent. Some are the breed names, but then there's \"hound.\" And \"Marmaduke\" instead of \"Great Dane.\" They ignore breed judging and breed groups, simply tossing a random handful into the ring which just so happens to include a...Kuvasz. Whoa. Clearly somebody threw that tidbit in as another reward to me for sitting through this. As if they were giving me a choice in the first place (a pink Poodle and an Affie who reminds me of my Barbie and Show Champions ones, like C'MON!) The Kuvasz IS another favorite, but of all the rare breeds to pick out of a hat, man! Guess it could've been a fellow fan. And there IS one in Homeward Bound II, so...Other obscure cgi dog movies come to mind. E.g. The Queen's Corgi--much less than stellar, overall better than Marmaduke, and a personal guilty pleasure thanks to the extremely Sasha LaFleur-like Saluki character. Speaking of which, there's the Indian Roadside Romeo. Doesn't live up to its potential but is fun enough to watch and has some great music. And so on. I've probably seen every animal movie ever, animated or live-action. Gotta say, this better have been as low-budgeted as it appears, because otherwise where in blazes did it get blown? The voices? As with TQC, there was zero marketing. It has to be shown to you when you're looking up something that's suddenly got a \"play\" button on the DVD queue (which is the only reason to have gotten Netflix in the first place. Blockbuster by mail. The digital nonsense is just a bonus.)\"It's for kids\" is never an excuse for anything. Kids deserve quality and excellence that will not merely entertain them in youth, but become even more appreciable as they age. Certainly no blaspheming of timeless characters and titles, who shall be eternally treasured by all in their earlier/original forms. The majority of the best and most enduring media ever to be produced, has been. Mainly prior to ~2010. I'm unashamed to say that my gargantuan favorite-movie list is comprised in no small part of cherished childhood loves--a significant portion of which are animal-centric. The key to making a great one of these (especially in live-action, but largely in animation too) was lost seemingly for good sometime around the release of the first, live-action Marmaduke film. That one was meh. 5-6/10 at best. Ugh, live-action animal movies used to be done SO right. The comic is somewhere right below Garfield, Peanuts, and Calvin & Hobbes.",

This is one of those lazier examples of adapting an iconic character to the big screen. There is nothing inspirational here; I dig the message of standing by those close to you even if they mess up from time to time but I don't think anyone working on this really had passion on it at all.In fact I think they sort of delighted in trolling us. Some horrific lavatorial humor is the worse thing but the moment the movie just broke me is when he literally runs around the world. I know that sounds crazy; it's a crazy moment and I think the writers knew that but they don't want you to know they know that.A big reason of why I watched the first act of this dump-truck's worth of Mom and her hilariously petite daughter. She's cute though, she's cute...Tons of this doesn't make sense, the pacing is all over the place, that Marmaduke talks at all just feels all wrong and they cram a bunch of characters in at the end and...Just one of those train wrecks you need to see to believe.I got a morbid satisfaction at watching this trash for some reason. Just the kind of person I am. But I'm not going to defend this movie for anything.",

When I was younger, I was into the live-action Marmaduke film released in 2010, but I must say I haven't watched it in a few years.I cringed at the first few seconds of this film opening with an annoying song that just says \"Marmaduke\" over and over. The first 10-ish minutes that I did watch, all I could see was awful outdated animation, childish jokes, gender stereotypes and lazy dialogue.As soon as the dad of the family decides to let a random famous dog trainer work with Marmaduke because he thinks he might earn some massive sum of money, I knew I couldn't sit through the rest of the runtime.I'm a 20-year-old and I'm aware I'm not the target audience of a movie like this, and so I know I can't be too harsh.

WHY DO CANADIAN MOVIES HAVE SO MUCH TOILET HUMOR?! Netflix animation has crossed the line! Honestly? This is worst than norm of the north... Well I just hope this movie doesn't have any stupid spin-offs just like what lionsgate did to norm the stupid polar bear! I can't believe they allowed this movie.
