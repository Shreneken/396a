            "content": "I think everyone who watched this movie wasn't expecting anything good, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. The first one was garbage too, but at least it had some kind of story to drive it, this movie is basically as 2 hour music video with sex.... yes, that's all it is. The relationship between the two leads is as mindless and unrealistic as the first, and another man joins the scene, who is just as dull as the first.Nothing happens in this film until roughly half way through, and if you even managed to endure the pain that is the awful dialogue, directing and acting, you then have to suffer a boring thriller-wannabe. It's a shame really, because with a good director and writer, you could have had a compelling story with good characters, but no...we get this. The main actors, (I can't even be bothered to look up their names) have little to no chemistry between them, and half of the time they are just standing there looking pretty.I understand that 20-40 something men aren't this movies target audience, but at least make it bareable for us.If you were to take out all the music and sex, you would have a 40 minute short film. Seriously, it's that bad. So many usless scenes that add nothing. The only good thing about this movie is its cinematography, which is surprislingly very good, which is the only thing stopping this from getting a 1.",

            "content": "Blame Italy, or Poland, or Netflix? No just blame people. Nowadays it's about a thrill, not a story meaning the movie was a cringe fest and a laughing stock. Now it's not the dialogue that was bad, the woeful unrealistic story, or the acting, what's bad is the fact people can make excuses for this throwing lot of clever cinematic views and shall we say steamy moments. A movie isn't about the thrill. It's not about filters and fancy clothes, being spoilt as a woman and loaded as a man. No actually that actually is all this is. Netflix throws this at us because of the demands to please the audience with this sort of thing. Any pathetic, girl power, snap chat fish for likes love myself type of person will adore this. As too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual. Point blank doesn't matter how disgusting the male lead is, how bad the story or dialogue, how bad the female leads acting is, it's all about what is pleasing on the eye. That's why a Netflix original cannot be trusted or half of the reviews left by these so called adults. Many of whom are probably underage by the way or only care about a good time and no doubt have everything easy. This isn't about an escape and it's not about putting yourself in the polish girls shoes, or underpants, it's about what is wrong with the every day person these days and how so long as they're enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters. Shame. A woeful woeful film.",

            "review_title": "Actually two years",
            "content": "Well two years since the original came out - and I am going to talk about that movie here too. Especially how it ended - because ... well it kind of was supposed to have an effect on the characters ... but more on that on the next paragraph - you have been warned more than enough about spoilers that are upcoming for both movies.The previous movie ended in an accident - actually the movie made it appear as if it was going to be a deadly accident. But as this starts it looks like it was nothing like that at all. I even thought \"is it supposed to be a dream?\" - something that might have happened but didn't? Am I thinking way too much about this? Especially considering this does not have that much plot.And let's be honest, this and the other movie got such a low rating ... and yet everyone seems to have watched it. It is like guilty pleasure for some ... and if you accept the cringe and cliche this includes ... and relish in how bad certain things are ... even the fact they talk in different languages, being unable to emote emotions ... especially crazy considering how many ... love scenes are involved.And yes this starts off with after the wedding ... and while the first movie was way more explicit, that first (I am going to keep calling them that) love scene is setting a tone. This is not a romcom - so even if you haven't seen the previous movie, you know what is up ... no pun intended. Though I would be wondering why you keep reading this.This time around the beauty and the beast theme is kind of gone - the marriage blues has substituted that. For the first half hour there is almost nothing more than ... love scenes and ridiculous issues made up from thin air. Even the mother of our main character is getting it on. But when it comes to showing skin, she leaves that up to her daughter.There seems no conflict at all until ... and again more spoilers to follow ... until the end third of the movie. The gardener ... you couldn't make this up ... maybe it does know how ridiculous it is after all? We keep watching anyway ... but maybe there is some genius in making this so bad, it actually is enjoyable.Anyway this gardener is apparently someone from a different gang/mafia clan or whatever. Why he was hired is beyond me ... there is no reason or logic for it. And to top things of, the ending goes completely off rails ... and this time around not only hints at a sequel but really sets it up nicely. I would be surprised if there won't be another one ... we have to find out who survived (probably everyone the way they were shot to be honest ... but hey, let's wait and see), right?",

            "content": "YALL KNOW I'M RIGHT ON THIS.I'm aware why we tuned in the first time. No, it wasn't the Oscar worthy performances, the breathtaking photography, the gorgeous music score, the thrilling plot or the spectacular and innovative direction.IT WAS THE SMASHING YOU CAME FOR. It was semi better last time and that kept you wanting more. Yet, this time it's miserably underwhelming and dull. The joke's on us.If the previous movie overdid it with the soundtrack, this one takes it to another level of obnoxious. This sequel is one big music video with random, unexciting, poorly edited sex scenes stitched together in between bizarre frolicking montages that serve no purpose other than stretch out the screen time due to the lack of actual storytelling. They outdid themselves by making the sequel even less of a movie than the first one. Congrats!There's no build-up, no sensuality, no decent choreography, just the two leads humping ungraciously in several locations with horrible, wordy reggeaton music in the background by unknown artists because they spent all their budget on drones and couldn't afford famous people on the OST. 24 songs every 4 minutes, people. 24 songs! Seems like someone from the editing team wanted to include their favourite Spotify party playlist at all cost.The no plot of this sequel is Laura being moody just 3 days after her wedding because her mob boss husband/ kidnapper has \"work things to do\", despite having all the time in the world for endless bang sessions in his musty dungeon.Laura behaves like another Mary Sue, being mad at her husband for cheating on her of course, not because he kidnapped, drugged, cut her off from her family , threatened and sexually assaulted her at any given chance. We're over the kidnapping in this movie, there are bigger issues here and nope, none of that has anything to do with Massimo's dirty ways and complete disregard of autonomy and consent. This franchise does not understand what these things are. If they did there we could have had some storyline. It's actually insulting to DV victims how the immensely abusive nature of this relationship gets downplayed. Yikes.Laura has wet dreams about the gardener/ rival gangster now, who cares about any conflict or character development? She's there to get passed around like a plaything , having zero agency and being controlled by anyone with a penis and a gun. Your body, your choice, our asses!Oh, look, we get to see Laura naked a lot again, straight female demographic that this saga is appealing to, i hope you're happy!!!Miki is as hot as ever yet we don't see much of his naked glory and he can't act to save his life either. It's a lose lose situation.The garbage plot is so ridiculous that average Telemundo productions could have a chance at an Emmy award. I lost it at the contrived twin brother drama storyline, seriously, did a toddler come up with this nonsense? It's not only riddled with plotholes but it's also pure unintentional comedy.Michelle Morrone's hilarious interpretation as the scorned, coked out brother provided some needed entertainment in what seems the biggest trash Netflix has put out yet and there's more to come.And if you are a fan of this series getting heated by this review , are you honestly satisfied with lukewarm sex scenes with Youtube pop music and ridiculous tiger roar sound effects? I've seen porn films with much better direction, execution and acting. Let's not lie to ourselves here; it's hot trash and one good looking guy cannot save this.If they can't deliver semi decent sex scenes what else is there for viewers to anticipate? Laura's deadpan expression and her ability to get kidnapped by any guy she finds attractive? Massimo's cringeworthy tongue flicking and his babygorl phrase? The materialism overload in each scene? The toxic, creepy cues in every dialogue?This reads more like a soft porn parody than a 50 shades knock-off that gets progressively worse with each installment. Can't wait to see what pile of yesterday's sewage part 3 is gonna turn out to be!",

            "content": "*im not an English native speaker nor a movie critic, but this one is so bad i HAD to write something about it, so excuse my possible mistakesSo...where to begin. What to say.This whole movie felt like a music video with some beautiful visuals and landscapes and often people having sex in different locations. And if they weren't having sex, they were staring off at the ocean \"meaningfully\".Now sprinkle a few sentences there and then and boom thats our movie.I can't even understand how can anyone write or produce something this bad.Characters- zero. There is literally nothing to say about characters as they are generic and so one layered that i think i would see better written characters in otome games. They have no past, no future, no thought process, no motives, no nothing. They are just here to make the \"story\" go.I get that the idea is nothing new and it has the usual bad guy mafia boss and a beautiful but wild girl who gets in troubles and needs saving BUT couldn't there be a little more conversation? Was it so hard for the author to write a few pages from the perspectives of other characters and their insights? You have all the pieces: hot and cool male protagonists, wild and free female protagonist, they get married but are having communication and trust issues. Was there ever attention on those problems? Did our couple even TRIED to fight or argue about it once? No. Missed opportunity to easily gain some depth and add some drama to their dynamic to show us how each side feels about it, how would they defend themselves or what they think in general. Just no.Next , and in my opinion the character with the most potential: the twin brother. (Again i know its a generic trope) It could've added so much if his tragic story was even a little bit elaborated and worked out. I mean he showed up twice?? But everything that's happening was happening because of him? \"There is an evil twin brother with evil motives just go along with it\"? I feel like there could easily be made up so much more to fill up the story a little bit. Hell, I feel like I could easily make up some character background and better plot. Was it so hard to write some sob story about abandoned child at least in attempt to make things seem more \"DeEp\"? Or something about hot and caring but cold and distant bad guy? Or maybe a few words from a woman who lost her unbound child? Im so pissed that there was like one minute talk about it in the beginning and then nothing. Everything is so flat and shallow.I dont even know what to say about other characters: Olga and Dominic? What the hell. The gardener seemed nice in the beginning but it turned out to be fake and just like the rest.I think i said enough about plot just by talking about characters but I MUST mention few other things. That shooting scene and Lauras running in the end had me literally laughing. And its so funny that near the end, they all meet up to \"talk business\" but 1 minute into the conversation they all somehow end up worrying about Laura and suddenly ending the meeting to go find her. That was a legit WT* moment for me. Mafia in this movie=\ud83e\udd21 . And Lauras mum who dramatically turns while leaving and says \"don't stop me\" while no one even moved a finger to do so? Also laughed. That little fashion show sequence? What was that about???To sum up, this movie could have been your generic movie with average, kinda cringy plot and average characters that we've seen so many times, but it horribly fails to even do that and meet the minimum in every aspect. Instead its a 2 hour long music video. Its just terrible. I didn't think it could be worse than first one but here we are.",

The entire script could fit on to a single-page word document and I was bored after half an hour. It felt like I was watching a musician's feature film for their album rather than a movie.When it comes to the characters, Laura is just plain unlikeable and her friend is obnoxious. The scene where Laura throws her phone off of the cliff is completely ridiculous. Who would throw away their one way of contacting their friend/family when they're with a stranger in a foreign country? I thought Laura and Olga were meant to be best friends.. Yet Laura just runs away without even telling her we're she's going or what happened!When it comes to the men, Massimo is trying too hard to be Christian Gray that it just comes off as cringe. One minute he's controlling and the next minute he's not. Nacho's character doesn't make any sense and the whole romance between him and Laura is so unrealistic. She's supposed to be heart broken so why is she making out with him? Together all of these characters feel like a fanfiction that walked straight out of wattpad and onto the big screen.Finally, the ending is an even worse cliff hanger than the first movie. At the end of the last movie, we see Laura hinting at being pregnant and then going into a tunnel with her friend where she's supposed to be killed. This movie starts with little to no explanation on how she and her friend survived that other than 'there was an accident'. So the whole transition between the two movies was such a let down.Overall, this movie (if you could even call it that) was awful. The constant sex scenes and video montages to music just made me feel like I was watching a feature film of an x-rated musician's album. The dialogue was so minimal and the dialogue that there was, was poorly written and full of grammatical mistakes. It even appears sometimes that the actors are not aware of what they're saying (perhaps they don't understand the English lines). I understand that they were trying to appeal to the western market but surely they could find actors that speak English well or just have the entire film in Polish/Italian. We needed subtitles anyway as it is hard to understand what they're saying with the grammar and pronunciation mistakes.To summarise, do not bother with this movie. Even if you love romances you probably will be bored of this. There's hardly any dialogue, the plot is nonsensical and the characters are even more unrealistic than the first movie. It was such a let down after waiting so long for this.",

The ending was abysmal and I'm sure watching a 2 hour porn compilation would be a better way to waste the 2 hours I wasted watching this giant middle finger to the movie industry. Up until now I thought the live action Slenderman movie was the worst film I've ever seen but at least that movie was funny because of how bad it was. Save your time and go watch paint dry for 1 hour and 50 minutes.",

If they make a third one, I might not watch it, guessing they would just skip the part where she was shot dead in the chest and she will be alive and well.

You're kind of watching sex all the time until about the second half of the movie, where it slows down a little bit with those scenes and a little bit of story comes in, which I think is just as weak. So what does this film have to offer? The first half is all sex, which we can find everywhere on unnamed sites these days, and the second half has some plot, but it's not the best. This film will probably please only the biggest fans of the first part. I would advise others to avoid this one. It has nothing to offer in my opinion.

He's a proud Italian mafioso. Very disrespectful to speak to him like that and also unwise. I've watched the first one easily 365 times, ha. See what I did there? But I've hardly watched this one. Maybe 15 times.",

That's my first issue with this movie.The other problem I have is with the lack of storyline. It's sex scene after sex scene with occasional dialogue. It does have a pretty good soundtrack! So at least there's that.If you're only looking for the sex scenes, then you will love this movie! But if you were hoping for more of a storyline you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "When I watched 365 Days...I had yet to read the books and although there were flaws, Massimo's appeal surmounted my grievances and I enjoyed the film enough to want to read the books. Now I have read book one and book two of this trilogy and am watching This Day after reading it. In this sense, I was a little disappointed that the film did not stay truer to the source material it was based on. I realize that they had to tell the story in a short period of time so it makes sense that they condensed it quite a bit and you do still get the sense that Laura is being pretty unreasonable with Massimo while he is trying to please her and do his \"job\". It really made me appreciate the loving care that Passionflix gives to its films in regards to their source material.Having said that if I take the film just at face value...it is sexy (now there is not only the sex god Michele Morrone, but new character played by Simone Susinna), it has great luxury locations, a fabulous soundtrack and the fashion is top notch! For those reasons alone I would recommend the film.While I am aware that dark mafia romances are not everyone's cup of tea...for some including myself this is enjoyable escapism which is what entertainment should be. If you have \"triggers\" or only want to see women respected in a safe environment...why are you watching a dark mafia romance? No one says that it has to be your taste. If you don't like it, don't watch it. No one is being forced. Do i believe women should be kidnapped? Absolutely not. Do I want to be kidnapped? Absolutely not. But that is why it is escapism and not reality. Let people enjoy the beauty that is.Movie 2:This Day picks up jumping a little into the future with Laura back with Mossimo on the brink of their wedding. They marry and Laura quickly becomes bored after their honeymoon because Mossimo has to go to work. Laura flounces around like the pouty, spoiled brat that she is. Mossimo brings her family in for Christmas buying them gifts and Laura a fashion house to run. Then Laura sees what she thinks is Mossimo cheating on her with his ex and goes on the run with new character, \"Nacho\" the new gardener. She spends time learning to surf in a tropical island paradise with Nacho...and if you want any more you will have to watch the film.While not for everyone...I know plenty of people that I will be recommending this film to and I for one cannot wait for the conclusion of this story.",

Long ago, I was able to see all of the films featured in Harry Medved's brilliant book \"The 50 Worst Movies of All Time\"...and have gone on to complete or nearly complete a few other bad film lists. Apparently I am a glutton for punishment...and I'm adding \"365 Days: This Day\" to this infamous quest. Yes, I watched it because the film is supposed to be terrible...and right now it's on IMDB's Bottom 100 List...with an overall score a measly 2.5....placing it at #60. Interestingly, the film it's a sequel to, \"365 Days\", is also on IMDB's list...though with a score that's recently risen to 3.3, it's apparently better...but I really, really hated \"365 Days\"! It's not hard to guess what I will think of the sequel!This film is Polish...the first Polish 'bad film' I've seen. And, for some reason, Netflix has chosen to buy it and market it here in the States...and subscribers apparently are not enchanted with the story!The first film had a very sick premise....a mobster kidneaps a woman and he expects her to eventually fall in love with him. And, amazingly, she does...which sends so many inappropriate and weird messages to men and women! Here in the sequel, it begins with the same pair of weirdo lovers tying the knot...but, not surprisingly, problems are on the horizon.Like the previous film, this one plays much like a porno film where they edited out much of the nudity. Now I am NOT saying it's a PG-13 or R film...so it's still amazingly explicit...especially for Netflix. So what the film emphasizes is a dopey plot more than nudity...which I am sure is the reason most folks watch porn anyway...those great and realistic plots.So is it any good? Of course not. While the film looks nice and was filmed in many lovely locations, the story is pretty dumb. Plus, WHO wants to be rooting for a mobster and his kinky new wife?! That's a pretty hard sell!That being said, while the film is offensive (again, the wife was kidnapped and made a sex slave....eventually a very willing and frisky one!) and dumb, I don't think it's among the 100 worst films ever made...nor close to it. Technically speaking, at times the film appears to be well made despite the many deficiencies of the writing and silly acting and plot.",

If you saw the first film you knew exactly what to expect. It is an erotic film, period! Expecting more and worse yet, reviewing it as such, is ridiculous.As erotic films go, it is slick and visually stunning compared to its American cousins. The story is mostly predictable, yet there are surprises. The production values and the surprises set it apart from the typical erotic film. The intimate performances are pretty hot and the simulated sex scenes are convincing to any viewer.I will say as polished as it is, there are moments where the performances are a bit stiff or forced, but overall, a very well done film that could easily be appealing to couples. Exotic European locales, the dangers of mafia life, etc... set up a decent experience. For those who are looking for Shakespear, see a play, this is not for you.I enjoyed it for what it was and had no preconceived expectations to ruin the experience. I wouldn't say it was plot dense or dialogue rich, but it played to its strengths. That being the on screen chemistry between Anna Maria and Michele. It worked better than others in the same genre, where a poor story was mixed with terrible dialogue and shoe horned in simulated sex scenes between actors with little to no chemistry. If one were to remove the steamy sex scenes and panoramic vistas, it would likely be a 30 - 40 minute short about competing mafia families.I recommend checking it out if you enjoy erotic films. The staging and erotic performances are remarkable.",

The sequel, however, had me feeling like I did as a kid in the '80's and into the '90's when sequels as a rule, with a few notable exceptions, were consistently inferior films.And this was a god-awful meets dumpster fire in ways previously unexplored. I mean, at least they stopped after crap sequels like \"Jewel Of the Nile,\" or \"Weekend At Bernie's II,\" but these guys are likely going to go on to \"Crocodile Dundee in LA,\" or even \"Robocop 3\" infamy.I'm giving this 2 stars because I did enjoy the soundtrack as much as the first and because, as many have referred to this as a \"guilty pleasure,\" I'll likely succumb to curiosity and watch dumpster fire part III like Cersei walking through Kings' Landing ...

Not have sex for 50 minutes and 20 minutes of the actual storyline. I would like to believe that this movie isn't porn and it has something meaningful to its storyline- even fairytales aren't all magic and rubbish at least I really liked part 1 of this movie. Who killed Massimo's dad??- it was revealed that his twin was involved but that was only a short scene towards the end! Now I have to wait another year(s) for part three and God so help me if there are not more important stuff like more scenes on mafia rivalry, Nacho's dad and what tf his problem is, who survived and finally the two main characters getting to trust themselves other than having great sex all the time I'll be forced to hate this movie and currently fifty shades of grey is incomparable! I'm expecting a lot from part 3 stop wasting money and round this movie up. Laura is a fool for not confronting Massimo first- maybe she just wanted to get away :) all in all the movie is really nice and it's a great watch ;)REAL SPOILER: I can't believe Massimo was so faithful to Laura!!

I have not read the books, I don't know if the dialogues are as corny as they are in this film. But jesus christ, everything that came out of the actors' mouths were like sharp nails on a chalkboard. But beyond the arguably worst dialogue in the history of professionally produced filmmaking, the whole thing looks like a collage of rap music videos, something like how \"new money\" people would imagine being rich looks like. Scenes don't add to a story. They are just there to fill the time.Otherwise, it's clearly not amateur camera work. Actors, are not even particularly bad. The lead guy can give face and emotions. People who performed miles worse in previous jobs ended up wining Oscars in their subsequent works in the past.But the script... I have seen nothing like it. There is clearly something wrong at Netflix, if they can't turn down this script, ask the writers to \"kindly revise\".",

The acting of the lead couple is terrible neither can act to save their life. Michelle Morrone was more like a supporting actor in this movie, very few dialogues or scenes of any substance. His acting as his twin brother was so cringeworthy and as Massimo was the same expressions nothing new. Anna is not even worthy of being called a actress she's terrible.2. Sex scenes didn't look natural or sensual it was more like porn where they were performing for a camera. The scenes were thrown in all over the place with no relevance to what was going on in the movie.3. There was no storyline this was more like music video which they are trying to show a story in and failed it.4. The ending was rubbish no climax no real build up or gripping stuff, we all know Laura will survive that bullet for the third torture part which I hear will be released later this year.If you have a lot of spare time and want to waste 1 hour 50 minutes of your time then watch it.

            "content": "Those who are saying there's no plot until the end clearly don't know how to comprehend a storyline. The first half of this movie heavily focuses on the chemistry between Massimo and Laura. She almost died in the first movie and they start the movie off with the wedding. After the amount of sex in the first movie, why wouldn't you think there would be a ton in the second movie?The heavy sex is to portray how there is so much physical love in the relationship but then once the honeymoon is over, you start to see Laura is bored and needs more than just physical affection. You watch the relationship grow. Massimo starts listening to Laura's needs and buys her a clothing line. He also tries to open up to her about family but you can tell he's not fully ready to discuss that further yet. The growth in this relationship is why it's so shocking that Massimo would cheat on her with Anna.While Laura is completely betrayed by Massimo, she never fully gives herself to Nacho. I think deep down she always knew what he was and while she started to slowly move on, she was still very hurt and loyal to Massimo. She also got a lot less out of Nacho than she did from Massimo. She would have been in the same relationship; however, Massimo actually attempted to make adjustments for her.If you can't see the plot or how beautifully this movie transitions, then you just have comprehension issues. Could the movie have been better? Sure. But it's not the bad movie everyone here makes it out to be. There is plot, it's beautifully filmed, has an amazing soundtrack, and the characters are developed very nicely. Have an open mind.If I were to suggest any changes, I think the trilogy could use some more action/violence - after all its a mafia movie. We need answers as to what really happened in the tunnel, so flashbacks to that would be great. Other than that, I think they're doing great and I'm super excited for the next movie.",

I had reviewed the first part as well and so, here we go with my take on the latest one.First the plot : Don Massimo (Michele Morrone) and Laura ( Anna-Maria Sieklucka) get wedded and go for their honeymoon to continue what they did all through the first part. After all kinds of kinky sex, Laura discovers that Massimo is cheating on her and runs away with her gardener (Simone Sussina) whom she develops a crush on...To be fair, This Day has a semblance of a plot unlike the original which was just an apology to portray continuous love making scenes. Here, the prime characters like Laura are developed a wee bit even as the sex scenes keep popping up frequently either in reality or a wet dream!! The climax is again kept open ended hinting at a further sequel which I believe is in the making..Of the cast, Anna-Maria shows improvement from before but the same can't be said for her co-actor Michele. Overall, 365 Days : This Day can be tried by those who have seen the first part though it is not something I would wholeheartedly recommend.Strictly adults viewing please!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

            "content": "There was only one reason to watch the first movie 365 Days: Michele Marrone. The sequel offers two: Michele Marrone and Simone Susinna. Each is a delicious feast for the eye, both are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. What a pleasure to see truly handsome tall masculine men instead of the usual Hollywood approved quirky short \"interesting\" male leads.365 Days: This Day doesn't deserve the scorn it's received from so many critics. The movies are based on books written by a woman for women. They are romantic erotica and don't pretend to be anything more than fluffy fantasy.Is that so wrong? Of course not. There is definitely a place for dreams of having a powerful alpha-male setting his beautiful brown-eyed sights on a woman he woos and eventually wins. It's the stuff of legend, a story as old as time.Those who claim the situation is rape-y are not correct. Massimo makes it very clear that he won't force Laura to do anything she's not ready to do. And while he employs rather outrageous means of \"showing her what she's missing\" he's true to his word.It is Laura who initiates their first sexual encounter after Massimo rescues her from drowning, puts her to bed and moves to leave her alone to get some rest. The scenes that follow have had the whole world talking for the last two years. And for good reason.Disappointingly the sex in This Day isn't as powerful or erotic in spite of the actors and scriptwriters getting \"creative.\" One of the sexiest scenes in the movie is of Massimo and Nacho (Susinna) loading up and striding on long legs to rescue Laura. T levels through the roof!While Simone Susinna is, if possible, even better looking than Michele Marrone his Nacho and Laura have little to no chemistry and their relationship seems contrived.And speaking of Laura, has there ever been a luckier actress? However in my view she was miscast in this role. While attractive, certainly, she doesn't possess the beauty and charisma to realistically portray a woman a man like Massimo would spend five years searching the globe to find. Costume, makeup and hair design did nothing to enhance whatever assets she does have. The decision to die her hair jet black was unfortunate, the actress is much more striking with her own natural blond.Much of the criticism of both movies comes largely from those who think it outrageous that stories written by a Polish Wattpad author and turned into cheeky movies by two unknown Polish and Italian film makers can become a Netflix, of all things, phenomenon. That is the province and privilege of Hollywood alone in their view.Both the first movie and its sequel are harmless fun with good music. Morrone, also a singer, performs many of the songs that add much to the sensual feel. Gorgeous European countryside also contributes a sense of romance.",

            "content": "The original Polish film was essentially Fifty Shades of Grey crossed with a Stockholm Syndrome situation, it ended on a cliffhanger, so a sequel was pretty inevitable, but I did not have my hopes high it would be any better. Basically, Sicilian Mafia crime family leader Massimo Torricelli (Michele Morrone) and his Polish lover Laura Biel (Anna-Maria Sieklucka) are getting married. Laura may have survived the accident inside the tunnel, but she lost her baby. Her friend Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) says she should tell Massimo the truth, as she never told him that she was pregnant, but Laura is concerned of Massimo's reaction. The wedding goes ahead successfully inside a church with all friends and family of the couple witnessing. Massimo and Laura drive away and begin their honeymoon in a bedroom with her tying his hands to the chair. After undressing she pleasures herself with a dildo and he watches lustfully. Eventually she unties him, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Domenico (Otar Saralidze), one of Massimo's Italian men, is getting closer to Olga. Massimo and Laura spend the next few days playing a naughty game of golf (with the ball aimed at a different hole!), horse riding on the beach, making love in a hot tub and in a swimming pool, and swimming with little to no clothing in the sea. Later, Domenico and Olga are caught by Massimo and Laura while she is in her underwear while he is naked with her eating fruit and licking cream from his chest. Laura and Olga go to dinner; Olga gives her an idea for a sexual encounter with her husband. One day, while making love, Massimo leaves Laura in bed after receiving a business call. Laura again catches Domenico and Olga having sex in the bathroom. Laura and Olga spend the day together driving a sports care and at the beach. Masssimo interrupts the friends having lunch and insists that they leave. She berates him for now allowing her to have her own space now and then. One day, Laura meets Massimo's new gardener Marcelo \"Nacho\" Matos (Simone Susinna), nicknamed after his Spanish roots, and may be attracted to him. They strike up a conversation which becomes flirtatious. Later, Massimo and Laura spend Christmas with her parents, Olga, and Domenico. Massimo and Laura reconcile and passionately kiss, while Domenico proposes marriage to Olga, which she accepts. That night, Massimo and Laura spend the evening pleasuring each other and having sex with several sex toys. They lay in bed together talking about the accident and he reveals that he has a brother whom she never knew about. Laura and Olga spend the time at a luxury clothes store, owned by fashionista Emily (Natalia Siwiec) to try on a few dresses. Laura mentions that she is angry with Massimo but does not explain why. Massimo and Laura attend a party, and she sees him later in the evening upstairs with a blonde woman, ex-girlfriend Anna (Natasza Urbanska). She heads upstairs down many corridors until she catches Massimo having sex with Anna, she smiles at Laura while continuing to be penetrated, but Laura walks out before he can see her. She runs in devastation and is found by Nacho who offers to drive her away. The following morning he offers to take her away to collect her thoughts. Laura calls her mother to tell her that her previous suspicions of Massimo were right, and that she is leaving, she says she will call again in a few days, before throwing her phone over a cliff edge. Nacho takes Laura to his father's house. Laura's mother Klara (Ewa Kasprzyk) confronts Massimo about what Laura told her on the phone and tells him that they are going back to Poland. Massimo is confused about what has happened and starts searching for Laura. She meanwhile meets Nacho's pregnant sister Amelia (Karolina Pisarek) and enjoys her new life on the island. Massimo meets with Anna to try and find out what has happened to Laura, but she does not give him any answers and tries to flirt with him. Laura and Nacho start to get closer but do not give into their feelings. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Massimo's identical twin brother Adriano (Michele Morrone) posed as Massimo to be caught by Laura having sex with Anna. During the night, Laura dreams of making love to Nacho. When she wakes up, Nacho is fighting an intruder, later revealed to be a man sent by Massimo, possibly an assassin. Laura and Nacho go jet skiing and have a day at the beach. Laura later has further fantasies, dreaming of kissing Nacho in the ocean, and then him giving her cunnilingus. Laura starts enjoying her life on the island and at the same time she fantasises about having sex with Nacho. Laura has had enough of Nacho hardly telling her anything about his background; he finally admits his father Fernando (Ramon Langa) is the head of a local Mafia crime family, rival of her husband's family. Meanwhile, Massimo meets with Don Matos, who says Nacho lured Laura in as part of his plan to go against the rival crime family, though it was her own decision to come with him. Meanwhile, Laura is in a courtyard and encounters who she thinks is Massimo, but realises it is his twin brother Adriano. He tells her he wants to get rid of Massimo, before Anna walks in with a gun, she wants revenge for being abandoned by Massimo. Nacho brings Massimo to where Laura is located, and a stand-off begins, with Adriano holding Laura with a gun and Anna pointing hers at Laura. After Adriano tries to antagonise his brother, Laura breaks his hold of her and runs towards Massimo and Nacho. Anna shoots Laura in the back, Nacho shoots and kills Anna, and Massimo kills his brother with a gunshot. As Laura is unconscious on the floor bleeding, Nacho turns his gun at Massimo and momentarily aims it at his head, before lowering it and walking away. It ends with Massimo holding Laura in his arms, Adriana and Anna lie dead on the floor, but it is unclear if Laura will survive being shot. Also starring Dariusz Jakubowski as Tomasz Biel, Laura's father, Tomasz Mandes as Tommaso, Massimo's cousin, and Robert Wabich as Priest. Morrone is good looking, he also plays a newly introduced evil twin brother, and Sieklucka is beautiful, while Susinna is a good-looking gardener fighting for her affections. The chemistry between the two original leads and the lead female and the new love interest are fine, but like its predecessor the story seems less important compared to the scenes of softcore porn style sex and the extravagant locations, and the soundtrack dominating scenes can be hit and miss, another silly erotic romantic drama. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Remake, Rip-Off and Sequel (with 365 Days: This Day), and Worst Screen Combo for The 365 Days Sequels. Adequate!",

It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!Unlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!There's even some minor neat cinematography, too.

Nope again - the story has a twist - which is rather lame. Even there is no mentionable character development. The protagonists are doing their mistakes again and again (even though \"she claims\" to learn out of her prior mistakes).Maybe it is advertisement? Regrettable even the featured products (for example a beautiful Bugatti Chiron) are cut short. You could not even use the movie to use as screensaver (e.g. In an electronic store) - the few sex scenes are not really adequate for this use.Instead this movie is dipping its toes into different genres but unfortunately never commits.Well - maybe it is a dating movie - not intense enough to be a direct sign, but not interesting enough - so it gives plenty time of another focus.

The twist was good for the story but the character wasn't on screen enough to get a real feel of how we should feel towards them. Adding in a new got guy just made it messier.

Somewhere a long the story, the characters did deeply fall in love. In 365...it was the chase of Massimo and Laura falling in love. In This day, it is them getting married. There is a plot despite what some are saying. Laura believes Massimo cheated on her, but he didn't. It was his evil twin brother. Then comes the character of Macho, who saves Laura and she does sleep with him, I think. At least she has a lot of dreams of doing it with him.Macho cares about Laura, but there was no love connection. Laura heart belongs to Massimo. Dramatic ending with Laura getting shot and his evil twin also getting shot and Macho walking away. I'm sure both are alive and the story will continue in the newly released The next 365 Days. I'm hoping for a conclusion of the story in the The Next because this series of movies can only go on for so long.The sex scenes are at times hot and excited, but most of the time the scenes were over the top with the director showing that he's running out of ways for the couple to make love. I wasn't feeling the sex toys scene. Seems a little out of place because Laura and Massimo tend to bring their own heat.I give this title 4 stars for the love story, some sexy scenes, and the acting. The acting isn't top notch, but I've seen worst in my life.",

In fact, This Day added things that weren't in the second novel. I can say that I was really disappointed with how Laura Beal's character was so whiny and needy. In 365DNI she was much stronger and I admired how she took over the situation of her kidnapping (Some critics compared it to Stockholm Syndrome. NOT!). Also, I hated the ending of this movie.

Why are we still watching these two characters who I wasn't even rooting for in the first place just laying around being some of the most unlikable characters I have seen in awhile. It's not like the screenwriters thought to write a story that has us follow these characters through a relatable emotional journey like The Before Trilogy did no, its just music video after music video and maybe 15 minutes in total of plot comes up mostly at the end of the movie. And spoiler alert I still don't like them after this movie. If anything I dislike them even more cause they somehow act even dumber and more insane. The movie if you want to call it that does not earn its over hour and forty minute run time. It felt like an eternity watching this.

Why this one has the lowest ratings is beyond my comprehension. The \"music video\" cinematography is perhaps the weakest aspect. There was probably only a page of dialogue for all characters combined, lol. However, the film almost completely rids of the male gaze and toxic masculinity undertones. You can tell this film was primarily directed by a woman. The camera shots on Laura's pleasure were clear. It focuses on her experience, not Massimo's. There wasn't a single BJ scene ! Also, it shows a bit more chemistry between Laura and Massimo. She is laughing and smiling with him. We even get a small, but significant smile from Massimo. Additionally, it shows Laura and her friend Olga having fun at fancy restaurants and clubs ! This is good ! The writers finally realised that women like buildup and emotional intimacy.Nacho brings some more conflict and plot to the film. However, he's not a bad guy at all. He is more emotional than Massimo. Which is why I am #TeamNacho. His name may be ridiculous, but he is gentle and compassionate, unlike Massimo.Besides the excessive use of music and the cheesy film archetypes (love triangle, evil twin, etc.), this film was decent. I was not uncomfortable in any of the scenes. My rating was 5/10 because it is not a quality film in a general sense. You cannot take it seriously.

But I think the writers and producers of this follow-on made the mistake of thinking the only reason people watched the first (and hence the second) was for sex. Newsflash - we're in 2022, we can get soft (or hard) porn any day of the week. If we're watching a film, we also expect a bit of a storyline to go with it.This film is so full of (bad) soundtracks and (cliched) montages, it looks like a naff 80s pop video. I think there are about 4 songs in the first 17 minutes of this film alone. It's sex for the sake of sex, and because all the plotline and tension has been lost, it's about as erotic as watching two gibbons mate at Whipsnade. Also, the way those two kiss is quite disgusting - the face-licking and open-mouthed salivating. The two main actors actually become incredibly unattractive.The 'plot', for what its worth (when it gets going) doesn't really mean much. The acting is either wooden or OTT (the 'baddies' are like parodies of baddies). And let's not even start on how bad the English language parts are. Now I know that, in real life, non native speakers of English will muddle tenses etc, and that's charming and perfectly acceptable. But in a film, it's grating to hear someone say, for example, 'You've got to take responsibility of your own life' rather than for your own life. Maybe this scripting was intentional. But it just feels amateur when, in reality, many people who speak English as a second language can do so fluently. It was just one more thing, on top of the lousy acting, that's going to jar with an audience, as it makes the scriptwriting values look as shoddy as the rest of it.All in all, I'd say to give this film a miss, even if you liked/loved the first one. If you watch it, you WILL be disappointed.",

He wasn't in it! That's my point he made a wise choice! I'm angry that I am actually writing a negative review because I feel I'm cheating on Massimo BUT come on this was bad like really bad! There was no acting, no story line, no talking or anything for the first hour perhaps???? It was tacky! And a waste of beautiful looking actors, scenery, properties and cars it just wasn't a film! I think the writer just got lucky with good looking actors, it was an extended model photo shoot end of there was just nothing, nothing! I'm annoyed like really annoyed. A honeymoon whereby they didn't talk just a few outfit changes and a few 15 second clips, no actual relationship just sex! And then when I finally heard some speaking I checked and only had 15 minutes of the film left! I thought there was a mistake on my Netflix account I was about to log out and sign back in or cancel the whole subscription! I hate knocking people down but the writer failed massively!!!!!

Everyone stuck at home with nothing to do, and this masterpiece came about, blessed everyones lives and was the hot topic for a while. With a good plot, and an edging cliffhanger, many, like me, were itching to know when a part 2 was going to arrive and expected it to be nothing less than the part 1. Well, like I said, it's what we expected.10 Seconds into this and you can tell that the cliff hanger from the first one was completely ignored. I mean seriously? Who ends a movie with the star getting kidnapped and starts a new one aimlessly ignoring the fact that it happened and carrying on about their day? This irked my soul in ways I thought impossible. Proceeding, I thought perhaps I'd give this the benefit of the doubt neglecting the fact that I wanted to watch this to know what had happened to Laura after she had gotten kidnapped. WRONG DECISION! Aimless sex scenes, plots with no direction, unnecessary characters, and I could keep going. For starters, the introduction of nacho was entirely too brief. No backstory, no lead up, no follow up, no NOTHING. Just some Gardner who happened to know Massimo and killed Massimo's twin? Yeah cus that makes sense. And when the hell did Massimo get a twin? No follow up on that either nor a build up. This whole thing didn't make sense.It felt like Olga's story line was way more interesting than that of Laura's and Massimo's. Laura's was just sex, and emphasising on the fact that she now trusted him, but there was no plot line at all in this movie; just sex, 3 seconds of Massimo's 'twin' cheating, nacho coming in to somehow save the day out of nowhere, and then massimo being kicked out as boss. How do you go from getting married and letting Laura have her own business to being overthrown as a mafia boss? Why would you give Laura the plot of having her own fashion business and not even follow it up? Disgusting ah nausea ga nayo.Anyways I'm disappointed, so 4/10.",

They only whisper to each other and have s.x, all the time and do nothing else. It was like looking a soft porn movie where showing s.x scenes was the main goal. And on the end finally they realized they forgot to film the real story, did this quick and guess what, Laura is shot and lies dying in his arms. Oh my.... she is again dying? Nice cliffhanger for next film where of course she came back to life again and they can f...on. I skipped the film after s.x scen 10 to the end and went to watch a nicer film with more story.",
