You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now I want more.",

Pretty much everything else about the show falls flat for me. The plot really doesn't work for me. It reminds me of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Riverdale. It doesn't feel creative or inventive at all and just doesn't work for me. The whole \"school for outsiders\" thing plus murder mystery just wasn't a hit in my opinion. I also wasn't impressed with the casting of Morticia and Gomez and their relationship with Wednesday. Overall, it feels very YA so maybe it's just meant for a younger crowd.",

The first episode gave me hope that her character wasn't going to be messed with, as in watered down into a more friendly Wednesday. However, it turned out I was wrong, as by the end she was hugging her room mate.That said it wasn't a bad series, it just felt watered down from what it could have been, as is the case with most of what Netflix produce. The story kept me interested throughout and kept me guessing till the end. But ultimately this is typical Netflix fare, nothing too demanding and nothing surprising or shocking. It might sound harsh to some, but Netflix really has become the streaming service of mediocre TV production.",

Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",

Uncle Fester was okay as well. And Thing, but, ya know, he's a hand. The casting for the rest of the Addams however, I didn't like; they just didn't capture the essence of the characters in my eyes.This series had its moments, but as a whole I just didn't get what I was hoping for and was left a bit disappointed.",

(yes, I am listening to APOCALYPTICA: Nothing Else Matters as I write this)It's dark, with some clever word play to give it a lighter tone at times as a nod to the older shows but...it's not a comedy.

This is not even adjacent to that one let alone a spin off, sure some of the characters share the name and aesthetic but that's about it. It's a show for grade schoolers only packaged in a dark aesthetic. Think the new Sabrina mixed in with Riverdale.Jenna Ortega (as Wednesday) was amazing and the saving grace of this show. She killed it every second she was on screen, most of the humor worked because of her delivery.The costume and set designs were also striking... but then you have the actual plot and writing.The character development is nada. The world building is so simplified that it's down right childish. Some of the lines were good but that was only because of Jenna Ortega delivery, more often than not the show dipped into cheesy and cringe territory. The CGI monster... was something else.Overall this show is a 4/10, it gets two extra stars for the acting alone but that's about it.",

            "content": "I've rewrote this review because 1) I finally finished the season and 2) Because I came to a better understand.Now, of course, I could've been even more cruel and title this review \"Scooby Doo goes to Hogwarts to meet the X-Men\" but I'm trying not to offend anyone (too much). After all, there is a connection of Scooby Doo and the Addams Family as far back as the 70s.With the promise I made to my 10 year old niece, I forced myself to finish the first season. In the original review I wrote here, I was saying that: \"I'm at episode 3 and it is painful. It was a struggle to watch the first episode, but the more it goes on, the worse it gets.\"But before I (and others) come to conclusions, I (we) need to understand some things clear: This is a coming-of-age series made for the adolescents of today. It is not for adults specifically, it is not R-Rated and most of all, we must understand that the new generation of teenagers are different from the teenagers we were. The difference in generations must be taken into account. After all, those who are fans of the 90s movies (like myself) will also see the 60s series differently, and the 60s fans (such as our parents) will see the 90s movies differently. I'll come to this subject again later in the review.Now my thoughts.While this has all the necessary 'tools' to be great, it just isn't (in my opinion). We have a cast with great actors such as Christina Ricci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman, Gwendoline Christie and the new star Jenna Ortega who is really really good. We have Tim Burton who directed four episodes. We have music of Danny Elfman on four episodes. We have Romania, who could've been used as it is, instead of turning it into an American land. Even with all of this, it just couldn't deliver (to me).It has nothing to do with the madness of the Addams Family tradition, it's more like a fantastic world of J. K. Rowling after listening to Bauhaus, while at the same time talking in teenage internet language. Painfully cringe, many times predictable. All the goth stuff you can think of, it's here, but presented in a way that is, like I said, cringe. I'm expecting that in a future episode we'll see Wednesday drinking absinthe in a cemetery and reading Poe's poems, or maybe using some Book of Shadows, Ouja Board and some occult-themed stuff (which wouldn't be new, but lets see how predictable this show will be). The grandiose moment when Wednesday pronounces \"mansplaining\", you know you got a Netflix production.While the Addams family of the 90s (both the movies and the animated series which I loved as a kid) had a darker humor that made you laugh, here I didn't even smirk. Maybe I'm just one of the old generation that is lost in the past and can't connect with today's generation, and I'm stuck with the rather more offensive, darker humor of those movies. The humor in here is just too mainstream, too gentle, too clich\u00e9. Looking at the high praises given here in the reviews, and then going to the profiles of the people who wrote them, I understand that this is a tv series that is great for the teenagers of today. The generations differ, that is clear in many aspects, and this is one example. That doesn't mean I'm right and they are wrong, of course. The same is for me, who as a 90s Addams Family fan can't really enjoy the first shows from the 60s to the fullest, or even the 1998 adaptations which were truly horrible (even though Nicole Fugere was great and I was in love with her when I was a kid). I didn't even bother to watch the 2019 and 2021 animated movies. So Wednesday 2022 is not the worst.Even so. You can't even tell it's a Tim Burton movie. I don't know what happened to Burton, but after Sweeney Todd he seems to have lost his brilliance. Yes, Dark Shadows and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children might have a bit of his touch, but not in the way we think of him. When you say Tim Burton you say Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Corpse Bride and even though not directed by him, the classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Adding an Addams Family would've been a must-have in his profile, but this one just didn't work out.The school for weirdos is actually more normal than the school I was at. The principle of the school (Gwendoline Christie) is out of character and more of a 'normie' than a 'weirdo'. The other actors are so plain that I can't even remember their names. There were those two teenagers in the bookshop trying to flirt as in a 80s teen movie. I don't remember their names, but that moment was so cringe I felt like screaming and slamming my face in the monitor. I guess I can be Wednesday too. I think that Thing has the best acting. Oh, and Christina Ricci is doing a good job at... whatever she's supposed to do/be in the film (later edit: found out her role in film and it's good, but her character's final discovery was made in a mediocre style). With all the respect I have for Catherine Zeta-Jones, she just doesn't make you feel like she makes a good Morticia, as for Luiz Guzman, again, not a good fit for a fantasy style movie (he will always be El Cid for me: from Oz). However, the worst character and actor here is Fred Armisen/Uncle Fester. When the guy came out I thought that he's like a villain from a Fox Kids/Nickeldeon/Nick Jr. Production who happened to steal Cruella de Vil's motorcycle while having Raiden's electric superpowers. What-is-this?! Compare Fred's Uncle Fester with Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester and you'll see the HUGE difference.There are some good things here and there, and the dance scene is indeed great, Jena's moves and stare are perfect! The scene when she speaks in German to the tourists is also great, and it's something that really brings the real character of Wednesday as known in the Addams Family tradition. The piranha scene is also characteristic to Wednesday we all know and love. The scene when she plays the cello is also amazing, it actually gave me chills (good ones). The sword fight is great as well, her fighting skills in general are great. \"Thing\" being portrayed very human-like in character/personality (like he's one who likes to take care of his skin) is really cool as well.Yes, goth girl goes to Hogwarts. This is so much like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Harry Potter, Scooby Doo and X-men that is so far from the original idea and charm of the Addams Family. Drop some teenage hormones, since it's a Netflix production, and there you have it. Enjoy the stew!",

In what is supposed to be a constant tongue-in-cheek flirtatious relationship is completely annihilated by the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones wouldn't be in a romantic relationship with Luis Guzman, ever. My ability to suspend disbelief was impossible watching those 2 on screen.It's not just physical, either. Luis plays Gomez's dialogue...very strangely. Like a raspy whisper. I do not understand this choice. Any time those 2 are on screen I lose all interest in watching.The main storyline isn't compelling enough for me to stay. Yet another IP mined by Netflix for nostalgia yet they then completely ignore the nostalgic bits that made it popular in the first place. What's the point? There is none. Like this series.",

Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series...

            "content": "I only watched the first episode of Wednesday and feel uncertain about continuing with the series. The music and special effects are amazing! As well as the actress who plays Wednesday. The huge downfall is that in the series, Wednesday and the Addams Family are seen as \"mean spirited.\" That is not how the original series was at all. In the original series, The Addams Family, the family loved being weird, and could not understand why a normal society, (seen as strange to the family) could not accept them. They still loved each other, and were kind and considerate to each other. The pairings of John Astin and Carolyn Jones as Gomez and Mortica, along with Ken Weatherwax as Pugsley. And Lisa Loring as Wednesday showed a family that loved and cared about each other. Who all liked to do strange things. But they almost never had evil intent to hurt others. In contrast, they would feel puzzled about why a visitor's behavior in their home would feel strange to them. To the Addams Family, they saw their world as perfectly normal, but very rarely would they act or react with threats of violence, unless a visitor was really a threat to them. However, the Netflix series, Wednesday tries to compensate the flawed premise of Wednesday Addams being evil, by using great music and special effects. The result is brilliant CGI animation and music. But this can't save the flawed characterization of Wednesday as mean-spirited, when the real Wednesday Addams was not. Fans of the classic 1960's show may want to stick with the original series for these reasons.",

I didn't care for the X-Men like school of odd balls or the ScubbyDoo Mystery at the heart of the film. This show just had too much of a Disney vibe to it, especially with the casting. Yeah, this wasn't for me but perhaps it will appeal to the newer generation who grew up with the X-men, Umbrella Company comic book films. Sad, because I thought the first episode was good.

They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in.

Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.Rather than compete with the beautiful Angelica Houston, Catherine Zeta Jones brings her own interpretation to Morticia while Luis Guzman brings to life the Gomez Addams as he appeared in the original New Yorker Cartoons. This is a smart move because when it comes to the late, great Raul Julia.... Well, just don't. There's just no replacing him so sidestepping that issue was the best thing they could do..

There was no relation between the real Gomez and this mess. There is absolutely zero chemistry between Gomez and Morticia, which was their major defining characteristic. How do you remove a major component of something and expect it to work? It's like taking 3 wheels off a car and expecting it to still drive.I believe Catherine Zeta-Jones could have been a great Morticia but just like Guzman it didn't feel like there was any relation between the real Morticia and this version. When she kissed Gomez it looked like she was thinking \"I'm not getting paid enough for this crap.\"Pugsley is a sniveling little wus. I can only assume they made him that way to try and boost Wednesday's girl power image. Whatever the reason it's pretty sad.Wednesday herself seems to track reasonably well with how an angry angsty teenage girl acts, though being played by a 20 year old is stretching it.About the only original characters not a major disappointment are Lurch and Thing.The secondary characters are shallow and predictable stereotypes. I'm not sure if they wrote them with the intention of making them as annoying as possible or it just came organically but they could have done much better.I made it through 2 episodes before I couldn't take anymore. There's no hook to the show. They try to position several mysteries but none are compelling. Just a yawn fest.Overall, the show is just trading on The Addams Family name with no real connection to the original.",

In this new series, they have completely trashed what made the original so wonderful - their love and support of each other and how they embraced and cherished their \"weirdness\".This show does none of that. Now I read through many 8, 9, and 10 star reviews and if they are legitimate reviews then I am happy so many enjoy this show. But I find those that rated it around 4, 5, and 6 stars seem more in touch with the reality that this show misses the mark in many areas.So if you like it, that is great!

            "content": "As the title suggests this spin off from 'The Addams Family' is centred on daughter Wednesday. In the opening scenes Wednesday is expelled from school for releasing piranhas into the swimming pool... while it was in use. She is sent to Nevermore, the boarding school for outcasts that her parents attended. Even here she doesn't really fit in. Soon after she arrives she witnesses a monster kill one of the students; unfortunately nobody believes her so she decides to investigate herself. This leads to some trouble with the local sheriff who has history with her family. She must also contend with her developing psychic power and other students, including her perky werewolf roommate who is determined to be friends.I never watched the original TV version of 'The Addams Family', but enjoyed the 1990s films, so for me Christina Ricci is Wednesday Addams... at least she was until I watched this. Thankfully the makers took the character in a somewhat different direction; she is still morbid and dressed in black but this Wednesday is older, not as pale and rather than having a large forehead has a fringe that almost covers her eyes... This meant that it was very easy to accept somebody else in the role. Jenna Ortega does a really fine job; she really makes the character her own. The other characters are interesting and the cast is solid. The story provides laughs, thrills and some good scary moments. The various special effects, especially the monster, are really good. The central mystery develops nicely. This is nicely intertwined with various single episode plots. The main mystery is nicely wrapped up in a single season but the end clearly hints at an intention to make more... I certainly hope they do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of 'The Addams Family'; scary scenes mean it is probably unsuitable for younger children.",

She loves the classy dark gothic clothes. It is half half here. Sometimes she really looks like Wednesday's taste ,but sometimes not. Wednesday also doesn't really stay with neutral face the whole time. In old movies and cartoons if you'd like sometimes she does show some emotion no matter is it when she tries to be spooky or jokingly spooky or tired of crap. What is it with Gomez?

            "content": "I'm not an especially fervent fan of the Addams Family so won't hold it against this spinoff that it doesn't follow its predecessor material 100% faithfully. However, it does seem to make some fundamental errors that go against the core of the Addams appeal. Firstly, a lot of the charm of the Addams' is them being unaware of how bizarre and frightening their macabre interests and lifestyle are to the people they encounter. To that end, Wednesday has too few such moments of juxtaposition and almost none of the Addams quirkiness is met with anything more than a quizzical look. That is partly down to the Addams feeling a bit watered down in this spinoff, but is mostly due to a bigger problem the series has: it's choice of world. Choosing to have the show take place in a school full of supernatural characters much of who are weirder & arguably more interesting than the Addams robs Wednesday of a lot of her uniquity. Where the Addams could previously shine against human foes, being a bit goth around actual vampires, werewolves and sirens seems a bit underwhelming.The series then also weirdly seems to forget that the show should be about Wednesday, and instead becomes a run-of-the-mill supernatural detective story that wouldn't seem out of place in half a dozen other series. You can replace Wednesday with any other character and the storyline wouldn't change much. Wednesday feels like a supporting character in someone else's mystery. Laurel Gates (not an established villain of the Addams) has come back to Jericho to exact revenge on the people she feels took everything from her family. She uses a Hyde to carry out her murderous plan which involves killing a coroner and mayor involved in a coverup, and destroying the school of outcasts that her family spent their lives fighting against. None of this really involves the Addams. There's a loose connection that's tried to be established - Laurel's brother was in love with Morticia and when tasked by his father to poison the school of outcasts, he instead goes after Gomez in a jealous rage and dies in the ensuing fight. It's quite a weak attempt to shoehorn the Addams into this mystery and the series itself seems to know this as Gates vs Addams isn't really the focus of the conflict, it's more Gates vs Nevermore. This becomes even more apparent when you consider that Laurel started her plan of revenge about a year before Wednesday was unexpectedly sent to Nevermore and so her plan wouldn't have involved the Addams at all.Lastly, the series throws in some tiresome modern social politics that all shows nowadays can't seem to help themselves doing. It's a bit too on the nose most times. When Xavier offers some advice to Wednesday about her visions, she says he's \"mansplaining\" them to her - visions she admits she only started having a couple months prior and doesn't know when they happen or how to control them, and Xavier's advice was coming from his dad who had been living with visions for decades. But sure, let's just tell him he's mansplaining. Enid's struggle with not having become a werewolf takes on a not-so-subtle parallel to gender identity when her mother suggests she goes for \"lycanthropy conversion therapy camps\". I don't know what it is about modern writers but they can't seem to get across admirable messages of acceptance, overcoming adversity, defying expectations etc without it coming across as preachy, jarring or having to put another group down in the process.The rest of the Addams, though they have little screen time, leave a bit to be desired. Pugsley is for some reason weak and defenseless when he should be just as intimidating and frightening to 'normies' as Wednesday is. Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman also just don't have the chemistry to match up to the iconic duo of Angelica Huston and Raul Julia.Jenna Ortega however does a sterling job as Wednesday; her delivery and timing is spot on but the script still somehow makes her feel tragically underutilized in a series that should be about her. Thing is excellently done and is probably the best portrayal of the character yet. The soundtrack is also commendable, in particular instrumental versions of Nothing Else Matters and Paint it, Black are superb. Gwendolyn Christie is also very enjoyable as an antagonist to Wednesday though succumbs to a cliched end.I overall still enjoyed the season, my few gripes don't detract too much from the positives and I'd be happy if a season 2 was announced.",

First, the character of Gomez Addams is extremely awful, Mortica is boring, Pugsley is a non-entity, and they even manage to make Lurch and Thing uninteresting. The Wednesday character is easily the best of the bunch, but that's not saying much. And, true to the usual nauseating Netflix wokeness, all of the male characters are violent and/or dimwits.I barely made it through the first episode, and based on the previews, it looks like it'll turn into a lame ripoff of Harry Potter.

Ricci's Wednesday wasn't self-absorbed or angst-ridden, she was part of the family unit and wasn't constantly out to prove herself. She was already confident and didn't need to be rude or defensive. She was mature beyond her years. She didn't want to die, she was interested in death.And while I know this show is focused on the one character, I find the absence of the family-first value we got in the earlier renditions of the Addams' to be off-putting.Maybe it's just not for someone of my generation, we already had our Wednesday Addams, and this one is just too hateful.",

Which is saying a lot because Melissa Hunter's 'Adult Wednesday Addams' was pretty amazing as well.I won't give away any spoilers. I'll simply say this is a must see entry for any Addams Family fans. I like Luiz Guzman's Gomez better than John Astin but not as well as Raul Julia. Catherine Zeta-Jones is servicable as Morticia but no one will every be able to own role as Carolyn Jones did, and Anjelica Huston was a little more enjoyable as well.The supporting Nevermore cast were all quite good as well.

            "content": "\"The Addams Family\" films are among my all-time favourites, and I had high hopes for this series considering Tim Burton is again in the directing role. But to my surprise almost every aspect of this series is simply wrong.One main problem here is the core concept. The Addams family is supposed to be a eccentric or weird family, and the main conflict in their stories -as well as one of the main sources of comedy- comes from the conflict between this family and the \"normal world\" that surrounds them. But in this series Wednesday goes to a school for misfits with supernatural powers, among which we can find vampires and werewolves. They seem much more dangerous and even more interesting than Wednesday. So anything special about the character is simply gone out the window from the start. What could possibly be interesting about Wednesday, if she's surrounded by actual monsters? She's just a girl who says creepy things. Strangely, characters around her still act like they're scared of her, which makes no sense whatsoever. Shouldn't they be more scared of the actual vampires and werewolves in the school?Another big problem is the casting. I can't imagine for a second that Catherine Zeta-Jones (Morticia) and Luis Guzm\u00e1n (Gomez) are a couple. And apparently they neither, because they don't seem eager to touch each other. Pugsley doesn't look like Pugsley. Uncle Fester doesn't look like Uncle Fester. Every character seems off. And the title character most than anyone. Jenna Ortega has a \"sexy latina\" look that certainly doesn't match the Wednesday Addams style. Characters around her call her \"pale\", but she seems to have a healthy tan. Shouldn't a teenage Wednesday look like a stereotypical gothic girl? Is that so difficult to do? Also, for someone who is pretending to be a cold, unexpressive killer, Jenna Ortega seems too emotional. It's the most unconvincing character, probably because it's the one with the most screen time.Another worrying aspect is the comedy. \"The Addams family\" films had great jokes, which still make me laugh despite having seen them 100 times. And dark comedy provides so many opportunities... But in \"Wednesday\", most jokes don't land. And in some cases, they were so bad that they made me wonder if they were actual jokes. I've seen bad comedies, but I've never seen a comedy so bad that I'm even unsure if they're trying to make me laugh. It's perplexing.But the most unforgivable of all these sins is not understanding the characters and what made The Addams Family great. It was the story of a family that, despite having very odd members, loved each other and cared for each other. \"Wednesday\" fails miserably at that. The first things we learn about the title character is that she seems to hate her parents and despise her brother. She doesn't love anyone, so why should we love her?",

There is none of the character he usually brings to his projects.

There are bits to this that could have been fun or interesting Gwendolyn Christie is wildly under used. Catherine zeta-jones will never be mistaken for angelica Houston.

It does remind of that latest \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" series, down to the tone and romance woes.. as well as early Harry Potter movies' villain uncertainty and a tad of Riverdale (what I know about it from osmosis).The story as a whole is a bit tried and done.. and sadly, falls quickly into expectations.But the \"Addams Family\" connection gives it some leeway to unwrap itself differently and generate an identity worth pursuing.. even if the character Wednesday acts like she should in some situations and contradicts her herself in others.. like wanting to stop bad things from happening, you know, the core of the series. Personally, I don't crave their weird-charm (though, I do enjoy a good game of Gloom).. but it if is well executed, I can appreciate anything in any coat of paint. Not to mention the fact that Jenna does a fantastic job at continuing the mantle left by the talented Christina Ricci. Whom was a surprise to see again.. though, I had some expectations for her assigned character that were not off the mark. Beyond her, I enjoyed seeing Gwendoline Christie in another great role (an Actor that should get more roles), and I hope Emma Myers gets more attention after this.It's an easy watch, although I thought it could have been ANYTHING else besides the Addams, like a new adaptation of Mattel's Monster High.",

I was confused at the casting but Miss ortega is phenomenal, her eyes and mannerisms are perfect! You can see exactly what she's trying to get across easily!The show flies by, effortlessly entertaining, beautiful world has been crafted and it's just a genuinely witty, unique experience which is a breathe of fresh air. Whilst I prefer new content and ideas I don't mind seeing stuff like this when it's done so well.There's only 2 negatives, I felt Wednesday softened too early but completely understood story wise why she needed to. The other one is the casting of Gomez, supposed to be handsome, charismatic but a bit daft, but this film and the animated 2 portray him as an unattractive guy with little presence or charisma! There was none ot the cliche Addams stuff between him and Tish. CZJ was a good choice but pugs, lurch and Gomez in my view should've been better.",

If you accept it is another YA teen drama with an outcast kid at it's centre it's more watchable. It's just not the Addam's Family really.At the core of Charles Addams creation was love and familial solidarity: that is abandoned here and replaced by a thoroughly unpleasant, self-absorbed bratty teenager being vile to everyone but especially her mother. I don't think this is \"updating\" the story but completely undermining what we loved about it to begin with. She doesn't seem sassy or funny just rude. The Addams's were always scrupulously polite - even to their enemies - it added to the humour and showed how classy they were, yet Wednesday is yet to offer a civil word to anyone. The success of any show depends to some extent on our identification and sympathy with it's central character but there is nothing at all so far to make you care in the slightest what Wednesday does next.

They just hoped the viewer ignored all of this and were easily distracted by shinny things.Christina Ricci was terrible in it.

Admittedly, i never really got into the old movies or other adaptations (except for the animated series when i was a kid), but being a long time tim burton fan( which hasn't always been easy), this version intrigued me. My thoughts on the series are.......mixed. Some good, some bad, overall complicated. Jenna Ortega was definitely the stand out, and she acted circles around the rest of the cast. Burtons signature gothic style is all over the screen, and having him work again with danny elfman was definitely a welcome addition for any burton fan. This is easily the best product hes put out in years, which unfortunately isn't saying much since his last few projects have been, just, bad. The story, while being filled with cliches, was certainly enjoyable and kept my interest even through some of the things I didn't like, enough to make me wanna see what was gonna happen next and how it was all gonne end. I'd even say some of the comedy was well done and had some very smartly written joke. However, the show definitely has some flaws. Some of the characters were just straight up annoying, and their performances definitely didn't help. I know the whole adams family thing is \"quirky\", but some characters were definitely trying to hard. Also, like i said earlier, there were so many clich\u00e9s and cringy lines that it made it a little hard to get through at times. Some of the cgi was just bad, like 90s cereal commercial bad. Also, i found the climax to be a little, well, anticlimactic. Though there was one twist i genuinely didn't see coming, the rest of it was pretty predictable. Overall i cant say this is a bad show, and i would be interested in a season 2, but it's not particularly great either. So, I'd give it an ok.",

            "content": "The biggest reason I was hesitant to watch Wednesday was because of what it was advertised as. It's pretty hard to do a respectable job with a young adult property let alone produce a good one. There's been so many attempts, anything geared towards teenagers is almost forced to parody itself just to dodge people overtly giggling and smirking at it. Wednesday doesn't avoid all the pitfalls but I was pleasantly surprised that it navigated its way around as many of them as they did. The central mystery was interesting enough that I didn't know outright guess it halfway through and although I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan (I like some of his work, other projects... not so much) his experienced hand and Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this budding franchise. Despite the occasional misstep, I was impressed at how the show kept up the pace and didn't become too rote after each adventure with Wednesday. The creative team may not have created the new Citizen Kane but there was effort put into the story here and I appreciated that.Instead of the whole Addams Family being at the forefront, we focus on the titular Wednesday as the protagonist and there's a lot of work put into understanding her mindset at this point in her life. She's a sullen and angry teenager but she's also got a razor sharp wit and a passion for seeking out the truth in her surroundings. I do think they sanded off a couple of the sharper edges from previous versions of the character (the jokes she tells are similar but she's less edgy in her interactions with others), but it was a necessary sacrifice as she needs to at least be semi-approachable by her classmates and other members of the Nevermore community. As much as her rebellious streak could have been annoying or cliche, the writers frame it as her wanting to step out of Morticia and Gomez's shadows and forge her own identity. She's still suitably prickly, but much like the Grinch, her heart grows a couple of sizes by the end of the initial season. Some of the supporting characters are given some nice mini-arcs like learning to stand up for yourself (Eugene), learning to accept yourself for who you are and live your best life (Enid) and even to let go of bias and preconceived notions and moving forward with an open mind (Sheriff Galpin and Principal Weems). Is it all stuff we've seen before? Perhaps, but it gives the background players some material to chew on while Wednesday skulks around Jericho.I wasn't thrilled with much of the casting, I grew up watching Raul Gulia, Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci as the Addams Family but once again, Wednesday left me taken aback. I was swayed by Jenna Ortega's fascinating work as Wednesday. I wasn't familiar with her before this but if she's not a star already, this should catapult her to the next level. She gets Wednesday's biting humour and she even brings some physicality to her performance. She's excellent at being stone-faced and motionless while she's interrogating suspects or making biting criticisms of her peers. Gwendoline Christie does a gratifying job of playing against type as Principal Weems, she's a figurehead who's all smiles in front of the cameras but an imposing figure behind the scenes. Gwendoline does a solid job of portraying her duplicitous nature. Christina Ricci (famous for previously playing Wednesday Adams) is a nice bit of casting as Marilyn Thornhill. She's very sweet and convincing as a sympathetic ear to Wednesday and it was fun to see her again in this property. Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones grew on me as Gomez and Morticia. Zeta-Jones was the standout of the 2 but they both got the strange beat that Gomez and Morticia dance to together as they fawn over each other in every single moment. I'd also like to credit Emma Myers, Hunter Doohan and Joy Sunday respectively for their work as Enid, Tyler and Bianca. All 3 of them had some standout moments and were good in their supporting roles.While Wednesday is certainly intriguing and is raised above the normal fair by its excellent lead performance, the material itself is cribbed from a lot of other YA properties. It's faithful to the Addams Family spirit but the teenage private eye angle, the school for outcasts, the separate social clubs/houses are all either borrowed from previous series like Riverdale or successful movie properties like Harry Potter. Any effort in the genre is going to have similarities but even when explaining parts of the show to my family, their comments were \"okay, so just like __________?\" The only retort I could offer is that while it does \"borrow\" many bits and pieces, Wednesday does it well enough that you can almost forget/forgive them for it. But I have watched my fair share of YA material and these thoughts were still present in my mind as I binge watched every episode.I got a lot more out of Wednesday than I expected to and I'm happy to applaud it for that. I'm not in the target audience but due to the efforts of Ortega and the cast, the great Gothic atmosphere, an adequate central mystery and some chuckle worthy jokes, I was happy I took the time despite my reservations. Wednesday may not be wholly original but it's still an upper tier entry in a genre that's best days are long since past. I'd be happy to watch a 2nd season for sure. Wednesday is plenty creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky enough to justify your time on Netflix.",

I only know Jenna Ortega from \"You\" in 2019 as a bratty mouthy teenager; I do not have high hopes but I want to give her a chance, and oh yes she delivers! Ortega should be commended for carrying the show throughout. That is not an incidental accomplishment, rather an expectation and she easily meets it. Wednesday is emotionless yet you cannot take your eyes off her face. Emma Myers as Enid is also wonderful. We find ourselves a couple of young actresses to watch and root for in the future. The dialogue here is witty, highlighting the biting one-liners uttered by Wednesday in rapid-fire fashion. Then we have the beautiful cinematography accompanied by a rich soundtrack.

However, once I had become aware of those flaws, I couldn't unsee them.The main character is perfect at everything she does. She is supposed to be a teenager but she possesses a set of skills to cover several lifetimes.There's an old issue with poorly written main characters of action movies. Main characters need to be vulnerable. If they are indestructible powerhouses then you can't associate with them or feel any sort of worry for them.Wednesday is especially indestructible and undefeatable when it comes to men (with 1 or 2 exceptions), many of whom are given the role of either bumbling idiots, traitors or otherwise evil. I don't normally go looking for these social issues in films and shows, but I couldn't not notice it here. I guess this is just the social state of things in Hollywood these days.However, this attitude actually does fit the show fairly well, since it's a show primarily about teenage girls, written for teenage girls. You know, girl power and all that...Finally, the story is not that well written. A good story with twists and turns is one where you can look back in the end and see that all the pieces fit together, but with this show, the various episodes are fairly independent. The story serves the scenes rather than the other way around. The writers could've made anyone to turn out to be the main villain in the end. There are a few times where characters just spout exposition at you.This show is primarily an exercise in style. Cute characters do cute things and everything looks cool and stylish.

Wednesday is doing what she can with this role-doing a good job with the dead-pan humorlessness Wednesday is defined by, but again, there is no underlying quirky juice to make her at all funny. She does things that are funny from time to time, but the jokes fall flat because her character delivers with a kind of anger that goes a little too deep.I think if you're not familiar with the original show, or the Sonnenfeld film, you probably won't mind all this, but for me, it's just not my cup of poison.",

            "content": "First Impressions:Wednesday Addams... The name needs no introduction, at least not to fans of the \"Addams Family\" franchise. This series captured Wednesday's experiences as a student in a frightfully fantastic gothic light that made it everything, and more, that fans like myself have been expecting to see. If you consider this show a live-action version of the 1992 cartoon series, many of the creative elements you'll discover as you go will make exponentially more sense.The Crew:Tim Burton, Gandja Monteiro, James Marshall did exemplary work directing this series. They captured some nice yesteryear \"Addams\" vibes while including some newfangled twists.Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Kayla Alpert, April Blair, Matt Lambert's writing was aces and deserves high praise. It might not have been easy to script a series of episodes around a multi-generational fan-favourite character, but they succeeded in that endeavour.Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman's musical scoring was brilliant. It was a balance of familiar and fresh that will be an auditory treat for fans of this franchise. The soundtracks were great as well, especially the covers and instrumentals.David Lanzenberg and Stephan Pehrsson's cinematography contained a world of captivation and wonder. It was immersive in all the right ways.Mark Scruton's production design was great.Set decoration and art direction were superb.Editing, sound effects, and VFX were amazing.Hair-makeup and Colleen Atwood's costume design were outstanding.The stunts team did remarkable work.The Cast:Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was perfection. She also double-acted as Goody Addams, her distant ancestor.Christina Ricci as Marilyn Thornhill was nostalgic and brilliant.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was unforgettable.Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams was good.Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams was interesting.Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Gomez Addams was funny and good.Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester was noteworthy.George Burcea as Lurch was good.Victor Dorobantu as Thing (the hand) was an amazing addition to the show. His 'character design' was great.Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin was outstanding.Emma Myers as Enid Sinclair was captivating.Georgie Farmer as Ajax Petropolus was memorable.Percy Hynes White as Xavier Thorpe was notable.Calum Ross as Rowan Laslow was quite good.Joy Sunday as Bianca Barclay was enchanting.Riki Lindhome as Dr Valerie Kinbott was good.Jamie McShane as Sheriff Donovan Galpin was great.Moosa Mostafa as Eugene Otinger was engaging.Sophia Nomvete as Connie Jorgensen was a pleasant surprise.William Houston as Joseph Crackstone was good.Gracy Goldman as Gabrielle (Bianca's siren mother) was captivating.Amanda Drew as Esther Sinclair (Enid's werewolf mother) was quite good.Plot Summary & Analysis:Wednesday Addams went to school *snap snap*. Classic \"Addams\" vibes and relevant corny-cool elements enriched the series to no end. I loved how they gave enough freedom to Tim Burton to work his singular magic on the show. How could I tell? The quality contained in every episode spoke for itself. Netflix made an impeccable decision in choosing Burton to tell this story and tell it right.I admired how they covered Wednesday's emergent psychic abilities. They made her a heroine who didn't desire to follow in the footsteps of her parents - Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Gomez (Luis Guzm\u00e1n). Those portions of the script were compelling and credible. After all, nearly every young girl and boy will find themselves in a position where they need to express their own individuality. This plot-thread mattered in connection with Wednesday's motivations.Now, let's face it, Christina Ricci previously did a brilliant job capturing the heart (so to speak) and soul (again, in a manner of speaking) of Wednesday Addams. It therefore pleased me to see Jenna Ortega seamlessly recreate the character in this series while still giving it her own spin.Speaking of Ricci, I was enormously impressed and overjoyed to watch her being re-cast in the show as Marilyn Thornhill, one of the teachers at Nevermore Academy. It spoke to Ricci's humility and versatility as a person and an actress to even have said yes to the role. Then again, when Tim Burton calls, any creative soul will answer.Two schools were in focus in season 1 of \"Wednesday\". Nancy Reagan High (initial portions, anyway) and Nevermore Academy. Both brought their own admirable elements to bear on the script. As for Nevermore, it gave off distinct Hogwarts vibes; if Hogwarts were American and smaller. Nevertheless, every inch of Nevermore was 'awe-chitectural' eye-candy to me.I also liked the older-sister vibe Wednesday brought, especially how she took care of her little brother Pugsley (who gave an interesting performance, btw).As for Catherine Zet-Jones, she paled (pun unintended) in comparison to her predecessor Angelica Huston who owned this character in subtle and sensual ways. However, Zeta-Jones' emotional scenes were something to behold. Luis Guzm\u00e1n was great as his own kind of Gomez but, again, he lacked the energized je ne sais quoi Raul Julia originally brought to the character.Their younger versions, though - Gwen Jones as Morticia and Lucius Hoyos as Gomez - gave us criminally brief moments of the classic goth-couple vibe that fans have come to adore about these two iconic characters.Fester was a mischief-crazy addition to the cast, but he wasn't given too much screen time this season. Lurch (George Burcea) was interesting and looked the part, but was barely given screen space. I was looking forward to hearing him give that signature exasperated moan, which never came.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was a perfect fit for this franchise. I've always been a fan of her work, so I was glad to see her shine in this role.The storyline in \"Wednesday\" 2022 was neat and elegant. It evoked \"Addams Family\" moments I remember cherishing when I watched the 1991 movie (directed by Barry Sonnenfeld) and the 1992 animated series that aired on Cartoon Network.Back to Wednesday's psychic capabilities... This was new. It wasn't exactly confirmed in any of the other characterizations of Wednesday over the years. The way they delivered this plot-point, especially the style with which they used Wednesday's newly blooming psychic skills to lend her an air of gravitas and power, was splendid. I thought I would come to dislike this inclusion in the overall story, but I ended up giving it my vote.In addition, Wednesday proved to be quite the detective, particularly when it came to solving a series of monster murders - the creature was known as a \"Hyde\" - that took place around Nevermore. Making her a savvy sleuth truly elevated the show from anything that came before it in the Addams-verse. Instead of sardonically or sarcastically pointing out the obvious, Wednesday instead found opportunities to collect and connect clues to help solve serious issues.They even gave her character a nice literary touch. Wednesday writing novels as a hobby was captivating, to say the least. Her fictional cases were conducted by a girl-detective named Viper De la Muerte who was quite like the author herself in several regards. In addition to moments like these, so many other features in the show displayed a flair and fervour for traditional old-school \"Addams\" wordplay and tropes.From martial arts to fencing, cello playing to classic line-deliveries, I loved everything about Wednesday Addams and Jenna Ortega's take on the character in this Netflix series. Her dance in E04 was groovy (word intended), The Cramps' \"Goo Goo Muck\" soundtrack was perfect, some evocative steps from past Wednesdays made me fan-scream, and the \"Carrie at the prom\" finish (especially in regards to Gwendoline Christie's contribution) was brilliant!Also, I managed to guess the identity of the Hyde monster early on, but Burton and company wove their red herrings so cunningly that I could never quite be sure until the actual reveal (rather, bold-faced confession) happened. It was simple but effective misdirection worth admiring.Superb characterizations all round, captivating back-stories, and noteworthy pacing were some of the many elements that made this show an iconic production to hail from Netflix this year.Final Notes:In just eight episodes, Wednesday proved that capturing the old \"Addams Family\" magic was not impossible if summoned by the right hands. I do believe that Tim Burton made this Netflix series work in more ways than one. Christina Ricci did not disappoint, either.The series contained a little bit of everything, from school-time sentiments and crime-drama tropes to horrors and comedies galore. It portrayed the Nevermore alumni as a batch of oddities and outcasts, who included vampires, werewolves, gorgons, and sirens. All of it gave Netflix's \"Wednesday\" multi-pronged possibilities to use in future.By the time season 1 ended, I was genuinely weighed down by sadness to realize it was over and that Netflix was yet to greenlight a season 2 of \"Wednesday\". Hopefully they will, and soon. Otherwise, in classic Wednesday Addams fashion, someone is going to have to drop a bag of live piranhas in the executives' private swimming pool if only to remind them they have a great thing going here.",

Having only seen episode one, I'm torn between the hope it might get better after a few episodes, and exasperation at Wednesday being so unbelievably unlikeable.I get that Wednesday is supposed to be dark and moody and obsessed with death - none of which I would mind.'This' Wednesday is incapable of having a conversation with anyone without saying something hurtful or condescending, and it very quickly loses its charm - if there ever was any. She's the main character, and we're supposed to be rooting for her, but I find it incredibly difficult to do so. I actually keep hoping someone will put her in her place.As most teenage girl protagonists these days, she considers herself a victim of parental oppression (after they send her to a school for \"outcasts\" rather than let her get charged for attempted murder, how awful of them). She's like a not-funny parody of what a moody teenager is like.Aside from generally disliking the titular character, there's other stuff I'm not a fan of either. The cliche school cliques, the \"all grown-ups are enemies\"-trope, the fact that this series seems way too much like any generic YA fantasy series to be an actual Burton project... like, I'm upset, ya'll.But Wednesday's behaviour and demeanour is by far what puts me off the most. She's got the perfect grades, is the one who protects her bullied little brother, is amazing at fencing, and writing, and saying really smart-sounding things... but she's so friggin mean and malicious to 'everyone', including those who truly have done nothing to deserve it. She's a mean Mary Sue.I will keep watching just to see if it gets better, but I'm not too hopeful.",

It is interesting, dark, and a blend of old and new, all wrapped in a fun Burton-esque way.The lead actress is fantastic, she really captures the personality of Wednesday, she even nails the dead, cold but intense stare. But kudos should be given to the rest of the cast, because they do a great job as well,I loved Gwendoline Christie as the Head Mistress, she really plays ambiguous characters very well. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are perfect in their roles, and the actress who portrays Enid (Emma Myers) nails the character.Of course there are mistakes and inconsistencies (a rainy day suddenly becoming extra sunny, with no evidence of the previous rain at all, etc), but all in all, those mistakes don't negatively affect the quality of the series.I really don't understand the viewers who compare it to the movies, and expect it to be the same. It can't be. It's been 30 years since the Addams Family movies, the world has changed, we are supposed to be moving forward and keeping up with the times. Please stop comparing old and new, \"Wednesday\" isn't a remake, it's a brand new series based on one of the characters, not the Addams Family as a whole. This series, pays a great homage to the original Addams Family, but it is firmly set in the present- as it should be.Old and new can be equally worth your time, each one for its own merits.8/10 from me, with the potential to go higher for the next season(s).",

But after watching 4 episodes of the 8-episode Netflix series, I am sad to report that what >I< have loved about the Addams Family; the sardonically dark humor, the double entendre of dialog, the characters whom, at their core, are deeply loving to each other. All of that has been set aside for yet another outsider teen angst series in the vein of \"Winx\" or later \"X-Men\" movies. Tim Burton's vision never evolves beyond the script. The series is superbly cast; Jenna Ortega is marvelous as \"Wednesday\", Gwendoline Christie as the Principle, in their brief appearances, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman rise to the roles of Morticia and Gomez, but once the setting moves to the Nevermore Academy, the story falls flat and one-note. The gentle but diabolical humor of the 1960's, and the early movie franchise is replaced with blood and gore, and this devolves into a teen drama. Am I expecting too much? Do I want that wink back to nostalgia? More Charles Addams and less Zack Snyder, perhaps? There are one or two great lines and scenes; Wednesday in the morgue, for instance; \"I just got comfortable, a few more minutes\", but that feels far and few between. What gets me is that when you think of the macabre humor that is the \"Addams Family\", this should have been a slam-dunk for Tim Burton. His movies all have that vibe to them.

(I don't care anymore about my Hogwarts letter, just bring me to this academy!!!!)\nThe actors were perfect, Jenna Ortega was MADE for this role (speaking of actors, I feel the need to remind you that Gomez is inspired from the first original cartoons by Charles Addams, not the Gomez you're used to), having Christina Ricci in this show was also a very nice idea!!And of course, Tim Burton couldn't have made a real comeback without Danny Elfman!! The music was fabulous. Just the main intro music is so epic, I could listen in in a loop for hours!So yeah, as a huge huge fan of The Addams Family, I must say, I LOVE this show.And I'm definitely gonna watch it more than one time in my life.",

Jenna Ortega was awesome as Wednesday, she understood the assignment and nailed it. A+Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia, no this was not a good choice at all even with her only in two episodes. Luis Guzman as Gomez, why? Again this was NOT a smart casting decision. There was zero chemistry between these two, it was just weird and awkward to watch. They felt so out of place compared to the rest of cast.Thing was a delight as per usual. He has always been my favourite character. I enjoy his updated look. Christopher Lloyd will always be my number one Fester, but Fred Armisen was still decent. The rest of the cast did a good job and played their characters well.At times, it doesn't have the same feel as other Tim Burton classics. The reason for this is because some episodes are not directed by Burton. However, the episodes with Tim, you can absolutely tell it's him. The CGI was good but not spectacular. The story was interesting and humorous. I was laughing at Wednesday's statements quite often. Also, the dance scene was epic!The soundtrack is fun and definitely feels more like Tim Burton. One of my favourite scenes was when Wednesday played Paint it Black on the cello. I love the cello and had goosebumps, it was so beautiful to listen to.I rate this 8/10. It was worth watching, I didn't feel like I wasted my time. It left me wanting more. It is geared more towards teens, but adults like myself will enjoy it too. I would gladly watch a second season. My only desire is that if this does get a second season, that they cast different actors to play Morticia and Gomez.",

Apparently (and I hadn't known this), Tim Burton was the director originally attached (as they say in the \"business known as show\") to The Addams Family movies, but couldn't make it work with his Batman movies' post-production schedules. I don't know if the eventual director, Barry Sonnenfeld, was 100% responsible for the original casting of Christina Ricci, or if Burton had a role (he would use her in later films like \"Sleepy Hollow\"), but the young actress created a memorable if not iconic character in two films. And she gets a nice, if light supporting role here. So why this series? Well it's now literally a new generation with an updated sense of cynicism and sarcasm, plus we've got to give Tim Burton his time at bat, don't we? He doesn't disappoint. And neither does Jenna Ortega's turn in the role of Wednesday (Full of Woe) Addams. I refer you to the dance scene in episode four. Memorable, once again.

In a nutshell Wednesday is nothing but a typical Mary Sue, and her \"attitude\" is very annoying. What made Wednesday in the films funny was that she wasn't the only main character. Her whole family, even the house added to the quirkiness of it all. Making her one liners a spiky and a break from the more slapstick humour of the rest of the film. Also I got the impression she loved her family (in her own special way). Here she is just a petulant teenager (who for some reason is rude as hell yet people like her). She can do and fix anything... Snore. And her psychic abilities are really off putting (and probably taken from a mid 2000's cartoon adaptation) . If she can't/won't tell people their fate (fair enough I get that) then unless this is going to be some major plot device; why bother?The casting of Gomez and Morticia were poor and have zero chemistry together. Gomez is just whiney, and Morticia was just flat as a pancake.Whilst I think if it since when has this world been so magical? The point of the Addams story was they lived in the \"normal\" world and the fun was who thought who was weird the Addams or the \"normies\". Throwing Wednesday into this silly school with supernatural factions is unoriginal and again boring! Clearly the creators had no clear idea what they wanted to do with the character and it shows. School factions are really dated these days.I haven't finished the series and I already worked out who is the main bad guy - can't we do better than this? Also this is so full of \"now\" politics. Werewolves with pink and blue hair...don't think I didn't spot that. Bees have no patriarchy...

Honestly this show reminded me of Stargirl or something else from the CW. It's rated 15+ but it's just SO kiddyish and silly. The character Wednesday has had everything interesting and kooky about her stripped away and now she's just some Daria clone who just talks without emotion and has no other defining character trait. This looked and felt way too silly for a show supposed to be for older teens and adults. It's feels like a show that was made for a 13 year old girl. Extremely unsatisfying show that took everything fun and kooky about Addams family and just made a Netflix cookie cutter Riverdale/Stargirl clone that is predictable as heck, and insanely kiddyish.Ps. Take a shot every time someone says 'Patriarchy' in this show or any other Netflix produced series, and you'd be dead. Bonus shots for 'mansplaining' to really seal the deal.

The cast includes Jenna Ortega (Scream), Gwendoline Christie (Game of Thrones), Riki Lindhome (The Last House on the Left), Christina Ricci (The Addams Family), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Chicago) and Luis Guzm\u00e1n (Traffic).The atmosphere for this picture was absolutely amazing. I was thoroughly impressed by Jenna Ortega as Wednesday. She was amazing. Her mannerisms and facial expressions were perfect. The settings were brilliant and have an obvious Tim Burton feel to them. Adding Wednesday to a school filled with other unique children gave the film a Harry Potter feel to it. I thoroughly enjoyed the diverse group of characters. The CGI used for the monsters and magic were perfect. The storyline was very clever in how it weaves in the past and present, keeps you guessing and tells you a little more about the Addams Family than you knew going in. The last 15 minutes did feel a little rushed, but I still enjoyed it.Overall, this was better than I ever imagined going in. This is a series that needs a season 2 ASAP and is an absolute must see.

It's when writers give characters dialogue to deliver a speech or something similar to introduce information that they don't have time to show because of budget, time, or laziness. This is when they explain the plot or give a bunch of information about a character.We need information, but it has to be done in a subtle and natural way so we never notice the exposition and there are ways of doing it if you have the right writer who has the talent to do so. This isn't it.I also don't think Ortega has the charm of the original Wednesday or even Ricci's portrayal of her in the movie adaptation. The humor doesn't land.Tim Burton, to me, has mostly created artificial worlds where the characters deliver lines that feel like a wink to the camera. Very hammy and over the top.It's just hard to watch, like a singer that is off-key. If you are tone-deaf you don't notice it.Anyway, I guess there are just so many bad films and TV shows out that the remotely engaging ones get praise despite not deserving it.Sorta a blown opportunity.

Why... well various reasons really. First of all, spotting Tim Burton and Danny Elfman already gives you goosebumps thinking back of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare before Christmas, and although Wednesday as a series is nice and entertaining, it came nowhere near the other two movies mentioned here, and I'm actually being nice here. Secondly, the endless following of social agendas, especially thinking back of the original Addams Family, seems just so wrong. Not looking for a new Addams Family story, but one that stays true to the original, including the original music score and characters. Think only Uncle Fester came close to the character as portrayed in the original series. Thirdly, the story itself has embraced too many \"Harry Potter\" elements, which just made the whole show a bit sad and lacking the originality I'm used seeing produced by Tim Burton. Wednesday is just a female version of Harry, and nothing more than that really. Last but not least, found the storyline messy and extended to infinity for no reason whatsoever, other than trying to fill up eight episodes with the same-same over and over again, and am just not buying in to that, as quantity does not equal quality. That's why Big Fish will always remain one of the best movies ever made, it's exactly the right duration. Anyways, that's my feedback. So, although Wednesday is nice children's entertainment, it doesn't belong in my list of top productions. 5/10.",

Mayers acting was also very good and gave very very good contrast.And that's about the only good thing i can say. First- that monster looks like rabid Gollum , who was created by AI via Loony Toon generator. It looks bad. Neither scary, nor interesting. And with all the good CGI troughouth the movie, the monster was plain bad. You can't take it serious when you see these huge eyes like that.Storywise - mediocre, tho not terrible. Buuuut besides the few twists, everything was so predictable and obvious, incl the twists.Camerawork was decent ok, can't say it's bad, but it's not superb either. It's ok. There were some well placed and executed shots. Editing was also decently good.Now, about the characters. Wednesday, as i said, was superb. Thing was also good , tho you can't screw his character easily. Enid was also solid character, alongside Bianca... The rest ... nothing good or interesting, many random fillers and clich\u00e9s .Thornhill (Christina Ricci) as a character was very out of place. Up until the last episode, you see her there just for the rating because \"heey, that's the \"original\" Wednesday\" (not the original ofc, as there's 60s series as well). But i felt her presense there was just a plain nostalgia play, she didn't bring anything to the story at all.Lurch was ... short . What the hell was that. Lurch is supposed to be slim but very tall and intimidating. This one was .. not intimidating at all. Gomez didn't have any proper vibe. Ok, i get it, it looks like the comics, but Gomez is supposed to be madly in love with Morticia. And he gave no such vibe at all. Morticia was supposed to have deep but very cold love for Gomez, and we see no chemistry between them at all. No matter how many french kisses there are, the spark is not there... And you need not a spark but a bonefire with them two.Nostalgia elements were so tastelesly put there. Having Fester there just for the sake of nostalgia, no real good reason for him there... having classic sentences like \"you rang\" out of place , the signiture snapping with fingers.. just random nostalgia, put in random place for the sake of the old one...So, If you're a fan of the 90s version, you won't (probably) enjoy this one. If you haven't seen any Addams before, you may or may not enjoy it. Besides being predictable and mediocre, it's not the worst thing i've seen so it's ok.",

I only wish Netflix had released it in October because it would be so perfect for Halloween. Tim Burton is a phenomenal director, and every cast member is perfect for their roles. Jenna plays Wednesday so well, I saw an interview where she spoke about taking direction from Burton. You can tell she really enjoyed playing the character, and her commitment shows on screen. The \"high school\" Netflix show trope has run its course so many times before, it feels stale, but this is so obviously different and fresh.",

            "content": "Teens written by middle aged YT men just needs to stop. This feels like a higher budget CW show that stole from Harry Potter. The darling unique and charming Addams family are made pathological and weird.I love Luis Guzman, but due to makeup, hair and costume choices, his Gomez Addams is grotesque. Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia is lovely, in spite of costume design that isn't glamorous or very flattering. She is a passionate, energetic actress and so I did miss the more cool and regal self possession of previous Morticia;s (just my personal preference). Sadly the best thing about the Addams isn't portrayed well for most of the series... their love and unconditional support for each other and unity as a family. More emphasis was placed teen drama that makes no sense (such as Wednesday despising her mother).In the show a line reads \"I've always hated the term 'write what you know'\" and some thing about stifling creativity. That feels like the motto of the writers on this show (and sadly many others streaming today) where \"creativity\" seems to mean pulling poorly planned series out of your a$$-pirations.Wednesday is skillfully acted and really, really fun to watch, but she's written with such discontent and often malice. And they felt the need to write her an origin story??? Wednesday doesn't need an origin story, she is a fully formed character by nature of her family. It's quite insulting.It was uncomfortable seeing Mortician and Gomez act apologetic and embarrassed, not to mention absolutely having no chemistry. Pugsly is written as if he is an afterthought. The principal is fantastic & one of the better creepy elements of the show. Most of the other actors are very well done.One last thing that really bothered me are the gross jokes and innuendo throughout. Enid is made the butt of some especially crude and disgusting jokes. Fred Armisen is especially abrasive and you're left wondering did he write or embellish his own jokes??",

This show's Addams family is about distrust, suppression and conformity. I really don't want to use that descriptor, but... This show is disgusting! I and all of my friends are disappointed.

I had initially expected Tim Burton to deliver a feature length movie, not a series. Not that I am complaining or anything, because this was definitely entertaining.If you are expecting this to be an \"Addams Family\" thing, you're in for a surprise. Sure, some of the family members were in the show, but as the title of the show indicates, then this is all about Wednesday Addams, not the family Addams.The storyline in \"Wednesday\" was good, it was well-written, but I felt that the end was a bit rushed, as if the director suddently realized that they were out of time and had to close things up before the lights were turned off. But the eight episodes do make for good entertainment, and the writers did a good job at keeping the audience in the dark with this being a who-did-it-mystery.I was, for the majority of the talents on the cast list, unfamiliar with the cast ensemble in \"Wednesday\", and that was good, because that is something I enjoy when I watch something. There were some familiar faces, such as Christina Ricci, Gwendoline Christie, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzm\u00e1n and Fred Armisen. However, leading actress Jenna Ortega (playing Wednesday) was just just simply phenomenal in the role as Wednesday with her mannerisms, demeanor, appearance, and way of acting. It was definitely a joy to watch her bring this particular version of Wednesday Addams to life on the screen, and she totally stole the show and made it her own. I will say that actress Jenna Ortega makes it well-worth watching the eight episodes.Visually then director Tim Burton does show his trademark dark, gothic, semi-twisted fingerprint, though it is much toned down in comparison to his other work. But it looks good and definitely added a lot of flavor and atmosphere to the series.I was genuinely entertained by the eight episodes, though the ending was a bit too forced and rushed for my liking. But, all in all, a series well-worth watching.My rating of \"Wednesday\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

The cello and the dance are both very nice touches, like the cherry on the top. The supporting cast is also good and the side stories are not annoying despite the whole story happening in a high school. The funniest of all is that they managed to make out of all the characters, including the grownups, comic book characters.

The serie is new and fresh, but also has a lot of recognition for the older viewer. Morticia and Gomes are still disgustingly in love. With Gomes still kissing Morticia's arm, Thing is still the same just trying to be there for the family. And Wednesday is still her dark self.This show however gives a huge dept into the character Wednesday. That Christina Ricci plays a roll in it is just is the icing on the cake. Especially when she says to Wednesday that she is just like her. Its all that little details that just make this show. Apart obviously from the great fantasy Tim Burton made of this serie full of monsters, weerwolves and other beautiful creatures. The serie Wednesday is the perfect example of making something new, with the respect to the previous films and shows.It is mysterie, excitement, adventure and a lot of fun with just the right amount of dark humor.After seeing the first episode i was allready extremely excited for the rest, that did not change anything after finishing the show.",

Okay, let's do this.I wanted to say I'm confused, but confusion is nothing compared to what I feel right now. I have no idea, what happened here.First of all, we need to split this season into two parts.Part I: First 6 episodes, Part II: Last 2 episodesWhen it comes to the first 6 episodes, there's really a lot of good stuff here. Characters are likeable and interesting, dialogues are well-written (expecially those spoken by Wednesday). This show has its own tone and tons of \"weird stuff\" that match this tone perfectly. I appreciate that very much.Plot is nowhere near impressive, but it's not bad or boring either. There are also a few \"teenage drama things\" here and I don't mean it in a good way, but still those are the things I can stand easily. The show is very enjoyable... At this point.I don't know what happened to the screenwriters after they finished episode six and I'm not sure if I want to know, but it was definitely something bad. And I mean \"hard to explain without cursing\" kind of bad here. At this point I'm going into spoilers, because I cannot do this without them.Wednesday starts to loose her mind and she's throwing absurd accusations at everyone on her way, until somehow one of those becomes the truth (it doesn't really make sense). A lot of characters start to make irrational decisions, because we need \"power of frendship\" and things like that. Principal Weems' death feels like it's a parody. The whole character of Tyler Galpin feels like a parody right from a moment he reveals himself as \"the hyde monster\". I suspected Marylin Thornhill to be a secret villain for a few episodes at this point and it does make sense to me, but after the whole reveal she becomes unnecessarily cartoonish and stupid too. Finally, at the top of this parody cake, I cannot even find the right words to discribe Joseph Crackstone. And then, when I thought it couldn't get worse...\nThat fight between the hyde and the werewolf reminded me of \"Twilight\". Seriously, literally. I wasn't ready for such a bottom level, I still can't believe that. The CGI, the role it plays for the plot, the \"choreography\", everything... God, I want to unsee this.I am shocked, I am disgusted, I am confused, I am in denial, I am blown away. None of those I mean in a positive way.

The first episode is alright and does a good job at capturing the feel of classic Addams Family movies, but things quickly go downhill from there. Instead of being the creepy little girl that we all know, Wednesday comes across as this impudent teenager who pouts all the time and tries her best not to show any emotion.

So here we go:First of all, i've watched the 60's show and the 90's movies, and loved them with all of their flaws, but this show is just... So bad, i only finished it because of peer pressure (all of my friends watched it), but i hated almost everything about it.The whole thing is just another heartless, soulless, lifeless cash grab. It's stupid, lazy, forgettable, cliche, predictable, with bad writing and ohhh soooooo boring.I guess i liked some of the casting choices, like principal Weems, and Jenna is very beautiful. There were also a couple references to the originals that made me smile, (cooky and spooky, snap twice, etc), uncle Fester showing up also made me happy and that one date scene with Tyler and Wednesday was funny. But that's about all i liked.The plot is boring, and it just stretches unnecessarily, it could've been wrapped in 3 to 4 eps max. Should've made a movie instead.Addams family has always been the portrayal of a happy and healthy family unit. Do i even need to say more on this and how the show handled it?The characters were uninteresting and one dimensional. There was also a lot of character tensions and dramas with little to no pay offs. I feel like nowadays character development is more of a privilege and bonus than something that should exist in stories.A lot of subplots and plot threads were left hanging to hype up season two. Which is not exclusive to Wednesday, just something i see a lot and hate.The only romance that actually managed to be entertaining was Enid and Ajax's. The rest (especially the love triangle) was stupid. There was no chemistry between characters. ( Like Morticia and Gomez, which should be a crime. Like how did you manage to destroy their romance?? Was it really that hard to make them look in love???)Also, it felt like the show itself didn't know what it was, and was trying to be everything at once. Comedy, mystery, horror, drama, romance, etc. So it ended up being weird (not in a good way) and ungrounded. It couldn't set the mood and the atmosphere. And don't get me wrong, you can mix those genres and get something good, but you have to execute it well, and here, they couldn't.It didn't feel like Tim Burton at all, It just felt like a bad fanfiction. It was so trope-y and cliche with no originality.Not to mention, forgettable. I mean, i watched the whole thing yesterday and now? I barely remember 1/3 of it!And you know what bothers me most? I pretty much knew all of this beforehand, and i was still ready to give it a chance and love this version just as i loved the rest, embracing all of the flaws, as long as it was enjoyable... But it couldn't even do that!!!I would've forgiven all of the mistakes, if only the show hadn't bored me to death. If only the show made me give a a single F about any of the characters. If only it had one, just ONE actual, genuine, emotional moment. I would have loved it. But it didn't.If i had to sum it all up in one word, it would be disappointing.Also, on a more general note, I have rarely, VERY rarely met an actual human teenage person that acts like teenagers act on TV. When will people understand that not all teenagers are angsty, stupid, dramatic, and immature brats that hate their parents?? Seriously, i'm getting sick of these stereotypes.",

Turned the movie into a \"teen supernatural romance\" kind of movie and removed all the dark humor so as not to offend anybody? Lol. When did Pugsley become such a wimp. I couldn't even feel the love between Morticia and Gomez. I wouldn't too cause Gomez has never been a fat, ugly, creepy man. They are supposed to be a weird misfit family showing their love in their own kind of way to each other. But the parents are not proud of their children's behavior.

So be warned that I will not be praising nor dissing this show for its accuracy.That being said, I actually enjoyed this show. I've never actually thought Netflix could actually make me enjoy an adaption off of something, and now I have a spark of hope for future Netflix adaptations (my expectations will definitely still remain low for those future projects, but still a tiny spark of hope).This show isn't a masterpiece, there are a lot of cringeworthy jokes that never hit, characters that I would've perfected not to be in this show, but there are still a lot of reasons why I gave this show such a high score.First off, Tim Burton directed and produced a lot of the episodes, and you can really tell. While I\nmay not be familiar with the Addams Family, I am familiar with Tim Burton's work, and let me say this definitely feels like something that came from the mind of Tim Burton himself from the camera angle decisions to the dark and silly moments in this show, and that I will praise this show for.The camera shooting decisions in this show was something I greatly appreciate. There were many beautiful and unique scenes that were shot in a lot of creative ways, and the fact that I've never actually heard this being praised by anyone is mind blowing to me. Camera shots have always been underrated from critics and should always be praised when done well.Something I've heard a lot of people praise this show for was Jenna Ortega herself, and they weren't kidding, her performance basically carried the entire story. She really did a great job portraying Wednesday as this sarcastic sociopathic goth, and while I was expecting that kind of performance I never actually thought she'd make threes elements work as an interesting character, especially since she barely shows any emotion throughout the entire show. Jenna Ortega hasn't really impressed me in all the roles I've seen her in, but after this I'm kind of excited to see what else she can pull off in her acting career.The story itself was fine, it wasn't groundbreaking but it still had its moments, and the fact that this was a murder mystery made me enjoy it more since that's the kind of content that I typically enjoy, and I was definitely not expecting in a story like this.One issue I did have was with the other characters that I feel like slowed down this story, and that mainly holds its place with the love triangle between Xavier and Tyler. Wednesday has shown to not be interested in boys and I think they should've kept it that way as she works better without a love interest in my opinion. This love triangle was here for filler and didn't really serve a purpose until the last two episodes.Wednesday is definitely not for everyone and I can see why some people don't like this show as much. It has a decent story that is is engaging with Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday having a detective-like personality throughout the show, some amazing camera shots, and I think it's worth your time to at least try. There are a few fillers, but for the most part they're still entertaining, and they all end up tying into the main storyline by the end which makes me appreciate those filler moments that I didn't care for, and because of that I think this show is worth your time.",

Wednesday was, of course, a second tier character because Gomez and Morticia were the stars.

I worked out early that this was a sort of variation of Harry Potter, and instead of a wizarding school we had a school for outcasts. I personally much preferred this over Harry Potter. We don't see much of Gomez and Morticia, which is fine - Zeta-Jones is good as Morticia but Luis Guzman lacks the looks and charm to be a credible Gomez. Jenna Ortega, though, is brilliant as Wednesday. A really excellent performance. Emma Myers and the rest of her fellow students were generally very good, and Christina Ricci did nicely in her role - and a nice bit of casting to include a former Wednesday.

The third thing I love is the effects of the movie were so real like when u watch it sounds to you real and full of logics . I think there will be another season for this series , its clear ofc and I hope . I advise you to watch this series especially with your family . And there is a little or u can say small scenes that are not allowed for kids ofc but they are like short only 10 seconds and meybe less . I give this series 9 out of 10 only because some actors should acted more stronger , well I hope in season 2.",

            "content": "As a kid I loved the original TV series of the Addams Family, and the 2 films were entertaining enough without ever living up to the TV Series. Wednesday Adams was always my favourite character, the sweet looking girl with a love of the macabre. Christina Ricci was standout in the films and for my money nailed the character. It was great to see her given a significant supporting role in this film but not at the expense of Wednesday being front and centre.When I saw this trailed I had high hopes and I have not been disappointed, if anything my expectations have been exceeded. In essence the original Addams Family series and the films are a succession of short sketches to play with the kooky and macabre for fun and laughs. Here we get a much deeper nuanced exploration of one of the characters outside of the family unit. This doesn't come at the expense of the fun, with lashings of Tim Burton's trademark dark humour thrown in for good measure.The series is expertly paced, without any weak episodes. The mystery and drama keeps you guessing while the dark humour is playfully woven around the main plot with plenty of nods to the originals and to horror film tropes in general.I have a minor gripe that stops me giving this 10 stars and that is Gomez and Morticia. While only playing minor roles in the story Gomez is portrayed as meek and subservient to Morticia and it grated with me a little as in every other version Gomes is a dynamic character in a relationship of equals with Morticia. This isn't a reflection on the performances of Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones who hold their own amongst a host of fine performances.Special mention goes to Gwendoline Christie who is imperious as Principal Weems, and especially Emma Myers as Enid, the day to Wednesday's night. The interplay and the developing relationship between Enid and Wednesday is one of the highlights of the series, as without Enid we wouldn't get to explore Wednesday's personality as deeply as we do. What we see here is a more grown up Wednesday than the ghoulish child we have seen before and so we don't have to worry about comparisons about who is your favourite Wednesday. They are different but the same if that makes sense.None of this would matter if Wednesday herself isn't front and centre. Jenna Ortega is simply magnificent as Wednesday. From the first moment she is on screen, you only see her from behind, and you immediately know she just is Wednesday. It is not just her expression but the whole way she holds herself, the way she walks, and then there is the eyes that tell you everything. The standout moment is the school dance.Everything you would want from Wednesday is delivered and then a few extra layers you don't know you wanted are added as a bonus.The series ends with a not so subtle hint that there could be more. I expect that viewing figures will determine that. I hope there is, but it would have to be Jenna Ortega, nobody else can play this version of Wednesday now. Christine Ricci owns the young version, Jenna Ortega own this older version.",

It doesn't feel cohesive.It's basically taking the worst of Riverdale, mixing some Harry Potter, and naming characters after the Addams Family characters. There is no reason for this to be tied to the brand. There was little to no effort done to make this a \"Addams Family\" show. On top of this, It's there has already been a show based on Wednesday before. By a YouTuber. Who not only did a better job made but understood the material a lot better. It's embarrassing that having so many people and such a massive budget produces such poor results.This would have been fine otherwise, but dragging a beloved IP into this lazy \"re-imagining'\", doesn't deserve anything past a single star.

No Itteration of Morticia would EVER deign to be called \"Tish\" WHAT?!Jenna Ortega fails to bring anything new to a character and instead simply copies Christina Ricci's take.

So what. We still seem to be enjoying them.Loved the mystery, the fast-paced action, the fantasy. Excellent acting by all plus pretty good special effects. Not for young children, but highly recommended for everyone else.",

Over the years there have been various attempts to adapt them to TV and films, with varying success. Here is the latest attempt, although this time the focus is on Wednesday Addams.This really felt far removed from the Addams family origins. Sure the various usual characters make an appearance, it has the gothic trappings etc. But the narrative was more like that in Harry Potter, set in a boarding school, with Wednesday having to solve a series of attacks by a mysterious monster.The story wasn't really that interesting, the attempts at humour really fell flat. Wasn't the whole point of the original Addams family that they were subverting the typical American family and way of life, where is anything even remotely like that here? If you set it in a school for outcasts, then what is the point? None of the jokes work when everyone is an outcast.On the plus side it looks great, the actors all fit their roles well and give good performances. I don't think Tim Burton really did a lot here, it doesn't feel like he had much involvement at all.",

            "content": "This is what I would call regressed preppy: it's safe, insular and fluffy yet violent, erotic and toxic, that thing where it simultaneously feels like a very young children's tv show AND an X-rated movie. A very jarring experience with continuous whiplash, just totally caught off guard by the combination. It's Spongebob Squarepants meets Freddy Kruger.It's like being immersed in an identity crisis, wanting to be perceived as sweet, soft, and innocent yet that repressed wild side and agenda can't help but peek through. It makes for a very calculated experience which is totally unimmersive.For example, you can just tell that they used White coded passing bullies in that overcorrection/overcompensating 'see, we're not biased' way. Then you can see how they specifically, actively, put a Black coded passing bully for another scene as a way to balance it out and/or stick to their comfortable biased routine.Or how the characters keep emphasizing how \"white\" Wednesday is which is just poorly cloaked Casteism. Wednesday might as well ask a mirror 'who the fairest of them all' is.Then you have the questionable romance/social plots which almost seem to normalize or glorify toxic behavior. You know, rude for no reason, zero empathy yet is still supposed to be likable and is liked by others or insta-love type of stuff. It's starting to become disturbing and not in a good way.Other than that it's just very predictable and flat entertainment due to the approach: the lore, tone and aesthetic is just superficial wrapping on another typical teen drama with flat trope characters and identity cult propaganda. The Woman cultism was in full effect: Men are 2D-evil except love interest(s), perfect female protagonist has unlimited skills, abilities and knowledge and wispy/waify/skinny character with little to no muscle tone can beat up anyone, typically a male.The over reliance on formula is also clear, I mean, a werewolf character that says 'This kitty has claws'? Just because it has been used successfully before in other media and vaguely correlates? Since when were (retractable) claws the weapons of werewolves? Fangs would of made more sense or why not just make them say 'This puppy has claws' or make them a Werecat? Instead they just put tropes, cliches and formulas in a blender without a lid and used whatever flew out. It can also been seen in how Wednesday literally talks in wry, sarcastic, macabre come backs. We're talking 95% of Wednesday's lines and that is zero exaggeration.Lastly, the exposition. Why are you using all of the dialogue to explain to the audience what is currently happening right in front of our faces? Dialogue is there to weave a story and express characters, not to talk down to us.This IS just a magic mirror for the matching demographic (light featured, dainty, logical/socialite Women and the 'Latinx' Women/Other Women that aspire to be them) which is what all shows are becoming, 'chosen one' simulators. At least if it wasn't your vibe or matching demographic it was watchable but now it's just so bludgeoning, obstructive and exclusionary.If you're the matching demographic you may enjoy it and why not as I said most demographics seem to be doing it but what happened to stories, character flaws, and creativity instead of risk-free formulas, decadent self worship and identity cult propaganda?",

The mystery is not that deep or involved, so I hoped the characters would shine out, but sadly not.The Addams Family members are completely new characters, full of emotion and empathy, making them nothing like the original Addams Family members. They all seem to phone in their performances too.The wider cast is ok, but seeing Christina Ricci makes you feel sad that she's not playing an older Wednesday in a more adult story, which would have been much more enjoyable.The performance by \"Thing\" (the hand) overwhelmingly outshines every other actor when it's on screen. All the nuance and emotion missing (or misplaced) in the other characters shines from the performance of a single hand.For teenagers who loved those boy wizard movies, or Angsty teen dramas like Riverdale, this is for you.

            "content": "With a long history of different adaptations of Charles Addam's classic characters Wednesday is no doubt the most ambitious. Sent to a Supernatural Academy for outcasts like herself, Wednesday Addams must uncover a strange series of murders happening on the campus.At first I was a bit puzzled about a character that sticks out of the normal environment going to a school where she blends right in cuz it would make situations less funny and not letting the character stand out. But to my surprise everything for the most part works tremendously with its excellent production & set design, colorful cast of supporting characters, and of course Jenna Ortega as our lead weirdo. Ortega was born to play this modern interpretation of Wednesday Addams. Channeling that same dark energy Christina Ricci brought in the '90s films while also making it her own, Ortega delivers plenty of morbid humor as well as showing much wit into solving this grizzly case. As expected Wednesday doesn't show much emotion for her situations but the moments she does they generally do hit hard. Emma Myers lights up every scene as Wednesday's roommate Enid while Joy Sunday as Bianca gets plenty to do then what one could expect from the usual bully tropes. There's tons of easter eggs throughout that'll make Addam's Family enthusiast like myself smile manically.There are a few things that keep the show from hitting gold status. While the murder mystery is pretty engaging the whole way through I was able to predict who it was going to be before the end. It's probably never a good idea to make your characters overly nice cuz that makes it too obvious. While I appreciate the show for getting an actor that resembles a more comic accurate Gomez Addams, Luis Guzm\u00e1n just doesn't have that energy or sharp charisma seen in previous performances nor does he share barely any chemistry with Catherine Zeta-Jones's Morticia. Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester also doesn't make for a very good portrayal of the character. There's also this love triangle with Wednesday and two other students at the academy who are dull as dishwater.Despite these shortcomings Wednesday is a solid effort nevertheless. It shouldn't be anyone's first time discovering The Addams Family but definitely a refreshing take for the formula. Without its aesthetic and excellent performances it would just be another standard teen drama.",

She's remarkable as Wednesday. The hand actor for Thing and everything that went into making the character possible is perfection. The only other drawback for me is the slight tonal shift in some places of the second half of the season when Tim Burton is not directing. The other directors all do a great job and do come very close to matching Burton, and they almost get there. There's not a bad episode in the bunch though.

So, I tune in and find that it's a series based on the Sixties hit \"The Addams Family\". Right there a lot of readers are going huh? Since their earliest recollection would be the pair of films from the Nineties with Anjelica Huston. Whatever. Be that as it may, I persevered beyond the first episode and got to the point where I had to see where it all led to. I'd have to say Jenna Ortega is a pretty fine actress as the title character. I was certain she would have to break down and crack a smile at least once during the series run, but she remained true to form as the death obsessed daughter of Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Gomez (Luis Guzman) Addams, who send her off to the school they both attended after Wednesday dumped a pail of piranhas into the swimming pool where the boys' athletic team was practicing. No result of that prank was made known, but I think one can visualize at least one likely scenario.The Nevermore school was one for outcasts, similar to Hogwarts, but after the names of the student groups was mentioned - Fangs, Furs, Stoners, Scales - they were never a factor again. After witnessing the murder of a student by a monster like creature, Wednesday decides she'll stick around to solve the crime, after the local sheriff (Jamie McShane), and Principal Weems (Gwendoline Christie) fail to take her eyewitness account seriously. From there, tension builds, and story lines interweave, with a little sidebar of how Gomez was arrested for murder! Twenty years prior while attending Nevermore.I mentioned how Wednesday never broke down to smile, but let me correct that statement. Episode seven brought in my favorite character, Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen), who provided a much-needed spark of humor when things got really down and dirty. He turned Wednesday on to the idea of a Hyde at work with the now growing number of campus killings, informing her that a Hyde will have a master, so now it's a two-person search to solve the killings.I'd have to say the writing gets a little complex in the final chapters if you're not paying attention but stay the course and it all comes together nicely. I'd still have to say the series is targeted for teens and young adults, but I stayed with it and found it to be an entertaining ride. In the middle of watching it, Netflix revealed that it's now their top viewed series surpassing 'Stranger Things', so if you don't want to be left out, check it out now.",

Jenna Ortega's memorable performance and her dynamic with the likes of Emma Myers as the roommate Enid and franchise favourite Thing are for me the best aspects of the show.Some other characters also entertain, such as Principle Weems, Eugene and various members of the Addams Family. There are some characters that are reasonably good, but forgettable, and some that I find generally lifeless or annoying like both boys vying for Wednesday's attention.The plot unfolds in a reasonably good way. I would describe the premise as Addams Family characters set in a very Americanised and gothic version of a Hogwartz-esque school setting, that has elements of X-Men, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and others. It has clich\u00e9d teenage characters, uninteresting romantic interests, but the mystery stays generally compelling throughout. When all answers were revealed I was slightly disappointed, but most characters did enough to keep it all entertaining throughout, thanks to some good humorous dialogue, sight gags, and amusing performances.A big positive is the cinematography, art design, editing, and visual storytelling.

Four houses compete to be best, at all cost and tricks. And oh yeah, it went more like Ben Hur's chariot race rather than Quidditch game.Wednesday has a nemesis too, And his name was (yes, you can say his name) Joseph Crackstone. There is also a (not so) secret society called Nightshade, principal in the form of Brienne of Tarth and chamber of secrets (pun intended)Wednesday's first season feels refreshing and exciting. I can't wait for second season. Hopefully, there would be a Teacher Againts The Dark Arts, with a deep and intimidating voice: \"Wednesday Addams. You are neither special nor important, and no, the fate of Nevermore Academy never depends on you\"Refreshing 9/10.",

Well, the bestest thing in this category for a while at least. It's funny, full of little twists, a little scary, quite mysterious and never really what you would expect, which is exactly what you'd expect from something with the Addams name.",

Of course, it was beautifully shot, scored and acted - all that was to be expected. I just didn't see why it needed to be 8 episodes. This could've easily just been a two-hour, stand-alone film.The title teen Addams is transferred to yet another school after, gasp, misbehaving and just think of it as a very, very scaled down Hogwarts. And just like Harry Potter, there are plenty of mysteries to solve before the end of the school year.While I didn't mind the casting at all, in fact, Catherine Zeta-Jones looked amazing and Jenna Ortega as Wednesday did good for the most part, I just thought they lacked chemistry as a family and I thoroughly didn't like this disjointed version of the Addams Family. Naturally anyone, including me right now, will compare this to the OG 90s duo (excluding the 3rd one.) I not only liked those first two films better than this whole season, but I even liked the 2019 animated movie more as well.Would I recommend? Eh, maybe. I didn't hate it and I did manage to stay through all 8 episodes with the first and last ones being the best ones. I won't watch any more. I prefer just to stick with the 90s classics.***Final Thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I'm beating myself up that it took me over an hour to figure out that side character is Christina Ricci.",

This character depiction is reduced to stupid hair, acting like he's a teenager with raging hormones and awful one liners referring to Wednesday. It's an awful depiction in my opinion.Thankfully they are only in the series a couple of episodes and I'm hoping that will continue in series 2\nI cannot imagine that there won't be a second series as there is so much to love about it.Enid and Wednesday are perfectly cast as are the rest of the crew and the plot will twist and turn sufficiently to entertain and make you laugh etc.",

Even though, the series focuses on Wednesday Addams and her adolescent problems such as her fight not to be like her mother, love affairs etc. And her life among the other outcasts , it still has the feeling of the old show with all the interesting family members. To be honest, I wish we could've seen a little bit more of the other family members but that's not a big deal as the series' called Wednesday.I want to underline another point before coming to the flawless performance by Jenna Ortega, which is the lack of representation of some outcast members. I haven't understood the the purpose of other outcast members than Enid, Bianca, Eugene and Xavier. It's understandable as Nevermore is a huge school with many outcasts but I would like to see at least more of Yoko as she seems to be written to be an important character but we could see not many scenes including her. Hopefully, we'll see more from other outcasts next season.Now lets come to the point of Jenna's performance which instantly increases my rating by one point. I'm not unfamiliar with her performance as I've watched her on The Fallout, Stuck in the Middle, X and Scream, but I was still shocked when I watched episode 1 of Wednesday. I've watched lots of movies and series this year but her performance as Wednesday has impressed me the most. It's no shocker as she had given lots and lots of efforts to portray the character before the shooting started (learning Cello, fencing, archery and German). I don't even need to mention the dancing scene :) It's pleasing to see she finally gets the attention she's already deserved from the fans and critics.I know it'd be a long review as I'm unable to shorten my ideas as a non-native speaker, so I added a pros cons section for ease to read :)CONS\n-Lack of relationship with family members and representation of them.-Lack of representation of characters other than major characters and some minor ones.-Some CGI are a little bit cartoonish.-Script could be little bit darker and gory which would make the series more Tim Burtonesque (As the show's rated 18+)PROS\n+ JENNA ORTEGA, she's just flawless, I couldn't think of any other cast for the role after Christina Ricci's performance+EMMA MYERS. She's so cool, funny and colorful. Enid is perfect other half to complete Wednesday's Ying with her Yang :)+Thing <3+Christina Ricci+All other cast (Yes, including Luis Guzman :) as opposed to the most of the comments saying he's not the right choice, I loved his Gomez and he looks like the Gomez from comic strips)+Directing is really solid, especially the first 4 episodes.P.

Nothing bad to say about Zeta-Jones, though. She's perfect and gorgeous as Morticia Addams. And the little bro, is just too irrelevant to care. Now, I won't lie. The premise sounds a awful lot like all of the platform's teen fantasy series. And as entertaining as this one can be, it lacks originality. And is surprisingly tame coming from the anything but commonly Tim Burton. Maybe he just signed his name, and left it to other people to develop the concept. Which would explain a lot.

How many times will she get it wrong and be arrogant enough to ruin all of the friendships that don't even make sense?Speaking of friendships. The concept of outcasts gets overshadowed by the fact that everybody wants to Wednesday's friend, and she does not mind people breaking her boundaries, despite being famous for having no patience for such thing previously.

The courtyard scene from Mean Girls, multiple visuals exactly from Harry Potter movies. It was really hard to ignore. We're those supposed to be references? Sheer amount makes it feel just lazy.Acting was supposed to be campy, but is severely lacking, and just makes you feel awkward.

But only the first half of the first episode of this series captures the spirit of Wednesday Addams for me. In those first 30 minutes Wednesday delivers such crisp, snappy, irreverent dialogue that I thought \"wow, this is amazing - I can't believe how good this is\", but it doesn't last. The character is played well by Ortega, but the writing quickly veers away from what makes her and the Addams' so cool and instead drives down a one way street filled with childish teen drama.Eventually they even kind of give up trying to make Wednesday unusual - she starts wearing increasingly normal clothes, develops close friendships with a shockingly large number of classmates, becomes more emotional and... well, increasingly normal.It becomes this bland mix of Harry Potter and the recent Sabrina reboot (with an extra dash of Netflix's politics for good measure); a supernatural teen drama show littered with forgettable side characters, clich\u00e9d child-like plot lines, a tedious love triangle (yes, really), and cheesy dialogue peppered with trite political slogans.It's so far away from the quirky, kooky, irreverent, gothic, deadpan, macabre, sarcastic, ironic, and surprisingly well-functioning family unit we know and love that it's almost offensive. Instead we have a resentful Wednesday, a weirdly frosty and controlling Morticia, a corpulent Gomez who has zero chemistry with Morticia, an afterthought of a Pugsly, and an almost non-existent Lurch (he does look the part at least). Only Thing is really nailed - the new design of the hand is cool, and he's amusing, dutiful, and endearing as a character. Funny how there's more character in that chopped-off hand than almost all other characters besides Wednesday.3/10 for the three highlights: Ortega's acting, Thing, and some funny one-liners from Wednesday (most of which happen in the first episode).

I had to force myself to watch an episode each night with my spouse and neither of us were impressed with the story, characters, and overall depth of the series. I can appreciate dramatic shows as much as the next person, but the writing done on this show was so poor I could hardly suspend my disbelief for five minutes as the show revealed plothole after plothole. As if that weren't enough, it was also riddled with a criminal amount of terrible high school drama tropes. I like tropes when they're done well, but these were lazily-written and unoriginal.The only redeeming factor of the show is Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday, even as I grew to loathe her character. She does do a very good doom and gloom goth, and has some good one-liners. Sadly, they're just one-liners, as Wednesday doesn't have interactions with other characters so much as she has stand-offs where she always gets the last word. Nobody seems to know how to respond to Wednesday, ever, which makes for terrible dialogue between the characters on the show.Speaking of the other characters-the only lead with any chemistry whatsoever with Wednesday was Enid, her roommate who inexplicably puts up with a barrage of hurtful remarks in exchange for an almost-smile or two from Wednesday. Still, they had more going for them than whatever the hell Wednesday/Tyler and Wednesday/Xavier had going on. For the first three episodes, I genuinely couldn't tell the two guys apart. I thought they were the same character. They might as well be for all the depth they have. Both of their performances were terrible (Tyler in particular looked like he was constantly grimacing), but I can hardly cast too much blame on them when they obviously had very little to go on with their characters. Both are so ridiculously generic.By the end of the show, I hated Wednesday's character. She's obsessive, petulant, unnecessarily rude, self-absorbed, needlessly dramatic, manipulative, and utterly toxic to everyone she comes across. There is literally nothing to like about this character by the time the show is finished.",

Their world was slightly terrifying but never shown in depth, or taken too seriously, so you didn't start feeling awkward about laughing.Wednesday, however, starts to dive into their world and you realize they might be terrible people or at least severely mentally ill.

Or I'm simply too old as I can imagine I would have enjoyed it way better if I was 14 or something. I am a bit tired that I have to shut down my brain completely to enjoy things thanks to horrible writing.With little changes this could have been made a way better show:\n1. It has literally nothing common with the original Adams Family neither in spirit or characters besides the names.2. Many of the cast is simply utterly boring, uninteresting and do nothing for the story. It could have been simply avoided if multiple characters would have been moulded into fewer, but due to this more complex ones. Or left out completely.3. I know most shows are made for \"modern audiences\" and in spirit I agree, but... I would have left Wednesday either asexual or at the very least her suitors could have been at least a tiny bit competent and a bit more masculine in general. My wife pointed it out to me that if Wednesday was played by a male, the barista and the painter guy would have been played by females with the exact same lines and manner it would have made a lot more sense. After imagining an watching it with this perspective I had to 100% agree. I am assuming the writers could not write male roles.4. I know in the first point I already raised it as a concern that the original IP was not really used in any manner, but this iteration of Gomez and Morticia was pretty horrible especially if I compare it to the wholesome original.5. The plot did not really do anything smart most of the story was outright dumb and the visions invalidated any effort in the entire movie. Everything was falling into Wednesday's lap literally.6. Wednesday's character did have some flaws that was called out on, but she was a bit too Mary Sue still. I am not sure why did they have to include so many things into the character. She is smart, bilingual, plays an instrument, brave, crafty and have the goth thing too with vision superpowers. Why does she have to be a character who stands up against bullying, karate chops multiple twice her size guys, repairs coffee machines and so on. It is again the typical case when they cram everything in... Most of the fight scenes operate with fast cuts at least so it is not actually shown how stupid it is. Why does a mystery/horror show need these???7. They went to an academy where we have literally no idea what do they do. I can't be the only one wondering what the hell they are doing there. They go to a single class about botany with a single teacher and they have a headmaster. Oh and they fence I guess and there was a teacher there too probably... Why was this added as a setting?8. They named l supernatural creatures \"outcasts\" and yet they are literally not casted out. They fit into both society and form perfectly functional social groups too. A very cringe choice of word.Just to say some positive things:\n1. The cinematography is great\n2. The costumes are very good\n3. The animations are believable and good for a show like this\n4. I think the actors did a very good job too\n5. The story is generally somewhat interesting (despite the horrible writing)",

I was pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable this show was, and how well casted it's characters are. Jenna Ortega is the perfect Wednesday, playing her with a refreshingly morbid sense of humor and dark yet wry outlook. This is where the series sold me. It's increasingly rare to have a show where the protagonist is smart, capable, and endearing instead of one-note, whiny, or just simply unlikable. I correctly guessed the overarching mysteries and plot twists fairly easily and early on, but I didn't mind because I enjoyed the journey through the series and through Wednesday's character growth (Another rare quality in modern TV protagonists 'cough' 'cough' She-Hulk 'cough' 'cough'). The production as a whole is quite well done, as is to be expected from cinematic mainstays like Tim Burton.Of course, there are some cons. It has the usual Hollywood political overtones, but it doesn't constantly beat you over the head with them. Some might say that a few characters are somewhat cartoonish or exaggerated, but I take that to be in the spirit and style of the show as a whole and overall quite fitting (I mean, it's the Addams family, not Twin Peaks). The supporting cast including Gwendoline Christie, Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta Jones, and other newer talents nicely round out the supporting characters. The entire Addams family was perfectly cast, and Thing is still one of my favorite characters in the show. For those worried about waiting for a second season to conclude the story arc, fear not. This season is fairly well contained, coming to a satisfying conclusion in the finale.Overall I was pleasantly surprised 4/5.",

As Wednesday becomes intrigued, she also starts digging to find out who the killer or beast is, perhaps she can save her school in the process.Throughout each episode, the main character has evolved until she can rescue the Nevermore Academy and her family. Despite starting out lonely, Wednesday ended up becoming a hero who is beloved by everyone. As she contemplated going out for a date, she found herself kissing the beast she had been looking for, considering it her best match, but she insisted to destroy him.We expect nothing less from Tim Burton. For instance, the first thing he does in this film is to create an atmosphere that is unprecedented. He makes our main character Wednesday extremely dark and gothic: the way she speaks, the way she walks, and the fact that she is wearing only black.Life is all about being yourself means different, but you shouldn't live alone, with constant caution, obviously.Despite your coldness and difficulty, your heart must soften, for you are a living being driven by feelings. Wednesday, at the beginning of the series, quoted the French philosopher Sartre as saying: \"Hell is other people\".But in the end, this saying was contradicted when Eugene attacked Laurel by shedding bees on her and said: 'Hummers stick together' and Wednesday's look confirmed his words.The writing is quite interesting, it was jointly written by Charles Addams, Miles Miller, and Alfred Gough. As you do not get bored at any time, you cannot look away from the screen.The direction was very precise, and was also split between Tim Burton (4episodes), James Marshall (2 episodes), and Gandja Monteiro (2 episodes):\n-The Image is beautiful, very colourful, and dominated by the Gothic atmosphere.-Success in casting all main and secondary characters.-The costume and the make-up were so colorful and realistic except Wednesday she was unicolor.-A gothic horror decor that emerged mainly in the building of the Nevermore Academy; the large number of statues, drawings and paintings.-The soundtrack used in the series allowed us to enter and experience the suspense mixed with some hits for 40 years (Metallica, DuaLipa, The Cramps).Well, thank you for that work of art.We'll hold off until next season.",

When a friend told me it was like Chilling Adventures of Sabrina I facepalmed, I didn't get along very well with that show at all, but thankfully I think it was nothing like that but instead far superior than Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.One of the things this show does is hit me with what I love most about media. Characters. I love good characters, this is one of those shows where character really trumps story. The story is fine and all if not a little predictable, but I absolutely loved the characters. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is the best Wednesday since Christina Ricci, I might even say better. She really gives off a great deadpan expression. Emma Myers who plays Enid is just a treat, she is great, she has a charming way with expressions and emoting on camera, Enid and Wednesday's chemistry together is perfect I cannot keep my eyes off them.Even the Addams Family themselves are all good, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Morticia and Gomez Addams are perfect, straight from the old cartoon iterations themselves.Even some of the side characters are fun and they are for the most part not as boring as I would have thought, Joy Sunday as Bianca is a character I really enjoyed, she plays that high class snobby but also quite sympathetic character you can get behind as time goes on. Jamie McShane as the Shieff isn't half bad and has a few moments.Everyone in this show has their own little quirks and identity and its enjoyable to watch.As mentioned before the story is very hit and miss but it still hooks you in, its a detective/mystery plot for the most part and it does its part well but its the characters that really help drive that story along and I am completely okay with that.The writing for the most part is fine, there are some lines of dialogue that make me roll my eyes, a bit too many buzzwords thrown in that will probably date this show in time, thankfully the great writing on the characters keeps everything well enough so you don't really care too much. That is the true strength of this shows quality.There are few negatives about the show really. It does come across as a very X-Men school type of show. The dealing with outside prejudice, a school of misfits with powers, even though that is kind of played down a bit in this show. I do admit maybe the love interests of Wednesday and Enid are a bit bland at times but they still command a bit of interest. Additionally the whole love triangle trope is a bit eye rolling at times and plays like a young adult show. In fact the whole show at times feels more like a young adult fare than it does anything else.Overall a awesome show, though not perfect delivers everything you would expect from a show based on Addams Family's Wednesday. Any show that can get me to smile this much throughout must be worth it. If you come in expecting a full on Addams Family show you might be disappointed, but if you liked Wednesday enough and the idea that she's grown up and in a boarding school, then you may find something of worth.I certainly enjoyed season one for sure and look forward to season two.",

Horror should be added to the description of the series on IMDb. That this is rated for 14 years old is very sad (and that most teenagers love blood and dismembered bodies, and that's what actually sells, is even sadder). This Wednesday doesn't have the magic and sweetness of the Wednesday of the 1991 The Addams Family (directed by Barry Sonnenfeld) played by Christina Ricci when she actually was 11 years old -not 20). This Wednesday appears like a spoiled selfish teenager. That's a pity and it's the script's fault, not the actress', who did a great job in spite of the script. Overall, too much blood, not funny, not fun either, and completely overrated. 3/10 (1 point for the music, 1 point for the cast, and 1 point for the nostalgia).",

Once there a mystery involving their parents, magic and monsters creates whimsical narrative. Sound familiar?Wednesday answers the question no one asked. What if the Adam's family went to hogwarts? Then changed it just enough to avoid plagerisim. Here Wednesday is Goth Nancy drew. Solving the mysteries with constant thing ex machina.Well shot. Well acted. Monster looks like a cheap CGI garbage version of xtro. Stories are bland, recycled high-school drama/Harry Potter plot points. It aims more mature but falls flat in teen drama. At times it's rather insufferable. Pushed as a comedy it's seldom ever funny.Many will enjoy this. Turn your brain off and you can. Think about it and it's the same teen drama that's been on repeat on cable for 30 years. Neither original or very Adam's family.Give it a shot. But if your bored by episode 2 pick something else. The beat dosen't change.",

What I really miss is some good and interesting story, the whole show is just a potpourri of well known ideas thrown and mixed together: a little Hogwarts here, a little Twilight there and so on and on. Thanks to the fine cast (Zeta-Jones, Ricci, Christie among others) and the nice production, Wednesday is still good enough to waste some time, and I'm pretty sure, that someone in his teens or early twenties will like the show more than I do. All in all a solid piece, but I like The Addams Family from the 60s a little more.",

It's played very seriously, with Wednesday trying to uncover a mystery, becoming highly proactive. This is a big detour from other iterations, where the Addams family really couldn't care less about anything but their own macabre home life. Sure, the movies had serious elements and the Addams were put in peril, but they relished in it. At death's door, Gomez and Morticia found ecstasy and the normies looked on in horror. That's the appeal: these death-obsessed goths clashing with the real world. In this show, Morticia and Gomez immediately take Wednesday out of high school in the real world and put her in Hogwarts. All the weirdos Wednesday meets kind of take the effect out of the Addams Family, making her seem rather normal. Great acting (particularly the actress playing Wednesday) and production value can't save the show from such an odd tone.",

I think the biggest reason is two of the stars - Jenna Ortega as the deadpan Wednesday and the outstanding Gwendoline Christie as fashionable yet acidly sweet Principal Weems. These two along with an ok cast, great sets and fantastic costume make this rather thin murder/mystery keep you engaged. Also, the whole concept of Nevermore Academy is just a rip off of Hogwarts, in this case for 'outcast' that covers vampires, wolves, sirens and gorgons. That part of the story, and the supernatural elements, is deficient to say the least. Yet, this is much more a tween oriented series so on that basis Wednesday is much better than a lot of other series out there.",

The feel is exactly as it should be. It's Wednesday, it works without the comedy of all the proceeding versions of the Addamses. It occurs to me that those that love the Addams family are drawn to the dark deadpan delivery, not really needing the funny. As a coffee drinker from infancy, I love that Wednesday's coffee order is the same as mine (4 shot espresso). End of the episode and it's still a 10. The whole cast has the odd surprise, but they work so well. CZJ as Morticia - a big surprise, I'd not looked up the cast in advance. The first scene with her in the car - that \"I know I know you, but who are you\" feeling...... I remember her fro The Darling Buds of May back in 1991.

Why is Wednesday so angry with her mother, played by Catherine Zeta Jones (Who at first felt was NOT the best pick for the role of Wednesday's Mother until further into the season in scenes where she wasn't acting with that horrible choice of an actor they picked to play he father!) Wednesday and her brother may have \"played\" rough or she may have had some \"hate\" towards him but in every other movie or episode I've seen she adores her family... I mean it's \"The Adams Family\".... They showed us that family is the most important thing to have! So yes I understand her being the way she is towards others but the entire interactions with her family were strange and different but maybe Wednesday is supposed to be \"Growing Up?\"\nThe second thing... I hated the choice for almost every actor in this series! I'm sorry I just don't understand the appeal of these skinny and scrawny \"boys\" being so appealing to women lately! You see it in a lot of movies now but yeah if the guy I'm dating is thinner than I am it's a turn off! I mean they don't have to be bodybuilding muscle-heads... but I like a lil meat on the bones I guess lol. Wow my review is probably going to be so unliked!I know that's Tim Burtons style but even Johnny Depp has some good size to him!Yea so when I can't get into a cast because of actors that I really don't enjoy playing iconic parts... it ruins it for me.In fact... I almost stopped watching after the first episode... I legit thought it was corny as all hell and again seeing her around her parents that episode didn't help. The ONLY reason I came back to finish watching was because 1. I saw the TikTok video of her amazingly choreographed dance number and really wanted to see it but didn't know why she'd be with that guy at a dance so I just went back and watched it from where I left off.She did a fantastic job playing Wednesday. She and the actress who played her roommate and the actress who played the dean... loves them! However all the others just made me not want to watch... I ended up kinda just watching it when nothing else was on I wanted to watch and i had to rewatch episodes over and over because I kept falling asleep... I guess I was one of the only people who just didn't catch the \"Wednesday Fever\"",

He is another reason I wanted to watch this.

Even the supporting cast is excellent, highlighted by Emma Myers as Enid, who is able to bring out the best in our heroine despite the fact that she is colourful.

Add to that my absolute love for Tim Burton's way of seeing monsters as misfits rather than awful creatures, and you get the most awaited series of my life. I had already seen a few images thanks to the Festival Lumi\u00e8re in France, and I was waiting for it to come out with a bit of worry, what if the story was not good, what if the actors didn't deliver? Within the first few minutes, I already knew that Jenna Ortega was absolute perfection for the role, and I was confirmed in my believes throughout the whole series. Ortega pulls the whole cast up, with absolutely amazing lines that I wish would have come out of my brain in the same situation. And she made me forget the few things that were not on the same level, like the story that is a bit too simplistic, and I expected most of the actions in the series. I knew who was the main villain within the first 20 minutes of the first episode. And even though Luis Guzm\u00e1n is amazing as Gomez Addams, Catherine Zeta-Jones is really not a good Morticia, thankfully she doesn't appear that much in the series.

The writing becomes thin as it drags and tries desperately to find cliffhangers and stretch the story to the next episode. The number of times someone goes in and out of the local jail and is almost expelled but then forgiven, or something \"terrible\" may or may not happen to whatever character gets ridiculous in the last few episodes.I hope Tim continues to the second season and figures out how to write several unique episodes that organically tie together. Unfortunately, each episode just started feeling repetitive; the only thing keeping me engaged were the characters and their various arcs.Beyond that, as many have already said, Jenna Ortega is Wednesday, Addams.

She is completely flat. Not a single emotion. It was probably VERY challenging for the actress and I appreciate her effort. But to be entertained by that performance there needs to be contrast. Gomez has zero charm. No personality, no humor. Morticia pretty much the same. Flat, dry and completely unconvincing. Even her makeup lacks contrast. Lurch was completely unimposing, Pugsley barely there.Out of the Addams family, the second best performance behind Wednesday was Thing.I had hoped the dullness would be relieved once they get to the school, but the one bright and charming performance by Wednesday's roommate wasn't enough to save it. Even the school is dull and devoid of mystery. We are told as an audience from the outset the nature of the school clicks. No surprises and completely predictable.My daughter insisted I get at least as far as the school dance, but when I saw that was episode 4 I bailed. Did not even finish episode 1.",

Thing steals the show alongside Wednesday. Period.However, here are my reasons of why, and despite that, I don't believe it's as fantastic as a TV series as I've been hearing around:1. The Addams family. Wednesday (and maybe uncle fester) is the only one I really see. Zeta-Jones as Morticia is nice regarding make-up, but I don't feel the character as I used to in previous movies. Luis Guzm\u00e1n doesn't make Gomez for me, Idk. And I don't see the fatty inocent Pugsley in any way.2. Enid is a nice character, but it seems kind of... Exagerated? Maybe it's something they did on purpouse to make it clear she's as opposite to Wednesday as she can be, but still. Too much.3. The main plot has so many problems. The way the story is connected to the Addams family is the most interesting part of it, but how it's solved, how it's rushed at the end around the Crackstone and the Gates... It doesn't work that much.4. It was too predictable to know who the Monster was, and it was also too obvious how the show was trying to focus the attention and the clues in a different direction.

Wednesday Addams goes to a Hogwarts-style school for \"Outcasts\", complete with \"monster\" factions they never really delve into or explore, and gets wrapped up in a Scooby-Doo Nancy Drew murder mystery featuring a m-m-m-MONSTER!!! Despite Wednesdays sulking, pouty demeanor, monotone delivery, and constant braggadocio, she's incredibly inept at sleuthing. Thing does most of the work and carries the heavy loads, functioning as the resident deus ex machina. After multiple wrong guesses, people getting killed who didn't need to die, and some light kidnapping and torture, Wednesday gets handed the killers identity on a silver platter due to her psychic powers. Very Mary Sue!The show isn't all bad, Jenna Ortega does the best job she can with character that can really only be played one way. Gwendoline Christie delivers as the school headmistress, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman excel as Morticia and Gomez Addams. Fred Armisen puts in a competent cameo as Uncle Fester. All minor and supporting characters on the show are pretty much one-dimensional archetypes, but that's probably all there's room for because there's so many of them. The show throws in a lot of these characters into the mix in an obvious attempt to create subplots for more seasons, and to lay the groundwork for what they hope will be an Addams Cinematic Universe. *sigh*So overall: great casting, really good actors doing the best they can with a script that's heavily and obviously young adult fluff, in a drawn out murder mystery at a lamer, Addams family version of Hogwart's. It's trite teen fare, deliberately so, and really fails to deliver anything beyond that.

But it didn't turn out good, for me at least. Burton has, unfortunately but most certainly, lost his touch. Everything he puts out nowadays is sprinkled with oversaturated images, bad CGI, plastic looking people, costumes and sets, and strangely enough, a very childish energy. And they all feel empty, like there was no passion in making them. If you don't believe me just go check movies like Dark Shadows, Miss Peregrine, and Dumbo. They all look the same, and they feel the same. Granted I still enjoy Dark Shadows a lot, and I think Big Eyes is a pretty solid film, but still.Enid Sinclair is the personification of everything I have just typed. Incredibly colourful, plastic looking, annoying, and childish. Larissa Weems, the headmistress at Nevermore (what even is that name?), serves as another perfect example. What is the point with having characters like this? They feel generic, and they look generic, and they are too basic, and kept taking me out of it.Wednesday Addams started off great, but turned into just another generic character pretty quickly. Can we please have strange, unhinged characters and just appreciate them for what they are? Why are they trying to make her \"normal\"? I get it a character needs to have depth and some development to them, but that doesn't mean she should start acting all sweet and \"normal\" all of a sudden. She's not. That's the point. Stop ruining everything. I LOVED Jenna Ortega's performance though, I'll give the show that.Anyway that's more or less all I wanted to say.

            "content": "This show mixes a lot of the elements from successful franchises like Harry Potter and Riverdale then backs it up with a lot of the original dark humor and lore from the Addams family. The result is a bit of a \"super powered teen soap opera murder mystery\" and, while this mix could easily flop, \"Wednesday\" totally makes it works.A big part of the success is due to Jenna Ortega's amazing performance. She's perfect as Wednesday but the supporting cast, especially Emma Myers, also deliver in their performances in a way that's campy, fun, but also heartfelt. The direction and production value are also solid. Totally a quality show.While I haven't finished the series yet, my only complaint would be this: I think there's some inconsistency between the Addam's family history / lore of diabolical behavior - indeed a lot of Wednesday's dark jokes infer terrible things her family has done in the past - and one of the main story arcs where a member of their family is accused of murder. Without giving anything away, the character's reaction to the accusation seemed way out of character to me. You'd expect the Addam's family would sort of laugh it off, or be like \"yup, that makes sense. Next.\" but instead it seems to conjure up feelings of mistrust and betrayal, which just seemed odd considering there are plenty of other jokes where the family is kinda like \"oh yeah, our uncle is a cannibal\" and then nonchalantly moves on.This isn't a major criticism, and I'm still very much enjoying the show I just think it's weird that the whole family is a celebration of \"the dark side\" but then, in this one instance, they're like \"oh no, that would be bad behavior\". Lol, wut?",

Blending the over-the-top world of this spooky family with Burton's masterful macabre abilities feels like a masterstroke, quickly elevating this to one of Netflix their current top shows.The support of castmembers such as Zeta-Jones and the original Wednesday Christina Ricci certainly helps, but it's young Jenna Ortega who steals the show effortlessly. Her ice-cold depiction of deeply sarcastic Wednesday Addams is of Antarctic-freeze levels and will leave you all warm and fuzzy when watching her bend her entire world to her dark and brooding will.A must see for any Tim Burton fan and anyone who loves some dark comedy really.

            "content": "My dad would watch the original Addams Family when I was a kid, I do remember the unique mannerisms of each character and the cooky, spooky lifestyle they lived. I remember liking Munsters more, but both were enjoyable enough. However I was basically the prime demographic for the films and, like many others, yeah, I loved them. Never saw the CGI one.I went into Wednesday knowing pretty much nothing about it except it was a spinoff based on Wednesday and Christina Ricci was somewhere in it.Indeed, I was quite pleasantly surprised. Honestly, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I only have a few complaints, and most fall under the same umbrella...But they had a VERY high standard to live up to...and I'd say they did as good a job as anyone probably could have.One thing I recall about the previous Addams family iterations is they didn't necessarily relish in the fact they were so weird. They just...were. It was sort of their thing, how they were basically oblivious to how twisted and odd they were, and it was everyone else who commented on it. Wednesday doesn't really follow this, which I do find disappointing...to an extent. In its defense, from what we've seen, it does seem to be mostly Wednesday who almost takes pride in her oddities, and the rest of the family is ^^as above. Of course, we see barely anything of the family, so we'll just have to see where they go with it.However, if you 'are' going to make this change, I think Ortega and the writers did as good a job as you can. It's not like she made a HUGE deal out of her weirdness, but it was still a shift away from the traditional Wednesday.The other major complaint is similar to others here. At its core, Wednesday really is a teen drama, a la Degrassi. Definitely not as cheesy and teenie as Degrassi, the show absolutely is made to appeal to adults as well, but it's a similar structure where most of the episodes in some way revolve around teenage drama at school...namely boys and popularity contests, \"proving\" yourself etc. Fortunately there was still enough \"adult\" content that I could just roll my eyes and laugh to quickly get over some of the cheese, but it seems more like a show made for a mother/daughter than a general fan of Addams, Burton, or all things creepy.Having said that, I enjoyed it immensely. I loved the dry humor and wit Ortega delivered so perfectly. She is, obviously, the real star of the show. I'm a pretty 50/50 Armisen fan but I don't see how anyone couldn't like his Fester. Is it Christopher Lloyd? No. But so what? He still did a great job showing the demented quirkiness of Uncle Fester. Just because it's different or not as good doesn't mean it isn't good. Lloyd's version was actually much more of a shift away from OG Uncle Fester, so if you don't like Armisen, you can't claim that as being a reason.Same applies with the family members. I think the 90s films pretty much perfectly cast the Addams Family, so Netflix had a high bar to beat there, and instead of also going for the \"perfect\" look, they decided to roll the dice and go with the \"new\" look.For the most part, it works. It will be divisive, but I think over time we will continue to appreciate THIS Addams family more and more. I admit, I don't 'love' CZJ's Morticia, but I don't hate her either. I'm probably in the minority of that one though so, take it or leave it.They are also clearly trying to capitalize on the ever widening gap of Harry Potter content, so Nevermore and Wednesday's paranormal adventures are very reminiscent of the Harry Potter movies...if you liked those, you will almost certainly like Wednesday. Just imagine Hogwarts but slightly smaller and if Tim Burton designed it, and they frequently visit Hogsmeade.And on the note of Harry Potter there is also a magic/paranormal aspect to Wednesday, which at first I was a little iffy on, but I learned to appreciate what they were going for...which is exactly what they said. A unique spin off with the Wednesday character, not a re-creation of Wednesdays past.My advice? Don't look too far into it. Take Wednesday for what it is...a portrayal of everyone's favorite sociopathic anti-hero prodigy...and you are bound to enjoy it.8/10, really hope to see more of Armisen and Ortega in a season 2.",

I saw that there was a huge amount of hype surrounding the launch date - another red flag (let's face it , most of the stuff that gets hyped to the eyeballs is utter rubbish).Then I saw that it was being made by Tim Burton , the master of the gentle macabre so I thought hmmmm. Of course Wednesday was being played by this girl Jenna something (yes, I know her name NOW, at the time I couldn't place her) and I thought, \"who is this upstart who is taking on the role of the ONLY Wednesday (Christina Ricci, of course). Then I saw that Christina Ricci was in it, and had said that Jenna whatsername did a great job, so I thought \"Ok, I will give it a go\".I must admit that I sat down to watch it 'on sufferance' and had it firmly in my mind that I was going to hate it.By the end of episode one I was hooked, and I binge watched the whole series. Jenna Ortega (yes, I knew her name now) did a great job as Wednesday, her room mate played her role magnificently, even down to the little subvocal whimpers and whines of a puppy when you listen for them. Christina Ricci was almost unrecognisable, but played her part well, as did most of the rest of the cast.I was somewhat disappointed with the look of Gomez, but it is more in keeping with the original comic, so I have to forgive that even if I was not keen, although he was one of the few characters that i felt phone in his part to an extent. Catherine Zeta Jones did not put in the performance of an Oscar winner, although I suppose she wasn't too bad. I think the only thing I wasn't keen on was the monster which looked kind of like Gollum on a bad acid trip.I have read a number of the reviews from those who really didn't like the series (many of them refer to it as a movie, so I am not sure how much they took notice,, or even if they watched past the first episode), and of those the main thing that people say is that it is not the same as the series and that it is only for teens. My response to that is \"No, it's not the same as the original series or the films, it's not meant to be. And, as for being for teenagers, I am 60 years old. I loved it\".",

The only thing that they lack in is the writing department. This is no exception to that.It truly just seemed like another Netflix teen drama that is an unnecessary dissection into Wednesday Adams only to repaint a feminist icon into the new geist of what is today. A twist to add in all of your political criteria while bringing in the ethos of what many younger women feel they are today; intelligent, self-sufficient, witty, sarcastic, and with a little bit of angst and cynicism. I know this is how the character is in a nutshell more or less, but this rendition seems more Gen-Z and contrived compared to the nuance I think the character should have.If it was done in a film or mini-series format it might have sat better with me, but them turning it into a Tv show is where the unnecessary dissection really comes into the foreground.

I thought \"what the hell, l give it a shot.\" Since I had no expectations I wasn't pre-empting anything but was pleasantly surprised and well... enthralled with a series which grabbed my attention and kept the momentum going till the end of the season. There were a few bumps along the way, but on the whole it delivered a great entertainment piece I really enjoyed.Of course we're probably well familiar with the Addams Family, their intricacies and dark existence, which for the most part has always been treated as a dark comedy genre. Its similar here but a little different. It's quirky, dark but a tad more open handed that prior renditions. Jenna Ortega - who I'd never heard of is exceptional as Wednesday, and when I saw Catherine Zeta-Jones in the opening credits of the first episode, I had to look twice to realise it was her playing Morticia Addams. Luis Guzman brings an unusual character rendition with Gomez, but a good one. In fact the whole cast is pretty accomplished and I loved Gwendoline Christies Principal Weens. Aside from the cast most things in the production are great. There is nothing that stands out as lacking though some things were problematic.I found the dichotomy of Nevermore existing in the space of the real world problematic and this persisted throughout the series. The framework of awareness is between the two worlds is not clearly defined as with say 'Harry Potter' so I found myself unable to accept or relax into much of the story as it unfolded as I was never sure how characters and occurrences were defined within the story space. For example the sheriff's attitude (and indeed that of the whole town) suggest he's completely ignorant of supernatural issues, then he isn't so much... then sort of is. Well which is it? It's an uncomfortable oversight that needs clarification and this is never done.I'm liberal minded and forward thinking, but don't like the way modern social issues seem to be shoehorned into every production out of Hollywood. I don't want to be beaten over the head with social issues (even those I agree with) when I'm trying to escape in an alternate plane of visual entertainment. I cringed when I heard Wednesday use the term 'Mansplaining' and nearly called it term when 'gender neutral toilets' came up in the plot.Joy Sunday who plays the black schoolgirl has thick luscious lips, but there is only one scene in the whole series (I suspect this was an oversight) where they don't look like they were coated with three layers of ultra mirror finish lip gloss. I'm not sure why this aspect of her persona had to be so severely accentuated, if it was shot in a strip joint them maybe, but in a school setting? It was totally ridiculous.Wednesday is fifteen (her sixteenth birthday in episode six) but the sheriff's son Tyler who works in the coffee shop is trying from episode one to 'court' (for want of a more robust word) her, and then date her! He looks mid to late twenties and even though it's ever stated just how old he is, the screenplay pits him in about mid twenties and its safe to say he seems and acts ten years older than Wednesday. This makes him a blatant podophile. Even seeing them before they became somewhat 'entangled' gave me an uneasy feeling of repulsion in the pit of my stomach and seeing them kiss was just weird and mind-bogglingly distasteful at least and unacceptable at most. It isn't really OK for a TV series to portray this as OK and I found difficult to deal with throughout the series. Did the produces think it was ok to have 25 year old man going after a 15 year old girl? Really?Ok so those are my main gripes, which is not to say there weren't others but nothing worth mentioning that wouldn't make this too long. All in all I really liked this.

The cinematography reminds one more of a film than a typical tv series but this is nothing new with the likes of GoT changing the landscape of what can be accomplished behind the camera of a television series. With near perfection in casting, I am sorry, I do agree with most here, Gomez was a mistake and seems to be driven by the choice in the cartoon films. But this is all forgotten with the mesmerizing role that Jenna Ortega performs. You would be forgiven and understood if you were planning on passing off as the latest Netflix dribble, but Wednesday breaks the mold of the last few years of release (of course we have Squid Games and a few other outliers, but for the most part Netflix has a negative net rating on quality of releases) and really delivers a strong story with enjoyable aspects for all different viewer groups. I am a 35 y/o male who typically watches independent films, thrillers or sports and I found this to so enjoyable we watched it twice over the long Thanksgiving Weekend off of work. I would truly recommend this to any and all. While understanding not everyone will love \"Wednesday\", I believe we have a new hit on our hand and can only hope future seasons take us on a deep dive into all things that this season created for us to love.",

The plot is very intriguing and you just want to watch more and see what will happen next. It is always a plot twist and it is fun because the watcher can have suspicions. But it is always the person who you suspect the least.The only thing that drags this movie down is the quirky comments. And it feels a little Disney channels vibes with the script sometimes.

            "content": "I was a bit skeptical about the choice of actors after watching the trailer, but the casting turned out to be the least of my concerns. All of the actors were quite good, though Wednesday's messy hairstyle and Morticia's somewhat revealing dress were a bit distracting.The feel of the series was all wrong though, I kept getting a \"Twilight\" vibe with a flavor of \"Nancy Drew\" - weird girl investigating mysteries in a school surrounded by vampires and werewolves. Wednesday's character is all over of place, she is a typical teenager and anything but an Addams.Actually, the only moment in the entire series which reminded of the original Addams movies/series was a scene from the trailer where Wednesday's released pira\u00f1as into the swimming pool. The Addams comedies were so much darker, I've rewatched \"The family values\" after watching the series and in that movie alone the Addamses casually murdered a couple of people and injured a bunch.. in the nowadays PG-13 streaming world it is a bit too much, even for Tim Burton. What a pity..The plot itself is rather predictable. It was kind of obvious that they wouldn't just cast Christina Ricci as a botany teacher, so she had to be \"the bad guy\". A handsome barista with big puppy eyes was also a bit \"in your face\".Anyhow, as a supernatural teenage drama this is watchable, but it could have been so much more. Didn't feel like an Addams movie.. or Tim Burton's.",

            "content": "My review after 4 episodes: Unfortunately Wednesday suffers from poor writing. For example, when they organize the 'boat race', Wednesday has turned their boat into a James Bond vehicle with levers that extend knifes and release a net, and this all overnight. That is impossible even for a girl like Wednesday to build in such short notice (let alone the fact the boat would sink based on what is shown). It bothers me because the writers just make up stuff whatever works for that particular scene instead of working within certain parameters. Also, how does Wednesday know when to release the net? She cannot see where the fish guy is. Another example is another team releasing some sort of an axe that almost beheads an entire team. How is that acceptable behavior for any school, considering the fact they are way more strict in other areas? Why didn't the writers use a less lethal object to make it fit more with the overall setting?Yet another example is the statue that listens to 'two finger-snaps'. Does the statue have a sensor that listens to audio? Wouldn't it spontaneously open whenever someone makes sounds that are similar (false positives)? That stuff does matter because the filmmakers don't show if it's mechanical, magical or anything else. It's lazy, very lazy writing.Lastly this school just ends up feeling like a subsidiary company of Hogwarts but then with special kids instead of magic wands. We've seen this all before. It's not original.Wednesday starts to bore me. Her lack of expression (but caring 'deep down') becomes a part trick and I don't end up caring for her mission. I'm just a bystander and not fully immersed. I don't care about any of the characters, their desires, struggles and goals. It's two-dimensional.Shame because the art direction is really good.",

            "content": "I have seen 1.7 episodes of Wednesday at this point. It took me about one week, in three sittings, to watch the first one, and I fell asleep before the second one could end. I don't think I'll torture myself any further.I dislike this show on more than one level.Reason 1: I don't like teen drama, and this is bad teen drama. It's like the kids in Twilight went on a school trip to Hogwarts and brought their useless heart-throbs and jealousies with them. From the 10th minute of the first episode we get to know that the kids are not just humans and they belong to species that could rule the world but no... they go to school just for the sake of being a pain in each-other's back. Wednesday goes through all this wearing the same exact face for the whole time (again, like Bella in Twilight) and every once in a while she drops an aphorism that has already been a meme on the Internet for the past 10 years.Reason 2: This is not Wednesday Addams. I am a fan of the original series in black and white and I was already disappointed when Thing was made to walk around in the movies. The addams were always an eccentric family but they were depicted as humans. In this new show Vampires, Werewolves, Mermaids, Magic, etc... are dropped in the story cauldron on day one, removing any relatability between the characters and the audience. Even Wednesday has some magic power of sorts. Her moral compass keeps swinging. She is proud to be some sort of careless queen of death but then she tries to save someone for no specific reason. The characterisation is terrible and even the acting is not particualrly convincing. We are light-years away even from Christina Ricci's Wednesday.Reason 3: It's boring. The Addams Family was a fast witted show. Every second there would be a new thing to laugh for, something that would hilight the difference between the boring regular people (us) and the mentally free and self-indulgent Addams family. This new show is slow. Nothing happens. Apart from a few unremarkable jokes every now and then, there is no direct contrast between normal people and anyone living at the school. There is no fun in following \"detective Wednesday\" venturing around the Victorian rooms of this American Hogwarts.Reason 4: I am not American. While the original Addams family was just funny to watch regardless of one's background, this one is set in a rich American boarding school in which, obviously, most people in the world have never been. Secret societies, rowing competitions, houses... is stuff that is alien to most people, including me.Reason 5: There is no moral complexity here. Wednesday is immediately depicted as a rebellious teenager who wants to move away from her parents as much as possible. She is made to look like an outcast, but she is thrown in a school for outcasts where she is not an outcast anymore. Needless to say, the moment she meets a normal guy he's happy to help.Bottom line: are you a teenager and you want a modern version of Harry Potter set in a rich Americans' boarding school? You might like this show.If you ever in your life liked the Addams family, then avoid Wednesday.",

            "content": "The fact that Tim Burton was not the director of the two films from the 90s' is quite surprising. I'm amazed it took this long for him to do any sort of adaptation to the Addams Family.The premise is very simple. Wednesday is sent to an outcast school, Nevermore, and attempts to solve a series of murders by a monster within the school.For those looking for a project that reflects some of Burton's early work, this is it and it is the perfect style for this type of show. I love the set designs and the cinematography is tremendous for a show like this.This is a show that is really driven by its cast. Jenna Ortega is wonderful as Wednesday, giving a very hilarious deadpan performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a surprisingly perfect Morticia. Luis Guzman is an odd yet humorous choice for Gomez. However, my favorite performance, outside of Ortega's, is Gwendoline Christie as the Principal Larissa. She so delightfully creepy, that she fits this show like a glove.There are only a couple of minor problems with the show thus far. For one, some of the shows scenes with the teenage characters can come off as rather formulaic. Also, one of the highlights of the original source material and the two films from the 90s' was that the rest of the world contrasted the Addams family completely. The real world in this show is very much Tim Burtons version of it, which sometimes doesn't differentiate itself enough from them.So overall, a great show that really brings Tim Burton back to his roots as a filmmaker.

She's written like a protagonist from a self insert wattpad fanfic written by a 13 year old girl.The other characters aren't exactly riveting either, they're pretty bland and generic and fit into personality archetypesThere are very cringe references to pop culture along the lines of \"You should post on instagram, snapchat and tiktok!!\" that kinda just seem to scream \"these kids are hip and topical\" but only serves to make me cringe.The special effects and CGI are noticeably not great x everything looks especially fake and like it doesn't belong but I understand it has a budget of a netflix original and not an MCU movie, but i've seen originals with better CGI such as Umbrella Academy.Overall it feels like this show was made to market to preteen-teenage girls and is not especially riveting or engaging.",

Catherine Zeta-Jones, I think she is phoning it in.The few moments that it feels like Wednesday Addams show are great. The one or two times that it happens. This is not a good Addams family show.

Either skip the classic \"fight the bullies\" scene, or let her defeat them with some clever plan or something, and not physical strength.Or even better, let Tyler fight the bullies to defend wednesday, but then get knocked out. That would be more heroic/realistic.Tyler could even have a short frenzy where he bites/scratches the bullies as a foreshadowing of him being the monster.I think it is a new trend where a lot of the male characters are portrayed as weak and whiney.",

Together with the more than outstanding sets, the viewer really gets something beautiful for the eyes.I've often read that many found the story a bit too long, but I don't find that at all. I liked seeing the characters in subplots away from the main story.The season closes with a very good season finale.My only criticism is that I didn't like the design of the monster.Unfortunately, for me personally, that seems a bit too artificial and far from reality, which tragically takes away the seriousness of the actually frightening scenes.",

This series has a spooky modern gothic feel and it's a spinoff of family teen daughter Wednesday Addams(in a super killer turn from Jenna Ortega). The story set in Vermont has Wednesday going off at the age of 16 to attend school and that's \"Nevermore Academy\" which has plenty of spooks and crazy secrets which are connected to the days in which Wednesday's parents attended school there. Wednesday despite feeling out of place makes friends, even when things are not normal as a supernatural murder mystery hangs in the clouds. Along the way nothing or no one is whom they seem it's an expanding murder mystery. Look for actress veteran Christina Ricci(in a wickedly secretive role). In a fun and wild subplot Wednesday deals with her feelings and psychic powers the best she can while trying to solve the ghoulish like murders while learning in high school and fitting in! The series is an entertaining winner that's blended with suspense and well written modern humor! \"Wednesday\" was one well done enjoyable series that I liked watching.",

It always just feels like it's hurting the original creation.So this show wasn't bad per say but I don't feel like it does right to the Addams Family and I can't quite understand why Tim Burton would have done this.(also, Wednesday Addams almost falling in love with a nice guy doesn't make any sense really)",

The new characters were so well suited. I love Enid. She could carry a spin off on her own. I loved Ms Weems. She was absolutely beautiful and she played her part so well that I hated her until the end and then I loved her.The only thing that I didn't understand and I think was a continuity error was Goody Adams.

Apersons whos parents don't accept them and want \"conversion therapy\". Many cases of stuff like this that you will notice if you looked deeper. And of course the push for race/religion/gender stuff as always. Sometimes its hard to notice, other times its very visible like when out of no where you briefly meet a teens \"moms\". You meet them for a few seconds, but never hear from them again.At least if your going to make statements, add them into the story and not just quick snippets. Because it looks like you try to hard to get people to think your diverse. People like diverse when you actually don't shove it in ones face in a brief scene so you can say \"See, we are diverse!\"So onto the rest of the series....I love this darker version of Wednesday and the Addams family. The actress plays the role perfectly. I was actually surprised how bland Zeta felt playing Morticia. Gomez's actor was great in the role. So was Pugsley and Lurch. Even Thing was great. I love they gave him a more creepy look with scars and a sown up nub where the arm used to be.Without spoiling anything I will just say the theme of the show is solving a mystery. And a good one at that as it has you questioning everyone and then revealing \"Wow, I was wrong!\" Along side the mystery is of course the story of a school for ....more super natural gifted students.Now as for who may like this series? If you want cute family with light \"darkness\" like the old movies and show, this isn't for you. However if you want a more darker and stranger version, this is for you. The show does feature blood and guts, nothing extreme mind you. But enough that you probably don't want your young kids seeing it. And it deals with some more adult stuff.This isn't to say it doesn't have its funny moments of course. The comedy is still there, just a bit darker then normal. And Wednesday alone often makes you laugh because she is much darker, brooding and cold then normal.Lastly I will say for those who gave it a 1 or 10, these are the reviews to ignore. They always complain about the show got the opposite number. 10s don't exist in reviews. And 1s are very rare. 1 would mean the shoe was literally unwatchable. Poorly filmed, terrible acting, no story, bad editing....etc..And many of the negative reviews often mention Wednesday being to dark and way to cold to her mother. Well yes, she is darker.

The acting is pretty strong for the most part, if a bit simplistic and cartoonish as well but that's the style they were going for as far as I can tell.After reading some of the more critical reviews, I can definitely understand why people who are more familiar with the source material are disappointed. I didn't personally watch the original show much so it doesn't bother me that this new show is so different, but when I read the more critical reviews describing the older show, it sounds like a way better concept.All and all, a well-made show that aims a bit too low in terms of target audience age for me.

Boredom... ringing boredom... No atmosphere, no worthwhile dialogues, no charismatic actors. Who riveted it? Did he even watch the original? The first episode, Mortisha's farewell to her daughter: Mortisha burst into tears from the fact that Wednesday talks to her unkindly. Seriously? Why turn a unique character of an infernal mother into an average American mom from movies?And Wednesday? Performed by Christina Ricci, she has become a legend! We still remember this amazing character. A psychopathic girl with a rod that you're really afraid of. What's going on here? Just a nerdy little girl in black clothes with a scowl.Judging by the general facelessness of the plot (and everything in general) and the similarity with hundreds of current youth series, it seems that Burton was rigidly placed within the framework of the modern agenda and he simply does not know how to fit into all this, so in trying to pass for his own, he makes a terribly clumsy 'G'.God, Timmy, how is this possible with your experience and spontaneity?

Honestly not surprised I later found the writers also worked on Smallville, and the level of quasi teen/high school-ish drama is sort of understandable once I learned that.

I couldn't make it past the first episode, but don't let that discourage you.

I was REALLY looking forward to this as I LOVE all the Adam's family movies.... but I'm on Episode 4 and I am STRUGGLING to keep watching. It's a bit soapy for my tastes. There is very little comedy or anything worth a chuckle. The movie's were full of that. The higher production quality is keeping it above a CW series but just BARELY. And that makes me sad. I don't really understand how this has an 8.5 currently.... 3/10 is the best I can do and that is very generous. The essence of every character in this has been changed in including Wednesday. And what did they do to Puggsly? He is a cry baby wimp now. The more I reflect on what I have seen... the more I dislike it. I was going to finish watching it. But I think I am done with it. The only character true to the essence is.... Thing. And they even made him weird looking like a Frankenstein hand.",

I believe if you are into spooky things this can be an enjoyable watch, but given, that I don't consider myself as a big fan of this genre the series didn't make too big of an impression on me. I also believe that the main target audience for this series are early teenagers as the setting of the series is very stereotypically that of an teenage series.Another thing I would like to point out, that bothered me was, that the plot twist was very obvious, as you could very early figure out, who is the odd person, that could be behind all of this. And the last thing is that the way some situations played out was very unbelievable as the possibilities of them turning out like that should have been ridiculously low.But if all of these things don't bother you I believe this series would be a very interesting and fun watch for you.",

You can really tell it is washed down, to the point it is terrible.The setting of the series feels like a complete rip off of the Harry Potter story...\nA school for unique kids (vampires/werewolves) instead of wizards.4 school societies, just like harry potter.A championship between the societies, just like the quidditch game where people tried to sabotage other teams.Pugsly is portrayed as a wimp instead of the confident prankster.The casting seems poor too, gomez and tich had no proper romance between them, it seems very cheesy. They are also normal parents, ashamed of their kids bad behaviour instead of proud of it.Also, why they made Luis look so weird I don't understand.Wednesday, a sadist and social recluse starts making friends and has romantic feelings towards someone...

However, Jenna's Wednesday glare definitely beats Christina's Wednesday glare.The setting was great too, perfectly captured what you would expect in the Addam's Family universe and how you would expect Wednesday to behave when she is with other girls her age.

As other have mentioned, another angsty teenage sci-fi drama... I don't mind if they have a show centered around one character, but we're heavily missing the connection between the rest of the family. All of the characters are different. Good job on appearance, but the personalities don't match. Gomez seems a bit quiet and reserved when he's normally a showman. Morticia appeared to be too positive and hurt by Wednesdays pessimism and distance from her. Pugsly was just a little wimp that relied on his sister's affection. I love Fred Armisen but his Uncle Fester was horrible. Wednesday's (Jenna Ortega) performance was better than I thought it would be from first glance but still nowhere as stoic as it should be, but much more harsh and cynical to the point that shes an outcast in a school filled with outcasts and everyone she 'befriends', ends up hating her for the same reason they liked her, but have no problem with her by the end of the series. They still have some of their odd quirks but no one really seems fazed by them, or they quickly accept them as almost normal. The plot was quite predictable and the same thing you've seen time and again; new student shows up, mysterious things start to happen, dangerous monster, constant misdirect showing who you should think is the culprit when it's painfully obvious who it is (and isn't). Some of the deaths were unnecessary and quick to the point and the last episode seemed kind of rushed, could have used a couple more episodes to flesh out the resurrected Pilgrim ancestor, his random magical powers, and plot to kill outcasts, despite sort of being an 'outcast' now (undead and magical). The main baddie got a simple K. O. in the end, with no explanation what happened to them afterwards. The final scene obviously leaves off on a cliff hanger, opening it up to another season, after we see the 'monster' reappear. If you want to keep the same spirit of the first season, that's fine, but at least make new mysteries, dangers, monsters, and villains, don't rely on reoccurring characters.Overall, it was good for a laugh, some of the jokes were funny and on par with the Addams family, some of the characters were well done, I loved the interactions between Wednesday and her roomie. The camera work and symmetry as well as the wardrobe/makeup/set design, were all great. Other then that, it kind of fell flat, was kind of slow, boring, and as mentioned before, somewhat predictable. As a stand alone show, it's alright; as a continuation of the Addams Family Legacy, it was quite a poor representation, as it was more of a reimagining of the world The Addams Family lives in.

Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester is the only comedic character. If I had any complaints is that the show had too many plot twists that got confusing after awhile.

            "content": "'Wednesday' Spoiler Movie ReviewLife is too short and no one ain't got time to sit down to read a long-drawn-out one!The main characters in the movie are Wednesday, Enid, Tyler, Xavier Thorpe, and Bianca Barclay.Giving a brief summary of the plot is smart, sarcastic and a little dead inside, Wednesday Addams investigates a murder spree while making new friends - and foes - at Nevermore Academy.The possible theme for this story is different from the 'Adam's Family,' while it dabbles more in the darkside on mysteries, monsters, and mayhem of a symbolized secret society's study of alchemy and the occult through outcast - from the perspective of a Gothic writer. Whereas; the 1964 TV series 'The Addams Family' was more of one of the funnier and more enjoyable series of the period about a ghoulish family that just seems to be totally unaware of their strangeness, that showed how a family can be lovable in their differences. For example, the cousin Itt loves to drop by for a visit and has a body that is entirely covered in hair; he speaks in gibberish that only the family can understand and is arguably the least creepy of the family, as he just minds his own business, even when he's staying at the Addams residence. The Grandmama Is Not Like Other Grandmas who is known for her wild outbursts, primarily while spending time with Wednesday and Pugsley; she can come off as brutish and rude, but deep down she does love her family like everyone else. Lurch Is A Loyal Butler who has nothing more to say than some incoherent grunts, but he is undoubtedly one of the most interesting characters to come from the Addams family as he serves the Addams family. Pugsley Addams Is A Devious Child, wh0 is a little boy who likes to play pranks with his sister that usuallly disrupt the lives of others. However, he has a soft side for his sister and shows he cares about her. Thing Has Evolved Over The Years as a disembodied hand that crawls around and helps the family with their antics; he doesn't speak, but like every other Addams member, everyone understands Thing anyway and he appears as a watchful guardian. Wednesday Is The Darkest Addams who is known for her blank stares and pigtails, being obsessed with death and solitude; as she is quite intelligent and shows she has a heart through her detective work. Morticia Addams Has A Presence In Every Room and Despite her coming from a long line of witched, she's madly in love with her husband while she can be very alluring, even if she doesn't always get along with her children. When all else fails, Morticia keeps things running as smoothly as they possibly can for a family like theirs. Gomez Addams Is The Head Of The Family who is eccentric and romantic, albeit in his own dark and twisted ways; he takes part in all the dark activities his family enjoys, although he is much more whimsical than most and mostly concerned with living life to the fullest, in his own ways. Lastly, everyone Loves Uncle Fester who is big, bald, and always wearing a fur coat. He's the most whimsical member of the family, known for his distinct voice and laugh. He enjoys many odd things, such as sticking his head in a screw press for pleasure. Above all, he's the most caring and loving member of the whole family.The moral for this story is about Family diversity, in the contemporary context, refers to all the different forms of families and family life that exist in society and to the characteristics that differentiate them from one another. Each person in a family has the same traits. There are no differences in traits between parents and offspring or among siblings. Strangely, life itself has proven that there is no such thing as a \"perfect family,\" but the love that they have for one another makes a perfect family, not who they are or what they can do.The audience who would like this movie are viewers over the age of 14, because it may not be suitable for anyone under that age; due to fear, language, and violence.In my opinion of the movie,\nThe introduction was complex and captured my attention right from the beginning, but dragged on thereafter so I lost interest in the other episodes in general. The actors were talented, natural, experienced, professional, and very skillful in their preformances. The dialogue was though provokingly deep and cleverly written. The characters were lovable, but overall memorable for me. I would have appreciated it a lot more if it wasn't so cringeworthy depressing, that could have been more feel-good and meaningful.Overall, I would not recommend the movie because it wasn't as interesting or exciting as I thought it would be like the 1964 'The Addams Family' TV series.",

In the first episode, Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) plots her escape from her Gothic confines, but all that is soon dropped (along with her therapy sessions) once Thing arrives to help our heroine adjust to her new surroundings, which includes a secret sect of teenagers--\"Outcasts\" who have tapped and untapped supernatural powers--and unraveling the mystery of father Gomez's criminal past. There's also a monster tearing apart travelers in the nearby woods (one that leaves behind human footprints) and artwork from a mysterious book which appears to depict Wednesday herself in a fiery confrontation with a tall pilgrim. I hoped to detect some of Burton's sly humor in evidence here, but this series is needlessly overrun by boring teenage bullies (including in a flashback!) and a lachrymose sheriff (Jamie McShane) who keeps popping up like a bad penny but who never really accomplishes anything useful. Like most of the characters in \"Wednesday\", the sheriff is a plot function: he's there to move scenes along rather than to take a part in the action. Ortega is certainly well-cast (as is Christina Ricci, the '90s version of Wednesday, as a teacher at the school), but she has to carry this weighty thing a long way. The finale, a showdown between Wednesday and two villains plus another fight between CGI monsters (one of them Wednesday's ditzy roommate, who suddenly finds her true self as a werewolf) is pure hogwash, one in which Wednesday is unceremoniously dragged into the 21st century by getting her own iPhone!",

Lots of expectations when Tim Burton put his Name on this Series, but kudos to him and his Creative Team for delivering the Goods big time.It just so good on so many levels, first is that it is not only about the Dark Humor and quick, witty Dialogue, there is a lot of multi-level Storytelling also involved, giving most of the Characters a lot of depth.A lot of talk about how Jenna Ortega was absolutely perfect for the Role, but for me it just wasn't her, most of the other Actors and Actresses also did very well, helping contribute to just how good this Show is.Take Catherine Zeta Jones, for example. I wasn't sure if she was going to be a good Morticia Addams since Anjelica Huston in the Role was a pretty hard act to follow, but she delivered wonderfully, proving that she could indeed still be good in a Comedy Role.You know this Series will be full of dark, quick wit, but it still catches you wonderfully off guard at various moments every time it comes, like when Wednesday told Gomez she knew he didn't have it in him to be a Convicted Killer, then Gomez says he forgives her even if what she said \"stings\".The Soundtrack is also pretty good, something that is certainly noticeable, they were turning Classic Songs from the 1970s onwards into an Instrumental played by an Orchestra.SPOILER ALERT (Don't read this if you don't want Spoilers), I'm glad the previous Wednesday didn't just go into the Series in a Cameo Role but was in fact quite a Pivotal Character. We may even see more of her in succeeding Seasons.Anyway, this THE Must-Watch Series on Netflix right now, and looking at all the buzz it is generating it seems a lot of other People agree with it, too.",

I personally prefer there to be Easter eggs pointing to who that is but this leaves it open to be anybody.Regarding Jenna Ortega, I think she did an amazing job. Considering she is 20 and portraying a 16 year old, she brings a lot of experience and skill to the role. At the same time, it also makes you appreciate how well Ricci did in the 1991 movie. She was only 11 and did a remarkable job and still portrayed some innocence.Ortega does a great job showing teenage angst and rebellion against their parents, like so many teens do.

Her acting is marginal at best, and the character wasn't portrayed as being dark enough in my book. This is Wednesday Addams we're talking about and she just came across as a moody teenager.Catherine Zeta Jones absolutely failed as Mortocia. Angelica Huston set the bar on what Morticia should be, and that standard was not met.Fred Armisten was incredibly annoying as Uncle Fester. He had the look down, but everything after that was an abject failure.Again, this show had potential but needs to be darker than it is.

So we get mermaids and werewolves? What? This literally makes Wednesday lose what was special about her, because she's actually the most ordinary one in the bunch. She's just a goth girl with mediocre teenage angst and the rest is every high-school show you've ever seen.Remember her going to camp? That was classic. This is what I was expecting. What I got was just a teenager going to school Scooby-Doo mystery with none of the ingredients that made this family magical.I'm not even going to get into the casting of the parents, each a disgrace to their former counterpart's brilliant and charismatic performance. They could have just put a black dress on a tree and call it a day. Below zero chemistry.Then you have this horrible relationship between Wednesday and literally everyone. They used to have such amazing family dynamics. It was the perfect contrast to their absolute horridness that we all loved.Where's the dark comedy?

I'm going to say right away that the character they've picked is really fantastic to make a spin-off about. Jenna Ortega plays really, really well and it's that I don't like horror that much, otherwise I would really like to see more of her in similar roles. At first the series reminded me a bit of Harry Potter and you can also compare it to that. That is where my first point of criticism comes in, and that is that it sometimes looks a bit too much like Harry Potter. Sometimes things have been taken literally and I thought that was a bit of a shame. I don't mean to say that I think the series is stolen, but it could have had a bit more of its own style (especially at the beginning), especially with regard to the school. The characters in the series are really, really nice. What I also really like about those characters is that they all have a little caracter arch. Not a very big one, just big enough in my opinion for a first season. What I also liked was that the Addams family also gets a little more backstory in the series. I will now go straight to my last point of criticism and that is that the series is perhaps a bit too much aimed at children. Yes, it is really very dark at times, but I would have preferred that the dialogue, for example, be a little less aimed at children. What I also want to say is that the soundtrack is really fantastic again. I definitely recommend watching this series. If I had to describe this series in short I would say that it is a nice spin-off with nice side characters but that is a bit too much aimed at children. There are some parts that gave me goosebumps.

            "content": "As Wednesday Addams begins at her new school Nevermore, she finds herself attempting to thwart a series of monstrous killings all while attempting to navigate her new relationships at school.When I heard that Tim Burton would be directing and producing an Addams family spinoff starring the phenomenal Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams I nearly fell out of my chair. It immediately became one of my most anticipated shows of the year and after finishing it did not disappoint.Jenna Ortega has possibly the most potential amongst the younger actors and actresses working today and to see her in what looks like the role she was born to play is truly incredible. Every scene she is in is phenomenal, and her ability to take over a scene with showing basically no emotion and focusing on acting with her eyes and body is phenomenal.Burton is known for his dark, gothic style of directing and it shows in this first season. Every scene involving Wednesday is given a feel unlike the rest. Even if they are in a place such as a coffee shop or a classroom if Wednesday is present Burton adds a gothic style that is perfectly well done.The plot itself is a well written mystery. It keeps you guessing throughout the season as clues are discovered and killings continue. My only real issue with the script is the the writing for some of the side characters. I found that anyone under the age of 18 who is not named Wednesday were not super well done. When the story shifted towards a character for the purpose of a subplot rather than using them within the solving of the mystery I found that I was less interested. That being said if they were used in the context of the mystery I didn't mind their character and thought it worked well. Enid on the other hand is an exception to that, I thought she really worked as a counterpart to Wednesday and I felt her subplot was well handled. It was characters like Bianca, Tyler and Xavier that I felt could have been handled better. The older side characters on the other hand I really enjoyed. Gwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems is amazing, there is one scene in particular where her and Wednesday are in her office and she gets a little agitated and leans towards Wednesday it gave me goosebumps.The final thing I will touch on is the use of the entire Addams family. I won't go into into spoilers so I'll make the blanket statement of I liked the castings and I liked how they were used.Overall Wednesday is everything I wanted it to be, a great showcase of Tim Burtons style using a childhood classic piece of fiction all while Jenna Ortega gives what may be her best performance to date in a well written murder mystery.8.5/10\nA-",

I takes the sting out of the essence of being an Addams.I can't recognise any of Tim Burtons usual flavour either.

An Addams Family series -- directed by Tim Burton, no less -- that gets released well after Halloween?I understand perfectly if the show wasn't completed yet (Lord knows I've roasted a fair number of straight-to-streaming shows for seeming to have been released on a strict schedule rather than \"whenever it's ready\"), or if the creators wanted the image of a pilgrim statue set ablaze to better coincide with Thanksgiving. Still, releasing something like this in November just feels wrong.Wednesday is often enjoyable, albeit not as distinctly creepy and kooky as it could've been; many of the actors sans Jenna Ortega are unremarkable and it doesn't help that the show often feels more like The Umbrella Academy or some CW superhero show than The Addams Family. Could Burton not decide between an Addams adaptation and a Miss Peregrine spin-off so he did both?I've also seen some complaints re: Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Gomez from \"long-time fans\", claiming that he's completely wrong for what the role is supposed to be. I already pointed this out in my review of 2019's Addams Family reboot, but if you Gomez Addams fans out there are perturbed that he \"isn't tall or handsome anymore\", then you're not actually fans of Gomez Addams, but rather the Raul Julia-John Astin variation that is decidedly less faithful to the Charles Addams comics than this is.That's a good Gomez too, but if you're gonna come at this new show with puritan pretenses, I just want you to keep straight what the \"original\" is.",

            "review_title": "Has potential, but is not faithful to Charles Addams",
            "content": "I watched the entire first season before offering a review. While it has it's pros and cons, \"Wednesday\" is a far cry from what creator Charles Addams had in mind.On the pro side, much of the casting was well thought, including Ortega (who I was initially skeptical of). Yes, she's a few years older than her character, but that's pretty common in film and television. Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia were great additions (Fred needs to be in more episodes in season 2). Other stand-outs were Gwendolyn Christie, Riki Lindhome, and \"second Wednesday\" herself Christina Ricci. But props to Emma Myers (as roommate and budding werewolf Enid) who was a bright spot in a generally dreary environment.On the con side, I'm sorry but prolific character actor Luis Guzman was miscast as Gomez. Guzman has the physical shape of Charles Addams concept for Gomez (not tall like Raul Julia or John Astin), but he simply is not dashing or effusive and his dialog is often hard to understand. And the Pugsley and Lurch roles were practically non-existent.Also on the con side is making \"Wednesday\" a YA-focused show. As such, it was filled with forgettable second-tier characters with little tension or backstories. And the two potential suitors for Wednesday were interchangeable with other \"teen\" actors and were immiedtaly forgettable.A big question is why Tim Burton decided to create a whole world of \"outsiders\" around the Addamses. The genius of the original TV show and 1990's films was how the Addams family, while outwardly odd, seemed more loving and normal than the so-called \"normal\" characters - that was the point. Giving each member of the Addams clan \"powers\" (except Gomez and Pugsley, as far as we know) defeats the whole purpose of Charles Addams creations. Burton compounds the problem of putting them in a world of werewolves (\"furs\"), vampires (\"fangs\"), sirens, Gorgons (medusas), hydes (no jekylls?), shape-shifters, and faceless students who don't say anything. Most of these add little to the show (there are some notable exceptions that will not be described since those could be spoilers) and are just so much background noise.Another slightly annoying feature is the one \"normal\" American-looking street in Jericho - clearly a limited set piece since the show was filmed in Romania. This pretty much limited location shots that were supposed to be off-campus.There were fun call-backs to the original TV show and films, such as the double-snap to gain access to the secret society lair. There was also a quick-and-you'll-miss-it reference to an \"Addams family reunion\". A brief portrait of a relative of Cousin Itt (yes with two t's) was shown, but they somehow also gave him a first name, making Itt his last name. That's incorrect. But other references, such as to Grandma Addams, or even Pubert (from the second film) are not to be found.There was one fun trivia fact: the coffee shop called the Weathervane, is named after the student newspaper in Westfield (NJ) High School where Charles Addams was the graphic design director of the Weathervane while a student at Westfield HS. As someone who was born in Westfield, the \"shadow\" and legacy of Charles Addams looms large across the town and Westfielders will appreciate the shout-out.For season 2, it will be hard to undo some of the negatives experienced in season 1. It would be more appropriate to have Wednesday and her friends interacting with more of the \"normies\" outside Jericho. Now that it has been a Netflix hit, maybe there will be a budget to shoot season 2 somewhere in the US instead of Romania.Overall: 7 out of 10 with room for improvement.",

I hope there's a season 2 with a bit more darkness and bite.It's funny that the show seems to borrow from legally blond, a girl out of place in a new school, smart but in unfamiliar surroundings. It borrows from a few high-school tropes, which sounds kind of cheesy, but Jenna and Tim Burton make it work.I still think the show is missing something.

I watched the whole series in three days and I really hope that Netflix will make a second season.Some cringy points in the story where the acting or story falters, but on the whole it's a solid tv show.Some political points are made, but the overarching story has no political agenda.Definitely don't let your kids watch this. It's rather violent and the monster in the show is like a demon from hell and he will most definitely give your kids nightmares. Swearing is also present in the show. Another reason why your kids shouldn't watch the show is because they won't understand the teen drama and the story. Adults probably wouldn't like the show for that reason, but as a teen I loved it.Characters, especially Wednesday, are most definitely not role models. Many characters seem to struggle from mental illness. Wednesday acts cold and unfeeling. She's not entirely devoid of feeling, and she does care for at least some of the characters, but generally she's willing to endanger others to get what she wants. She definitely shows some sociopathic tendencies.Overall 9/10 definitely worth the watch!!!",

Where there was previously a loving family that couldn't find a place in \"acceptable society\" because they went against social norms, here we have an unoriginal story about an angsty teen that doesn't like their parents.

No Itt or Grandmama yet, but most at least had an appearance.The only real gripe I have is the casting of Gomez. Gomez is supposed to be a sword fighting, lion wrestling, non-stop energy force of nature, and they cast a morbidly obese actor for the role. He's a fine actor but just all wrong for Gomez Addams. He's only in a couple scenes in a couple episodes, so it doesn't really matter, but that was a huge miss. Pugsley and Morticia were perfect though, and Fester was fine.Other than that, it's fantastic... I hope they pull an Emily in Paris and just announce a multiple season extension on this gem while the actors are still the right age... 3 more seasons would be amazing. Highly recommend!!",

Wednesday hates her family and treats her friends like trash. Unfortunately it's not done in a charming way. I feel like they went too far with making Wednesday cold and they took away her substance. This is a huge flaw because you have to be able to like the character and care about them. I think that the show could improve if they realize this and make Wednesday more tolerable. No one can play Wednesday like Christina Ricci, however the actress did a good job. The problem lies within the writing, I actually hope for a season 2, but I hope they improve the actual problems because this could be a good show. Maybe give Wednesday a soul and make her a bit more charming. The Adams were always good people who enjoyed being different and I embrace that.

HOWEVER, Jenna Ortega does an AMAZING job capturing the essence of Wednesday in her own unique way. Similar to the Joker, I love seeing different actors give their unique interpretations to iconic characters. Jenna definitely gave the next generation something to look forward to.For the overall show, I love that it gives over this Hogwarts vibe, but with its own personality. From the cinematography, to Tim Burton's touch, to the fashion/wardrobe, to most of the actors cast, to the dynamic between Enid & Wednesday, to the giant spider web window (which was my favorite piece), I love how this show captures dark humor. There were several moments that I literally laughed out loud. The cherry on top was casting Christina Ricci to be a part of this!!My only problem with this show was the casting of Morticia & Gomez. It was a complete miss for me. It was almost a distraction at times from the flow of the show. Angelica Huston & Raul Julia were the perfect balance to me and their portrayals were so iconic. Maybe that is why their choices were a miss. I know the show is about Wednesday, but the whole family is like a puzzle that just fits, so when a piece is missing, it feels off.Surprisingly, I felt that Fred Armisen's take on Uncle Fester worked in this series. I believe it works because it balances Wednesday's mood/vibe. Her energy is heavier, whereas, he gives off this lighter touch. Sort of the way Enid does.Overall, I also loved the message that Wednesday gives about life as a series. She doesn't dumb herself down to get boys to like her. She doesn't try to be likable to get friends. She doesn't follow trends, like social media, to try and fit in. She owns who she is and doesn't apologize or try to be fake to win people over. You either take her or leave her. I think the message about authenticity, no matter how weird it may appear to be to the world, is very important. Let's see what season 2 will have to offer! :-)",

The story is very great all the cast was amazing on point the flow of the story is good the way there is type of people and the they have a different school for them. And she has roommate which is there for the they fight but when they need they are their for each other. Love the ending Wednesday didn't express it but became friend with everyone in the end Its a great series waiting for the next part. But again love the way Wednesday character is cold from outside she even didn't like her family but when her family need her she is there for it but warm inside she care for her friends and family.Love the series : )",

Not every adult will be interested in Wednesday, but you can watch it with your family. The series primarily attracts its attention by being directed and sprodussed by Tim Burton. Its influence on the series is felt everywhere and this Wednesday compares favorably with most modern youth series. I would like to compare Wednesday with Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and The Umbrella Academy. But these two series have long been rotten. And I really want to believe that Wednesday will not give up also for the second season. Of course, Wednesday compares favorably with other series primarily because there are not so many and there were good series in 2022, well, unless 1899 comes to mind. The conclusion of the first season in the best traditions of Netflix is abrupt and clumsy. But for the first season it's not bad in general, I'm waiting for season 2.",

Maybe it's Tim Burton's deft touch, but this show has it in spades right down to the smallest details. The cast, score, writing and production are all top notch.

Here's the deal about the 'Family' (and I get that the show needs Wednesday to be strongest but).... Anjelica Huston Was legit the BEST morticia since the original on tv. But Catherine doesn't have that morticia Adam's feel. Luiz Guzman doesn't feel like Gomez. I'm just not feeling him and the kid playing Pugsley def isn't a fit. The other actors and actresses in the series are GREAT. Like legit everyone. In addition to Jenna- The actress from Game of Thrones who plays the head of the school is SO good. Her name escapes me at the moment but she's great. The two boys that like Wednesday and her have a really interesting and strong chemistry too. The actress playing her school dorm mate is really good too. Christina Ricci is great too but oddly looks like an older wednesday lol.

From the off-kilter characters to the intricate plotlines and stunning visuals, this show exceeded my expectations. The story follows Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) as she is sent to the peculiar boarding school of Nevermore Academy. Here, she must not only learn how to control her innate psychic powers but also unravel a supernatural enigma that has haunted her family for over two decades.The show does an excellent job of balancing horror and suspense with humour and fun moments. As Wednesday navigates the strange world of Nevermore Academy, she forms unlikely friendships, solves supernatural cases, and gets closer to uncovering the truth about her family's past. Wednesday is a great show that has something for everyone. It's mysterious and spooky, but also witty and entertaining. The visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack is amazing. And Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday Addams is mesmerising - and holds the entire show together.I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for an original supernatural show with a unique twist.ONE FINAL NOTE: Given the benign nature of the original Addams Family TV series back in the '60s or the recent movies, parents may automatically pop their kids in front of WEDNESDAY assuming it is a kid's show. But WEDNESDAY is most certainly not a kid's show. Here in Australia, it is rated M (recommended for ages 15+). I'd personally suggest ages 12+. I encourage parents to give the series a look first before showing it to the kids so they can make an informed decision.",

            "content": "'Wednesday' is a supernatural teen drama/comedy from Netflix starring Jenna Ortega that debuted on the streaming service in November 2022. Tim Burton serves as executive producer while also directing four of the eight episodes. Along with Ortega the series features Gwendoline Christie with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman making appearances as Wednesday's parents. Christina Ricci shows up as well in a nod to the girl who was made famous playing Wednesday Addams in the 1990's Addams family films. Within a matter of weeks Wednesday became one of the most streamed shows ever on the Netflix platform and a second season is forthcoming.Wednesday Addams is a hyper intelligent although incredibly dour young lady in keeping with the classic macabre Addams family schtick. When she is kicked out of yet another school for putting piranha into the pool she is sent off to Nevermore Academy where her parents went. It is a school for so called outcasts; people who are not exactly human such as vampires, werewolves, gorgons and the like. The local populace referenced as \"normies\" are aware of the school and its odd student body and treat them like the outcasts they are. Wednesday gets saddled with a roommate who is the antithesis of her in that she is bright, spunky and colorful. Despite being a misanthropic humbug Wednesday manages to collect a few loyal friends as well as potential suitors while also cataloging an impressive list of enemies including the school's principal and the local sheriff. When it is revealed that there is a monster afoot killing people, and a psychic connection exists between Wednesday and one of her ancestors she goes into junior sleuth mode hunting for the culprit while also attempting to save the school from a fiery foretold fate. Along with the mystery and her burgeoning psychic abilities she navigates a typical dog eat dog school hierarchy while also delving into her families fraught background. There are some twists and turns before a somewhat predictably climactic and confrontational endgame plays out.'Wednesday' excels at balancing its wannabe brooding, dark tone within a surprisingly family friendly framework. It is a tough balancing act, but this series walks that fine line well. It probably helps that this is just the sort of subject matter that Tim Burton excels at. Jenna Ortega takes a star turn as Wednesday, and this role is sure to vault her into the stratosphere of young Hollywood ingenues. Despite the show being set away from the family proper they did a good job of working all the primary family members into the story. The show is almost universally well cast with the sole exception being Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester who just felt odd in the role and not odd in that good Addams family kind of way. This show is extremely well put together. The characters were all engaging, and you even feel invested in the random side characters' subplots. The main mystery narrative is quite interesting and keeps you guessing until the end. Ultimately though the show rises and falls based on Ortega's delivery of Wednesday, and she knocked it out of the park managing to be both off putting and yet utterly endearing all at the same time. I am not an Addams Family aficionado, but this quirky, macabre, yet vibrant show feels right at home in the realm of Addams family movies and television and feels in keeping with their overall ethos for as we all know, Wednesday's child is full of woe.Eric's Grade: A-",

There's not much to the story as the idea seems to be to move from one crisis to the next, complete with all the special effects available.",

The artists did a fantastic job.But for some reason, the writers decided to take and make what monster species characters is and make it an allegory for gender identity or orientation, which doesn't really work. It's one of those things that's so poorly managed, I can't see people on either side of these issues appreciating the way they're presented.The murder mystery and monster hunt is rather interesting. However, the subplot with her parents doesn't make any sense. Neither does what's happened to Gomez, who was incredibly fit in the original. There is a lot of manufactured drama, which also hurts the show. Situations and motivations that seem contrived to create drama and drag the story out. In many cases, the major arcs could have been handled without any of the added drama, and it would have been a better plot.Overall, 5/10. If the writers focused on the story instead of checking boxes or manufacturing drama that isn't there, then it would be a great show.",

            "content": "A reimagination and extension of the Addams Family cartoons, Wednesday brings the titular protagonist (an adolescent in this portrayal) to Nevermore, a school for outcasts. In addition to dealing with her lack of emotions and social graces that renders her isolated in this setting, she also gets embroiled in a dangerous murder mystery, the key to whose solution may lie in her unique psychic abilities and ancestral legacy.Bearing somewhat of a Harry Potter and Sabrina vibe, the deadpan macabre humour and striking goth depictions are impressive. The production quality is excellent, be it in terms of the costumes, the sets and environments, the music, or the effects. Side characters like Enid and Eugene are memorable and Jenna Ortega's acting chops in her lead role are abundantly evident.The show however suffers from some serious flaws, especially in the writing department. The whodunit is derivative and uninspired with much more enjoyment to be gained from watching Wednesday's struggles to fit in at Nevermore over guessing the identity of the monster. The full potential of characters like Principal Weems is never harnessed and the entire Joseph Crackstone saga is extremely underwhelming. The dialogue often feels out of place as if it was intended for teenagers but written by adults who do not understand them. And for all the romantic subplots, the essential chemistry is missing, be that between Wednesday and Xavier or Morticia and Gomez.These criticisms notwithstanding, Wednesday should still prove diverting to lovers of young adult fantasy and supernatural shows. The first season sets a good platform to relate future stories in the same universe and it will be interesting to see how Wednesday will evolve as a character going forward.",

Too bad the plot is built to lead the viewer to conclusions that are later proved wrong, the clues are sometimes subtle, at other times very obvious, but in the end they're all red herrings. This wouldn't be a problem if an attentive viewer could figure out who's done it but the twists come completely out of left field. Actually the viewer can sometimes foresee what happens next by paying attention to the clues and imagining what would be the most stupid and absurd plot twist that makes all clues and plot points completely misleading or useless: \"These scenes completely prove x will happen, but y would make for more drama and is completely unexpected so that's how the it's gonna go\".The legal system doesn't make any sense. Caught grave robbing? Trespassing? Kidnapping and torturing? Get out scot free by the power of being the main character.On the point of the main character, I get what they try to give her a somber and morbid personality but after a bit it comes out just as an insufferable edgy teenager that always says the most unpleasant things that comes to mind just for the sake of being unpleasant. I wanted her to be smart, methodic, pragmatic, but no, she sure is smart but get only other character trait is being unpleasant.Why are people trying to help out befriend her? She only lies and mistreats everybody. She doesn't do anything whatsoever for anybody at any point that to justify people wanting to be around her. I expected that she would be insufferable but actually get things done for the good of others so they would be willing to help her along but no, they only try to help and befriend her because the show would be boring without more characters.The acting by some of the actors is sometimes so stifled and robotic that it sounds like a random person picked out of the street mocking a middle school children's play. That's specially obvious when compared to the main actress who completely nailed her part, the actor that plays Gomez and the actress that plays the principal.All in all it's just a morbid, kind of comedic and poorly developed teenage drama that revolves around an outcast main character.

            "content": "\"Wednesday\" has been getting a lot of traction on social media, so it was inevitable that I begin watching the show - to see what the hype was all about. Frankly, I don't fully understand why the show is so popular (other than Jenna Ortega's performance, which I'll get into later), because it's - for lack of a better word - mediocre and average.The story itself is nothing too special. It follows a character of the show's name, Wednesday Addams, as she enters a new school (Nevermore Academy) full of misfit students ('outcasts' as they're repeatedly referred to as throughout the show). The show progresses as Wednesday grows to like the school, creates (and destroys) relationships, and becomes engulfed with a murder/criminal conspiracy that plagues the school and citizens of nearby town (Jericho).On paper, a show like this isn't something that'd enjoy all that much. It's like a high school drama set in a \"quirky\" world with strange people and creatures. Then, as a cherry on top, there's a murder mystery that the titular character must solve. These kinds of stories often suffer from mediocrity and - for lack of a better word - cringiness, and these are definitely applicable descriptions to \"Wednesday.\" The dialogue can be clunky and unnatural, and the setting doesn't feel all that creative - just another monster/fantasy-based high school drama with a backdrop of murder mystery. If this was all the show was, I wouldn't be able to give it anything higher than a 4/10. But of course, something is bumping the grade up, which I'd like to get into.Firstly, the cinematography is impressive. The camera work, the colour coding, the settings, and everything to do with the visuals of the show are great. It never felt boring or lifeless, and it was a great and refreshing contrast to the unimaginative and spiritless cinematography of today's films. I also was a big fan of the character work. The characters were, for the most part, written well and in an interesting way, all unique in their own facets and all undergoing some sort of meaningful arc. While, again, the dialogue does, at times, get unbearable to listen to and detract from the character work, the actors do well to counteract the sometimes strange and odd dialogue and make it more enjoyable and even funny.On that note, the performances in this show were mostly phenomenal. Catherine-Zeta Jones and Luis Guzm\u00e1n have such fantastic chemistry and portray Morticia and Gomez Addams (respectively) very enjoyably. Gwendoline Christie gave Larissa Weems a great air of intimidation yet sympathy, and I thoroughly enjoyed Emily Myers' energetic performance as Enid Sinclair (her character was a sort of overused trope, but her performance made up for it). I'd also like to bring up that Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen) and Thing (Victor Dorobantu) were among my favorite performances and characters in the show, second only to Wednesday herself. If I had any complaints, I'd say Hunter Doohan's performance was underwhelming, as he simply plays Tyler Galpin with the same emotion of \"awkward teenage boy\" for most of the show. I'd say his performance definitely picked up by the final episode, but it was a minor taint in an overall phenomenal cast and performance. However, this can mostly be attributed to his character's writing, so I'll let it slide.But of course, I have to bring up the woman of the hour: Jenna Ortega. Her immense rise in popularity on social media and countless praises of her performance was the main draw of the show for me, and I have to agree with the masses. Her performance as Wednesday was compelling, charming, funny, intimidating, and overall phenomenal. This show would not be half as good without the incomparable performance she put up, as well as the fantastic chemistry she had with the other cast members and the effort she dedicated to prepare for the role (eg. Playing cello, practicing fencing, learning German, and so much more).In all, this show is far from perfect. The writing and dialogue are clunky and clich\u00e9d, and the plot does feel redundant to a lot of what's come out in the past few years. But some shining aspects of the show, particularly in the performances, make it a great experience to sit back enjoy. The show may be cringey at times, but you'll be laughing with the show - not at it. I highly recommend everyone to give it a watch and I hope you enjoy this imperfect but fun show as much as I did.",

I am not a die-hard fan of the original Addams Family show or movies, but I did see several of them and don't remember the tension and strife between the two of them, but maybe I'm just not recalling properly.Overall, I can't wait for season 2 to come out. I hope that this series ends up having a few seasons. I'm excited to see what is next at Nevermore!",

It lags in a few spots with some of the tertiary characters stories, but that's a minor complaint.The only thing that grinded on my nerves was the casting of Luiz Guzman as Gomez...he didn't fit the role at all. Not meant to be a shot at him as an actor, just not for this role. Though his role in the series is minimal, it took me out of the story whenever he appeared. Fred Armisen.as Uncle Fester makes up for it...he was hilarious.If you're looking for fun and entertaining show to watch, I highly recommend this one.Jenna has my vote for an Emmy on this one.",

That said, I must confess, I'm an intense watcher of good stuff, sometimes watching things over and over, never missing a thing, and discovering more each viewing...like Joker, Scarface, Silence of the Lambs. But once is enough watching Wednesday. I too, was a bit disappointed in how Gomez was cast with Luis Guzman. I enjoy his work, but cast here, was a chemistry mismatch for Zeta-Jones. Jenna Ortega, cast as Wednesday, can certainly hold her own and I think is an up and coming, attractive and talented actress. I would be compelled to watch her in something else. Regarding Uncle Fester, I heard him before I saw him and thought surely, it was Steve Buscemi. Nope. Fred Armisen.

It feels like Scooby-Doo met early live action Disney movies for kids and they tried to add cuss words and talk of mild gore to push it to older teen audiences. It didn't work.If you're only looking for a teen drama and don't care about the Addams family then go ahead and watch it, you might enjoy it.If you were looking for a fun modernized version of Wednesday in the Addams family universe then this isn't for you. You'll like Wednesday Addams but will be tortured (and not in a fun way) by the kiddy cliches and offensive use of such a wonderful and nostalgic family.Wednesday the series adds nothing of any worth to anything. It adds nothing to the Addams family. It adds nothing to teen drama. It adds nothing to mystery. Very disappointing considering the budget and those who worked on it.

To me. John Astin as Gomez and. Carolyn Jones as Morticia were awesome. The chemistry was so great, and then there was the great addition of Ted Cassidy as Lurch. How the ended this show after only 2 seasons is beyond me, and the success of the follow on movies is quite a testament.Now that I have introduced what I really liked about the original series, I will follow with the disappointment of the movies, Carolyn Jones was so much what I remember with the greatest fondness, and the people that were cast for her in the movies just did not have the same elegance that Carolyn brought to the show. However I have seen the comic strip, Luis Guzm\u00e1n and Catherine Zeta-Jones are visually just so perfect for the parts of Gomez and Morticia from the comics, but miss marvelous chemistry between them. The affection that Luis shows towards Catherine Zeta-Jones just is misses the mark from the TV series.The biggest hit for me in the show from the original was Victor Dorobantu who did Thing. Head and shoulders above the series, and to me one of the biggest draws for this show. Victor Dorobantu is able to bring such energy to the character.Jenna Ortega does a marvelous job with Wednesday. Maybe could have been better. There is just a little something that she is missing I feel, but still she does a great job. Still think maybe Samara Morgan who has done Wednesday on Youtube in some ways is better.The third excellent character was Fred Armisen who plays Uncle Fester. When I first say him, he did look so much like Jackie Coogan form the original series. Started to see difference, but I thought that the Uncle Fester of Fred Armisen was much better.The one thing I really miss though is the Lurch from the series. They did almost nothing with this character in this series, and it left me frustrated. Hope he becomes a more significant in the next season.Definitely a show enjoy, and I think those that enjoyed the Mandarin series will like this since Thing should be quite a draw like Yoda.",

First, let me tell you what I like. Jenna Ortega. She gave an excellent performance. The other actors weren't bad either. In general, the adult actors were very good. There were also overacting acting. Luis Guzman, did not like his acting and character . He doesn't fit the role. Also, the character of Gomez was not like in the movies. I didn't like it at all, he was very wimpy, coward and . . . Anyway written differently. Mortica wasn't bad. The brother was also ok. Uncle was average. The music was very good in the show. It was also a very well thought out decision to call Christina Ricci specifically for the supporting role for the series. Overall it was a teen series. But it wasn't bad either. If there is a second season, I will watch it. The editing was good too. The dance scene was choreographed by Jenna herself. I like it. I also hate Tik Tok, but it was inevitable that this dance would go viral. I watched it on Youtube from time to time :) There were 2 characters I doubted about the killer. I mean, one of the two is definitely a killer, I said after the 4th episode and one of them was true. Honestly, I didn't really like the ending of the series. It was lazily written and rushed.

She kinda grew as a character by the end, so at least there is that. Besides her, there was absolutely no other character that captured interest. They all seemed like shallow CW teen drama characters.The mystery was probably the only thing that really kept me interested, even though I predicted the \"bad guys\" in episode 1.

I found every character interesting and the acting very convincing, this honestly helps the story because you really want to find out \"Who done it?!\"I adore Tim Burtons work, he is one of my favourite directors. Danny Elfmans music makes every scene either suspenseful or spooky. It's a really great way to add to the scene, so you don't have to rely on the visuals alone, audio is a great clue.The storyline makes complete sense and it really does make you go \"omg no way!\"\nI really do recommend watching this show, it's perfect for any introvert who loves spooky and fantastical shows or movies.

This time, an adolescent Wednesday is sent to a boarding school for outcasts.With an uncanny expression of gloom, and never blinking eyes, Wednesday takes viewers on a fun adventure of doom.For a first season show, it seems to tell a well crafted story. There are scenes which are sure to be identified as iconic as we move to the future. The most amazing of those scenes is Wednesday's dance. It could literally carry the entire season on its own.Seriously, if you haven't watched, make a plan to do so.Tim Burton does a stellar job, and his collaboration with Jenna Ortega is destined to be legendary.Wednesday is a jewel.",

I know nothing about the cartoon except seeing some ads for it a few times. But the Gomez in Wednesday looks similar to the Gomez in the cartoon. So when I make any comparisons it will be based on the tv show and the Huston/Julia version compared to Wednesday characters.First, Gomez, horrible casting except he looks like the cartoon. In the TV show and the Huston/Julia movie you could feel chemistry between them. Huston gave a dark, somber version of Morticia which was similar to the original. Julia was the suave and lovestruck Gomez. Gomez is OK in most of his roles but a suave and deadly with a sword type he is not. Zeta Jones just doesn't have what it takes to be a Morticia. She was an OK actress when she was in her prime and IMO her looks carried the lackluster acting. To be honest both are too old for the roles.Wednesday did a good job of being the dark and cynical Wednesday. You could picture her as the younger version from the TV show. When she went to the dance and actually danced I thought that is out of character and then I remembered the episode in the original where she was showing off the latest dance craze.Uncle Fester was a fairly decent reproduction of the original. Pugsley I was not impressed with. Lurch...Well what can you say about a character that mainly walks around and groan. While it was funny in the original it just doesn't seem like Lurch. I wonder if we will be seeing Cousin It and Grandmama in future episodes. My only question was other than being weird what was the justification for the Addams going to Nevermore? Supposedly Thornhill was the \"first\" normie at the school. They have vampires, werewolves, sirens, gorgons, shapeshifters and other things but I don't believe they have ever said what the Addams are.Anyway, if you liked the original then Wednesday is a good reproduction if you overlook Morticia and Gomez. Now if this was based on the cartoon and that is how they are like that then forget this whole ramble :) But for some reason I picture the Gomez cartoon character as more like a weasley Igor type.",

            "content": "It's not an exaggeration to say this is literally \"Riverdale\" and \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" story lines that got rearranged & copy and pasted for this show's plot, I know that because I did myself the misfortune of sitting through all these shows. It's a disappointment, with misleading trailers and reviews. It's so grossly over-hyped just for you to realize it's nothing but a lazy cash-grab, and that's why every promotion focused so much attention to the big names rather than the story or content itself. Something that you can unmask about the positive reviews is that none of them are critical or capable of a detailed opinionated review. Their reviews are vague and reason-less because they liked the decent looking actors, the superficial aesthetic, the good but basic indie/overplayed soundtrack, and the slightly Tim Burton atmosphere, but they're unable to pinpoint that because most of these reviewers are likely unaware of it. When it comes to the actual story, no way did anyone like this shallow plot that is no joke, a rip-off of \"Riverdale\" and \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\". The protagonist is a cookie cutter \"weird girl\" who always has to remind you every time she opens her mouth that she's \"not like other girls\" which gets old quick but lasts the whole series. No character, not even the protagonist, has growth, depth, character, or culture (which is ironic because of how much Jenna talks in interviews about representing her Latin culture). The dialogue the writers wrote for the protagonist is very clearly what a mindless person would imagine a thinking person sounds like but to anyone sensible she just sounds very pretentious and childishly edgy. While previous depictions of Wednesday made her a smart and funny character (and movies like Addams Family Values gave her growth), this Wednesday is hard to not cringe at. You can tell this was just a paycheck to the creators because they literally thought throughout this series that a one-off act done in the movies was some kind of deeper connection to her history. They took an interesting eccentric family and instead chose to center the story on boring cardboard cutouts of fantasy teen drama extras who are an unsubtle attempt to one-up the eccentrics of the family which obviously misses the entire point of the Addams Family. On the second watch, It really stuck out, how bad the acting is, most of the actors are either under-performing their parts or dramatically performing like Disney channel cartoon characters. In its most basic proposition this show had potential if there were any creative minds involved. The biggest disappointment is the reception, lousy cliche cash grabs like this getting positive support to this extent, just confirms people will eat up anything. If they like the aesthetic, the big names, and the heavily reused soundtrack, regardless of any effort or creativity on their end people will pay a lot more for copy and pasted formulaic media. We're in a never-ending cycle of unoriginal and uninspired remakes, reboots, redesigns, spin-offs, sequels, etc. Because big companies like getting rid of any shred of originality and people support milking out any creativity to the point media becomes this dry. It's frustrating because even the people involved in making this series have publicly admitted to rushing it and inserting the most basic and predictable cliches because of how little this side-project mattered to them.",

Speaking of which, it was incredibly smart to bring back Christina Ricci for a role in this show as a nice easter egg for the fans of the prior. Ortega fully embraced the character and \"became\" her on another level. Time for me to check out more of her work for sure!The cinematography is very \"Tim Burton-ish\" with a modern twist to it. You can feel his directive presence throughout the entire show. The writers did an incredible job as well to take an already existing iconic character - which is a bold move - and dive deeper into her personal story and life. The music and sound design was also very much like the theme of the show and the previous ones. The nailed the atmosphere and overall vibe for me really well.I was afraid at first that they would \"normalize\" Wednesday too much. After all, I feel she should remain an intriguing and morbid character with surely a lot of underlying depth underneath her deadpan witty personality. She was exactly that in this show and I'm very happy about that. Wednesday remains to be an absolute boss, as she should be. She was humanized in subtle ways and with slow steps without forcing any narratives or uncharacteristic traits.The acting was pristine. Jenna Ortega was the perfect pick for the role and she crushed it. Her co-stars manage to not disappoint either next to a presence like hers. Gwendoline Christie's character surprised me a lot. Her performance (subtle emotion, motivation, traits) elevated her character and transformed her from a \"somewhat\" antagonist to a beloved, awesome figure whos presence was constantly felt throughout the show. I was also presently surprised by Hunter Doohan and Emma Myers, whom respectively play Tyler and Enid. Great things await these brilliant actors.I thought the casting of the other Addams' family members was just perfect and worked well as an addition to the show. The way \"Thing\" moves and communicates brought back some very nostalgic feels, I love It. The twists were great and some more unexpected than others. The detective-ish theme of the show had me hooked from the beginning 'till the end. I truly hope they'll release more seasons, which I assume they will since this show will no doubt break the internet. Not doing so would woe my mind.",

Writes should take examples from japanese animes or korean series, spare some time and put some effort into story. Seems like they just filled every cliche plot twists in the book and created just another fabrication mistery series. I've watched kid shows with better twists. It bored me.Wednesday's punchlines were very boring and cringy. Not like in the 90's movies. They were brilliant.Acting was ok for the main chacacters, but as i see on the internet, fans are overrating it obviously.This production kinda ruined the Wednesday chacater in my mind. I excpeted way more intelligent, psychopath Wednesday and maybe few more torturing scenes, but with dark humour not horror. All she does walk around,stare and say forced darkish sentences.Oh the cgi.. I don't wanna talk about it.Costumes and decorations are ok.

The two guys who are supposedly Wednesdays love interests are literally so bland and unlikable wow, Xavier is the average, snobby edgelord and Tyler is super annoying and thinks he's special because he's not scared of Wednesday. He's so pick me, choose me, love me like god go away. Enids case is almost worse cause she has a completely random crush on Ajax, who's literally even more boring than the other two, like i can't list a single character trait for him and also the audacity of him to be mad at Enid for going to the dance with someone else, while he does the exact same and not even telling Enid why he couldn't make it to the date like shut up bro literally get lost in the woods what an unnecessary character. He drags Enids character down. Bianca was a great character, should've gotten more screentime, she has lots of potential which was unfortunately ignored in favor of stupid \"romance\" and bland characters nobody asked for. Yoko was there for like 10 seconds, which is weird cause she was promoted quite a bit and we just never saw her or heard her talk except for like 2 times. Eugene was cute, only likeable male character, he's just chilling, love his dynamic with Wednesday. The rest of the Addams family were great to watch, the principal and the teacher were also nice characters. CGI was uhh interesting but i don't care much for it so it didn't bother me. Biggest issue is really just the romance and some of the characters. Wednesday and Enid had a scene at the end of the last episode that put all the romance scenes to shame, because these two literally have the best chemistry in the whole show. I would watch a second season only for Wednesday, Enid and Bianca tbh. Well and Yoko but the team doesn't seem to care much for her character.",

Apparently you CAN do all of that, and it doesn't have to be horrible.The title character Wednesday is portrayed very well by Jenny Ortega, who manages to be funny and charismatic in the role while being true to Wednesday's dark and angsty personality.The plot is interesting and the mysteries of the show are engaging and satisfying. Even the teen drama aspects, which I was fully prepared to cringe at, were handled well. The characters felt like real people dealing with real problems, even when they were silly supernatural creatures dealing with ridiculous supernatural problems. Even when the interactions carried obvious \"social justice\" messages, it didn't feel preachy or like some school anti-bullying video.The only big negative for me was that the show seemed to have a hard time with the balancing act between Wednesday's character as an antisocial psychopath who loves death and murder, and the fact that Wednesday is also supposed to be our protagonist who's really a good person and cares about everybody and does the right thing, the nice thing, etc. There were a few moments when I found myself thinking, \"okay, so she's a actually a big sweetheart pretending to be Wednesday Addams.\"But overall, loved this, and I was pleasantly surprised.",

It also shows wednesday's soft side and how she isnt completely heartless and emotionless. Binged it 1/2 days and would recommend!",

I decided to give it a try despite my reservations because the score was so high and Tim burton has made many excellent movies. This show should be on the CW. I can't believe Tim burton made this. It doesn't have that feel at all. It also doesn't have the adams family feel. At this point, why even make a reboot? Why even make something that already exists and change it until it's nearly unrecognizable? Where are the original ideas? I only could force 3 episodes because I was so bored and I hate shows about teenagers. The casting of Gomez was so awful it was distracting. I was literally cringing when his gargoyle looking self was trying to caress the stunning CZJ. Gomez is supposed to be smooth, handsome, romantic. This Gomez came off as a creep. CZJ tried. She was beautiful at least. Wednesday did fine, but so much of her charm, quick whips, and deadpan was missing mostly because her dialogue just wasn't funny or sharp like the original. If you have watched the original show, or the 1990s classic movies, you will probably be disappointed. This show feels more like a knock off Harry Potter. Don't believe the score, and don't expect much. If you can stand stupid teenage problems, this is the show for you. If you are a mature audience and love the originals, just skip it. It also can get a little preachy at times with its messaging. I'm guessing a lot of people won't exactly like the message. I didn't mind it, as I mostly agree with the views, but I'm just warning people.",

What really works is the focus on the main character- one who could have come across as one note- but much like her Cello Playing she knows how to hit both the high and low notes. The mix of secondary characters adds smoothly to the story. For any Game of Thrones fans, they will really enjoy Gwendoline Christie'a role. She is a diverse actress who pairs well against an anti-hero role of Jenna Ortega. Another shining actress is Riki Lindhome (from the comedy band Garfunkel and Oates) and Emma Myers plays the quirky friend role well. Like most tv series, it does have some misfires - mostly the casting of Morticia, but she isn't in it enough to distract the viewer. Hopefully it doesn't follow in the path of Riverdale and go too far off the wheel with writing or like Game of Thrones, where they throw away all character development in its last season. The actors really made the story, and their in-between moments is what kept it grounded. With the wrong script or wrong actors, this could have been a real mess.",

It feels over stylized in a very generic, average, rushed kind of way. Burton's previous projects where cheesy and stylized, yes, but they were quirky and oddball which made the cheesy element kinda charming. The new Wednesday doesn't have the oddball charm.As for the main character, Wednesday...we'll it's boring. The depiction is deadpan, as expected, but that's it. There's a subtle timing in W's delivery that's missing here. (Ricci had a bit of it) long awkward Pauses, silky silence before the fatal verbal blow or surprising dark comeback. A finesse. Maybe it boils down to charisma, I'm not sure. Ortega plays her like a walking corpse, but she was more than that. The original W seemed wickedly mysterious. She was dangerous in an unassuming and surprising way. She was also humorous but that doesn't come across in the updated version. There's nothing there. Nothing. Just some average dialogue in an average story with a average portrayal. Average.The show is and will be a commercial success.

Also she is portrayed as smart and planning ahead but when the plot requires it she (and others) just act stupid\n. Lazy writing.

Writers should have come up with some plan for the finale, or at least have Wednesday try to do a plan and order the students around but they refuse to join\n. Enemies are weak, and inconsistently so. In the last episodes, it only takes one student to easily defeat each enemy, and in less than 5 minutes. School is inhabited by hundreds of vampires, werewolves and other monsters, and did I say sirens who can make people obey them with their voices?. very uninspired and unoriginal, imagine every adolescent cliche and copy paste characters, and terrible romance\n.

I remember hearing this show was going to be a thing and unfortunately because of the way other reboot type shows have treated other titles I've loved in the past I wasn't excited. I'm a believer in being fair so I resolved to watch it and be objective. I was hooked after the first episode. Granted some of the younger themes are a miss for me but I easily look past them because Wednesday is perfect, she is absolutely brilliant! I had prepared to hate the show because there were early reports of \"wokeness\"... there are some political statements being made but they're subtle and used as part of the story, they aren't THE STORY. I never once felt preached to or scolded. The rest of the family is spot on as well but like I said Wednesday and her antics with Thing are just so much fun. This series pretty much saved Netflix 2022 for me. I'm excited for more seasons to come.",

The acting, camerawork and editing is out of this world and it is very unexpected to see a reboot of the Addams Family but its done really well in a modern setting and the overall universe and worldbuilding is great but where this show lacks is the story.You have your average teen drama characters and storyline and it actually does turn the clich\u00e9s around to provide some humor but I can't say the same for the \"detective story\". The twist that Thornhill and Tyler were the bad guys wasn't executed that well. From the first scene you see Thornhill you could smell she was the bad guy through the screen. They try to decive you with the psycologist and xavier but it really does not work that well either.I really feel like there is potential a second season if they dont play it as safe and try to actually experiment a little with the story.Tl;dr amazing acting and visuals but a generic meh story that has already been done too many times.",

But...did not care for Gomez' portrayal. Yes, he looked much more like the original cartoon character. But Charles Addams himself was a consultant on the original '60s series and his notes are what actor John Astin performed (and mimicked by Raul Julia superbly in the movies). The portrayal here was so, well, wimpy and subdued. The crazed dueling Latin lover millionaire playboy that others have portrayed is exactly how Addams described him to the original show's creators so why this wasn't continued is beyond me.",

Good entertainment for the whole family.I am watching Wednesday, I am at episode 7. But I want to write the review now, because I completely do not care about the solution of this mystery.So if I forget the Adams family, we have a girl who is very gifted and luckily she can also see the truth, because can she trust her vision power? Ofcourse!So we see a girl that is different from everybody else, even iif she goes to a school for weird beings. I am wondering what kind of being she is, that is not really clear for me. She is a Adams ofcourse, but ok, she is trying to find it out I think.Because she is at a school with young beings, a bit like the Harry Potter school. But way more shallow. The CGI cannot cover up everything, it is hard for me not to see the CGI especially with the monster... Maybe they did it on purpose so young viewers can also watch it?Ofcourse she shares a room with some one who is the complete opposite and she needs to learn to be more like her. She is 'struggling' with that. Like with al teenager shows, emotions, love, sudden change of emotions. And everything together with a gentle sauce of: you must accept everybody and especially women. Do not get me wrong, it does not feel forced. But a wolf who cannot be a wolf yet is cliche. Ofcourse we need a character that is vulnerable and insecure.What I do like is that the bullies have their own problems and you see them. They are not 1 dimensional bully. I must say there or not many bullies on the school?! I expected more fights, maybe even about breed. Why are they living so close and peaceful together.Everything is about Wednesday, sometimes there is a little side step so others can develop a bit. But the focus is her, the case and her past. And ofcourse her new future which she creates. It is all covered with that beautiful people, flying angels music and stereoptype stuff. Like I am watching a teenager series. Maybe it is? I think someone of 15 will enjoy it a lot.For me as an adult I have not much fun. It is nice to see Wednesday, I always liked her. So it is nice to see a series about her. But she is just a bit too much for me. She has no flaws except not being able to show emotions and making friends. That in a not really good developed world. Great to know more about the mother, but it is easy to connect the dots. There is no connection with the father. The story about the murder of the father is an absolute joke.So well... A good try, but too shallow and a lot of: just not. The story, the world, the characters: everything is mediocre. So I give it a 6, it should be a 5.5.",

The characters you love the most are the ones you least expect, right? That's probably going to be an issue if you're investigating a murder spree like this. I love Jenna Ortega from previous films similar to Yes Day and she was also in series like Stuck in the Middle. I think she only blinked about twice in the entire programme, which is incredible! !SPOILER ALERT! I sort of guessed that Tyler was the hyde, but it was based on barely any evidence and I almost changed my mind near to the end. I felt so bad for Wednesday when she finally got the vision telling her who the hyde really was, and that the sheriff didn't even believe her since it was his son. It was also amazing how Bianca helped her defeat Joseph Crackstone, because I wasn't expecting her to do that. And the really nice & quirky plant teacher being Laurel Gates, the one manipulating Tyler into being the hyde? So unexpected. The amount of plot twists that this show had in just 8 episodes is amazing. But the ending surprised me most.. Now that Wednesday has a modern phone, she's going to be blackmailed by a stalker, who was stalking Wednesday the entire time and we never noticed? So it's got to be someone that is always around, had an opportunity to always be watching, and nobody ever put a second thought towards. I'm thinking of someone specifically that Enid is close friends with, but I'm not going to give my answer away, since I could be very wrong haha. Speaking of Enid, I am so pleased for her that she finally got her werewolf transformation, and I was also very shocked that Wednesday hugged her back at the end. Since Wednesday doesn't take a liking to hugs, she must've realised that Enid really needed it. Nevertheless, this is definitely the best programme of 2022, and I suggest that everybody watches it.",

True to the Riverdale and Sabrina template, it's necessary to have generational conflict with the parents, with absolutely no exceptions: even culturally requisite popular black girl Bianca can't stand the sight of her mother. Werewolf Enid is trying to convince her parents that she doesn't need conversion therapy (do you see how expertly the writers allude our normie issues? So understanding and sympathetic, would that the town's European and religious founders, and their normie descendants, receive the same treatment). The grown-ups just don't understand teenage suffering and will have to be educated by their intelligent offspring. There are some Addams family references here and there, but really, it's just another teen drama series that happens to be set in that world. It doesn't really make as much use of it as it could.

The Addams are close to each other in the family because they have their lifestyles, which are different from the others but don't make them lonely. They have friends and fun activities and are not afraid of sad emotions. Tim destroyed the Addams by giving them the loser character to all the family and making them normal.So please find the 1993 version or some cartoon and feel free to watch it then; you will see what I mean and you will understand how funny this family.",

However, while Catherine Zeta-Jones looks fantastic, I couldn't get past how ridiculous it is given her age that she's cast as a parent of young teens. Both parents' acting was robotic and awkwardly timed. Christina Ricci's acting was also bad.That said, the rest of the cast is stellar and I love the complex storylines and character development of many of the students and townspeople. The cinematography, music, and dark humor are on point.They did a great job setting the foundation for this to be a multi-season show with plenty of mysteries and crimes to explore down the road.

            "content": "It's hard to believe Tim Burton has never helmed an Addams Family project before. The quirky gothic stylings of the franchise are right up his alley, so it was only a matter of time until we were treated to his version of the family. While Wednesday may not be exactly what fans envisioned for Burton's take on these characters, it's a fun and mildly twisted series elevated by the always-excellent, Jenna Ortega.Although this show is geared toward a young adult audience, older viewers will appreciate the clever nods and references to the family's film and television history. Whether it's the signature double snap or having Ricci return in a different role, there's more than enough to please longtime fans. Burton's signature style gives the series an appropriately dreary look, even though it doesn't always meld with the teen-focused storytelling.The production design is also quite impressive. Everything from the gothic architecture of the Nevermore campus to the creature design looks great. Thing Addams in particular represents some of the most seamless VFX work I've ever seen, and I'm dying to know how it was accomplished. Danny Elfman's title theme and Chris Bacon's score make great finishing touches.Let's get something straight - this show works because of Ortega, and without her, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend watching it. Her expressionless expressions and matter-of-fact line delivery are pitch-perfect, and she fills Ricci's shoes with ease. We don't get much time with the other Addams', but it's not an issue because Ortega owns this role. Watching her play emotionlessly off much livelier characters makes for an amusing contrast.The season-long mystery is intriguing enough to make for an easy binge, but doesn't offer much we haven't seen before. There's a lot of angsty teen drama throughout that falls flat, but by placing the morbidly curious Wednesday Addams at the center of everything, it gets a pass.Wednesday caters to teen audiences a bit much to draw in older audiences, but there's still a lot to enjoy from this modern take on the iconic character. It's streaming now on Netflix, so snap to it and get watching.",

I still have nightmares over the animation adaptation that in no way lived up to the spirit of Adams family.I can't express how happy I was to be surprised at the quality and love that went into this show.So to start with why have I given 9 stars and not 10. Well simply I didn't like the casting of Fester and how the character was played. That is about my only complaint for this show.Other than Fester (who has very little screen time so don't worry) the casting is absolutely on point and all the cast down to the extras do an amazing job. A lot of the side characters have great arcs that don't overshadow the story but still give the world a great full feel.The story is good and keeps you wanting to keep watching whilst all the side action, especially Wednesdays music scenes, just keep it interesting all the way through.Also Hand. Wow. Hand is great. Never thought a single hand could actually challenge for the most expensive and interesting characters. Never a boring moment when hands on screen.Bring worthy show.",

I think it is really similar with with Harry Potter. Like Harry Potter in Wednesday has magical school, 4 houses , competition like triwizard tournament , friendship ant etc. I wish they should show school life , vampires ,sirens , wolves more.Netflix should give more budget for this series. Because visual effects at some point was not so quality. But places, set , general ambiance which is created by G. O. A. T Tim Burton can changed eveeything in a good way and you even dont pay attention to the effects.Jenna Ortega was iconic as Wednesday. She is such an great actress and has real potential. She was born to play Wednesday.Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the film in 1991 plays Miss Thornhill in this series. I was surprised when I heard. Even an episade where she said to Wednessay \"we are similar to each other and have something in common\" was subtle detail and she also played perfectly.Screenwriters wrote lines splendidly. Of course there is Tim Burton factor. We need to appreciate screenwriters who write scripts, lines , character so perfectly. Jokes are so much funny ,humorous, laughable and lines that given us in the sentences which showed how family is unique , extraordinary and maniac was perfect.If you like Harry Potter , Stranger things , Chilling adventure of Sabrina , Fear Street\nYou are going to love it.",

I forgot it was her on tv and not Wednesday Addams. I can't and will never be able to explain what a phenomenal job she did. I loved the incorporation of Christina Ricci, the original Wednesday, and how she was very active throughout every episode. I loved how multiple pieces would come together with each scene that passed. Every actor in this series nailed their role and it felt so real when I watched. Now, the dialogue...INCREDIBLE. Very unique and totally fitting to a series like this one. Fell in love with so many characters and their stories. Finally, the location. Gosh, Romania is gorgeous, and I loved how the creators of the show didn't stray away from the setting that Wednesday would be located in.

            "content": "Let me start off by saying, I've been a huge fan of Addams Familys since the black & white TV. The first DVD I ever bought was the Addams Family live action movies. While not all Addams Familys projects were a hit for me (especially the CGI movies). Wednesday is a HIT!I wasn't sure what to expect when it started. Especially after I didnt hear the double snap in the intro, I almost felt like it wasnt going to be for me. It felt like it was going to be another \"weird family trying to fit in\" story at the very beginning, I was even thrown off by a 'thats so raven'-esque moment in the first 10 minutes. But it quickly transitioned to a COMPLETELY different type of show which can be best described as \"Nancy Drew\" meets \"Hogwarts\" meets \"Monsters High School\". While that sounds atrocious, with Tim Burton at the helm, it worked out great.They took what was probably the most popular Addams Character since the early 90's movie, and made an entire story about her growing into her own. No longer is Wednesday a 10 year old girl, but a young woman.The story itself starts off as a subtle 'who dunn it' mystery plot, but once it picks it does get very interesting. As someone who normally figures out the plot before reaching the end, this one definitely had enough twist and turns to keep us guessing until the very end.Where I do feel baited and switched is the case that they got a lot of high profile talent for this show, only for all of them to play very small parts. Luiz Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones feel like they make brief appearances, I wouldnt even be surprised if they arent in a second season (fingers crossed there is another season). It definitely feels like the rest of the Addams family (outside of Thing) was underused. But the show is called Wednesday, so this should be expected.At the end of the day, I didnt know what to expect, but was definitely intrigues by the world the built, and enamored by Wednesday Addams herself. I thought this might end up as a tween-age highschool drama, which there were moments of that, but it definitely had Veronica Mars type deep mysteries that kept you guessing to the very end. There are times when you feel sad for Wednesday to the point of almost tears. With Tim Burton and Danny Elfmans added touch, this show is a winner.",

The fact she eventually stumbles onto the correct conclusion doesn't change the fact she got it wrong almost constantly. Furthermore, there's no acknowledgement of how wrong she got it on multiple occasions; the show ends with us still being told she's some sort of edgy genius on a level with Sherlock Holmes.Overall, the show was enjoyable and I'm sure there'll be a lot of memes created from Jenna's great facial expressions (or lack thereof) but the writing isn't nearly on the same level as her performance.",

I constantly get the feeling that this show does not know what it wants to be. Is this a mystery? Magic and witches and supernatural-y? Coming of age? Scary? Funny? Insightful? Weird? It is sort of all of those things, and yet none of them.A school for outsiders? Yea, how original... and a murder mystery which is so easy to solve half-way into the first episode... yea, the show is simply not nailing it.To me they should have made this scarier, creepier, and had a much less happy peppy room mate.

This thing was GREAT! Wednesday Adams was a treasure, her deadpan was genious ( I'm 66 years old and I am looking forward to rocking Wednesday's wardrobe). The atmosphere, the witty and slick one-liners was on point! My favorite genre is who-done-it and this gem did not disappoint. With Tim Burton at the helm it gave excellent scares, believable characters, deft acting and this thing was paced beautifully. I was also happy to see Sir Lady Brienne of Tarth (Gwen Christie) featured in this thing.I binged the entire seies in one setting and never stopped for \ud83c\udf7f. It was just that kind of a roller coaster.Pretty Little Liars meets Riverdale meets Scream the series meets Wednesday!One final thing...I would like to see more Casting take in consideration the feelings of Black girls.

With that said I'm not saying that I adore every single thing that he creates because sometimes it's just not too Burtony for my taste BUT if I do adore it..I DO !Wednesday was exactly what I wanted it to be ! It's not a horror like all his works but it has horror elements! It's not a kids movie but it could be for the right kids and just like most his work it may look like that but that's the charm of his style - not enough to be labled as anything but a Tim Burgon movie !When I first saw the cast I was really happy to see Christina Ricci's name because if you know Burton you know his Love for Ricci and the fact that she was the previous Wednesday when she was a kid in the 90s Addams Family films so I was pretty happy that he took her onboard but I was not that happy with the choice of Morticia and Gomez at first because I think Eva Green and (especially )Oscar Isaac would be the perfect cast for this duo BUT now when I've seen the show I'm actually very happy with the Catherine Zeta and Luis Guzman as they do not appear in very episode and I would be really unsatisfied if Oscar Isaac was Gomes and he was seen only a few times Jenna Ortega was just outstanding! I first saw her in \"You\" and she instantly became a favorite of mine .She was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N as Wednesday and that dance scene was just FIRE\nI also REALLY liked the fact that we could still hear Danny Elfman's music and that they used a real man 's hand ( still attached to the man :D) for the role of Thing,when I first se Thing I was mesmerised by how real that hand looked like and I know that Tim Burton is a huge fan of stop motion animation so I thought that it was a doll but it ended up being a grown man creepjnv on the floor and acting as the Thing...which is just as cool as it can get ! The styling,costumes, make up I don't thing there is any need on talking about it everything was perfect as always and I truly cannot wait for more of this goth icon !!!",

My only critique I have against this show is that some parts were so unnecessary. It felt as if they were trying to add so many different characters and events, but with the limited time they had, events felt so rushed, and characters so underdeveloped. Every episode a new kind of event thing happened: a ball, a race thing, a carnival, it felt so unnecessary. I feel like if they had focused more on like the school or some it would have been more interesting- like they built up the ball to be this big thing and it honestly kinda sucked, it definitely didn't live up to what every character was talking it up to be. The characters... where do I start? Wednesday was well written. I enjoyed her character, and she was so unintentionally funny. All the other characters felt so rushed though. They all had about one defining character trait and that's about all their personality was. The friends of enid's or whatever, I can't even remember them they were that irrelevant. So was Enid's boyfriend. Their whole love story felt so irrelevant again, felt like something the writers added in because- how dare anyone write about teenagers who don't have romantic lives! And Wednesday's love interests: again not needed. Love triangles are so overdone in film nowadays, it's just not interesting. Anyway, besides the millions unnecessary events that occurred and the underdeveloped characters who got into romantic relationships with little to no chemistry, I did enjoy the show, and I hope to see where it goes if it gets renewed for a season two- which it probably will, due to the attention it's receiving on social media.",

I can see where many viewers will enjoy this especially since the cinematography and sound were exceptional. Netflix made a good choice in remaking The Addam's family theme in this way.

The trailers made me feel it was gritty, horror, witty series for adults but in some parts it ll give you that teenage drama vibe, some scenes were not particularly tight I mean it felt childish like the boat race.

Still it turns on sound to be different from it because of Wednesday herself.The performances are great by the whole team and many of the actors we have seen before and their experience is enormous but Wednesday shines above all due to her mean attitude, mean expression, mean caring dialogues, mean cute dialogues and mean what not dialogues which surely make us laugh. I have seen Jenna Ortega in a movie previously named 'X' where she played a role of a very simple girl and in Wednesday she felt like a new version of herself and by this we can know what she can do ahead.After Wednesday the character which I liked the most was the 'Thing' which made us awed did by just hand signals, Wednesday's roomate Enid was cute and funny too.The CGI in Wednesday looks perfect.

But regardless of that, the plot was just a typical clich\u00e9.Jenna Ortega was amazing in her role as Wednesday. She portrayed a character that was unapologetic, confident and unreserved.Wednesday Addams establishes herself as the no-nonsense girl that enjoys her independence and takes no concern over what other thinks. This quality is almost consistent throughout the series, however the plot and directing basically attempts at condemning this trait. Wednesday is basically forced to attend Nevermore Academy in order to make her more sociable. Proceeding to which she is roomed with Enid, a jubilant and colorful girl who makes a sincere effort to be friends with her. Enid's dynamic with Wednesday brings out a new dimension to friendship where both girls are able to accept each others quirks, the chemistry between them works pleasantly. From there on the rest of the plot just basically tries to weaken her character as a girl who is overconfident and insensitive to other peoples feeling. Wednesday is put in-between two male leads who only care of dating her and becomes eventually becomes theme of the plot. The series attempts to make a character like Wednesday to be helpless by herself and that only others can help her solve problems. The romance element the series attempts to inject is also very unnatural, where the two male leads are repeatedly thirsting to date Wednesday despite her overt attempts at rejecting them. But this eventually leads to her being worn down to like one of them. The plot hits every clich\u00e9 plot device from framing the wrong suspect to making the other male lead the cliched villain all along. Although Wednesday keeps her dark gloomy stature, she is painted as a helpless girl that is better off with love. Wednesday initially started the series as a strong character only to have become conformed to the standards set by those around her.",

Actually it's hard to top all the actors from the 90's Addams family movies. Those movies were absolutely perfect with perfect casting and completely iconic characters that had good chemistry.This series focuses on Wednesday of course and not the family as a whole so it's unique to see her interact with other characters who she can't exactly terrorize like on the 90s movies. This has a lot of coming of age moments which are interesting. I find it a true homage to Christina Ricci's talent that her version of Wednesday is the one that became the standard. Before the 90s movies Wednesday was just a little girl with a weird family (yes I watched the black and white show growing up). Christina Ricci's version was more gothically rebellious but charming and creepy at the same time. Jenna Ortega Carried that on in her version of Wednesday.I'm not going to pretend like the Addams family is that big of a thing or that people gawk at who plays the roles. Their popularity kind of faded off In the late 90s and people forgot about them.

But for me it was just such a joy to watch, it sucked me in and I finished the whole season in 2 sittings.I really enjoyed how Jenna Ortega portrayed Wednesday Addams, she really made her feel like she has room to grow yet would still stick to her core principles. In older adaptations we would normally see the show/movie be more linear and just give you short and random fun. But here it was obvious that they wanted the character to grow a very small amount so that it feels more real and modern.The colors, scenery, acting by Jenna Ortega was all phenomenal. The story was solid, had the story been dragged on then it would have been very stale but it was always quick to the point and refrained from becoming repetitive.Now about the negatives which would normally outweighs the positives had the shown not been my style (talking about the concept, not about being goth).The show still had classic Netflix cliches which was realistically unavoidable but in this show it was bearable which I can't say for most Netflix shows, so for the people who don't like the show because it feels like a teen drama, I fully understand this reasoning and it is quite valid to dislike the show for this. For me the only 2 main issues I had were: the huge amount of inspiration they took from Harry Potter and the acting from most of the other characters (especially Tyler).The Harry Potter style really is hard to miss, I just purely didn't like that they didn't do something a bit more original. Now the acting and my god was it as some points horrible. I couldn't stand how monotone Tyler was, he always spoke like all of his muscles were tense and could barely move his mouth, I just couldn't stand him but maybe that's just me. The rest of the cast was okay with each having a few weak moments and a few strong ones but most of them had no depth in their acting and were just so linear and repetitive at times.I know this all may not sound like I'd give this show a 10/10 but given the fact that I rushed to finish it solely down to how addicted I was, I really don't think it would be fair to give it anything less than a 10.",

Her eyes are ridiculously mesmerising, the feelings she manages to relay through them is simply unbelievable.Tim Burton is a genius and i thank him immensely for bringing Wednesday to all of us.Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Gomez & Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia were perfectly cast as Wednesday's parents.Gwendoline Christie as Nevermore's principle was fantastic.Mr. Victor Dorobantu...although we never saw you..we all saw your hand as you played Thing! Being Wednesdays side kick and protector we thought you were amazing..how a scarred hand can be cute is hard to describe but it's true.I was greatly impressed after watching an amazing 8 episodes..thank you to everyone involved and looking forward to season 2!

The way she delivers her lines is a great start to this show. Her wardrobe is fun ( even if it's just a uniform). And we can't forget about thing! Truly a good time.",

OH and anything Tim Burton is my Jam. Jenna Ortega is fab. Actually all the cast is Fabulous It was nice seeing Fred Armisen who makes a cameo as Uncle Fester. Not like Christopher Lloyd Uncle Fester but like Jackie Coogan style with his own take on the character ( the original Actor who played Uncle Fester) I would have given 10/10 but without spoiling any thing. Something happens to a character which I thought was unexpected and unnecessary in my opinion. When you see it you will know what I'm talking about .I think it's a great show for any age I'm in my forties and binged the whole 8 episodes. There is some cussing so anyone under 14 you might want to cover their ears lol but I don't know what most people feel is appropriate for their child mine are in there 20s so I'm sure they have heard and said far worse. Any who. Keep an open mind. Try not to compare this with other Addams Family movies or character portrayal. Like u said before I binged the whole thing in one rainy afternoon. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Hope this was helpful I'm sure 47 out of 50 will .",

The comebacks and brutal honesty are among the best parts of her character, and this series. Jenna Ortega is perfect regarding what the previous literature and screen adaptations of Wednesday have sought to be. She fails, time and again, but, while staying true to her selfish and lone-wolf roots, she continuously adapts to her situation, and even \"evolves\", not only her skills, but in the ability to trust others.She. Killed. It. I'll say it over and over again!The show's aesthetic and setting were great, too. The colors, contrasts, and costumes kept it light in saturation, but not too subtle to blend into the background.Now, the Bad. Unfortunately, it's another one of those Netflix/Hulu/CW/etc. Shows that has no redeemable white dudes (and almost no redeemable dudes in general). They're either villainous or incompetent, and tend to get in the way. It's a trend to try and force-feed or explain (no, not mansplain or womansplain, just explain) it to everyone who fits the above stereotype, but for those that don't fit into the agenda's crosshairs, there's a few reminders each episode that'll take you out of the immersive experience for a groan; And to those that do fit the agenda's sterotyping (leading to real-world racial-profiling), they most likely didn't watch the show, nor anything with the Addams family, probably. It'd be nice to have info regarding what groups this show is for/against. It'll never happen, but that would be nice for those that actually care.Also, Gomez \"look what they did to my boy\" Addams was a big whiff. Missing Raul Julia, and he is irreplaceable, but whether it was casting, writing, or chemistry, Luis Guzm\u00e1n was cringe in the absence of charisma. In addition, Pugsley and Fester were letdowns. At least CZJ was a hit, but what wasn't was the writers' ideas to turn her into a remorseful and emotional wreck at times.Ortega carried (as expected), the setting was legit, the plot was predictable, and the supports were paper-thin as more copy-and-paste stereotypes to the subplot fodder.6/10.",

Not the first time he has done so, turning the charismatic Willy Wonka into a sinister creep. I have no problem with the casting, but where is the charisma, the joy, the wicked sense of humour that the Addams Family are known for. They revel in the macabre the absurd, I am sure that Morticia and Gomez probably would have chuckled at Wednesday's antics, not sent her to boarding school.

In addition Gomez Addams in all other representations is meant to relatively handsome, dashing and fearless but Luis Guzman is more small, fat and sweaty. I have read like most that Tim Burton directed a number of episodes but none feel like he has as all are pretty slow and unremarkable. That said I do not feel I was the target audience.

Although she has no intention of fitting in her new school, she nevertheless finds friends, even a couple of romantic interests, while on a quest to hunt for a serial killer in their community.A crisp dialogue dripping with sarcasm and dark humor as well as a gripping mystery keeps this drama highly engaging. Jenna Ortega's version of Wednesday Addams is engaging. I also enjoyed Catherine-Zeta Jones' Morticia. It was a treat to see flashbacks of Gomez and Morticia as students in the academy.

I'm a big fan of the old school Addams, you know the black and white version. I have enjoyed the more recent movies as well. But to try and compare any of these the very original show is a bit ridiculous. Now with that being said, Jenna Ortega did an amazing job as Wednesday, I don't care what anyone says. Now the the actors selected to play the rest of Addams are trash. They do not mesh at all, no harmony, and Catherine Zeta-Jones looks like she being approached by a disease everytime Luis Guzman gets in close. There is NO romance there. If there is no bond between Gomez & Morticia then the family falls apart. I see this as a different view of Wednesday's life because in this series she is a teenager, she's not a little girl, she is unapologetically herself. She is weird, out of place, and just all out oddball. But what teen isn't. The character is still Wednesday Addams but older. The show is about her and her peers. How they interact and how the other misfits treat her. I do think they drug it out where they could've probably wrapped it up in 6 maybe 7 episodes. But don't compare it to the Addams family movies, or even the original. Watch it knowing Wednesday isn't a little girl anymore and now she navigates the normies and the world.",

Like all good Tim Burton heroines, she manages to perfectly encapsulate a zealous thirst for the macabre and doe-eyed vulnerability in equal measure. The female cast members were all particularly strong, although the overly expansive cast left most characters woefully underdeveloped outside of a couple core relationships.The story is a whodunit mystery that most will likely figure out, but I thought the quirky journey and characters made up for the predictability of the plot.

Wednesday was unique and fit with no group - all characters could have been the same.The perception that Enid and Wednesday are part of a love interest or love triangle are wrong. Both girls are clearly interested in the other gender. It is seen throughout the show for both girls - the girls like the boys. People will see what they want but the girls are friends. The subplot for Enid and Wednesday is developing a strong friend bond. They are opposites with common interests. Black v colorful, quiet v. Outgoing, etc.Sadly in our modern world girls who are close must be portrayed as gay and sexualized rather than being close friends who care about each other platonically.",

But in the second half of the series, the tone of the gothic comedy takes a back seat and the mystery theme eventually becomes more of the main text of the series. So maybe this change of tone from Tim Burton to other directors is not interesting, but still the series has a good coherence.Just stop watching the show through Tim Burton's lens and instead see it as a teenage mystery drama with a gothic twist, and everything still makes sense and appeals.(And this integrity is due to Burton's fine design in the first half of the series.)In my opinion, this work has 2 flaws:\n1. In this series, we see a teenage drama with another stereotypical love triangle.2. There are moments of the series that do not offer anything exciting, both technically and visually.

The settings are also not as gloomy as one would expect from Tim Burton, I think he has definitely lost his magic touch.",

Ricci is hard to forget as Wednesday, but Ortega was made for that role. Her dark sarcasm hits every single time. I especially loved that they casted a Latina, since the Adams are Hispanic in the first place. The show was just so much fun! Wednesday's growth through the episodes was such a blast to witness, she is hilarious. Honestly, props to the writers and directors and literally everyone involved because this was an absolute hit! I liked it so much that the silly cgi can be easily overlooked. I can see this show and this version of Wednesday becoming huge. I recommend everyone watch this, you won't regret it. The bad reviews are from people who are stuck in the past. You're allowed to enjoy a remake without it taking away from the originals, if anything this adds more to the past characters we loved.

I would give this show a 10/10 but there were a few parts that got me cringing.

            "content": "Finally a series from one to another who resonates with Gothic sensibilities enough to express the quintessence thereof. It has been a desire for Tim Burton to direct an Addams production, with the upmost bonus of maestro Elfman conducting the score. It has come to be, and it is splendid. Those that brought forth the likes of Nightmare Before xmas, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Sleepy Hollow, and other favorites. A most appropriate and inevitable manifestation.This production is in a darker vein, reminiscent of Addams & Evil strips, some of which may have been excised from New Yorker issues due to its more preferably extreme, misanthropic nature.Beginning at normie generic secondary school for commoners, where she defends Pugsley from being picked on by simpleton bullies, ingenuously gaining justified satisfactory revenge, Wednesday is sent to Nevermore Academy for outcasts accompanied by a sutured Thing, who remains clandestine. Therein begins an adventure to finding out how she fits into the mystery of a doomsday prophesy.Nevermore is reminiscent of a combination of Hogwarts and The Addams Mansion with familiar mansard darkitechture and angles, filled with gargoyles and inherent statuary, inclusive of infamous alumni such as Edgar Allan Poe {\"Nevermore\" being an obvious Poe reference}, and portraits of other notables such as Morticia and Gomez, both of whom harbor quite a legacy herein, particularly in the fencing and s\u00e9ance arenas.Both matriarch and patriarch are modeled after the original depictions from the illustrations; the squat, pug-nosed, beady-eyed, gap-toothed, almost greasy toad-like characterization, while luscious Morticia is a bit more nicely full-figured than the original, who was skinny, moreso the likes of Cher or Eva O {both of whom one would not kick out of the coffin!}, who would also be excellent renditions. Both offer a rebellious Wednesday sage advice and attempted guidance, through her adolescent phase of self-discovery, determined to find her own darkness.Wednesday herself is perfectly misanthropic, ingenious, highly selective and obsessive, demonstrating the best eccentrically unconventional Addams traits reflective in our occulture. Clairvoyant abilities have been enhanced, aiding her exponentially in her investigations. While Pugsley, who remains back at The House in the regular world, is much taller and thinner than expected, yet still enthusiastically masochistic. She rooms with kaleidoscopic lycanthrope Enid, whose transformative capabilities become useful.Other students include vampires, werewolves, sirens, gorgons, telekinetics, witches, warlocks, and shapeshifters. {Some of whom cheat in competitions}. She also befriends apikinetic Eugene Ottinger, AKA \"Beeboy\".A pleasure to see an orange-haired Christina Ricci herein, who plays botany instructor & dorm mother Marilyn Thornhill, a secret devotee of outcast-hating Joseph Crackstone, a xian pilgrim deathcult leader whom she seeks to resurrect via Necromancy. A personification of theocratic tyranny who carries a staff of blindlight.Fester makes a brief appearance in trenchcoat and fedora, vital in the revivification of Thing, via his Frankensteinian electrode digits, thank Satan!Pleased to see season 2 is underway. It just keeps getting better.",

It felt liked the actors was doing a bad cosplay version of them.My favorite Addams character have always been Wednesday but this Wednesday was not the one I used to love. She did have some matching qualities but this Wednesday was a angsty teen most of the time.I didn't like they're trying to do a drama show of it. And the classic triangle romance drama is boring.Wednesday have said herself she doesn't want to be a housewife. I think she better of alone then in a relationship.I would have liked the series better if it wasn't the Addams in it. It's like they took the Addams family and throw in harry potter, twilight and sabrina.I loved Christina ricci and Gwendoline. The Thing was the most fun and thats saying a lot.",

Let's hope Tim Burton stays on board for the 2nd series (which there definitely will be, but wont spoil things if mot watched it yet) because I will definitely be watching it.

            "content": "With very few exceptions, people who are perceived as strange by society view themselves as normal and society as insane. When someone creates such a character without understanding this, the result is almost always awful -- it's not just that they got one thing wrong; the fact that they got it wrong shows that they don't understand what drives their character. They typically create a strawman; someone who, e.g., is cynical for the sake of itself, who couldn't justify their own behavior to others. There's no coherency to such characters, and you don't understand why they would be this way.The biggest reason this show works is because the main character avoids this trap. Far from being pointlessly cynical, her behavior is perfectly logical: there's a monster going around killing people, so she's trying to stop it. Just about everyone else is wasting time worrying about irrelevant things like teen drama, romance, social media gossip, or PR management. This is really stupid. Conversely, Wednesday is almost entirely working on the one thing that matters. This is normal. As someone who also thinks that most people's behavior is insane and stupid, I can attest that Wednesday is well written.The other reason this show is good is that it's incredibly entertaining, especially the first half of the season. It's overflowing with ideas, and most of them are pretty cool.Admittedly, Wednesay is a bit overpowered, seeing as she's impressively knowledeable about various things, speaks at least two languages, is great at fighting with and without weapons, is witty, a fantastic cello player, a ridiculously good archer, a writer, is fearless, has great will power, is highly skilled at untying knots, and is also a great dancer because why not. It's a bit much, but she's so much fun to watch that it's easy to forgive.My only real complaint (and why I'm not giving it a 9 or 10) is that the writing degrades noticeably in the second half of the season, and the finale in particular is bit weak. Everyone basically stumbles through the main plot points with the help of various deus ex machinas, much as you could see in a lesser show. But I can't be too mad because even at its worst, the show is still a lot of fun; I'd say it operates between a 6 and a 10, and a 6 on my scale is still worth watching; most shows never get there.Given the success, there's almost certainly going to be a second season, and I will almost certainly watch it.",

The characters are fleshed out and do thing for a reason and arent just stupid for the sake of the lore like in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. There is a villian or two and they are fleshed out too and not just bad for the sake of lore. Also the villiand arent overpowered like in many fantasy series so it kind of makes sense. Oh and the acting was great too. Ortega is great as Wednesday and Myers brough great contrast to the show as Enid. Also costums location and filming all great.

That aside, the season was throroughly entertaining and hope this is the beginning of a large and successful franchise reboot.",

Morticias character wasn't written well, the makeup was awful, she looked sick but not in the way they intended. I love how they showcase Christies height, she looked lovely in every scene.

Frankly, we were tired of the \"nonsense\" at the Addams house. Also interesting is the moment that not everything in the Addams family is ok and there is a conflict between a mother and a daughter who is a teenager.

            "content": "If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll definitively enjoy the series' aesthetic. Jenna Ortega is perfect for the role and you can definitively tell that she was very committed to play a perfect Wednesday.However, I believe that's pretty much everything the series gave us.First issue, the plot was kind of messy, especially the superpower / unnatural elements were pretty confused:\nWednesday's talisman could not only stimulate her visions, but also revive people from the death? Okay...The pilgrim's ghost could use dark magic (?) and Goody's ghost was still in the form of a child even though she didn't die that young considering she gave birth to Wednesday's descendants.Very neat groups with magical powers (mermaids, werewolves) and then people with random powers (the power of bringing life to things by drawing, visions, shapeshifting - speaking of which, they did the principal's death very pointless)Second, the characters and their relationships felt pretty flat: couldn't feel any connection to them which is probably because nobody had an arc except for Wednesday and her relationship with Enid and Eugene.Third, which is the main issue I have with the series: Wednesday never looked like an outcast. Everyone was complimenting her on how different she is and how she doesn't care about what other people think, when in reality she was actually always very popular, even more than the character that was supposed to be the popular one, Bianca, and even more popular than Wednesday's mother Morticia, who Wednesday always felt a disconnection with since she used to be very popular in school.Anyone who was a bit different from other people in school could probably agree on the fact that people don't really treat you that way if you are considered weird/different. That's why the story didn't really speak to me and I couldn't feel more far away from Wednesday's character.Overall a nice, iconic series, but I would not want to come back and re-watch it because it was missing an emotional connection.",

However, with that being said, for some reason it has seemed to have gained a lot of traction due to Jenna Ortega's 'instantly iconic' performance, something I personally cannot disagree much with. Though not a fan of the outcome, I think Jenna Ortega is now at the best point in her career to do this kind of role and, as shown by the over abundance of positive feedback, it was a right call to do so now. However, while Ortega tediously pulled the show along, even she could not prevent the story from dragging the show down so much. In conclusion, if you enjoy the two Addams Family movies then you will probably dislike this show even more but if you just want a chill time to relax your mind, this show will manage to do just that.",

I personally dislike Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia and I don't care for how the character is written. Luis Guzman initially put me off as Gomez, as I'm more accustomed to the bizarre yet suave versions of John Astin and Raul Julia. I've come to appreciate Guzman's version as closer to the Gomez of the original cartoons, however, and enjoyable in its own right.Highlights include Christina Ricci's appearance and performance, completely different than her turn at Wednesday, and especially Gwendoline Christie in a BRILLIANT bit of casting as Wednesday's school principal.A worthy and fun addition to the Addams canon.",

The finale reminds me of Buffy but in a bad way. The creators of Buffy were aware what they were portraying. Here the seriousness of everything just doesn't work. And everything is kind of meh all around. Predictable baddies, and a boring fight (especially when there are so many different creatures to choose from!).So all in all it's a mediocre show, with Jenna Ortega being kind of the saving grace.

I'm not personally a fan of those shows, but I have seen them and can confirm that the plot of Wednesday is simply a reorganized retelling of plot-lines from those shows.Although I didn't like the show, I know not everything is meant to appeal to everyone and so I'd rather give a mostly optimistic review for my negative experience. Some of the few ways this show exceeds those other teen dramas, is the show knowing it's simplicity, the devotion to the autumn aesthetic, some songs that are overplayed in mainstream movies but they're still good songs, and giving us a slightly different protagonist even if it's a very basic Gothic \"weird girl\" type. I can't make this review without talking about the writing, and I simply can't sugar-coat how awful the writing is. It felt like the writers intentionally inserted cliche phrases, barely researched concepts, and googled \"uncommon words\" to over-complicate very basic terms which just stood out. They put all of that into the script like a madlibs game, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and excuse it as a maybe rushed project. With how horrible the writing was, I'd like to focus the attention on how Jenna carries the bad dialogue and softens the blow making it seem not so bad with some of her delivery. She does her best to make up for the incompetent writers who did a horrible job, but she in her role, couldn't fix their short-comings. The bad writing is more apparent in the side characters who truly feel like extras due to how little character they have. Even the love interest has the personality of a plank of wood so when the forced relationship happens, the protagonist just increasingly looks dumb. There's so much more I can rant about, but I feel like I got my main conspicuous complaints off my chest.",

I have not watched the Original Addams family show so I can not speak for the OG show fandom. But I can tell you as a potterhead they really took way too much out of Harry Potter. School divided into 4 groups, sirens, werewolfs, shapeshifters, the whole scene of the rowing competition, the creepy store that reminded me of Draco's store from the 6th movie, statues moving and the secret passages. I can keep going but really they overdid it with the Harry Potter \"references\". Almost felt like a copycat show.Second, I would like to point out the characters made no sense and they were insufferable. Wednesday's acting was good but her actions made no sense. The blond girl was pretty much just used as a plot device at the end and her character was killed when she \"wolfed out\" because she pretty much did what everyone expected her to. The villains were very predictable.Bianca was the only savable character from the bunch as I think they developed her decently.Also, it wasn't clear to me which demographics this was targeted to. It seemed a teens, children, and adults show all at once. But somehow it wasn't appropriate for any.I'd say this show is nice to pass the time. Good effects kinda predictable story and good casting but don't expect good characters and story out of this.",

Enid and Wednesday contrasted each other too much for my liking and there was hardly any gray area in the characters personality.The plot was cheesy and, again, too black and white. It was not very complex and there was barely any suspense. It reminded me of a rip-off, cheesier version of Harry Potter.I think they could've turned it into a great series.That being said, I did like the special effects and sets.

They attempt to add depth to characters with their own family struggles but they ultimately don't go anywhere and most don't matter to the overarching story line. The treatment of Enid's character development particularly irks me as it is actually relevant in today's climate, despite being ham-fisted and completely lacking any nuance, and is only ruined for a cheap and quick fight. Enid's cheap fight is only bested by the embarrassingly short and bland climactic fight between Wednesday and a painfully boring resurrected Crackstone.In the end if you like The Addams Family and coming of age shows you'll at least find this enjoyable but it leaves a lot to be desired.",

Danny Elfman does it again with the music in the series, he is masterful. Loved Christina Ricci's character and thought it was a great touch to have her in the cast. I also really like the supporting cast of students. Thing was also done very well.I hated the entire casting of the family. Perhaps it's from preconceived notions in the previous actors of these roles. The chemistry between Gomez and Morticia was non existent and borderline disgusting. I get that Catherine Zeta Jones is aging, but it doesn't help when they cake on so much makeup, it makes her look older. Her acting is stiff and she just didn't pull it off. All I can see when Gomez is on screen was his character in the movie \"waiting\", he was gross in that movie and is gross in this series. Uncle Fester is way wrong, again I have Christopher Lloyds portrayal in my head as a creepy mysterious uncle.

If this series would've been called \"the adventures of goth-girl, starring Thursday Maddams\" it would've been okay, maybe a 7. But this is NOT THE Addams Family. It's a travesty. They \"harrypotterified\" the concept of The Addams Family, and almost all the characters are nothing like their counterparts from the sixties OG series or the 90s movies.And maybe because there's one key element lacking: humor. At the core of TAF, even the original cartoons, lays humor. The blunt contrast between every day \"normal\" life and people and the Addams' weirdness. And all that is completely missing in this series.The story is ok, but kind of very predictable, as it is with many products these days.The cast is almost ok, very much like the original cartoons, but there's something missing. I guess maybe Ra\u00fal Julia's Gomez settled the bar very high. This is not an argument against Luis Guzman's casting, but the characterization is very far from what we've seen in the og series and the 90s movies. It's the same with all the characters, except foe Uncle Fester and Thing, although the last one also lacks some of the humor from the originals. Jenna Ortega does a very fine job as the titular character, but she's written almost flat. Well, I mean, the original character, especially the one from the first movie is almost a punchline, and is better fleshed out in the second movie. In the end, she's just ok.Tim Burron and Danny Elfman are mere shadows of their former selves. They could've hired anyone as director and the results would've been the same. Maybe the hired em just for the weight of their names.Bottom line, this series it's just another \"big mac\". Another burger combo made for streaming. I'm baffled with so many uber positive reviews, but be it, it's ok, watch it if you want, but it's just another proof of the lack of innovation and imagination in a decaying medium, and it's consumers' taste.",

The consistently strange thing is that the students at the school for outcasts who are werewolves, sirens, ghouls and the like seem more 'normal' and freaked out by the supernatural than the actual normal folks in the neighboring town. The overall writing and overarching story line is generally pretty good but I for the most part can't stand Wednesday's on-screen presence which kind of makes watching this show a chore rather than a pleasure for me.",

It's pretty cringey and the stakes are low.Moreover, Wednesday's visions are clear as day. There is nothing vague at all, no effort of deduction required. Her visions and her peers' inputs point her directly to the next objectives, which makes for poor writing. Case in point: the revealing of the Hyde's identity. Also plot contrivances (e.g. Goody's powers in season 1's finale). The only thing that rescues this show is the cast's fantastic performance. Jenna Ortega is perfect in her role, and Emma Myers is a great counterbalance. Still, the trope is getting repetitive towards the end.

While it doesn't really have much to do with the Addams family, I appreciated this show going in a new direction with this whodunit teen drama. The show is more geared towards young adults but I think older viewers can still find entertainment in it because of the characters, mystery, and it's unique sense of humor.The Characters are very hit or miss, Jenna Ortega as Wednesday does a great job and really anchors the series. I particularly like her chemistry with her roommate Enid (played by Emma Myers). The two are polar opposites, them being assigned roommates makes for an entertaining dynamic that blossoms into friendship. I also think the casting for the entire Addams family is very good, while they don't get much screen time they nail the few scenes they get. Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester is a riot, he serves as a pleasant surprise and good comedic relief in the later episodes. Some of the characters are not so great, Tyler and Xavier are water vapor characters, they are void of any charisma and dampen the scenes they are in.I think the first few episodes of this series are quite good, they are more lighthearted and the characters get a chance to shine before the whodunit plot really kicks in. However, the last few episodes kinda fall off in terms of quality in my opinion. The show becomes to obsessed with plot twists and knocking the viewer off their trail that it fails to provide enough explanation for the villains motivations and the history of the towns feud with Nevermore and the outcasts. The amount of red herrings this script contains is obnoxious. There are multiple times where Wednesday is boldly and loudly wrong about her suspicions, which just doesn't track with a character that is shown to be much smarter than that.Overall, I think the show has enough good that it is worth the watch. I would be interested in a season 2 although hopefully this time around the writing is a little more cohesive.",

Binged it in two days. It gives Tim Burton does Harry Potter with a twist of Nancy Drew. Wednesday is completely endearing, perfectly macabre. Her one liners hit every time. I love the relationships she forms with her peers and I enjoyed the mystery of the storyline. The cast is spectacular in my opinion. Perfectly creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky.",

There are some comical moments, some outrightly silly and some dark humor, but \"this is not your father's Oldsmobile,\" as the saying goes.The casting of Ortega was magnificent. She captures the spirit of Wednesday and does display emotion sparingly and only when appropriate. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a nice Morticia. I was unhappy with Luis Guzman until Wednesday breathed a sigh of relief at his acquittal (I won't offer a spoiler about it) and said she was sure he didn't have it in him to be a murderer. The look on his face was priceless. It was an almost, \"Well, I'm happy you're happy, but I thought I was all scary and such.\" I think I laughed harder at that look than at anything else in the show.It's a good mystery, a fair bit of horror, and a good dose of dark humor and sadness mixed into a thoroughly enjoyable outing. Since it ended on a small cliffhanger, I am hoping it doesn't get the Netflix axe treatment that so many decent shows seem to be getting. I look forward to a season 2 and am eagerly awaiting to see if they can capture the same spirit they started with.",

I liked Wednesday at the beginning of this series but that feeling went went averse the closer I got to the end of the first season. She just doesn't seem genuine... for an Addams. I won't give away any spoilers but her acts throughout the episodes are conflicting the character she pretends to be. Now she just seems a teenager with Asperger syndrome rather than being a psychopath. I get it you know. They wanted to give the character Wednesday a bit more depth in her personality since a TV series runs longer than a movie but doing it the way they did it, didn't work for me.Speaking about characters. The other students at Nevermore Academy seem to be a bunch of dweebs and because of that I started to think who is this show for? I don't mind some teenage drama but this show is just filled with it in it's most simplistic form. Unfortunately it also includes the nowadays typical 'modern' inclusion propaganda that it could've gone without.It's not all bad though. The main storyline was entertaining although it got a bit boring while nearing the ending. Some details just didn't seem to match up making it sloppy. For me the thing that I perhaps liked the most was... well... Thing. It's by far the most humorous thing of the series. He might only be part man(?), or whatever he is, but somehow his appearances always seem to work out for the better.Also, according to the credits this is a Tim Burton's production but I didn't really notice much if anything of his influence.

It's lacking in any sort of tension, which is a key ingredient of both horror and comedy, the two genres this is working to fit in.Visually it's broadly uninspired. A few neat choices but most of the set design, costume design, lighting, and cinematography is undistinguishable from any other teen drama.The characters and their relationships are much in the same vein as everything else. Wednesday herself feels very edgy for the sake of edgy, lacking in any clear motivation for her actions and feelings once the real meat of the episode starts. This is fine for her as part of a broader ensemble, but not as the lead in a showNotably, on all of these issues, the show is inferior to the very similar \"Sabrina\" show on Netflix.The show, especially with Burton directing, feels like it would have excelled with a more satiracle or post modern type approach, like the one he brought to much of his work in the 90s and 00s.The pilot does not provide a compelling argument to keep watching.

            "content": "While this series has an attractive visual styling and a line up of quirky characters, any novelties wear out by 5th episode when you already know them well enough (the characters are all shallow, so it doesn't take much to see them through). This is because there is nothing else original in the story. The narrative is extremely linear with Wednesday moving from one clue to the next one sequentially. Each clue she takes on with full confidence in it and with no reflection on how she was wrong previously. Each time the next clue is conveniently revealed when enough trouble is caused by pursuing the previous clue. Like every teeny movie, the main theme here is how 13 year olds already have enough knowledge, life experience, and stronger confidence in themselves to navigate the relationships, solve crimes, and talk down to elder family members while the adults are always either buffoons or narrow minded participants with limited ability to contribute to the situation. There is obligatory, but luckily not overbearing, incorporation of modern gender diversity and inclusion agenda. The rest of the show's stuffing is recycled from popular fiction and previous teeny shows. At times you can confuse this for the \"best of\" Hunger Games, Twilight, Harry Potter, Riverdale, and you name it... mixed together. I mean this show would surely be epic for your teenager, as it must have influenced Kamila Valieva to dedicate her last year's ice routine to this show. Uncharacteristically for Kamila the ice routine was rather bland, so I watched the show to see, if it would give more dimension to it, but it didn't. I will just have to wait for a new Kamila's routine with the hope that it will be inspired by something better than Wednesday Season 2.",

It's not a reimagining of The Addams Family, it is truly Wednesday's story!! The school, the cast and the plot are absolutely delightful. Tim Burton is a genius and I am 100% ready for a season 2.",

Gomez Addams was never a repulsively ugly and creepy character. The original Gomez may not have been insanely handsome, but he wasn't repulsive. He was debonair, suave and still good looking. He didn't make you cringe when he obsessively fawned over Morticia. This actor is just slimy, creepy and repulsive for this role.As far as Pugsley goes, I have nothing against the actor. He seems fine. What I have an issue with is the writing of his character being emotional and weak. Pugsley was never a crybaby. I fully expect this to be dark and twisted (after all, it IS Burton and that IS what the public craves) so it should be well done. I just can't bring myself to keep watching Guzman in this role.",

            "content": "Everyone all over the internet seems to absolutely love the new Netflix show Wednesday. It has incredibly positive reviews and it is currently trending on TikTok with people dressing up as the titular character and dancing to the choreography of the now iconic dance scene (although for some reason on a speed up version of Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, rather than the original song??? I really do not understand the internet).All of this leaves me baffled and confused, like as if I have watched a completely different show than everybody else. The show, in my opinion, is just not very good. Or better, it's just really bad.From the butchering of the main themes of the original Addams family, to the ridiculous storyline, the predictable writing, the cringy dialogue, the acting (exception made for Jenna Ortega's Wednesday, which literally carries the show), the dull love triangle, the teenage drama, I could go on forever.But let's tackle this one issue at a time.Let's start by talking about the original Addams family. The whole point of the Addams family was to satirize and completely invert the trope of the perfect ideal American family. To do so, the original comic book (and the subsequent 60s tv show and 90s films) sets this family of \"outcasts\" (as the show likes to call them), where everyone dresses in black, is pale, has fascination for the macabre, and simply doesn't care about what society thinks or expect of them, in the most normal place you could think of: the suburbs. And that is where the strength of the original saga comes from: this contrast between the seemingly perfect American family, where everyone is preoccupied with their appearance and how society perceives them, hiding how secretly unhappy they are, and this grim loving family where between torture and grave digging, everyone is happy and loves and cares for one another.The Wednesday show however decided to take a different route, by placing the titular character away from her family, in a special school for outcasts. However, by placing Wednesday in a school full of werewolves, vampires, sirens, and other clich\u00e9 monsters from \"The Monster Mash\", she just loses her spark. Are we really supposed to believe that literal monsters are scared and weirded out by a regular girl who dresses in black, doesn't blink often and sometimes plays the cello? For this reason, and since I guess the original sociopath with murdering tendencies was too boring for Tim Burton, the writing team decided to give her a superpower: the ability to randomly see the future when she least expects it, just like in the much better \"That's so Raven\" (good job Mr. Burton!).Changing the setting however wasn't enough for them, so they decided to insert some drama in the family, to spice things up: a secret murder backstory for the beloved Gomez and Morticia, who lack any trace of chemistry (unrelated but I had to point it out), and by adding an unnecessary conflict between Wednesday and her mother. And for what concerns the last point, I have seen many people defending it by saying \"she's a teenager, every teenager has conflict with their parents at that age. It's perfectly normal family dynamics\". But that is exactly where the problem is: the Addam's family, by definition, is the opposite of normal, so this classic teenage drama and rebelliousness doesn't really fit the character.But let's move on to the storyline, shall we?To keep it simple, Wednesday gets sent by her parents to this school of outcasts, where a monster is on the loose, killing both students and normies (that's how the show refers to regular people). Among this chaos, Wednesday has a vision of impending doom, having to turn herself into a hero and investigate in order to save the school, while dealing with school drama and a love triangle, where she has to choose between a boring and plain white guy that vaguely looks like Evan Peters, and another boring and plain white guy that also vaguely looks like Evan Peters, but with slightly longer hair (Oh boy, can't wait to see who she ends up choosing). All of this is accompanied by some of the cringiest dialogues I have ever witnessed, gifting us with lines such as:\"Wow, you're in black and white... Like a living Instagram filter\"\n\"When I look at you, the following emojis come to mind. Rope. Shovel. Hole.\"\n\"You're just kind of kooky\" \"I prefer spooky\".The plot is extremely predictable, including its numerous alleged twists, and it culminates in an extremely silly battle that looks as if it came out straight from a Disney channel original movie, with a zombie pilgrim from the 1600 who vouched to burn all outcasts, who uses his magic staff to try to burn the school down. Wait, but if he can use magic, doesn't that make him and outcast too? Also in the flashback he didn't really use magic, or am I wrong? And what was the point of reanimating him anyways? I don't know and I simply don't get it.One more thing and then I swear I'll be done. This is more of a pet peeve of mine, so it's not really a big deal, but it still really bothers me. Thanks to Wednesday's vision, the show introduces us to an Addams family's ancestor from 400 years ago: Goody Addams (yes, I agree, it's a really silly name). The whole witch thing and vision powers is implied to come from Morticia's side of the family, which is also the main reason of the conflict between the two. It's Morticia the only other person in the family that has visions. It's Morticia that gives Wednesday additional information on this ancestor. It's Morticia that gives her the magic amulet that later, with the help of Goody, will save Wednesday's life.But Morticia's last name is not Addams, it's Frump. So I guess she got the witch power from both her mom and her dad? Couldn't they simply make her an ancestor from the mother side, to fit the storyline that they wrote more? Also, I find it hard to believe that they managed to maintain the same family name for 400 years. Especially, considering that Goody is a woman, and we live in a patriarchal society were we take our father's name. Did the writers thought that if they gave her different last name, or no last name at all and just called her Goody to make it simpler, the audience would have been too stupid to understand that they were related? Even though the character in the flashback is played by the same actress? I know it's a stupid hill to die on, but it really bothers me.That said, the show manages to not be a complete disaster simply because of Jenna Ortega's performance, who as I said before, literally carried the show. She really managed to portrait a more mature and emotional version of the character without losing the essence. And considering the script she was given, she did an absolutely phenomenal work, especially in the dance scene, which was truly iconic. Thanks to her, and her alone, a show that would have been completely unwatchable, turned into mediocre but easy to binge series, raising the rating from 2/10 to a 4.5/10. So, koodos to her.P. S. Having a subplot about a girl failing to turn into a werewolf and therefore failing her parents expectations, who want to send her to a conversion camp, implying a clear parallelism with being gay in a conservative family, to later have her suddenly and randomly turn into a werewolf just for the thrill of a final battler is kind of shitty.",

I don't know whose Wednesday this is, but I don't recognize her mannerisms, actions, nor aesthetic.The beauty of the Addams Family was that it was an eccentric family living in the normal world. So choosing to place her in a school for outcasts defeats the whole point. What was anyone thinking while making this?Love Jenna Ortega as an actress, but her face is too conventionally beautiful to be Wednesday. They should have casted someone with a quirkier look and essence. She relied on these Gen-Z esque quips to show how eccentric and cold she is. Television and movies seem to have lost the art of \"show, don't tell.\"Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman were so unsexy, I don't recognize them as Morticia and Gomez. No chemistry.What's with the teen romance being so prominent here? In Addams Family Values, Wednesday and the outcast boy like each other at the end, but it was more organic, not shoved down our throats from the beginning.However, aside from this baffling portrayal of Wednesday and the family, it is a well made show. I was able to finish watching the series. So if you like teen shows of the 2010s and beyond, you'll enjoy this. I do not like this category, so I personally hated this show.Also, it was extremely predictable. Good luck!",

Sure, it was ridiculous and completely unearned when it comes to setup, but it was fun and outrageous. Furthermore, it was quite unreasonable of either of the boys to expect a romantic relationship from her when she gave no indication of liking them at all. Honestly, they barely interact enough for any real feelings the boys could have to be believable. If they had actually put in some effort when writing the romance, it could have been intense and weird in the best way possible, but for that to happen, Wednesday would need to be a version of herself who's capable of putting herself out there for romantic love. She not only lacks the vulnerability required for satisfying romantic development, but she also seems to actively dislike the idea of romantic love. This is exactly what would make her the perfect asexual character, it proves that there is nothing wrong with not experiencing sexual or romantic feelings, you can still care about people and be a good person, but on your own terms. To me, there is nothing more Wednesday than to be yourself regardless of what people think you should be, so when they tried to push this onto her, it felt uncomfortable and wrong.

It feels like towards the end of the season, the writers had to \"fill in the blanks\" with some spontaneous additions.

Ortega's performance as Wednesday was incredible, and even characters like Enid (played by Emma Myers) were in my eyes well acted.The atmosphere throughout the season was amazing! It was dark and depressing, and really show a great evolution of Wednesdays emotions. It was also funny at times. Caught myself smiling at some of the one liners, and honesty of Wednesday as a character.If we are gonna point some fingers however, the love triangle with Tyler (Hunter Doohan) and Xavier (Percy White) were extremely weak, and the characters were very under developed.

It's a nice addition to the Addam Family's legacy \ud83d\udda4It was truly a delight to watch the amazing Gwendoline Christie play Larissa Weems. Her scenes with Wednesday were my absolute favorite. I love them & they both got my whole heart after their magical performances.When I heard that Christina Ricci had been added to the cast, I was so happy & her performance as Marilyn Thornhill were pure brilliance.Other favorites of mine from this series are Enid, Thing, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier, Tyler, Yoko & Ajax. I really hope we'll get a season 2, so we can see more of these wonderful characters.This might not be to everyone's liking but I really enjoyed watching it & totally recommend you to give it a try!",

My only wish would be to have a better world-building, because it is almost non-existent here outside of the plot-related stuff. Maybe people more familiar with Addams' lore can better navigate it, but I have quite a few open questions about the world.Regardless, Ortega was good in the role, and I certainly would not mind another season. Luckily, the ending does suggest a possibility for one. Would not surprise me if it will get 3rd season, too.",

            "content": "The show started as yet another great depiction of Addams family. This time we focus on, arguably, the most interesting character of the family. We get great references, amazing set ups, good plot, great cast. One thing bothers me though - why does each and every male character on the show is either a coward, a prime a-hole, a submissive wuss, or purely incompetent (even at the things he is allegedly known to be good at).Gomez was a big disappointment. In all other shows & movies he was a loving husband and father, but here he is a blob without an agency. To tell you the truth, despite grotesque attitude and attire, Gomez for me was the first an example from TV of a man who is a peer, an equal partner, to his woman, an understanding and deeply caring father to his children. Well, not in this show.But the list doesn't stop on Gomez. Tyler - incompetent even in one job he does, proven by Wednesday. Xavier - arrogant a-hole, also incompetent in archery and incapable of rowing faster than a female, proven by Wednesday. Ajax - clueless, submissive simpleton. Lucas - tall, athletic man that can't hold a fight with 2 of his buddies against 45 kg woman, also a prime a-hole. Pugsley - \"would not survive without me\" as Wednesday says. In the 60s series the Addams siblings were a great duo, each doing their own thing but complementing each othervin the end. Why does this show's Pugsley have to be submissive bug like that?Separate shout out for two one-scene characters that really bothered me:\nHomeless man who lived in a burned building who Wednesday beat to kick out of the place. He seemed like an ordinary, poor, homeless guy, who would probably just leave for a few hours if offered $10 or some food. Why did Wednesday have to \"establish dominance\" over the poor fella? I don't really see the point. If she paid him or gave food, I think it'd have shown that under all that grim darkness Wednesday still had some empathy left.Enid's dad. Why is he a \"beta\" in his own \"pack-family\"? Why can't he be a partner to his wife, like it is with most groups of wolves in the wild? It was a giant missed opportunity to include one wholesome male character. The wolf daddy could have stood up to the oppressive wife protecting his beloved daughter.Overall, I wanted to give this show 8 but for the terrible male depiction I subtract 2 stars.",

            "content": "What Chilling Adventures of Sabrina COULD'VE BEEN. (i'm joking obviously)It's like Tim Burton watched Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (Part 1, the only part of that show that's worth watching) and said to himself \"I can do A LOT BETTER!\" And he SUCCESSFULLY did.The similarities are as follows: Pilgrims. Witches. And pilgrim witches. A look into a strange past involving pilgrims burning witches. Visions. Visits from spirits. Ghosts. A boarding school in the woods for supernatural students. Outside a small town that is mostly toxically patriarchal, filled with small-minded town folk who just want to appear accepting in a shallow way, while covering up/just forgetting their history with teenage boys being bullies and causing problems. A strange and mysterious destiny that seems inescapable to the female protagonist who believes they are evil or might become evil in the near future. The female protagonist has a very supportive family. The female protagonist has a complicated relationship with their mother (or mother-figure). The female protagonist has a teacher that is even more supportive, telling her whatever she wants to hear in an obviously grooming her kind-of-way. The female protagonist rejects \"normal\" and has no real interest in s*x/physical relations in the way her family has taught her. The female protagonist likes to do things and handle problems ALONE, but will put her friends/loved ones in mortal danger. Takes her loved ones/friends for granted a bit. She likes to challenge authority. Witch hunters. A love interest that is a normal boy who helps her although he doesn't know much about the supernatural, what she's planning and is also somewhat afraid/spooked of the supernatural with a dead mother and strained relationship with his father, and for whatever reason seems to be interested in the female protagonist. A semi-love triangle with normal boy (who wears a lot of plaid) and a boy who's not normal, immediately interested in the female protagonist, popular, strange and suspicious. A mean girl who has a history with the supernatural love interest, is in choir and whom becomes an ally. A best friend to the protagonist who has her own struggles but is mostly positive and is also supernatural. In the end something supernatural happens that makes the protagonist \"fall out of love\"/walk away from the plaid-wearing love interest and returns to strange and suspicious love interest who is \"more her kind\". Oh, and a brother (or brother-figure) that the female protagonist is close to. And a sidekick who will help her with whatever, especially spying, and is not human.End of joke.LOVED this show. I was surprised to see that Morticia Addams was a little less darker than I'm used to, and also she doesn't speak French. And the whole family is Latino (?) I think.The whole cast is very talented. I do hope that this isn't one more show that Netflix goes \"oh the cast isn't completely/mostly white? Well we can replace that with something else, we're sure it won't be missed.\" THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE. For the sake of the baby goths of the future generations (joke) but no seriously, I really hope there will be a season 2.The only real flaw was that it wasn't longer (felt a bit rushed near the end), but Netflix rarely gives more than 8 episodes to something with a big budget like this one. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SEASON 2 WILL BE PICKED UP QUICKLY, and maybe contains more than 8 episodes this time.I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.",

Jenna did a great job, as did a few others. It was mostly because of the terrible writing. But also wrong casting. I didn't think any of the other actors of the Addams family fit the characters. But maybe they would have done a better job if the material and directing was actually good. I'll never know though. I just thought it felt like they were play-acting.. not like they actually inhabited the roles.I didn't like how all the male characters were basically portrayed the same. None of them were particularly interesting personality wise.The value of the production made me feel like I was watching Riverdale with a dash of Legacies.. I gave the whole season a fair shot.

It's heartwarming to see that such a cult classic got such a good treatment.Tim Burton's style is present as expected and fits the series perfectly.I hope this Serie gets more seasons, but I'm almost certain it will when I look at the overwhelming feedback.Cheers to Netflix, I almost lost hope in you, but here you are giving me one of my favorite series in years!",

As one who grew up watching the television series The Adam's Family in the late 60's early 70's! This was a grand slam! The writing is amazing! The cast is superb, leaving little to no room for you not to simply be totally emerged with each and every character. Jenna Ortega hands down is brilliant as Wednesday Adams, quirky, quick witted and cute, rolled up into one. Congratulations Netflix!!!",

            "content": "The villain doesn't make sense. I'm not good with names... So the botanist. The botanist may have a valid reason to not want outcasts around. Maybe they are dangerous and a threat to normies. Playing devil's advocate, maybe she's right. But, since she works in the school for outcasts, couldn't she find a way to kill them herself? Why try to conjure up an ancestor to do it for her? Next, if she's against outcasts, it's because they're a threat and a danger to normies. So, isn't she breaking her own code and logic by manipulating an outcast into killing people for her? Her ideals aren't aligning properly.The show was cute with the macabre attitude of Wednesday and her, I don't care what you think attitude. But, the show overplayed their hand. They also over did the theme and message to the point it got overdone and tiring. Every episode seemed to over emphasize her macabre attitude, how she doesn't care if people hate her and she's alone, her social skills, her as an outcast, her evolution as a social being. Those are good things to explore but they did it in a too blatant way. Too forced way. Overbearing way. And a one note way. Basically, it got old and tiring really fast. It's really hard to be an outcast. They could have explored this topic in a more meaningful way rather than a one note, overdone way.Wednesday seemed to care about people being murdered and solving murders. Then why do many jokes any murder like she doesn't care? Those macabre jokes were cute, but got old and one note quickly.Just saying they needed to diversify the portfolio. Sometimes the acting in the show was bad.I feel like the jokes, message were to one dimensional and also too forced.The show was also trying to be to funny but also emotionally meaningful. I think they failed in both slightly. The show could have had much more depth.I also feel like the plot was good in a way, but also too forced. It is hard to describe what I mean. I watch a lot of Asian TV shows, and no offense to Western writers, but the plots are often much, much better in some Asian shows.The plot was good in this show, but it felt like they were trying really hard to get it there. Very forced and not developing and flowing in a cool and natural way.Other than that, the show was good. It was well made and had good ambiance. I liked the atmosphere. Very surprising ending.",

The dialogue between the students can be a little off, but Gen Z is a hard demographic to write for if you're not us. I get that, so I give it a pass.The other reason I can see people disliking the writing for this show is the campiness (a.k.a. Corniness). I personally didn't have an issue, as I feel like that's still pretty true to the Addams' Family tone.Now, for the stuff I feel is good. Firstly, hats absolutely off to the casting crew; y'all did fantastic. I don't think there was a bad performance in here (maybe with the exception of Luis Guzm\u00e1n, but he still did okay). Jenny Ortega was brilliant as Wednesday and I can't think of a better actor after having watched.The set design was absolutely wonderful, specifically within Nevermore. I do also love the juxtaposition of a vaulted-ceiling castle with small town America; I feel it adds a good contrast and reasoning for some character decisions.The soundtrack and score bring a brilliant mix of classical, macabre, haunting to a fundamentally teen story, with good taste in song choice to match.The general plot and mystery of the whole season gripped me. There was a solid mix of clues that let you hypothesize and try to solve it alongside Wednesday, both from maguffins and cinematic cues. It kept me guessing the whole time, and questioning when things didn't necessarily line up. Overall, a genuinely satisfying mystery to watch unravel.I loved this show, and I'll be waiting with baited breath.",

I really don't think they could have chosen a better actress to portray Wednesday.My only real issue would have been Gomez.. Now don't get me wrong, I really like Luis Guzman but he just didn't seem like the right Gomez, for me. I think of Gomez as tall, slim & handsome like the original character. When I see Luis Guzman, I think of Shameless, not Gomez Addams.. So I think they could have done a little better with casting in that area, but Luis is a good actor so it wasn't completely bombed.I hope to see more Pugsley in future episodes. And I also hope that Wednesday doesn't turn too mushy in future seasons, that would just kill her entire character! It would be cool to see her rub off some of her dryness onto Enid or other characters, just to spice it up a bit, but not too much so she still stands out like a sore thumb.",

The show had a strong start and then mediocre attempts to keep you engaged, for me at the very least started everything to fell apart somewhere after the episode 6.Now, there is a lot of promising material lay out for season 2and the character building and characters have not disappointed but this show is not all about that, it has overarching plot that needs to be handled better.Another thing is the whole we have all this supernatural beings and casters, but we are not sure how to handle them, as in trying to keep everything mundane, while undeniably dance at the edge or magical.It just doesn't work. Second, we need more context of the world around. Like, more about outcasts and normies, how exactly do they come to live together in some sort of neutral agreement and etc. More about Nevermore, the show totally missed the spot there.I get it, majority watch this as plot around one of their favorite family members, that is makeshift Elena Sherlock, but seriously though it won't hold for long and the show needs more subsistence if it is to continue with more seasons (and it has potential, as far as producer's imagination goes really)For me this was fun to watch for most part but it left conflicted and not so much engaged. At the end, i didn't really care about unsolved mysteries, it didn't grip me to hold my breath until the next season, for no other reason than how awful last two episodes were and how sloppy 'curtains are down' reveal wasn't handled (not to mention cliche)",

She breathes life into this complex character, and her performance throughout the entire series never once disappointed.Overall, this series has to be one of my new favourites, and I would most definitely recommend this series to anyone who is even the slightest interested in the Addams Family. It surely won't disappoint.",

Her playing on instrument, dance, facial expressions adds an additional layer to the show. One of the best castings of all time, if you've seen her in the role, you can't even imagine someone else. She has a bright future ahead of her.The jokes, vibe and atmosphere are particular, the story is better than average, but it has flaws.

With Tim Burton this seemed like it should have been a perfect match of artist and muse, but the trailers had me concerned.I still find the casting of the majority of the Addams family as the biggest disservice to the series, but they play such brief supporting roles that it allowed Jenna Ortega to be the primary focus and do an excellent portrayal of an older Wednesday Addams.Thanks to the amount of screen time she was allotted, there was ample time to overcome the odd casting choices of the rest of the family. The writing was also exactly what I expected for the character, cold and sharply cutting quick-witted rebuttals that Ortega delivers with the emotional vacancy needed to fit the role.The overarching story is a simple \"who dun it?\" plot that limited the chances of being exposed to plot holes while serving as a vehicle to explore the expanded setting with.All new characters are pretty much high school tropes, even falling into nicknamed cliques and social circles based on what kind of spooky monsters they are, but thankfully Burton dialed back the teen drama that tends to ruin shows like Cobra Kai.I still can't get over the fact that Gomez looks like a meth dealer, and Morticia went from being agelessly regal to looking old and tired. Overall, it still succeeds in being entertaining and accomplishing what it wanted to, with enough plots lingering in the background for more seasons. Each episode had a lot going for it, making them feel longer than they were.",

            "content": "There is a good show here, one that probably takes itself a bit too seriously. I don't remember the original movies or the cartoon trying to flesh out the goofy Addams Family world with so much world lore and characters' backstory. The more serious tone and its infrequent goofiness are not entirely unappealing. But to me, it does not feel like an Addams Family show. It feels more like Tim Burton's take on Lemony Snicket's A series of Unfortunate Events with a hint of Netflix's Sabrina. That's a compliment, as strange as that sounds. I liked it more than I thought I would. Is this particular story something I believe would occur in the Addams Family world? Sure. After all, it is a strange, supernatural world centered around a weird family. As for the characters, Gomez, Morticia, and Pugsley sadly do not behave like their comic/movie counterparts. Their personalities have been trimmed and updated for \"modern sensibilities.\" It's not great, but it doesn't hurt the show much. Thankfully, Wednesday, the titular character, is very likable. Also, the music in the show is okay. Nothing spectacular. I wish they had used the iconic Addams Family theme song more generously. The show's opening barely hints at it.Netflix's Wednesday can be a fun show when its writers allow it to be. To clarify: the Addams Family franchise is satire. Getting preachy with satirical works is detrimental to the 'satire' part of the works. Netflix writers have a bad habit of writing insufferably preachy dialogue. So naturally, there are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in the show. Fortunately, Tim Burton does a fantastic job directing the first four episodes. Coincidentally, those four episodes have the least amount of cringe. The other four are entertaining, but you can tell the difference between the first four and the latter four's pacing and direction. Season 1's finale is weak but not entirely irredeemable despite its cliffhanger ending. I hope Tim Burton can direct more eps in season 2, possibly the entirety of season 2. That would certainly give him more control over the show.",

            "content": "Let's be clear - this is not a good show on it's own merit. If you're looking for just a reasonably on point entry into the franchise though, you could definitely do worse. But you also could do alot better.The show captures the Addams style of morbid humor quite well. It's not as funny or well executed as the Sonenfeld movies, or even the original TV series, but there are definite moments where it feels like an Addams show.But the acting choices for almost all of the Addams' themselves feels like the casting director wasn't really trying. Wednesday herself deadpans every line, but lacks the mischievous spark Ricci gave her. Luis Guzman's Gomez has none of the delight of Raul Julia's version. Zeta-Jones's Morticia may have been the best, but was also the most put to shame in comparison to Angelica Huston's masterful portrayal. And Fester...what a waste of our time.Most of the supporting characters are similarly uninteresting. The standout exception is Enid, Wednesday's werewolf roomate who is delightful as a character clearly designed to be the opposite of Wednesday is every way. The headmaster is of course played by the famous Game of Thrones actress, and she's competent, but in a role that gives her little to work with besides being the generic stern headmaster that every show has.Ricci plays a the villain which I called from the word jump...not because I deciphered clever clues...the show really isn't providing you with a mystery to solve. That would require effort from writers. Rather Wednesday will decipher it based mostly on visions, coincidences, and giant neon signs that read 'Clue' that show up from time to time in the form of convenient pictures and stories and the like. No, I predicted Ricci as the villain because it would be the most cliche move...and that's exactly what the writers did.Speaking of our villain, she gets almost no characterization until the final episode, depriving her of any real chance to shine. It is often said that you can't have a great hero without a great villain...and in this show we have neither.Even the setup for the series disappoints. By making the show focus around Wednesday away from home, we deprive ourselves of the chance to build on the core family of the Addams', the characters we care about. As bad as the acting choices were, perhaps if they'd been given better and more material one or more of them might have won me over eventually.The Harry Potter-style boarding school where monsters and freaks are sent seems like a strange choice for worldbuilding. The humor of the Addams' is grounded in how strange they are. So why make them LESS strange by setting up a world with werewolves, sirens, vampires, and gorgons? And why those specific races? Why not have each child be a part of a race that feels rare. By having multiples of each around, they each feel proportionally less special. Enid's subplot of being unable to transform is made less interesting by the fact that she's surrounded by other wolves. The Siren girl is made less interesting, in part by being introduced as the MOST generic 'popular overachiever b-tch' character the writers could dream up even though the idea of a family of Siren grifters might have had legs if better developed. Instead, they introduced the subplot and instantly threw it away.This pattern repeats over and over. Most of the ideas in the show are as unoriginal as you could possibly imagine, and the few original or interesting takes....tend to get underdeveloped or mishandled. Enid stands out as the one exception, and yet even she ends up in the generic place of turning wolf right when the plot needs her to. How great would it have been if she turned into a sort of were-poodle? Like even her wolf form was cute?So look - is the show terrible? No. I made it through the full first season as I write this, and I wouldn't have done that if it was terrible. But it's really mundane paint-by-number writing with just the most cash-a-paycheck acting imaginable from all but a couple of the actors. There are better shows. And there are worse shows.",

While I like this actor, I don't feel he was a good fit for this character. Not sure how the casting director came to pick him; there had to be other actors who tried out. Fortunately, his character has a minimal role.Jenna Ortega completely steals the show with just enough darkness, dark humor, and goth romance to keep the show captivating.",

However I believe that the rest of the season makes up for it, especially the ending which I would had never guessed and is an ultimate finish to one of the best and most creative bits of work that Tim burton has produced, if it were not for the beginning i believe more people would have watched and I personally would give it 10/10.",

Overall, the best part of the show was Jenna Ortega's acting, somehow pulling of her own unique interpretation of Wednesday while still remaining consistent with the source material. Another positive was how the atmosphere of the show felt comfortable to me, almost Harry Potter like. The side characters were a little bit hit or miss, with characters like Bianca showing excellent development and Enid being the most entertaining character, however, the love interest Xavier and Tyler felt unnecessary and annoying. The story itself was passable, though predictable for a mystery centered show. The reveals were pretty predictable from the beginning but the show was still fun enough and had interesting world building to carry it. I am excited for a second season but I hope they focus more on lore then on romance, unless they somehow improve their romance writing (and I'm sorry but making Enid her love interest probably won't improve it that much)",

But back the positives, some characters were interesting and I wanted to see more of them, guessing who the villain could be was also I fun spoof that even though it has been many times was still compelling. The actual Addams family were a highlight for me, every time they were all on screen I could not get enough of t\nhem. This is small but added to my enjoyment, the gore was a nice addition.Now for the negatives (they are more prominent then the positives)\nThe story was boring and times and couldn't tell what this show wanted to be. Did it want to be a mystery or a high school drama? Like I said before I liked the cliffhangers but they were quickly forgot about thus leading to disappointment and asking myself \"what was the point\" a lot especially at the middle/boring sections. Some of the characters e.g most of the boys were boring and bland. I cannot remember his name but the boy with the snake hair made me want to turn the show off.Overall it was a good show and good concept that failed (in my eyes) bc of not being able to choose a direction and having two levels of characters; really good and really bad.",

            "content": "Went through the whole first season, here's what I got (no spoilers):There is an obvious and deliberate through story. I would call this more of a mini series instead of just a series. Without spoilers, I did guess the main end reveal in the very first episode.The production design is awesome and I believe it was only the first couple of episodes that Tim Burton directed and it showed. That is what I gave the 6/10 for. Had it not been for that I would have given the first season a 4. Here's the problem; the entire through-plot could have been any series, any characters, any time and place, and anywhere. The plot has nothing inherently specific to do with the Adams family I know from the television series and the movie in the 90s. It's so random. The entire plot could service a western, could have been an episode of magnum PI, could have been a movie about a cult, or could have been an episode of saved by the bell. That's my main problem with this series. It felt like someone submitted a story concept with outlines to Hollywood, then shelved it, then attached the Adams family to it at a letter date, changed some character specific plot devices and called it a day.The series is nice to watch, is gorgeous, and has serviceable acting. The Wednesday characters seems like she is on the bleeding edge of straying from character type and just being a normal trope that progresses the plot as described above. I would like to see Jenna Ortega is a few more things before attributing her performance as unintentionally wooden. It's the same problem with Brent Spiner playing data in Star Trek TNG, is he good at playing a robot, or just a good actor in general?The roommate is useless and does nothing in the entire series except for the last moment. But she still had nothing to do with the series. You could have taken her out and nothing the driving the plot would have been sacrificed. There is absolutely no reason for Christina Ricci to be in this series other than fan service, she does nothing, although she gave me a little (fleeting) chuckle in the last episode.Is it entertaining? Absolutely. If you're here for Christina Ricci then skip it, if you're here for the Adams family, skip it, if you're here for rehashed tropes of Harry Potter, twilight, and stranger things, all a lot better and more original source material, then you're good.",

Sure, let's give it a try.Without any real spoilers, the premise of the show is Wednesday Adams being forced to sign up for a boarding school for monsters. The plot is essentially a watered down monster harem anime meets Scooby Doo. A mystery is set up and it's explored with some average quality writing.There are a handful of spot on gags that genuinely made me smile, they are the exception rather than the norm, but they were still good enough to be memorable. Detracting from the well done jokes are a few pretty annoying identity politics references that are out of place enough to stick out oddly. Keep politics out of entertainment please.So far, I would have probably given the show a mediocre 4 stars due to very uneven writing. However, Jenna Ortega absolutely, positively, amazingly grabs the screen. She portrays her character excellently, delivers the humor, and happens to be a very beautiful person. She is everything good about this show and grabs the screen so well that she makes an otherwise mediocre Netflix show worth watching.Writing, plot, pacing: 4/10\nJenna Ortega 10/10\nOverall score: 6/10.",

It is hilariously funny with all the normal Tim Burton spooky-kookyness as well as a great cast and brilliant story. I did, however, pretty much guess the monster and the master twist, but it did not dampen my enjoyment of this show. I am thoroughly looking forward to the second season which is forthcoming this year. I wonder if we'll get to see Cousin It?! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who grew up watching The Addams Family films or shows!",

The Addams are one of my favorite of all time and Tim Burton directing is a need to see!!!!The story is about Wednesday adventures, a book story to be published. The \"friends\" Wednesday have and the past stories she discover were great. Some mystery to solve and some lives to save.Nevermore Academy is a good theme for monsters and outcast to ensure more chapters in this series.I really recommend this series and enjoy watching it.

It's called ADR, or Automated Dialogue Replacement. Most people never notice it if it's done well, but I gotta tell you, this was bad. You shouldn't need ADR in simple scenes between two people in a quiet room. It's almost like the sound guy called out most days.Having said that, this was a fun PG-13 watch. Adults should stop giving it so much praise tho, it's for kids. And I agree that Luis Guzman is grossly miscast. You would think tons of actors wanted that role, so why Burton cast him is beyond me.

Jenna Ortega in the of character Wednesday Addams just feels tailor made for the role. The character has a proper arc as the story progresses. All the supporting actors were very good & my favourite is Emma Myers playing Enid. She's too cute to watch on screen. My another favourite supporter is 'Thing'. The theme music is very good & I thoroughly enjoyed the background score.Felt a little bored at some portions during the series which are manageable to pass on & the climax face-off wasn't as great as it was hyped in the previous episodes.",

However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.My favorite character is Larissa Weems, the principal of Nevermore Academy and a former student who was roommates with Morticia Addams because she seems to care for Wednesday and wants to help her but is secretly using her for her own motives to get what she wanted.

I didn't feel enough tension in most of the episodes, and at some point you start to realize that anything can happen in Wednesday's favor, which is a shame.

            "content": "Wednesday is a show about... well Wednesday. Christina Ricci stole our hearts as Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family and The Addams Family Values as its sequel so it comes to no surprise the franchise is brought back. The children of the Addams Family had a lot of screen time in the original movies so we are quite used to their perspective.In this series Wednesday joins a school for \"outcasts\" or more specifically for people with special abilities. Think Vampires, Werewolves, Sirines. The usual fantasy trope types resurface here. The show reminded me a lot of Harry Potter. It's a school setting with magical beings and magical things. It's obviously not as good as Harry Potter, but it kind of felt similar to me.You cannot watch this show and not try to make a comparison with Christina Ricci's Wednesday. And although Jenna Ortega tries her best I don't think there's anyone on this planet that can beat Christina. Her character superficially seems similar, but Jenna displays a more emotional version where instead of mischief we get anger and instead of cold stares we get anger and instead of a slight hint of superiority we get anger. Wednesday seems very angry at everything for some reason and it doesn't really help. Only sometimes do we see hints of the real Wednesday, such as the statue and Cello scene. Or the Piranhas scene at the start of the first episode.The men, as per the usual in Hollywood pictures nowadays where women take a lead role are all very weak losers that cannot do anything right. Pugsley her brother needs constant saving because he can't do anything himself. The original was never very smart, but he definitely wasn't a wussy. Her father turned into a short, ugly and obese waste of space instead of the \"zorro\"-esque lover boy from the movies. The two appointed boys thrown in for Wednesday to be attracted to are both annoying and weak. On top of it all Wednesday painfully misuses the terms patriarchy, mansplaining and gaslighting when she doesn't get her way. It's all put in to make her appear independent and strong, while in reality it makes her play the victim. It doesn't suit Wednesday at all. But Hollywood cannot make a show with a female lead without complaining about men or how they are suppressed (even if those things are wrong or irrelevant).Storywise what's weird is that Wednesday seems very sure of her ventures and in an effort to get her way turns everyone against her and seems confused (and angry) as to why this happens. Also it's fairly easy to derive what's going on from a viewers perspective and by episode 2 you should have a firm idea of what's going on and who did what. It's all very very obvious. Yet you'll have to sit through 6 more episodes of Wednesday fumbling in the dark before she gets it. For how smart Wednesday is supposed to be she does come of very painfully stupid in this show. Which is a good thing maybe for her character development? It otherwise feels like a mismatch for her character. The original Wednesday Addams had plenty of character flaws already.The true star of the show is Thing. The hand that does it all. Has the best character, the best interactions. I think a series without Thing would be very mundane for sure. A honorary mention to Emma Myers as Enid who, with her colorful appearance and character, makes for a very interesting contrast to Wednesday. And while her character arc is very predictable it is very enjoyable to watch. Both Enid and Thing really sell the show and pushes it to be above average.All in all, it's a flawed series, but with a good budget and an entertaining story. Is it as good as the original? Well yes and no. Jenna will never beat Christina, which is fine, but it is very entertaining and perhaps even more so than the original. Jenna's version is likable dispite the flaws the writers pointlesly added to her character. Still, Wednesday in an indian outfit torturing another girl while slightly mischieviously smirking is how I will remember Wednesday at her best.",

Love-interest turns out to be the bad guy, who would have thought? (Eye roll) Oh, and the werewolf who can't werewolf, suddenly does werewolf when it's most convenient.And Christina Riccie's character just had to be behind it all, as otherwise there was no reason for this character to exist. Speaking of characters that have no reason to exist: What was the deal with the whole Bianca-is-the-nemesis plot line? Or for Bianca's mother? Start a line that might be interesting, just to abandon it an episode later.I wasn't too thrilled about some of the casting choices either. Catherine Zeta-Jones still is a beautiful woman, but a bit roo old to play Morticia imho. And the guy that played Uncle Fester? Playing him is already giving him too much credit. He didn't act, he just read his lines.I realize I sound a bit negative, but all in all it's a fun watch, but nothing special. It had more similarities to The Order than to the Adams Family (although this is WAY better than the Order).Oh, and is there any reason her parents didn't send Wednesday to Nevermore right away, seeing how much they loved the place?",

Pugsly is a wimp in her eyes, which he kind of was in the original series, too.As for the new characters, I was incredibly pleased with them. They're complex enough to be interesting, but not so complex that they take away from the story. The plot line is well thought out; I had suspected one of the involved from the beginning with no real reason to do so, but it did not detract from the story at all. All in all, I love this show!

The words felt \"read\" - not \"said\".The setting/aura was too familiar and lacked originality - felt like a mix of Harry Potter and Wizards of Waverly Place.Some of the acting was bad.The story lacked direction and was all over the place. Significant events occurred too randomly with poor setup. The world (e.g., the school) wasn't properly introduced to the viewer.Wednesday's character was unlikeable and too monotonous. I understand that Wednesday as a character has to be frightful, but that shouldn't mean her range of emotions should be limited.

As much as I disliked that it would have been fine by me if Wednesday had stuck to her independence and dismissed any advances but she didn't. The worst part really was the kissing.This truly was a great opportunity for asexual/aromantic representation and it was missed. However, the writing otherwise really wasn't bad.",

The cold stares, the intelligent language, the non-blinking, and the love for violence are all there, and I couldn't be more impressed with the performance Ortega delivered. Secondly, the atmosphere is typical of the Burton films I've watched. Combined with a school environment that we all can relate to, even though most of us are not outcasts.The show is run clearly by Wednesday, which it should be, thinking of its title, but other characters make a notable mark in the story. Bringing in friendships, love, and mystery makes this story remarkable, and the twists and turns are good. The series' style is typical of Tim Burton but with a twist. Wednesday is the gothic, wearing black and white always, with the rest of the cast being more colorful, or in the case of Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers), Wednesday's roommate, a lot brighter. Wednesday is a total contrast to the rest of the students at Nevermore.Wednesday, as a series, brings something fresh to the table, even though\" The Addams Family\" is a pretty old story or a cartoon as it was initially. Wednesday is direct, a contrast to the usual teenage stories of today, and while some may see it as dark, it is a story of growth, and there is light at the end, so watch it.",

            "content": "Not the worst thing I've watched but was disappointed in the show. Plot is pretty predictable, and I agree with others how the Addams family are weird and unique but then to throw them in a whole world with vampires, werewolves and sirens(and even more), they are no longer that weird and unique. Especially Wednesday, the actress that played her did wonderful but the actual character was just a teenager who was clearly miserable like most of the other teenagers out in the world. I think the only thing that saved this show enough for it to be rated 5 stars was its humour which again was delivered by Wednesday and also Thing.The character Enid is terrible and extremely annoying. Very unrelatable and wouldn't be any 16 year old in reality.... She was just so over the top. I understand them wanting to create a character that is opposite to Wednesday, but they either need to hire a better actress or tone down the character because it just didn't deliver. It also made her seem extremely childish compared to the rest of the cast, even Bianca who acted childish for most of the series. That's just how bad Enid was.Now let's talk about the hyde and Enid's wolf. For Enid's over the top, annoying and too colourful character, she gets to turn into THE ugliest wolf. The sirens in the show look beautiful and creates more of a magical atmosphere, but I was disappointed to see that Enid's wolf looked so much like the hyde monster. Was just not fitting. The hyde is supposed to be creepy and that but again why would you make Enid's wolf look so awful given that her character is so colourful? Especially after she spends the whole season worrying if she's going to change into a wolf or not. Expected her to change into the most elegant and beautiful wolf and attack this monster and come out stronger from the experience. It just made me not want to vouch for her even more.Lastly, I think this isn't a terrible watch but honestly I can't say I'm on the edge of my seat anticipating every moment working up to season 2(which their most likely will be). I also feel these higher reviews are from people that either don't care about the flaws of this series or have fallen head over heels for Wednesday(and the actress that plays her). Because really she saved the series but still wouldn't be able to rate higher given the amount of flaws in this series.",

Wednesday being the focus and the rest of the family, Thing excluded, being relagated to one or two appearances. The family dynamic is very out of character which makes the whole thing feel off. The Addams' are supposed to be full of love and support for eachother. Wednesday would never \"hate\" her parents or dread being like Morticia. Also as much as I think Luiz Guzman was a great casting choice, he didn't bring any of the Charm to Gomez.",

            "review_title": "Was not expecting this show to be good",
            "content": "Going by the fact Netflix was producing this and the promos were making this show out to be \"CW-esque\", my expectations were pretty low. The only reason I gave it shot was because it's more or less a spinoff of The Addams Family.And after slogging through a lot of poorly paced and terribly written western TV shows this year like Rings of Power, various MCU shows, and whatever Alex Kurtzman passes off as Star Trek these days, \"Wednesday\" is like an Oasis in a desert.The show is basically Veronica Mars with Wednesday Addams, or a Goth version of Nancy Drew for those who never watched the former. What that means for the layman is that it's a murder mystery show with Wednesday Addams being our titular detective at the center of it all. And oddly enough, the premise actually works.The first episode does a good job of setting up the premise and introducing all the characters, quickly establishing everyone's relationship dynamics and their place in the show. And most importantly the main plot thread of this season-a mysterious creature that randomly kills people around town, and several seemingly unrelated side mysteries.So, every episode is usually juggling multiple plot threads at once, whether that be character building moments or making progress on one of the several different mysteries running simultaneously. Every scene serves a purpose, which more than I can say about Andor or Rings of Power, which both squander or pad out their runtime with pointless filler or stretching out an already thin plot.Now the all important question, is it woke? Yes & No. It does have a diverse cast of characters, yet it doesn't feel like they're going off a checklist. Most of the men in the show aren't doormats for the female characters, save for a couple of them-and even then they do stand up for themselves when they're pushed to far.None of the female characters are infallible, including Wednesday herself. While she does excel at many things; she's not invincible, nor is she perfect, and surprisingly she is wrong from time to time. And she does have to rely on other people-a good bit of them being men. The biggest surprise is that she actually loves & respects her father Gomez-she's actually grateful for all the things he's taught her over the years.She makes a few obvious snipes about \"the patriarchy\" and people \"mansplaining\" to her, but they are few and far between and even then the people she's saying this to either don't know what she's talking about or they're rolling their eyes at her, and never dwell on it-kinda the same way shows like \"Daria\" use to do it back in the day, but in this instance it's to a lesser degree. And unlike most female protagonists these days, Wednesday actually tries to learn from her mistakes, and experiences some personal growth.And there's like one lesbian couple in the show, who are parents of one of the side characters, but they're not obnoxious about their inclusion, they're just there.Does it bash White people for no apparent reason? Actually, it never comes up. At least not overtly. They do make references to the colonial days where they use to burn witches (or in this case outcasts) at the stake, so to speak. But the race of said people were never brought up.Are Minorities (POCs) treated like the paragons of virtue that can do no wrong? Nope, they're treated like regular people/characters with no special treatment, and fill a wide variety of roles in the story like any other character would.So, yes it's diverse, but diverse in a more organic way. And all the characters have a story arc, even some the antagonists experience some growth. Nobody stays static in this show.After binge watching this show in one sitting, I'm really looking forward to what they're going to do next season.",

Hands down to her.All the actors here played their part so well, including Gwendoline Christie (principal Weems), who has shown her true colors recently in another big part as Lucifer in The Sandman. Love her talent.Tim Burton strikes again, but I didn't expect anything less from him, this is truly right up his alley and he makes the most of it.What I noticed is that he kept his unique style while also laying down fresh, small directing details that are very much 'in' right now.He combines the old and familiar with the new in a way that's exciting and completely absorbing.I liked that even if it's probably targeted at the younger generations it's still a fun watch for adults as well. It kept me on my toes from start to finish, couldn't stop watching it.No unnecessary additions just to keep with the times, plain and simple morbid quirks in a fun, engaging atmosphere of contrasting characters and mysterious plots.I gave this an 8 because of the level of depth, but for a program of this type, it's as good as it gets!Give it one episode and you'll be hooked.",

Her portrayal of Wednesday is so great and she really makes it her own while still having the sass and charm of her predecessors portrayal of the character. She really embodied Wednesday completely and makes the character come alive. I also absolutely love Enid, her roommate and friend. The juxtaposition of their characters and even the cinematography in their scenes is outstanding. I also really love Thing, and Morticia played by Catherine Zeta Jones is great. And I love the storyline between Morticia & Wednesday and hope it's explored more in depth in season 2. I'm not totally resonating with some of the other characters as much and the storyline with the monster is not great in my opinion.I do like that Wednesday and Morticia share 'psychic' powers/abilities. It's very interesting and adds a unique layer to the show.As a fan of Addams Family growing up with those iconic movies and characters with the perfect casting it's never going to completely match up to that level of synergy those actors had with each other, but on its own it's a pretty decent show and Jenna Ortega really makes it iconic in its own right. Hope the storyline gets stronger in Season 2 and they explore Wednsday's ability more and the dynamic between her & her mother. Morticia is a favorite and with Catherine Zeta Jones want to see more of her.Enid is an unexpected, beautiful character that really brings a lot of charm to the show and the dynamic and back and forth she has with Wednesday is one of the best parts of the show.Looking forward to seeing what happens in future seasons.",

The show isn't some spin off of the other Addams family movie, instead, it is a show about a new era of Wednesday. Wednesday is instead a high school student instead of a child. Wednesday is sent to a special boarding school where her parents met. Wednesday discovers that there are secrets within the school walls as well as the town it self so she decides to figure these secrets out for herself. There isn't much more i can say without giving it away but this is one of my favorite tv shows now that i have watched it and i recommend you watch it well!",

The dark and intertwining juxtapositions of everything that one has ever seen either on television or the movies in the realms of horror and history is packaged in a beautiful symphony of the macabre, including dark laughs. Jenna Ortega is the find of the 21st Century. Her portrayal of Wednesday Addams is dead on and magnetic to watch on the screen. Now we know how that sweet girl in the TV series became what she is today and Ortega delivers it hook, line and sinker. The storytelling keeps you captivated and never idiotic or redundant in it's delivery. I am glad that Luis Guzman's portrayal of Gomez is reflected from the comics, not even insulting the fans who loved John Astin and Raul Julia in their roles as Gomez.Catherine Zeta Jones's portrayal as Morticia is great and relish every scene she is in.I have only watched one episode and I will stand by my review until the end. I hope that this series continues onwards in further seasons. I hope Netfilx delivers the 2nd season during Halloween, it would be so appropriate due to the nature of the show. Thank you Tim Burton for great direction and Danny Elfman for a music score that ranks as high as his previous works such as Batman and countless other Tim Burton movies.",

You could literally guess the ending right from the climax of the first episode- which is the worst mistake a \"who done it\" style show can make.There are also plenty of moments where Tim Burton got a little over self-indulgent. As he can often do, unfortunately. Plus there are numerous moments where the show directly contradicts itself too. Which is another school boy error when it comes to crime plots. However if you take out the main story arc and instead focus on the stylisation aspect instead then it's a little more to offer.All in all, it's entertaining enough to be enjoyable. While it sadly falls far short of being \"great\", it's not bad enough that I would describe it \"style over substance\" (though some episodes do get dangerously close to that mark).",

Like she's just wildly throwing around accusations and it just seemed completely dumb and a little out of character with how tight lipped and secretive she had been up untill then. The show also feels very Harry Potter-esque and in the last episode it went from feeling inspired by to basically coming across like a Harry Potter fanfic with some OC characters.Hope to see another season in the future, because while it wasn't perfect the show had me invested in the story and all of its characters.",

Great one liners, memorable characters and a cast that packs a punch, sometimes literally.

Jones, however, acted as if she were on Fear Factor and being covered in snakes while lying in a tank every time he touched her or tried to interact romantically with her.

The unique appeal of the Addams family as a critique of society by turning social norms inside out is replaced with a Harry Potter clone.Watch only if you enjoy being disappointed like your parents were with you.",

The murder mystery concept is surely intriguing but the script simply lacks of creativity. I noticed a lot ( and i mean A LOT ) of similarities with other franchises, mainly The Harry Potter movies and the X-Men series. You know , different, dropout kind of teens trying to create a society of their own while some evil force wants to kill them all ...\nThe romance in the series is nothing more than the typical disney-type (platonic relationships between teens that find it difficult to express their feelings)\nAppart from that it was honestly decent. The characters (especially Wednesday) all had good moments throughout the series and some fun lines. The series definitely didn't lack of humour and that made it fun to watch\nA solid 5/10 i believe is pretty representative but that doesn't mean it couldn't be 6,7, or 8 as well. I think it depends on your expectations and personal preferences.All in all ,\nJudging it as a teen mystery-drama it was pretty good but it definitely is not the greatest tv-series out there.",

It was also weird that Tim Burton didn't seem to understand that the Addams are the anti-family, where Morticia is the head of the house, Gomez is the stay-at-home dad, he did get that Pugsley and Wednesday deeply care for one another... But, overall, none of the family members felt \"Addamsy\" enough, not even Thing and Uncle Fester.The rivalry between Morticia and Wednesday felt completely out of place. It felt like classical teenage rebellion, which is the exact opposite of what should've happened, turning Wednesday into an ordinary Goth Girl, instead of being an Addams.The same with the Love Triangle. Why is Wednesday falling for 2 regular Chads? That was very weird. They missed a great chance to get out of the Hollywood box with that one. It would make more sense for Wednesday to end up with a character like \"Bee Boy\" than a regular love interest.Other than that, the show was great. The story was interesting. The characters were well-written. The love-story between Gomez and Morticia was perfect as it was. The mystery was good, even though you can figure most things out halfway through the season.I hope they make a second season... Don't forget the song, next time, though!",

My girlfriend said Tim Burton told Wednesday not to blink in the show, that was something I noticed. Really crazy.I'm a big fan of the fantasy genre and there was an element of this to the show which was great. To me it was a mix of a fantasy show, mystery and comedy.

            "content": "If you want to watch this show solely, because you are an Addams family fan, don't! The eerie, tingling, dark, gothic and death embracing atmosphere is not present here.Neither is the very soul of previous series/movies and the authenticity of their characters. Tim Burton (with NETFLIX) has simply borrowed this cult while completely raping, defiling\nand butchering the very essence of its characters (especially Wednesday since she is the main one).If you however like Riverdale and/or harry potter and Hogwarts, this show might be an enjoyable\nexperience for you. That is actually the only reason why I was able to finish this show. You can think of it as a sort of mixture of these two shows.The characters are unfortunately extremely off. So don't expect that empty, unemotional,\ndeadlike Wednesday. Our new Wednesday is constantly rude, arrogant, cringey, mean and extremely pretentious.She is in fact trying to be Wednesday so much(with all that pretentious and forced wannabe goth quotes),\nthat she has missed it and become something very distant from her. Instead of being empty like a walking dead corpse she is strongly angst-driven and always angry.Her self-assurance combined with arrogance and an \"I know everything and I know it much better than you\" passive-aggressive kind of vibe, she can get on my nerves quite easily.Prepare yourself for over the top pseudo goth quotes coming in each episode such as\n\"I don't bury hatchets, I sharpen them\" in every other dialogue. This makes this show nearly unwatchable and I cannot believe that she is indeed,\nthe way she is trying to present herself.The real Wednesday would not have to prove herself what she is, or hide her insecurities behind\nfalse superiority of her ego, audacity and meanness.The real Wednesday has neither emotions nor vulnerabilities/insecurities but real confidence.When she smiles, it's an empty gesture without a real emotion behind it. The new Wednesday is just a regular goth\nteenager with emotions and ALL the \"typical teenager stuff\" (I won't elaborate further so that I won't spoil too much).Wednesday is constantly trying to prove herself that she is soooo different and soooo strong. One independent girlboss who is so smart and superior, that the others are just\na burden dragging her down.Here we are arriving at perhaps the biggest \"butchery\" of the show's director/Netflix. The new Wednesday is portrayed as an ultimate object of desire as opposed to the object of repulsion\nand disgrace of society. This is precisely what made the Addams family so funny and interesting to watch.They were rejected because of their peculiarity and were frowned upon with fear and a certain\nprotective distance. That is however different in this show. The new Wednesday is the object of desire of everyone, admired, attractive and accepted from the first moment.They have created a certain safe space of weirdos, making humor very sterile and hyper politically correct.No further repulsion from society is possible in this setting (or even beyond their safe space).This is however what made previous movies so funny, the interaction between normal people and these weird sadistic monsters. And the significant distance between these two parties.Apart from that, severe plot holes are omnipresent and the plot is two-dimensional at best. Many things are unfortunately poorly thought through, reminding me of cartoons\nin my childhood for their predictability and imperfections. The makeup artist has not even bothered to make Wednesday look like a dead corpse after a couple of episodes, leaving\nher tanned skin to look natural. Neither they did bother with shaving Uncle Fester's eyebrow to give him his typical look. The same goes for Wednesday, not to mention that\nthey have picked a rather cute, eye-pleasing Latina (Jenna Ortega) instead of some half-dead-looking monster. Her parents are unconvincing and as off as her\nin all aspects. The most convincing characters are probably Thing and Uncle Fester.This show is no more than just another soulless serial in the profit-driven machinery of Netflix abusing a well-known name of previous shows and movies,\nfor a quick boost in easily earned fame.The only thing that is done properly here, is the environment and the camera. For this, I cannot rate Wednesday with anything above 6/10 at best.I did not expect much but you somehow made me feel disappointed.",

I've watched 1960s tv-show, the 90s dilogy and now that.\"Wednesday\" is a great comedy, horror and, especially for me, detective. Ms. Addams enters the new school and immediately gets into troubles, I like that!Now some words about acting. Well, it's perfect, what should I say? The characters don't look like the ones from 90s dilogy that's why this work got some hate. But I guess they've never seen the original comics. The characters in my opinion really look like the ones from books by Chas Addams. Wednesday here is less crazy than Cristina Ricci's one. Jenna Ortega is a great growing up star that played very good, my funko pops with her can't lie about it) My favorite character, thing, was an amazing thing for me. It was played by a real person, almost no CGI, that feels cool.The biggest con for me is that there are no a lot of Fester and Lurch but I guess it will be fixed in a second season, won't it?To sum up, I want to say that every person that watched Addams Family dilogy should watch that. This work is related a bit to teens but that's not so critically. My mark is 9/10. I gave 10 just cause I like this atmosphere of creepy guys from Addams family.",

I wish i could learn the same how not to care for others and always think of mine and you might be doing great. Got me a lil to a phase where i thought i must be cruel. But not so captivating as many others do.Really loved starting episodes of wednesday series. It was really great! 1hr each spending of day seems appropriate while eating. Not more nor less. It also wasn't that i was binging. It gave me control to continue it to other day and here comes the part which i dislike.The last two episodes was utterly rubbish! I mean why was even need for an uncle? It was so no required. That just seemed like he was making the series long,\nWhile on the other hand the death of crack stone was so very quick. Still money heist is better i think. I mean the whole series was about crack stone, and his death was so quick and just in some 10mins? Wow. That was very like a child drama.There was no sequence to the other episode. The episode didn't continue the previous one. It was rather a whole new one. I mean u need to watch previous one to get a recap of what happened. There was no continuation in episodes. Like when the eugene was attacked, and ms. Thornhill came at the spot, and it ended. The next episode didn't continue it. Infact it show a plot of school or something.It was more like a high school teen drama. Always normie are to be sus. So i pretty guessed it, it has to be the teacher, tyler or psychiatric. Also that shape shifting of principal was sus at the time of the murder.I was pretty much sure she was the killer, but well she wasn't.Loved the hand as pet. It was something definitely unique. And i would give 2 stars to it!Tyler really seemed sweet and still its weird to see him as monster. Casting not well cuz he is legit soft spoken and there was no any pointing to him that he could be a murderer. But that's what i liked. As it was unpredictable.Loved the character and portray of enid. She was really very friendly and felt how could there be some this much helpful to go in danger with friends. Lmaoo rather than all the friendship of enid seemed more fictional. But i cried when she wolfed out. I loved it how she turned and helped fighting the monster. And that hug. For a moment i thought wish i could have a friend like her! I think loved her character even more than Wednesday cuz at second last, i really hate how she plot xavier and turned him to jail. I really thought Wednesday so worse character as of her. And for a moment she was actually not solving the crime but doing by plotting him. And then xavier helping at last ughh again fictional. No one does that okay? I mean always the evil ones get their way out while nice and innocent were never.I was also moved when hand was hurt. I actually liked that unique character. It was definitely the highlight. It git hurt and how he was saved. And Wednesday, she like cried for the second time. I noticed.So in short manyy things were so great but last 2 episodes, wasn't.And i loved the series because i am Wednesday! Always a loner, loves to be alone. Tries not to care but still cares about others, but i end up getting hurt and can't even take a revenge, nor fight back and bears the pain. Wish i could be a lil evil like her.",

I wasn't too sure about this series at first, but decided to give it a try, and found myself absolutely glued to the screen on this one. There are a few things that kinda felt off, like the chemistry between Morticia and Gomez seems almost cringey bad, which is strange considering both are amazing actors, and although Uncle Fester is a great character, his involvement in this series seemed almost forced, as he provided no real reason to actually be there. But everything else, including the other characters at Nevermore, were great! The actresses that played Enid, and Bianca were both exceptional!I'm really hoping they continue this series with a second season, but I'm pretty certain that's a done deal considering the popularity of this first season.",

            "content": "Ok, so we have Wednesday Addams - from the Addams family who is meeting vampires and werewolves etc in a teenage drama/detective mystery in a Hogwarts/Veronica Mars/Riverdale setting. Wednesday begins to have visions, becomes an amateur detective in a murder mystery, gets drawn into a love triangle, and learns to socialize. So teenage drama.This is not necessary a bad idea though - the original series basically had one pitch only. The Addams family is an family where every-thing is the opposite of what is expected. They hate cute, nice things like dogs and happyness and love vile, strange things like torture, swamps, depression and dangerous beasts. The creepy and the kooky but also the dangerous (even if the 60s show in general was a bit tame) and every episode had normal society interact with them in some way. This was followed by the later 90s movies - movies with great actors but with a script that was a bit so-so and too much focus on Fester. In short - Addams need to branch out a bit.In this spin-off, Wednesday is getting the focus due to the characters popularity from Christinas Riccis acting in said 90s movies. She has clearly grown to high school age (she was very young in the 60s show and very underused) and is enrolling in a Hogwarts like place for freaks and outcasts. Again not a bad idea. However, while I get that they want to focus more on the sarcastic and antisocial parts of the Addams brand, the character was also sadistic and death-obsessed. The initial Piranha scene works well, but then she becomes way too sympathetic. Not necessary a huge problem, but her Addams Root is weakened - you could have simply invent a new girl, remove the Addams name entirely and go for that. In addition, the script in general is pretty weak. Its a bit too generic, too YA for it to really work. They should allow more gore, maybe letting Wednesday murder, torture or maim a classmate or something. I get that you could call it growth - but I am not sure I want to see her character evolve that much. In some episodes she is joined by other members of the family, but their scenes are mostly forgettable. The show is not about the family.However, this is saved by in general good acting and a pretty decent Tim Burton aesthetic. I would call it amazing, buts decent and cute and that can be enough. Just don\u00b4t do in expecting something really creative and unique here and if you are a hardcore Addams fan, you might want to skip this completely, since the focus isn\u00b4t really on the family and their kookyness. But it is very charming and that can be enough.",

At the end of the series you can see that she has changed a little, not only in the sense of personal evolution, but also in her behavior towards others.It is true that we are in front of another character of Wednesday and that it is not necessary to compare her with the one in the movie, which sometimes makes you not enjoy this series as much. Still, if you leave such comparisons aside, we see an actress who gets into the role and plays this new character very well.With respect to the other members of the family, we see a different Addams to what we are used to, but we will have to adapt to this new version, where there are small touches of that essence.",

            "content": "This review contains big spoilers for Wednesday and Sleepy HollowWednesday starts with a good premisse, but its execution is far from accomplished. It's a mixture of Harry Potter, Twilight and random Young Adult fare and it's not hard to see early on that that is its target audience.It's bloated, formulaic, predictable (more on that later), a bit confusing and with a lot of storylines that seem to go nowhere. It starts off as a generic murder mystery, then it goes off to another mystery involving Morticia and Gomez Adams that gets solved midway through (what was the point of having it?), Wednesday's rivalry with Bianca loses its steam and seems to be pointless, and a lot of lore and life-saving solutions quickly come up in the last episode without having been mentioned or established beforehand. It's not very hard to guess who the real villains are and, in that regard, it falls into the same trap as another one of Tim Burton's movies, Sleepy Hollow. In the latter if you know anything about film in general it's quite obvious who the 'killer' is - Burton cast Miranda Richardson in the film (back then a big name and riding in the back of Oscar nominations for a couple of roles) and gives her nothing to do throughout the film until the third act - that's pretty much a giveaway since she wouldn't just join the film to be a supporting player with very few lines, and that she'd have to have a bigger role in the film overall. The same thing happens in Wednesday - Christina Ricci (who played the character Wednesday in The Addams Family and its sequel back in the nineties) shows up here and gets nothing to do during seven episodes; it would have been one thing to have her show up in a cameo to pass the torch, but having a big name like her in the whole series doing nothing pretty much indicates that she will have to be of importance in the story at some point.Speaking of Burton, the episodes he directed don't really stand out overall, he just seems to be in autopilot mode (that has been going on for a decade now).However, Wednesday has some brilliant moments - that amazing introductory scene with the piranhas, the cello scene, the statue explosion and THAT dance sequence! Jenna Ortega is fantastic as Wednesday and gives easily the most accomplished performance in the series - she is captivating, funny and has great timing. The actor that plays Thing is also a stand-out. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia and Luiz Guzm\u00e1n as Gomez are a disappointment though, although their casting sounded great on paper. Zeta-Jones suffers from overacting in all her films (it worked great for something as flamboyant as Chicago or light hearted fun as The Mask of Zorro) but her Morticia lacks the dark warmth and subtlety that was so incredibly commanded in the screen by Angelica Houston; as for Guzm\u00e1n, he also lacks the larger than life personality that the great late Raul Julia put on display in the aforementioned movies.The production values are at times excellent (Wednesday and Enid's room is fantastic) and Collen Atwood's costumes are mesmerising as always - the wigs though could have been better and those used by the characters Goody and Marilyn are particularly bad. The CGI isn't great either.Still, Wednesday is a good distraction, mainly due to Ortega's performance, the dark humor and one liners, the gothic aesthetic throughout and especially those very memorable scenes.Hopefully season 2 (and others) will improve on this, although it seems quite a task as all the big mysteries at hand were already solved in this season so they will have to come up with a lot of new stuff to keep this fresh and going without it becoming even more bloated and unnecessary.7/10.",

Whether it is on Instagram or any other social media platforms, there seems to be a raging trend to match the dance sequence to her gothic attire. I really couldn't get my head around it. Honestly speaking, I watched out of peer pressure considering it a children's show, and was surprised at the hype the show and its cast is getting. I have to say the high-profile cast of Christina Ricci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman, Gwendoline Christie and the new star Jenna Ortega does little to impress me. Directed by Tim Burton, I had high hopes but boy, was I disappointed by this cringe-fest.Like so many other reviewers, I also felt the show was a mix of Harry Potter and the modern-day Addams Family. It was not done that great though I am aware its viral status speaks a different story. The main actors lacked chemistry and the plot failed to impress me. Jenna Ortega was alright with the character and I wasn't too impressed with her performance. The relationship between Wednesday Addams and just about anyone felt stretched at best. She felt, at best, like a Gothic Cho Chang from Harry Potter's world.Hardly smiles and maintains a distant relationship with everyone though the original series shows her close to her sibling. The representation of both romance and friendship was very stale. I couldn't remember the names of the characters and even now, I had to Google for most of their names. The CGI of the monster was done quite badly and was clearly looking like a computer animation than part of the real world at all.It was difficult to like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman's over-the-board romance and I expected it to be a lot more intense and affectionate than what was shown. The sibling relationship between Wednesday and Pugsley was also not up to par. I grew up watching the Addams family of the 90s with its twisted and dark humor, this one seemed too cliched with its plot and felt more mainstream for modern-day teenagers than the ones stuck in the nostalgic 90s. The humor here is targeted at mainstream and brings in a clich\u00e9 experience than a unique one.For me, the worst part of the show was predictability from the beginning. The predictability of the villains or monsters was also very clear from episode 2 onwards. I forced myself to watch the show and got busy observing each of its flaws instead of being able to enjoy myself.I didn't really like the show or understand the hype for it. Watching it, I could feel the cheesiness and overall blandness and there was hardly any good acting, chemistry, or plot to save the show in my opinion. The dance routine wasn't that impressive for the viral status it holds. I understand my opinion is going to be the unpopular one, but it definitely is going to be out here and an honest one.",

Hats off to the creators for portraying the comic strip origins. The problem is the lack of chemistry between his Gomez and Morticia. Next season, if approved, I suggest you take advantage of his appearance. Make Gomez less soft. More take charge type. More dangerous. He can love his family, but you don't mess with him. He'll become more attractive that way. Remember James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart? Not too pretty, but they had the ladies lined up!",

I'm wondering if the rave reviews and ratings are more for initial half of the season. I can say that I have watched it in its entirety and I would say it's between a 6 to 7 out of 10 with 10 being best. I was excited that the people behind Smallville TV show got together with Tim Burton to make this. Unfortunately, Tim Burton only directed first half of season and that's about the only part of the season that was most engaging to watch.The writing quality is uneven. It starts out strong first half which is important to first engage the audience, but fell kinda flat and drawn out after the first half of the season. I definitely feel the whole storyline could have been condensed to like 6 episodes instead of 8 without sacrificing quality. It's like show production got rushed and the writing got lazier from middle to end.Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday is the best part about the show truly. I've seen her in \"Scream 5\" and \"You\" playing similar characters that it's refreshing to see her show more versatility, showcasing her talent and acting range as a more different character.Spoiler from here down: It's one of those cases where as a viewer you figure out who's dunnit and becomes exhausting when Wednesday has pretty much exhausted all avenues before figuring out who's dunnit. It got annoying and my patience wore thin. And seemed like filler to draw the show out to have more unecessary episodes than it needed to have at the sacrifice in quality. By the time I realize the show quality goes downhill from here it's like I'm in it too deep to not finish at this point and I can't think of any other show I'd rather watch instead cuz I've felt like I've exhausted everything worth watching at this point. I also got annoyed when certain characters make stupid, obvious mistakes like for example a character turning their back on the villain they know is still there because their distracted by the villain killing a major character. While this level of stupidity of the characters is not unique to just this show, it's still annoyingly obvious and a sad attempt to add suspense and thrill in the moment and is a trope. Back turning against the bad guy happened about twice in the same episode.I would watch a second season. It's watchable. I do think because it's drawn out some people are gonna give up about about 5-6 episodes in cuz quality goes down from there and it gets a little boring and drawn out and the show doesn't quite redeem itself even with the conclusion of the mystery.It's got a similar feel to CW's Nancy Drew but lacks villain of the week and more villain of the season arc, but with better quality story initially and a lack of gratuitous sex scenes.",

But through the episodes you realize that what keeps you that way, is the peculiar and well build universe, as the precisly casting of every character. These elementes are the reason Wednesday is entertaining.With Tim Burton as a main key in this project, was expected that these elements were so important. The thing is that the well designed universe and characters overshadow by far the mystery and story that are trying to tell. Because the distinctive Tim Burton's style is so perceptible during the whole series. Though more inconspicuous than other projects by him.The mystery is simple and with potential, but it feels like nine episodes were too much for what it takes to get resolution. So the story dallies a lot.The plot twist is key element on this kind of stories, so it's important put them to good use and don't abuse of them. Something that happens a lot on Wednesday.A teenage Wednesday Addams as the main charachter, that tries to adapt to an unadapted school, feels refreshed. Showing new faces of the character that maybe before were unseen. As well as the others members of the Addams Family.The time devoted to the mystery's construction, and the fateful profecy to happen, makes the final quickie and deflated for all this expectation. So it's dispiriting the way it gets concluded. However, the town's background, all the characters that live there, and all the different beings that coexist with Wednesday, make this universe rich and abundant, which surely will get more stories to tell.In conclusion, Wednesday it's an entertaining series that will be remembered not by it's story, but for the peculiar characters and universe where it happens.",

Uncle Fester talks about having multiple lobotomies but sadly the acting doesn't match it. He just seems too normal. Wednesday seems to completely stop being her smart logical self and wildly accuse people without thinking, act too emotional for her character and I dislike the \"misunderstood emo kid who actually wants love\" vibe.She constantly threatens people(as Wednesday would) but as soon as she's in danger she does nothing and ultimately gets saved by someone else. The one time she takes matters in her own hands is during her still wildly accusing someone and it made her very unlikable.I would say it was entertaining but the ending ruined it a lot for me.",

There are some cheese moments but then again so did the original Addams family material.In a way, it's refreshing that the show runners didn't take this the full brooding, dark, and insincere serious tone that a lot our other childhood favorite comics or original films have opted for as of recent.Definitely give yourself an episode or two acclimate.

I would not call it family friendly as it contains explicit scenes of violence. However, I would not rate it much more brutal than the Harry Potter movies - which obviously served as a template here.

And much like SNL skits those brief gags are tough to stretch into a longer format story. The Huston/Julia movies show both the strength and weakness of this conundrum. Although very good if you look at the first and second movie you will realize that they are the same movie.So, I went into Wednesday knowing that they would need to stretch the brand in order to make it into a multi episode Netflix series.The good: Jenna Ortega is terrific! That was a brilliant casting choice. Thing steals every scene he (it?) appears in. The expressivenesss of that hand is astounding. Arneson as Uncle Fester is great. And I really had my doubts about that choice. Gwendoline Christie is also interesting and engaging in her roll as Principal Weems. Wednesday's roomate Enid makes a funny and solid foil as does Mossa as Eugene. The set design and costuming is first rate.The tolerable: The psychic ability is tolerable to advance the plot. The rest of the kids (other then Enid) are fine. The sheriff, Ricci's character, and the counselor are all accpetable. Lurch is a fine Lurch (with no real lines). The school itself is at time annoying and at times interesting.The bad. The depiction of Morticia and Gomez is *awful*. In the present they are dull. In the past they are completely out of character. I understand that there was a plotline that needed the conflict in the past but it still could have been written in a manner that was true to the characters.Second, one of the first things one should do on a project like this is understand and make the world clear as you are creating the story. And one of those things, when dealing with a world like the one Wednesday is portraying, is being clear about how these unusual characters exist in the world. Does the entire world know that werewolves, vampires and sirens exist? Does the nearby town? Or is this a secret kept on the campus of the school? Choose one, stick with it, and write accordingly.Overall it is worthwhile. I hope to see better world building and writing in season 2.",

As such my expectations of this series was neutral.To start with the good, Jenna Ortega as the titlular character was absolutely masterful. An outcast among outcast, she plays the dark teen, who whether she realizes or not, wishes to escape her lonely solitude. Unfortunately aside from Wednesday and Principle Weems, this show desperately struggles with presence from their other actors. Wednesday employs mostly unknown actors and it shows, whether it's the script, the acting or a combination of both, the show never finds life in its actors.The story is a high school drama with mystery at its centre. Wednesday often struggles finding its balance between the two plots. Giving us highschool cliches while at the same time trying the shy away from cliches. But perhaps Wednesday's most egregious plot line was the love triangle between characters, Wednesday Addams, Tyler Gaplin and Xavier Thorpe. Thorpe especially whose character boiled down to the jealous love interest. Wednesday is actively worse everytime it revisits this love triangle. However I stayed for the mystery aspect and the show shines, though struggled at the end.We learn Tyler Gaplin is the monster Wednesday has been looking for, which should have been discovered by the audience halfway through the series. A predictable mystery is not a bad thing, however the series throws so much misdirections that the reveal is exhausting. The big bad villain gone as soon as he arrives failed to kill anyone.Wednesday struck gold in its casting of Jenna. It's a decent series that may resonate in those that feel themselves to be outcasts.",

A little questionable is the casting of someone pushing thirty (Hunter Doohan) as an older teenager, but his performance was really great so I'll let it slide.The show's humor is almost always spot on, and I quite liked the mystery that starts unfolding all the way from episode one. From the very start, we are given clues on who might be behind the conspiracy, and there is enough for you to figure it out- not necessarily from evidence presented, but at least from a narrative perspective.Wednesday and her roommate Enid are both interesting characters, and watching the two play off of each other is always entertaining. Through her roommate Enid, her friend Eugene, and her love interest Tyler, we get to see Wednesday grow more as a person and learn to care for others.I did not particularly care for the love triangle. I didn't really like Wednesday romantically with Tyler or with Xavier (though I liked them both as characters), but I'm willing to overlook that because less time is devoted to that than to the mystery and suspense.There are a few plot holes in the show, such as the ambiguous nature of exactly how much Tyler was acting when it was revealed he was part of the plot against Wednesday and the specifics on how Bianca's siren song worked. But once again, those can be overlooked in favor of the overwhelmingly good elements.",

What kind of personalities in the characters the serie wants to portray? Realistic or unrealistic? The idea of \"just her\" being the problem does not feel real... Because the majority of people are not merciful.Xavier loves her so devotedly at first sight and went to jail because of her wrong suspicions. I do think that even thought he loves her, he should set limits. People who are cheated from their partners separates but still love them. Same thing should occur with Wednesday! The story transmits the false belief that we can do whatever we want with people who loves us. Even if the belief is true, where is the sense of morality in the serie? The story should teach good things not bad deeds! Mainly because their target audience are children!About the critics that said she is a very rude character, not funny or sympathetic. The intention of the serie is not to show an incredibely positive main character but yes a realistic one who seeks revenge, with some quirky traits (like not accepting hugs if the person is not a close friend)... that is constantly learning through her own mistakes but like I said before I do think the other characters should be more realistic.",

The two major twists are great, but overall, it felt like the show went somewhat off the rails. Climax is underwhelming, several payoffs are unsatisfying, the scene at the beginning messes up Wednesday's character growth, and the effects looked utterly cartoonish.

Gwendoline Christie was excellent as the matron of the school. I was initially attracted to \"Wednesday\" when I saw that Fred Armison was portraying Uncle Fester. Catherine Zeta Jones was also very good in her role as Mortician. Some good life lessons to be learned in following parents footsteps. Try to be yourself theme throughout.",

I do really think it is good sometimes but there are wayyy too many times when it just feels like it could've been much better.

All mysteries are explained in the end. Characters are well written, except Tyler and Xavior. The show could have given them a more complex story, but no, all I know about them is that they have a fascination for Wednesday. The whole show they only follow Wednesday and try to get her to date them. Wednesday just keeps making mistake that gets her and her friends killed/injured, and she doesn't learn from it. But of course she is bullet proof as a MC, so the show runners think it's ok for her to do all these things without thinking. It just shows that she is not a very smart person.Some parts of the story are long. The final boss fight was disappointing and lack of climax.However, it is a great show overall. Lots of mysterious and magic elements. If the show runner writes well for the next seasons, this show could really be the next Harry Potter.",

Not to say that there's something inherently wrong with any show that blows up, but they all have a few flaws. Here are a couple ups and downs of Wednesday.First of all, Jenna Ortega is absolutely fantastic as her character. Her deadpan, dark sense of humor, and unblinking confidence is captured perfectly. I was a little put off by Emma Meyers' performance as Enid, but it wasn't all that bad.The main reason I didn't give this show a full 10/10 was the lack of worldbuilding. It was completely unclear how any of it worked, and not in a good way. I wasn't sure if this was a fantasy world or if it was set on Earth--some combination of the two, I guess. With Harry Potter, the creators did this intentionally, but the creators of Wednesday seem to just have forgotten to elaborate upon the setting.",

Wednesday was very predictable especially the reveal of the villain and before something new was revealed you could guess that an episode to two episodes prior. The show left many plot holes but the show wasn't all bad. The acting by Jenna Ortega was great and I loved that she didn't blink, really added to Wednesdays character.

I was not a fan of who played Mom, Dad, and uncle Fester. I understand they have done some awesome work, however they didn't really make these characters come to life.

            "content": "I grew up with the 91 version of Addams family, and have always liked the spooky fantasy setting, but since I know very well that mediocre mass produced series are the dominant genre nowadays, my expectations were low.TLDR: This feels like a Netflix teen drama mixed with gothic horror elements, does not depict the Addams well, but has an enjoyable emotional story. It aims at younger generations, very mainstream, very clich\u00e9, but once watchable, don't expect too much. I'd give this a 6.5 if I could, but knowing the movies I rated 6 I gave Wednesday 7 stars for consistence.The setting is really nice, altough I gotta say that it is much more like a Disney Channel fantasy movie with gothic elements than an actual dark movie, but that's exactly what I expected from Netflix. The scenery and the music was spot on, I really the harpsichord as an instrument for dark melodies. VFX is junior level work, reminds me of the first live action Scooby Doo, it is too goofy and interrupts the experience. Some environment elements and the monsters looked especialy bad, felt like my 2 weeks old AutoDesk experience could've done better.The story offers nothing too surprising, but it kept me engaged throughout the series. It felt like basic teenage drama with some smooth plot twists and dark mysteries. I like other stories of similar complexity like Stranger Things or Scooby Doo, too, so this in fits in, though I again gotta say it still feels less, like a Netflix/Disney mass produced thing. The action itself was however fluid and kept me watching.Some characters were interesting, have some development curve, altough some of those were easy to guess from the start after I guessed the overall depth of the plot. Others are only caricatures, and all characters operate with - again - usual Disney level clich\u00e9 traits.Outcasts got a new meaning, the series depicted the people you'd expect to be weird, shy, mysterious, to be making their own version of High School Musical with popular kids, teenage celebs, prom queens and festivals. Everyone was overly extroverted except Wednesday, like they were totally accepted and not at all feared or segregated by normal humans outside the school. Even Hogwarts gave a better idea about a dual society. Then again, the series were probably aiming at teenagers on a mediocre level.The Addams factor was obviously butchered, Thing and Lurch did really well, obviously. I also liked Fester, though that felt like guilty pleasure having seen the parents' dissonant characters, always in limbo between conservative, anti-social homicidals and open minded, faint hearted progressives. Wednesday changed, too, but was well written. I have experience with people with cluster b disorders, so she felt a bit too real, even, though that vibe was obviously to be ruined by the end of the season. Let's say sometimes they had their Addams moments, but most of the time not at all.I was not impressed with the casting, for example casting dark skinned caucasians for Morticia and Wednesday was a straight up fail, no amount of make-up could make them as pale as death. I however really liked their acting, even though for example Morticia's character too was badly written, dissonant in behavior, sometimes dark and antisocial, sometimes a whiny, insecure, luxurious woman who used to be a star in high school. Zeta-Jones along with the others did a really good job portraying the faulty mess of a material she got. On average, I liked everyone's acting, they felt authentic even though their lines or character arch were sketchy at times.Lastly, Idelogical messaging was somewhat forced at times, and continuous sexist slurs were unpleasant, especially since I am from Europe and am not conditioned to put up with the present american culture wars.",

The contrived way \"Woe\" was included in every title with clumsy puns was embarrassing and unnecessary, this isn't Friends.Obviously Wednesday is portrayed as a continuation of her original character - a cold stoned hard ass- but none of her actions are worthy of this portrayal, she is consistently being saved by everyone else; Edin, Golly, Eugene, Bianca, literally everyone and she still has the gall to say lines like 'this isn't going to end well for you' microseconds before certain death if it hadn't been for all her saviours. I loved Harry Potter but this was my main gripe with Harry and his almost exclusive use of the expelliarmus charm BUT at least he never pretended to be a cold stoned hard ass.Then there's all the build up of the plot only for the main villain to be easily defeated, despite his superior strength and powers, thus having a minuscule amount of screen time, without any significant death, destruction or consequences. She even needed major help to eventually discovery who Laurel really was, she had no idea who Laurel was before Eugene mentioned the red shoes (after already incorrectly accusing the psychiatrist and Xavier), what if he hadn't have woken up or woke up after she got on the train (oh yeah the Hyde would have intercepted and killed her). There were at times comical moments but few and far in between and they eventually became predictable and clich\u00e9d.Usually a big fan but woefully disappointed in Tim Burton with this adaptation, he probably should have retired a while ago with his legacy intact. People have watch this due to the original Addams connection but this will be quickly forgotten, if they release season 2 (of course they will, they always bleed cash cows dry- the end?) it will take a noise dive in ratings as it won't be as nostalgic and the storyline is dead.

But then she has never been a great actress.Overall it's a stretch to make a series from the limited sub story.

Wednesday's actress portrays her exactly as I would hope,But the romance plot line broke my immersion and honestly just left me feeling irritated. The love interests are incredibly boring outside of the mystery around them. Except for his importance to the mystery, Xavier felt like your typical bland and overdone misunderstood artist. Tyler was the usually pretty boy with a dead mom and unsupportive dad that you see in a lot of stories. Every romantically charged scene made me groan and overall ruined my enjoyment of the series. Yes, it all lead up to a very interesting plot twist, but that doesn't change how badly it effected my viewing experience.I feel like there could be a better way to work the story to avoid a forced story, or even to rework the characters to where they'd be more viable love interests for Wednesday.

Finding people that will contrast well with the Adam's family and make it seem natural can't be easy but it is done exceptionally well here. The only character I was not extremally happy with was Uncle Fester, something did not fit the cast with his style. On the other hand, he did not have a lot of air time.Bottom line is that this is among Tim Burton's best work in my opinion. I am sure it is not the critics favourite because there usually is a detachment between what people actually think is good vs what some jaded \"professionals\" think is deep and boring enough to be a master piece.All in all, It has the same magical feel I had watching some of the great shows as a kid.",

The story had a really good pace and had me quite invested in the last few episodes. I loved the relationship between Enid and Wednesday that slowly built up, and I'm definitely hoping for more next season.But, there's also some of things I didn't like so much. Especially with the love interests, if you can even call them that. Tyler was an absolute menace to watch and I disliked him the moment I saw him, so when he turned out to be the hyde I was surprised but not shocked. Xavier was a ride for sure, at the beginning I really hated him. He was awkwardly pushy and just over all gave me 'pick me' vibes. To be fair, I did end up liking him a little more as the show progressed. If you asked me which one I'd pick, I would probably still say none. The romantic feels just weren't there.The plot was good, a little foreseeable but good nonetheless. I liked the flashbacks to young Gomez, Moritcia and Weems. It helped build more depth into the characters. A few of the pop culture reference were a little bit unnecessary and awkward to watch as a person who's apart of Gen Z. But it's nothing too serious in my opinion. The jokes were only there half of the time, and it's really something I hope they fix. Undoubtedly the best character was Thing.Overall I'd say, if you're looking for a casual watch then go for it. But if you're expecting the 1993 Addams family charm, this might not be the one for you.",

They both had same nature of torturing/ playing.Other than that, the series was really good. Jenna Ortega played the part of Wednesday Addams beautifully. The mother-daughter relationship and how it matures was really good.I absolutely loved the friendship and the way it blossomed between Wednesday and Edin. I mean portraying how Wednesday, a girl who keeps to herself and has no friends end up having such a beautiful relationship was one of the good parts of the show.The curious ending really added a punch to the sad time when a person ends a show.

Apart from Ortega, Emma Myers' portrayal of the original character, Enid Sinclair, was the needed 'splash of color' in contrast of Wednesday. The number of hours that the viewers made was at least a billion, and that is not a hyperbole. With 2022's lack of exciting new horror/comedy genre, Wednesday took the crowd like a storm.",

I would have accepted it if it wasn't for the strong episode one and two, but the lack of transition baffles me.Also, suddenly new characters are introduced to make the show make sense.

            "content": "Wednesday 2022 is an unoriginal combination of Harry Potter, Gossip Girl, That's So Raven, Twilight, Veronica Mars, with the characters from The Addams Family but only the characters, not the family. It uses the Tim Burton label for marketing purpose with only 4 episodes directed by him. It checks its production checklist but failed at telling a good story.My problems with the series (spoilers):It undermined the weirdness of the Addams by having a school full of so called weirdness which made it less weird. It's not the family against the world but rather the magical world against the normie world. But whatever, I can accept this setup, this is the least of my problems with the series.Nevermore is supposed to be a school for the outcast but it also chooses to outcast certain monster types, like the Hyde? It's just a magical school, not an outcast school, and you still have to fit in to be a part of it, which makes me think the creators of the series doesn't really know what it's like to be an outcast/misfit.Why would the villain go through all the troubles to try and resurrect a normie? Crackstone was evil but he had no real powers, he just hate magical beings, without his followers what can he do? But then he's resurrected and suddenly he had a magical staff out of nowhere and became a powerful sorcerer? And if you need magical power to destroy the magical school, then your hate has no base. It's just a silly plot device. The villain could have had those killings to drive a wedge between the normie and Nevermore and seed the hate between them and have some real damages.You have Ricci, the original Wednesday, should have made her a permanent role to side along with the new Wednesday, instead of making her a poorly written villain that barely had any screen time and only lasted a season. What a waste.The series is not too bad, Ortega gave perfect performance, the colors and cinematography are great, but the series is just not that good. Too many people seems to like it and giving it too high of an appraisal that it just doesn't deserve. I have no intention to pretend to be a film critic, but I'm a film lover and a fan of The Addams Family, so I give my opinion.",

Jenna Ortega is the perfect Wednesday. The script is phenomenal and is not cheesy. The show is not overly gory but definitely takes a lot of suspenseful twists and turns which leaves you wanting more. I also love that they cast Christina Ricci the OG Wednesday as Marilyn Thornhill.

It's a sweet mix of Stranger Things and Harry Potter shown through the macabre eyes of Tim Burton. My only complaint was to see Gwendoline Christie's character leave so soon. It was great to see her again after Game Of Thrones. She's statuesque and a beautiful actress. I binged the entire first season in one day, and I guarantee you will too!

Addams family spinoff and it has fights...me , personally don't agree.//)\nThat's for my personal views.On other side for the more in-depth object analysation:\nI love it.The tv show drags you into story, it lively ,it's fast ,it's emotionally pulling inside.. the character development is inside.Now I understand it's pretty difficult to create a spinoff on such delightfully mastery crafted legacy as Tim's Burtons.But.. seriously? Wednesdays kung foo fing around?Lil' smart as hell black (or white?) Raven picking hand to hand (or more likely feet to head?) Fights with boys and beating em up?I mean.. c'mon..\nSmart girl, gothique-like.. at least give her a rapier next time or dagger..

The music was great, camera work, outfits. Tim Burton manages to bring his dark vision to life once again. All of this cast was amazing. They managed to give Wednesday and her Family a new spin, without loosing the kooky, spookiness of them. I couldn't tell the end of this murder mystery, until the very end. Escapism at it's best. I will forever rewatch. I truly hope Netflix renews the series for a second season.",

The setting, characters, plot, could've made for a very deep, fascinating, spooky, rich and shocking story, but I think it fell short of that. As someone who likes dark and moody, I didn't feel super connected to this. Visually it is lovely, but the dialogue could've been much better and the plot felt dry and was kind of predictable. For a teen drama, I'd say it is good and well done, for trying to live up to the reputation of the Addams Family and my expectations, it disappointed me. Once I got over my initial disappointment there was still something keeping watching. Not sure if it was the mystery or the quirkiness or just the moody tones. It is fun and watchable but I see a lot of missed potential here. My guess is the target audience is teens and possibly young adults. I see it as a fairly interesting and flavourful teen drama and would recommend it to teenagers or people who like moodiness and dark themes. If you keep your expectations to a minimum you'll probably enjoy it.",

It's good enough to make me follow through to the next episode, as in to say it is enjoyable for the most part. Eventually you'll see it for what it is, a coming of age highschool drama.The bits that aren't predictable feel more haphazard than big reveals. I'm not a fan of Wednesday in this, she becomes far too relatable, it removes the mystique and quirks of the Addams family. She constantly suffers zero consequences for her actions other than some people don't speak to her for a day. Whilst those around her risk death and life in prison because she's alway wrong. She's a terrible detective and only solves the case based on a tenuous clue from bee boy. She comes across as a spoiled brat who has never been told no. I'm not taking anything way from the actress, a great performance but maybe too colourful.The subplot involving Gomez taking the fall for Morticia was a big anticlimax. In a clear case of self-defence Gomez and his misguided chivalry complicate everything for barely any plot payoff. The fact that he \"saved the school\" is purely coincidental. This could have been a bigger part of the plot but as it is I think they could remove the whole episode and the main story would continue just fine.Don't let me stop you though, it was good enough that I did want to complete it. Just take it for what it is, a poorly written teenage drama with enough budget, gore etc to keep you interested.",

Ironically, the new Pugsley looks more like the original Gomez than Guzman does. That was another bad casting choice, but we can only assume favors were paid off for these two misjudgments. Kudos to Tim Burton for including famous taglines and characters without exploitation. The 'you rang' scene was a perfect quivering delivery of the original Lurch.

Actually, most characters, be they adults or teenagers, and monsters or \"normies\" all seem to be hurting in some way. (Even the villains.)And then there's Wednesday herself. The girl who got the heart broken as a 6-year old and decided to never care, cry or love again, and who, step by painful step, starts to change and learn to relate to others. (And tries to save them and the school, at any cost.)This is a heartwarming and very, very sad yet hopeful story, with an amazing cast of both adults and teenagers. (And a few very fun scenes.) Also, since it becomes clear very early that no one is safe, you get chills every time someone is alone in the woods (or in another creepy location) after dark. And it gets worse, because there is also several incidents of people getting attacked in the center of the city in daytime, and eventually nowhere, not even Wednesday's room at the school, is a safe place.If you want a beautiful, stylish, cute and scary coming-of-age horror story, that is heartwarming and hopeful in the midst of all the darkness, then this is absolutely the show for you.A special mention for acting goes out to Jenna Ortega and Catherine Zeta-Jones, but literally EVERY actor does an amazing job, including the one playing Thing.",

Tim Burton's style is present, I love the settings among other things but the problem is that.... They do not shine at all, they do not have moments where these details are noticed and they simply remain as something in the background.The Addams are weird in each of their versions but in this one... they almost always just say they're weird but they almost never show it.

She is great - but the role is not.Wednesday is way to unvulnerable, way to much of a Mary Sue. She basically knows everything, can everything and her only flaw is shown as another perk for her. It is hard to be excited for the plot if a perfect person is up to the task.She also is extremely mean to everyone without reason. It might be hard to identify with such a person if you are no longer a teen.She even plays the gender-card whilst - in my opinion - a Wednesday Addams should be way above those modern topics. Meaning: As perfect as she is portrayed and with parents as modern as that she should know what sexism is and what not.For example: She meets up with a son of a very famous fortune-teller and this guy tries to tell her what he learned from his dad and his expertise. She calls it mansplaining as amother trial to be as mean and unlikeable as possible.Not having the same opinion as another person - who by accident happens to be a woman - doesn't make you a sexist as Wednesday states in this scene.Harry Potter as a franchise and story (which clearly is the inspiration for Wednesday here) wouldn't have worked if Harry would have been as mean as her trying to hurt Ron and Hermine as much as possible.For me this is one big flaw that ruins a lot - unfortunately.BUT for every Person who's okay with that: Watch it.

Was a good series but felt that towards the end it's conclusion was a little rushed. A big build up to a final 'battle' which was over before it started in what could have been so much more and froth the final episodes were a little disappointing compared to the rest of the series.Felt aimed at a more teen audience when it could have been far more universal. Some good characters but could have done with some more creative. Lots of promise and a second series would be welcomed, although currently aimed at more of the same.",

My only complaints are Morticia, and the series drags a bit. It takes a couple of episodes to begin to pick up, and then it does it's best to keep your attention. However I do feel like it could have been 7 episodes rather than 8. Overall, it's well made, well acted, and not to mention the set design is spectacular.",

It was very entertaining and not clich\u00e9 which is surprising from Netflix. I loved how Wednesday never got really soft or had a major character development. She stayed true to herself, I enjoyed her character deeply. The way she didn't care and openly admitted to it was a first. It was like all those others maim protagonists who pretend they don't care, she truly didn't and it was amazing.I strongly recommend watching and hope for a second season.",

It proposed to be so amazing and have that nostalgia taste for the older ones and lessons to the younger ones, but it doesn't. The show just looks like a homemade movie inspired in Addam's Family. There's so much information in a short period of time that we can't process so many plots. We need to have notebooks to write down the wide range of loose ends. As a teenager show, the route tries to have created a romantic air, but never has a conclusion in it. No matter how the show tries, just make it's worse. The show tries to adapt the history of a really deep character, Wednesday, opening she sides wide, as being gothic and also adapting itself to the colorful ambient. The show tries so hard to do it that can't take deeper the act of Wednesday or none of the characters, making them so egoistic as their original generation's and so egoistic as the crew generation. The Show fails to represent teenagers in general that seems the whole series has been taken out of American Pie or, as the show promotes, TikTok videos. The series just confirm to the public how a big production can't show in a real form how the so-called \"Gen Z\" is. The performance of the cast is amazing, but doesn't is in the right place.They should pick actors and actresses literally with 12-17 years old, as it was supposed to be. The job of cast that was picked was excellent and express the stereotype that all people are all the time trying not to be.",

I have no idea if another season would come up, but if it does, it should be fully directed by Tim Burton, not others. The web is full of chick flicks, normal and boring movies, he genuinely brings a different twist to a story, makes a show watchable. Others, just ruin it.",

Nevertheless, what's the point? I loved it! Sometimes we just have to embrace a good show and enjoy it, without trying to look for \"mistakes\".I can say that i was felling pretty confident with my ability of solving murder mystery's, after reading countless books about it. But with every episode i had to reconsider my suspects. I had to finish the tv show in that day, because simply needed it to know the end!It kept me hooked throughout the whole time, and let me tell you, it's been a while since that happened.Wednesday is a must watch!!!",

The casting has been perfect. It also gives Wednesday more depth and seems as though it'll add more depth to the rest of the Addams. A nice dark detective-like series with goth and monster influence.

Shes also getting less pale than she was before, whether that just came across to me or was just like that to show that she had changed in the face of feelings etc. Put aside. The episode was really good the ending left you wondering why they released the villain why didnt he kill anyone with the staff so nobody was ever really hurt and the headmistress was just killed straight away even though she had great potential and could certainly fight, the potential was not used which is tragic. But you can still leave the ending as it is, Im looking forward to the next season and I hope that mistakes like those made by the headmistress or in the final fight dont happen again, otherwise the series was really good.",
