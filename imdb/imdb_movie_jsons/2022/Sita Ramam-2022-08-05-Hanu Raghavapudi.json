They just comment on what ever they want to tell just because they hate DS or director or rashmika idk. But actually this movie is a masterpiece and deserves to be a masterpiece with lots and lots of positive talks. I'm kannadiga and this is my first non Kannada movie review. Since I loved this movie with my whole heart.If you are thinking of going to this movie by analyzing these comments then you should definitely ignore the hatred ones.",

I have no complaint about song department as movie is turned out as a absolute gem . Finally i would like to conclude that if love to watch love story, then this movie will give you immense happiness. A sure shot masterpiece and a Kohinoor as well for me .",

One of the finest from Dulqar Salman and Mrunal too was treat to watch. There is not much for Rashmika Mandana but she too did good whatever was given to her. The narrative give you thrills of a suspense movie within a beautifully woven periodic love story and that credit goes to the director.",

Sita Ramam is a must watch!! The director makes sure the movie is well connected and keeps its audience engaged. I watched it here in USA and am going to take 2-3 more friends to watch it with me. However i will ask atleast 10 friends to not watch Brahmastra because whatever money we spend on tickets of Brahmastra will be used to fund Pakistan. Hence we will boycottBrahmastra and support Sita Ramam.Jai Hind.",

To get the whole feel, you should watch this in big screen. Initially I thought the cast is bit odd for Telegu movie, but it is the best one. My suggestion watch it in Telugu version instead of the dubbed one.There is good amount of sentiment and romance throughout the movie. In fact my eyes got moist towards the end of the movie. I felt so tightened in my chest in this movie after \"96\".The movie flow is so feel good from the beginning.

            "content": "You almost feel like watching Veer-Zaara as soon as this movie ends.An Indian army major saving a princess carrying the weight of expectations of her grandparents wishes. The sacrifice and an unprecedented love, the wait for eternity, that transcends caste, society and even borders, so many parallels.For the generation that has grown with Veer-Zaara, this is a sort of tribute to it to. Not the scale and larger than life protagonists, but with all the beauty and soul.Sita Ramam is a beautiful movie, that takes time to engage the audience into the worlds of Ram and Sita. Set in 60s and 80s, where the feeling of love was more about the anticipation, of small things like talking over landline phone, waiting to meet, chasing your crush (not digital stalking), almost makes you wonder what is that technology has added to in our lives, rather than taking away. While the names Sita and Ram do blend it by interval and you feel like destiny playing its part to make the two meet, the movie imo did not completely justify using these names and I do not know where it moved away from that to a delivering a more diplomatic stance. The name Noorjahan (real name of Sita) is completely lost by end of the movie, while making sense, the movie did not completely transition into it. May be the times we live don't allow us another \"Veer\" meeting \"Zaara\".Best works for Dalqueer and Mrunal so far I am sure and will go down in their books as a milestone film in their careers.Took one point away for the end. I know what the director was trying to do and clear the stain on Ram, though felt it was not required. We must not forget that HE is our protector and not the other way round. But then again, such are the times we live in where we feel the need to protect even his portrayals.",

She looks too gorgeous in Sarees, probably she could become a heartthrob for many youngsters in the coming years!Although role of Rashmika is limited, she still has played her part.Probably it is one of the coolest love stories in the recent past and many love scenes flow like a cold breeze in the minds of audience!!

Every single instance in this movie doesn't work, but the ones that does work, works very well.It has the old school charming romance between two strangers who meets through letters and fate. Best thing about Sita Ramam is the performances by both of the lead actors. Mrunal Thakur is not an addition to the list of pretty faces. She can act too. Dulquer is simply one of the most charming actor in the country. Such roles are his strong suit and he owns it.The rest of the cast is pretty overdramatic or bad.Almost all the emotional and romantic scenes are great, while the rest of the scenes felt meh. A huge credit in the movie's success goes to the music director who did a fine job with the songs and background score.The forced religious harmony was unnecessary. Like the scene in which the guy from the embassy and the soldier says Jai Sriram and Allahu Akbar. Also, there is one guy who keeps saying \"what a love story\" so many times. It was a poor move by the film maker.Rashmika's character had some potential but ended up as a wasted opportunity.

Also scene composition and frames were well made to the characters emotion. Music and songs adds soulfulness to every portions. It lifts the audience emotion.The artists who acted in this film were well fit to their characters. Especially Rashmika gave her best performance and she is the right option for her character. Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur were the right choice for a love pair.The production and art department have given their best work in a way that the audience can feel that on screen.

The makeup department has also given their best.The screenplay could have been made some more stronger as some parts were predictable to the audience.Finally, this team gave their best by giving the best film. Goosebumps and emotional guarented. One of the best melodrama film.",

            "content": "Sita Ramam (2022) :\nMovie Review -Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur play the romantic couple in Hanu Raghavapudi's period romantic drama, \"Sita Ramam.\" Telugu cinema is aware of Yash Chopra's cult romantic tale, \"Veer Zaara,\" and has tried to give it a competition with Sita Ramam. So Dulquer Salmaan is Shah Rukh Khan, Mrunal Thakur is Preity Zinta, Rashmika Mandanna is Rani Mukerji with a twist, and I am not sure who actually plays the part of Manoj Bajpayee. Well, that's it. You get most of the ideas from these comparisons that will surely excite you for the film. Sita Ramam is all about love, emotions, bonding, and sacrifice, with a fantastic touch of patriotism and India vs Pakistan relations. Veer Zaara also had everything mentioned above, but it had a happy ending which Sita Ramam doesn't have. Oh my god, did I just give a big spoiler? Wait, let me rectify my mistake. So, Sita Ramam has a happy ending too, but in a different zone. It's not a regular happy ending. Hanu Raghavapudi's period romantic drama lives up to the hype and delivers what's promised and what was expected.Sita Ramam is about Ram (Dulquer Salmaan), an orphan and an Indian Army officer, who falls in love with Sita (Mrunal Thakur). Does Sita have anything to hide from him? You'll get answers in the film. The love birds are divided, and now a Pakistani girl, Aafrin (Rashmika Mandanna), is on the mission of finding the whereabouts of Sita to deliver one of Ram's letters. During the journey, Aafrin, who initially hates India and Indians, learns about some shocking events from the past, and evolves around them. Now desperate to meet Sita and Ram, will Aafrin find it then? That's all you get to see in Sita Ramam.The performances of all the leading cast members are fine in the film. Dulquer Salmaan doesn't have the image of a romantic boy like SRK. Instead, he is known for his versatility. That's what he does here too. Dulquer looks handsome, cute and innocent, and you fall in love with the kind of man he is. His acting has several aspects, and he fulfils almost every criteria in the film. On the other hand, Mrunal Thakur looks no less than an angel. Such a breathtaking beauty! You'll fall in love with her instantly. Has she ever looked so gorgeous in any film? I doubt it. The second lady, Rashmika, is known for her beautiful face and is hailed as a national crush. So how can she go wrong with this kind of role? Not just the leading trio, but the supporting cast has also done a nice job here. Tharun Bhascker, Sumanth, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Vennela Kishore, Sachin Khedekar, Jisshu Sengupta, Bhumika Chawla, and others have done well in their roles.Sita Ramam has a very good storyline that offers a fulfilling and emotional romantic tale. However, it takes long 160 minutes to do it, which wasn't really needed. The songs make it a longer film, but all the songs worked perfectly in those situations. And what are romantic films without songs in India? Nothing. So it had to be there. But does that bore you or waste your time? I'd say, No. The screenplay could've trimmed a few scenes and shortened the length, but by the time you reach the climax, you forget about the long journey you had till that time. The cinematography is spectacular in the songs. Those icy mountains, that palace, Kashmir's border and other locations add to your viewing experience in the same amount as what is expected from a period film.Hanu Raghavapudi's vision to look at things from a romantic point of view really boosts the essence of Sita Ramam. After all, a romantic drama is entitled to have something filmy, and yet he makes his points very clear while exploring the narrative. His storytelling is a bit outdated, but as we know, romance is like old wine. The taste just gets better and better by the time. Those two-decade old formulas of Veer Zaara have become a part of nostalgia, and Sita Ramam awakens all of them beautifully. The film has more variety and conflicts, which only add to your interest. If you are missing those pure romantic dramas from the bygone days, then watch Sita Ramam to relive the golden phase of romance again in 2022. As a whole, Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur's modern version of Veer Zaara will make you fall in love again.RATING - 7/10*",

Everything from the story, the screenplay, acting, direction, music (aaha), cinematography, locations, costumes, art, etc have been so good, so well done that the film's length doesn't make you wonder about its longevity. It is no short of a wonder. The story though starts off as a simple goal with ulterior motives for an Afreen, drives her to tell us about the characters Ram and Sita. The film steals the show in its subtleness and it's era of love, keeping every old charm alive. The music is simply soothing while the locations add to the beauty of it. The film never bored me at any point in time and is definitely watchable with family. It's worth every minute of those 160 minutes. Available on Prime in Telugu, Tamil & Malayalam.",

            "content": "Dulquer Salmaan has pretty much exhausted all the lover-boy tropes and cinematic cliches in his short but substantial filmography, from the college kid finding his way in life in films like \"Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi (2013)\" to the more worldly, commitment-phobe in \"OK Kanmani (2015)\" and it has seemed like he is playing the same characters over and over again in recent projects. So it is with much trepidation and lack of any expectation that I heard the announcement of yet another romance drama with the young scion of Mollywood in the lead, that too in Telugu.The man, however, seems to thrive on throwing conventions and expectations to the wind, combining forces with director Hanu Raghavapudi and two charming leading ladies to deliver one of the most gut-wrenching romantic tales of the year, that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. The period story set against the backdrop of war and terrorism, immaculate production design, colorful costumes, combined with an intrepid lead romantic pairing make \"Sita Ramam\" the perfect concoction of romance that the box office has been missing for some time.Rashmika Mandanna stars as \"Afreen\" a cynical, rebellious Pakistani teenager in 1980s London, tasked by her grandfather on his deathbed to return a mysterious letter to an Indian lady who he was never able to locate during his dying days. As the stubborn youngster starts her search for the peculiar person named \"Sita Mahalakshmi\" (Mrunal Thakur) addressed in the letter, she uncovers more clues that unravel her story as well as that of her dashing lover, \"Lieutenant Ram\" (Dulquer) and their star-crossed romance during the war-ravaged 1960s in Kashmir. While the first half gets sluggish and boring in places, the second half reveals that these initial set-up scenes were crucial to complete the intricate character arcs of our three principal protagonists.Director Hari Raghavapudi and cinematographer PS Vinod spare no detail in capturing the scenic beauty and natural aesthetic of Kashmir and the stirring songs rendered by Vishal Chandrasekhar become the cherry on top, propelling the love story to another plane altogether. Dulquer Salmaan's natural disarming charm and Mrunal Thakur's grace and elegance make a devastating pairing, one you will instinctively find yourself rooting for from their first scene together. I am especially glad that the capable actor in Rashmika Mandanna finally got a fully-fleshed out role that showcased her undeniable talent, that of the stubborn, ambitious but flawed \"Afreen\".\"Sita Ramam\" is the epic love story the industry has been desperately missing for a long time and it is curious that it is Tollywood that keeps churning out these innovative romance flicks, at least recently, be it the heartwarming musical \"Love Story (2021)\" or the more grandiose \"Shyam Singha Roy (2021)\". Take a bow Hanu Raghavapudi and team for mounting a project of such scale, vision, production value, and strong writing and for telling us a universally appealing story in such an emotionally touching way. Embrace this magnum-opus in theatres to experience the emotion that is Sita Ramam. This movie will stay with me for a long time. Highly recommended!",

Even though, I happen to stumble upon such works quite often.Initially, I didn't have any plans whatsoever to watch 'Sita-Ramam'; but for the last few days, an array of encouraging reviews coming from literally all corners of the country convinced me otherwise. And therefore, I made up my mind and finally decided to jump on the bandwagon.And now, I feel regret.I mean no disrespect, and I'm in no shape and form ridiculing other people's preferences but I do wonder why so many people felt a profound connection whereas I could not, despite my frantic attempts. Leaving out the technical expertise, music, and the lead pair's (Dulqueer & Mrunal) ceaseless charm, I find this one to be nothing but a meandering affair at best.It just didn't work for me, and bear in mind, that has nothing to do with my lack of affection for Romance, make no mistake, I can and I will forever appreciate a good film, no matter what! But the harsh reality is it is not a good film, at least it is not from my perspective, according to my taste.Usually, I don't like to bring up unwarranted comparisons, but here I'm making an exception by comparing this to a movie that came out last year from the same industry (Telugu) i.e. Shyam Singha Roy! Even if the core notions are slightly different, various bits of the screenplay did share some uncanny resemblances (The romantic set-up, ending closure, etc)And I will say this, that was a much better execution, yes, it had its own set of issues, correct, but on the whole, it was a movie that made me fall in love with the lead couple (Nani & Sai Pallavi) as well as with the characters they played respectively.

Also, Mrunal's sarees are gorgeous and the blouses worth copying. :DYet, the film did not manage to keep me captivated. :( :( I wanted to like it but I could not.Firstly, the length is unnecessary. The film drags in several places. At least two songs had to be cut down. Thematically, they are repetitive. Also, some comedy scenes are superfluous.Secondly, some questions remain unanswered. Why does an army officer, who's posted at the border in Kashmir, start and continue exchange of letters with an unknown person? And why does he go looking for 'her'? Was that not risky? S/he could've been a spy.Also, when she meets Dulquer's character for the first time, why has Mrunal's character gone to Kashmir? For photography? If that's her hobby, how come there's no mention of it later?Plus, why did Abu Tariq not deliver the letter earlier?If Rashmika's character has grown up in Abu Tariq's family, how does she come to hate India?I found several loose ends in the movie. The direction is somewhat amateurish. Although I am a fan of Dulquer, I want to see him in different roles now. Most of the character actors, too, are wasted, I feel.All in all, I don't see myself watching this movie again. :( If I have the strong urge to watch a Dulquer movie, I'll watch 'Charlie' instead.PS: I watched Sita Ramam in Malayalam, with subtitles.",

            "content": "Sita Ramam is a beautiful movie, which follows the life of a orphan soldier from the Indian army, Ram. Ram is compassionate and tries to save lives rather then take them. He serves on the Kashmir border and that's where during a conflict with some terrorists and angry citizens he saves the life of Princess Noor Jahan. He doesn't get a chance to see her properly or find out about who she was. However he does stop the conflict from escalating without any bloodshed or death.Later the heroic actions of Ram and his squad are reported on the Indian news, including the fact that Ram is an orphan. What follows is many Indians around India send Ram letters claiming to be family members. From brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles to Sita Mahalakshmi who claims to be his wife. Her letter is also the only one without a return address.What follows is Ram's attempts to find her and eventually meet her and the love that blooms, develops and grows between them. What he doesn't know throughout nearly the entire movie is that Sita Mahalakshmi is actually Princess Noor Jahan. He instead thinks that she is a dance teacher at the palace who is teaching Bharatanatyam to the princess. She goes by the alias Sita Mahalakshmi or Sita for short when around Ram. Problems arise when her brother takes over 60 Crores loss of property and assets due to the Sultan of Oman seizing all assets in the country. The only way to recover is for Princees Noor Jahan to marry the Sultans son the Prince of Oman and tie their two families together. Sita however has fallen in love with a common man, a Indian soldier named Ram serving on the Kashmir border with a monthly salary of 600 Rupees.Sita Ramam follows the love story between Ram and Sita from their first meeting to Ram's eventual marriage proposal and Noor Jahan giving up her title of Princess, her palace and all her wealth to be with Ram. They get a happy few weeks together and on the day that Sita wants to reveal who she really is to Ram he is given a secret mission with his squad to infiltrate and eliminate the terrorist Ansari. Ram will never see Sita/Noor Jahan again.The mission is carried out without issue but as they're leaving the cries of a little girl Waheeda in the burning house causes compassionate Ram to turn back go into the burning building and save her which leads to him and Vishnu, another soldier, being captured by the Pakistan army. Brigadier Abu Tariq from the Pakistan army works out a prisoner exchange deal, to swop Ram and Vishnu in return for a Pakistan officer. However things don't go exactly the way it was planned as Pakistan is only willing to swop 1 of their prisoners. Ram being the kind, compassionate and caring person that he his puts his own love and feelings aside so that Vishnu can return to his family in India rather then him. Pakistan want one more thing, the location of Indian army bases. Vishnu gives in to blackmail and tells them everything while Ram stands strong. However Vishnu is released and the blame for the base locations being leaked is pinned on Ram whose branded a traitor.Ram writes a letter which he gives to Brigadier Abu Tariq, who has adopted Waheeda as his granddaughter, to deliver. Minutes later Ram is executed. Brigadier Abu Tariq tries in vain to deliver Ram's letter to Sita Mahalakshmi at the Noor Jahan palace. 20 years later Brigadier Abu Tariq has passed away and before his granddaughter Afreen can claim all his assets she has to deliver a letter to Sita Mahalakshmi. In his last letter to Afreen he writes that it's a debt that needs to be repayed. Afreen sets out on a journey to find Sita Mahalakshmi and deliver the letter. Along the way she learns about Ram and Sita, who she soon realizes is actually the Nawab of Hyderabad. She comes across Vishnu who wants to stop the letter being delivered for fear that it may implicate him selling out his country.The letter gets delivered by a friend of Afreen's who has been helping her throughout her journey. Princess Noor Jahan who now goes by Sita Mahalakshmi gets to read the last words written to her from the love of her life Ram. With Afreen as witness and the letter from Ram, Noor Jahan/Sita launches an investigation against Vishnu Sharma (Ram's soldier friend who betrayed him and the country) who kills himself with his service revolver.The movie ends with Sita and Afreen hugging one another. Along with the letter, Sita received a newspaper clipping with the title \" Princess Noor Jahan of Hyderabad being in love with a common man\" which means that at some point Ram had found out who she really was, that she was the Nawab of Hyderbad and a Muslim, but didn't care and continued to love her, even more if anything, to give up her status and wealth for him. Afreen also finds out from Vishnu Sharma during her journey that she is Waheeda, the girl Ram had saved from being burned alive and who had caused him to be caught by the Pakistan army.Sita Ramam, a story about love between a common Indian soldier and the Princess Of Hyderabad. About a man who saved a little girl from Pakistan and who lost his life and the chance to see or touch the love of his life ever again. It's narrated from the year 1985 through Afreen's eyes with flashbacks showing you Ram and Noor's meeting etc and everything that occured in 1965. It is a beautiful, well directed movie that shows love breaks down all boundaries, love transcends all. Even 20 years after Ram's death, Noor Jahan/Sita still loves Ram with all her heart and with the help of Afreen proves Ram's innocence and restore his name and honour in the Indian army. She also accepts his honours from the army as his wife.The cast is truly amazing as well, with Dulquer Salmaan who plays Lt. Ram delivering an award winning performance. Mrunal Thakur plays Princess Noor Jahan/Sita Mahalakshmi and looks absolutely stunning while delivering the performance of a life time. Together Dulquer and Mrunal steal the show with their superb acting, looks and on-screen chemistry. Rashmika Mandanna also does a good job in her role as Waheeda/Afreen. The casting was just perfect for the movie, with Dulquer and Mrunal really bringing their characters to life on screen and making them feel like real people to the viewer. I nearly teared up at the ending...I will end this review by saying that Sita Ramam deserves a 10/10 in all respects, however I can only bring myself to give it a 9/10 at most, because of that ending. I can't give it a 10/10 when I see that ending and know that Ram and Sita never got to see each other again or be together. They never got to spend the rest of their lives with one another. If I was Ram I would have fought tooth and nail to be the one sent back to India, or sad as it is to say, I wouldn't have gone back into that burning house to rescue Waheeda. My mind would have been focused on escape and getting back to Sita. If it wasn't for him saving Waheeda, instead of Sita/Noor being alone for 20 years by the time 1985 comes along, she and Ram would have been married and living happily for the last 20 years, probably even had little princes and princesses of their own at that point. Ram is a much better man then me, I would have thought of myself and my Sita first and foremost, rather then thinking of a innocent little girl or the family of my fellow soldier(who turned out to be a spineless traitor). So 9/10 from me, Sita Ramam is what cinema is all about, give it a watch, enjoy it and be ready with your tissues for the ending.",

            "content": "Director Hanu Raghavapudi has definitely created a classic love story with Sita Ramam. Despite having read an important part of the climax it had the same impact making me cry a little. I loved the nostalgia it created and it felt a little reminiscent of Mani Ratnam's love stories in a good way.I heard some calling it predictable but that's the wrong word, it's slightly familiar. Story is not the most unique or unpredictable it has slight hints but it's not very predictable either and all the emotional moments still landed for me at least. The familiarity was utilized well to create a filling of nostalgia especially for those who love some classic love stories from the Golden Age of Indian Cinema in the 90s. Sometimes a story with a hint of familiarity can be truly taken to the next level with proper writing, performances, and taking. The movie still goes in a very unique way with an interesting screenplay which is a tad reminiscent of Mahanati's VD-Sam setup but works really well in this case and it's all tied together in a beautiful way.The movie is truly beautiful and is setup in a seeminly poetic manner, and the screenplay and twists landed so well. The movie managed to show the friction between Hindus and Muslims with such a poetic and unbiased light without putting either religion down. Kudos to the director for achieving that feat without getting unnecessary controversies and showing all as equal in the end. Some people complained about the movie being a little slow but I didn't have that problem, I was extremely immersed and even forgot to eat the snacks I brought.Dulqueer Salmaan is really good in the role and extremely charismatic which the movie calls for and I can't think anyone else who balances that charisma and the emotional notes that well. Mrunal maintains the same level of charisma and holds the emotional beats so well making this movie feel more poetic. I can't imagine a single other person in the roles of Ram and Seetha. Sumanth surprised me with his performance and the character in general made me dislike him and sympathize with him in an odd way. Tharun Bascker was fun to watch and Rashmika was another surprise with how well she performed and her character design was done really well.Overall a really beautiful movie with great taking which is making me sure that Hanu overcame all his problems with previous films to make a vintage love story which I hope stands the test of time.",

Watched it on amazon with English subtitles waiting for the hindi version. Mrunal looks so elegant may be the best look and the best acting of her career. Rashmika too looked awesome in her natural look. Dulquer Salman is slso amazing in his army officer look. Overall it's a 10/10 movie. I am sure it's a complete family entertainer.",

He lives the role of Lt Ram and this would be one of his finest performances till date.Mrunal Thakur as Sita looks gorgeous and it is difficult to take your eyes off her. She gives a powerful nuanced peformance going through all the emotions. Her ability to convey emotions with her expressive eyes lifts the character of Sita to a different level. One of her best perfrmance till date.Another thing that works for the movie is the chemistry between Dulquer & Mrunal.Rashmika is good as Afreen is good and so are all the other supporting cast.",

He easily meets the women who was writing him letters and there was no suspense at all. Sitamahalxmi is a princess from royal family but roams alone without any security. Ram and Sitamahalaxmi always look fresh in all scene with full makeup and perfect hairs. This movie has shown that there are good army officers in pakistan and nobody has any problem with it. The climax was very funny and rushed. They just belive the contents of letter after 20 years.Rashmika is such a bad actor and total waste in this movie. DS as ram was very good and loved his style. MT as sita was very average and her expression were same for entire movie. The chemistry of both actors were average. Unwanted comedy scenes are added in between.",

Mrunal Thakur were brilliant.Having said that, the movie was not without flaws like every movie this movie had few flaws, like Rashmika Mandanna overacting. Some melodrama which is fine that goes with the story, the movie dragged a little bit, the editor could have done a better job.Overall, a solid 7 star movie, so question is why I gave 9 stars, to be honest to counter the Hindu extremist hatred I had to bump to 9 stars.Go and watch the movie, it's beautiful with awesome cinematography and beautiful acting and chemistry between Dulquer Salmaan & Mrunal Thakur. Mrunal Thaukar really looked beautiful and she did an awesome job for Sita.",

            "content": "I watched Sita Ramam last night on Primevideo in orig. Telugu w/Eng. Subs.Initially the film appeared to be a typical fantasy musical romance like many others of this genre, but the story is much more than that and it was gripping till the very end.The film begins in London where Afreen (Rashmika Mandana) an aggressive student activist of Pak origin who hates Indians is compelled as a condition to claim her inheritance from her Pak army grandfather Maj. Abu Tarik (Sachin Khedekar), to travel to Hyderabad to deliver a 20 year old undelivered letter written by a long missing Indian Army person Ram (Dulquer Salman) to his wife Sitamahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur). But there is no address for Sita and Afreen must take the help of Balaji (Tharun Bhasker) to trace Ram's former Army colleagues and staff in the erstwhile palace of Princess Noor Jehan to execute her mission.No Further Spoilers .. its a new film and definitely worth watching .. so watch this film to see how the narration plays out.The music by Vishal Chandrasekharan is quite good, the cinematography and locations are beautiful. Its a big budget movies so there are also some songs shot inexplicably in Gujarat in what certainly seems to be the fabulous UNESCO Rani Ni Vav Queen's Stepwell in Patan, and in the pond of the exquisite Modhera Temple. Every actor has convincingly portrayed their respective character, there are a few gut wrenching and poignant moments, the storyline succeeds in going beyond the much cliched Ind Pak hyped hate filled dramatisations that several other films propound. Sita Ramam is not about this, but more about the love between two individuals caught in unfortunate circumstances of their time. Much of the film is shot in well constructed flashback and period mode.Could have been half an hour shorter.",

It has references of Ramayana throughout and tries to portray the story in a different way and time period. Dulqueer and Mrunal has a great chemistry between and i enjoyed every moments they were together. But there are lot of cringe scenes through out but it is necessary for the story and with out it the movie would not move further. But taking the fact that in those period of time I don't know for sure but it could have happened like shown in the movie, for instance Ram gets a letter from a women she writes he is her brother and should come and name her daughter and she send some snacks.But the problem with me is that I am a person who sees movies for entertainment, and i like a happily ever after ending. I couldn't accept the fact that Sita and Ram are not united by the end. Matter of fact I don't like how \"Chitram\" ends so i have an alternative ending for that movie according to my imagination where the two meet again. So from my POV I would have liked Sita and Ram living a happy life together. I accept the fact that she proved Ram is not a traitor and got him his redemption but for me an alternative ending would be, Ram somehow was still alive and finding out that he was not a traitor our government makes a deed and brings him back to India and the two unites.For me after watching the movie it felt like a beautiful love story but I still like the pair being united at the end.",

There were no unnecessary VFX or unique camera angles or different set locations. I felt some sort of purity, in this poetic story line. Definitely a one time watchable movie. I'm giving this 8 because it was not that perfect, the only VFX the movie had was the element of Fire which did not meet the expectation of realism. And a few camera cuts were a little off.

It's better than Ok Kanmani and Charlie combined, take it from me \ud83d\ude01. I think what works for the film beyond the grand scale at which it's mounted is how lovable the central characters are. Their chemistry sizzles and they both sparkle on screen, so everything around them naturally becomes appealing. From the moment Rashmika, who plays an extended cameo, decides to take the plunge and help herself by helping Ram and Sita, we know Sita Ramam could become everything that Radhe Shyam promised. Each frame is like a therapy for sore eyes, such is the brilliant cinematography. Although the songs are just hummable, the BGM is truly soul stirring and there are so many epic moments in both halves that I probably need to watch this film again just to revel in them. Hanu had given a flop in his previous film Padi Padi Lechu Manasu, which although was good, was also a little overdone. So credit to DQ and Mrunal for trusting the maker in him and giving us such a poetic love story. There is also a very intelligently woven subplot featuring the fight against Pak supported Mujhahideen. The cowardice of the countries that decided to ban the film is truly astonishing though. About the lead pair: Mrunal is gorgeous and her costume designer deserves every accolade in the book. She slips into the role of Sita so easily that you really can't take your eyes off her. Dulquer brings his career best performance in the role of soldier Ram and his honest performance will leave many teary eyed. I thought he's going through an identity crisis of sorts but hell no, Sita Ramam is the best decision he's made till date. The fact that its Malayalam version was almost full in a theatre in London and that the film's growing organically among the buffs, show there's something there. Sita Ramam is not just another love story, it's an emotional, epic and eternal tale of unanswered and unfulfilled love that's sure to last the test of times and leave everyone watching, supremely satisfied.",

So factor this in my exaggerated review here.Dulquer makes the movie an outright fantasia. You would want to be in it forever. I wondered earlier why Mrunal Thakur was cast, but not a doubt after watching her first minute. Perfect casting - everyone - backed by a scintillating score by Vishal Chandrasekhar.I am writing this review during the intermission. For me it's IMDb 11. Will be back soon in the movie theatre, to watch again and again, till it lasts.Intermission over, movie over, I drove back home in a state of stupor. Still haven't recovered.

DQ as Ram , Mrunal as Sita were mesmerizing.Rashmika and Tarun bascker added a good flavour to the movie.Music is at its best .No nee to tell about this , every movie of Hanu sir has this soothing and peacefull music.Vishal Chandrasheker did a good job.SP Charan sir voice nostalgically reminded of SPB garu.Coming to the Story point of view , the script is well built and the dialouges were too poetic.A dialoge in this movie goes as \" Kurukshetram lo Ravana Samharam , Yudhapu velugu lo Sita Swayamvaram \" Good one right ? , well there are many in this movie.The sets and the visuals are so brilliant and hats off to the director that he pulled off everything at 30cr.Highly recommended to watch .Itlu\nPavan Teja.",

Story, Acting, Cinematography everything was top notch in this movie. What a beautiful way to show a love story and not feeling cringed even for a minute in the whole film. I will suggest everyone to just watch this spectacular movie. This movie is just class apart not your regular cringe love story. This movie shows a beautiful story without any adult scenes and can be watched with the family. Backdrop of war, terrorism in Kashmir, spying everything was very masterfully integrated with the story. You feel like you have been transported to the 60's and 80's.",

There, she is tasked to fulfil her grandfather's last wish of delivering a letter written two decades ago by Lieutenant Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) to his lover Sita (Mrunal Thakur). Only if she delivers to Sita, Afreen will inherit her grandfather's property. This leads her on a path to Hyderabad, India in search of Sita without knowing who she is or who Ram is, unraveling their beautiful love story & also revealing why delivering this letter is Afreen's debt to Ram & Sita.The film is rich in visuals, kudos to cinematographer & even the art director to ensure such beautiful frames. The narrative pace is definitely slow & with a runtime of 160 odd minutes, it did feel lengthy. But it was the lead pair performance that held the film together till the end. It does take it's own sweet time in the first half to establish these two characters with non-linear narrative, but a strong interval point makes it all worth it.It is indeed the second half where the film truly works it's charm. It definitely had been a while since I watched a dedicated love story like this, where the director doesn't compromise or even deviate from his vision. The result being most cheesiest of lines actually working because the director along with the actors, succeeded in getting the audience invested in these characters, no matter how predictable the screenplay was.",

Could have been a simple yet great love story without the condescending Bollywood type preaching in matters that doesn't concern the love story at all. Taking liberty of undermining Indian army (but appeasing the Pakistani army) in order to glorify your lead characters is just unacceptable. This preaching attitude of directors and writers is ruining the movie experience off late. People who do not know about Kashmir shouldn't venture to show their version of \"truth\", specially when the movie doesn't need that narrative for it's purpose.Making is also not that great with harsh transitions between scenes. Except the lead characters, all other characters are non relatable and less believable. Rashmika continues to be ordinary on screen. Only saving grace is probably the music.All the positive reviews are either paid or biased. I've definitely seen much better movies from the same industry.",

            "content": "Story by Hanu Raghavapudi, Sita Ramam is like a fairy tale. In 1985, Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna) is a Pakistani rabble-rouser studying in London who is set in her ways and harbours an intense dislike for anything and everything Indian. She might be from the other side of the border but her feelings mirror that of youngsters on this side of the border even today. Early on in the film she's told that the solution for her misplaced anger is love, a notion she brushes off as the sayings of an old man. But when she begrudgingly decides to deliver a lost letter to India, she's transported back to 1964 where the poetic love story of Lt. Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) and Sita Mahalakhsmi (Mrunal Thakur) unfolds. He is an orphan; she is a woman with a secret she can't reveal. Even as Afreen and her begrudging partner-in-crime Balaji (Tharun Bhascker) learn everything there is to known about Sita and Ram, she might end up learning a lesson or two along the way.On the surface Sita Ramam is nothing more than the love story of two people from different worlds falling in love while writing letters to each other. But dig beneath all the opulence, old-school glamour, beautiful clothes, VFX butterflies and extravagant sets, you find a story that has its heart set in humanity and love.Hanu does a good job of showing, instead of preaching, how irrespective of what god you pray to and what country you belong to, it's only humanity that matters at the end of the day. Even as not everyone in the armies on both sides of the border believe this, Ram and Major Tariq (Sachin Khedekar) inadvertently set off a butterfly effect with their empathy that doesn't just touch numerous lives, it even leaves them better off. And beyond that, Sita and Ram do have a love story that makes you want to root for them.Dulquer Salman and Mrunal Thakur steal the show in Sita Ramam. For a film like this to work, you need to be invested in their story and the actors do a good job in ensuring that. They breathe life into their characters and it doesn't hurt that Mrunal looks breath-taking in the film. Rashmika, Tharun, Sachin and Sumanth do a good enough job while Vennela Kishore and Murli Sharma are a hoot.A lot of able actors from Priyadarshi and Rahul Ravindran to Tinu Anand and Gautam Vasudev Menon make short appearances that work well for the film. PS Vinod, Shreyaas Krishna's cinematography and Vishal Chandrasekhar's music truly aid in bringing the world of Sita Ramam to life. But a special shoutout must be given to art director Irfan Rashid Sheikh and costume designer Sheetal Sharma for transporting the audience so seamlessly to the 60s and 80s.On the whole Sita Ramam is a beautiful love story. The film has a decent first half and great second half. The scintillating performances by all the lead cast, the pleasing narrative, and the poetic writing will make you poignant and heartwarming. As the film is centered around a simple love story and war, it may not be overwhelming to the masses. Almost all the departments did a superlative job. Director Hanu gave us a beautiful and aesthetic love story that should surely be enjoyed on big screens. You can surely watch this film without a doubt. It is worth all your money.",

As melodramatic love stories go, this one stays pretty close to form. I like the premise--a soldier (Ram) receives letters from the mysterious Sita claiming to be his wife. But this one does very little different from expectation--there are echoes of The Notebook and pretty much every well-known love story including Roman Holiday. But while the latter remains a delicious vignette in a princess's life, Sita Ramam drags it out and overstays its welcome. Is it watchable? Sure. But ultimately forgettable.",

May be in real life too terrorist do that kind of conspiracy for creating discrimination and misunderstanding to civilians for Indian army !

It's better than Ok Kanmani and Charlie combined, take it from me \ud83d\ude01. I think what works for the film beyond the grand scale at which it's mounted is how lovable the central characters are. Their chemistry sizzles and they both sparkle on screen, so everything around them naturally becomes appealing. From the moment Rashmika, who plays an extended cameo, decides to take the plunge and help herself by helping Ram and Sita, we know Sita Ramam could become everything that Radhe Shyam promised. Each frame is like a therapy for sore eyes, such is the brilliant cinematography. Although the songs are just hummable, the BGM is truly soul stirring and there are so many epic moments in both halves that I probably need to watch this film again just to revel in them. Hanu had given a flop in his previous film Padi Padi Lechu Manasu, which although was good, was also a little overdone. So credit to DQ and Mrunal for trusting the maker in him and giving us such a poetic love story. There is also a very intelligently woven subplot featuring the fight against Pak supported Mujhahideen. The cowardice of the countries that decided to ban the film is truly astonishing though. About the lead pair: Mrunal is gorgeous and her costume designer deserves every accolade in the book. She slips into the role of Sita so easily that you really can't take your eyes off her. Dulquer brings his career best performance in the role of soldier Ram and his honest performance will leave many teary eyed. I thought he's going through an identity crisis of sorts but hell no, Sita Ramam is the best decision he's made till date. The fact that its Malayalam version was almost full in a theatre in London and that the film's growing organically among the buffs, show there's something there. Sita Ramam is not just another love story, it's an emotional, epic and eternal tale of unanswered and unfulfilled love that's sure to last the test of times and leave everyone watching, supremely satisfied.",

The end did have me tearing. The place where Ram and Sita were living in Kashmir was more than what Ram could afford and since Sita hadn't revealed that she was Princess NoorJahan, it seemed illogical. The comedy was forced and many good actors were wasted.Dulquer Salman was his usual charming self. Mrunal Thakur looked good but didn't like her acting much. Both the leads had decent chemistry. Rashmika was decent.Overall wish the movie was shorter n since it is on OTT it is working, sitting in theater for so long would have been torturous.",

Cute and innocent face of hers brings up more reality to the character.P. S - Gave a 9-star 'coz of Mrunal, she looked a par gorgeous in the Sita look.

Mrunal Thakur and Dulquer Salmaan both gave a incredible performance . Impressive cinematography . Production design were topnotch , costumes and sets took us to 1960s .

It did require one to suspend reality, and it is not a bad thing. The unrealism, in no way make this a bad movie. But, with the talented leads, a more realistic take would have propelled this movie to greater heights.The movie entirely rests on Dulquer and Mrunal! Dulquer plays Ram with so much ease, and is so convincing. Everyone would want a Ram in their life. Mrunal, apart from looking gorgeous in every frame, played Sita with great conviction. Their chemistry worked and you just wish for them to stay together forever and ever.The movie felt a little draggy. I understand, that the writers might have wanted to take time in developing the relationship of the protagonists. To get us more attached to seeing them together, which raises the impact of the post-interval scenes. It does work, but as I said earlier, the treatment and sequence of events to and post the meeting of our protagonists is told through a fantasy-ish lens. It was an entertaining watch, but it did not stay with me for too long after I left the theatre.The cinematography was magical. I would watch this for the scenery alone. The gorgeous landscaped captured so masterfully by the cinematographer, adds the required hyper-realism to the story.I just wish the movie had better songs. Usually, such love stories thrive on having powerful numbers, which were absent here.Overall, I enjoyed it, although I believe the movie could have been so much more!",

Dulquer from Mollywood and Mrunal from Bollywood comes together to make a movie in Tollywood . The storyline was actually good and sure a movie content , however the director failed to notice the bubble gum effect and let the movie stretch for miles together, particularly the first half . Public comment was the movie had shades of Veer Zara, though I don't remember seeing that one in the past . The lead actors including Rashmika Mandana given the experience in this industry didn't fail to strike a good performance. Music just didn't get registered in mind . Cinematography was good and the screen was pleasant and colorful in many reels . First half was complete chaos and second half was much better and did end well resting everyone's mind in peace . People in UAE in a way would be happy that this movie is banned over there . One (long)time watch and cannot really recommend a theatre watch needing long sitting .

            "content": "Sita Ramam review :A sweet and warm love story cleverly packaged with cross border politics as well as Hindu Muslim angle; Sita Ramam is generally a satisfying watch though it could've been trimmed by ten to fifteen minutes.. never mind!Oscillating from 1964 to mid '80s, the screenplay highlights the love story of an army officer Ram (Dulquer Salman) and a mystery woman called Sita Mahalaxmi. This '60s romance is uncovered by Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna) whose grandfather, a brigadier in Pak army, wills her to deliver Ram's love letter to Sita twenty years too late. Why would he do that and how does he know Ram-Sita? All these questions are answered slowly and steadily through the two hours forty minutes of movietime.The biggest plus point of Sita Ramam are its likeable characters specially the lead pair of Dulquer and Mrunal. They not only look great as a pair but also deliver wonderful performances. You truly root for the two to come together even as they battle all kinds of odds. Rashmika, billed as a special appearance, has an interesting role of a feisty Pakistani woman who discovers herself during the process of delivering a letter in India.The situations are engaging as well as thought provoking and a couple of scenes truly touch your heart. Like Dulquer going to meet his pen-friend turned sister and on realizing she is trapped in flesh trade, rescues her and many others from the brothel. Another memorable moment comes when Mrunal falls at the feet of an Army Major and begs and pleads about Ram.Techinically, Sita Ramam is a winner with excellent locales and cinematography to compliment the soulful music. Its definitely a treat to watch.Anything negative then?, you may ask. Well, for one is the sluggish pace in the first half. Second and more important is a plot point which suggests Indian Army to be deserting their own soldiers in difficult times. And last but not the least is the climax which brings back memories of Yash Chopra's mellow-shallow drama Veer Zaara (2004). Yikes!All said and endured, I would recommend Sita Ramam as a one time watch.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

Her college dean insists her to either apologize to him or pay inr 10 million as compensation to avoid going to prison. Afreen refuses to apologize and returns to Pakistan in order to get the compensation amount from her grandfather brigadier abu tariq(sachin khedekar). But after returning she finds out that he passed away and his lawyer reveals to her that she will get her share only if she gives a letter written by indian lieutenant ram (DQ) to sita(mrunal thakur) in India. Rest of the film is afreen's journey to give the letter and find about ram and sita's love story.As a romantic film, sita ramam is everything what radhe shyam was supposed to be. Its gorgeous looking with two charming lead pair with beautiful chemistry and while watching them audience develop the feeling of them to never get seperated. DQ was extremely lovable as ram. He looked more handsome in the rugged prisoner look in the final act than the otherwise clean soldier look. Initially, the makers wanted to cast pooja hegde as sita but thank god she didn't because she would have never been as graceful as mrunal thakur. This film has an ensemble supporting cast from tamil,telugu and hindi industry making it a pan indian star cast.On the flipside, various subplots highly smells of mediocrity. Infact the actual love scenes only begins after the first 50 minutes. Also there is a sense of dejavu while watching sita ramam as it reminds you of films like ghajini and veer zaara.On the whole, sita ramam is a heartouching epic and beautiful love story.",

The jokes don't land, the direction is abysmal, the screenplay is filled with glaring plotholes and overtly convenient tropes, the cinematography while ambitious leaves much to be desired. However, the saving grace for the film is its lead pair - specially Mrunal Thakur who is as good at looking ethereal as she is at delivering the grace and gravity of her character. Salmaan has done a decent job but it's his chemistry with Mrunal that brings the best out in him. Rashmika Mandana does fine with what she had been handed.The film's script is fine mostly because of the climax and the romantic plot but the screenplay is so poorly done - specially in the first half - that one would feel compelled to turn the movie off. Don't. It gets better afterwards as the romantic plot takes off, the music takes center stage and the plot twists and slapstick humor finally begin to land. At least for a little while.The director has done the film dirty. He is good in the romantic parts but is grossly underresearched and unconvincing in geopolitics as well as military sequences. He's also in a discomforting haste to get to the parts which seem to be his natural strengths.Overall, the film is an entertaining watch if one is able to turn a blind eye (impossible) to its many inadequacies. I am going with 6/10 for the music, climax, romance and Mrunal.",

The flow of love is more mesmeric with mrunal and Dulquer. Those music bgms and song placements were good. It takes you to a real love story where these kinds of love stories are rear now. Hats off for taking such a beautiful love story. I watched this movie 10 times but still, I couldn't take my heart from this love especially the \"hey Rama song\" and the climax sad song apart from those love scenes. I was waiting for this for a long time after kgf 2. But never thought that this would be an absolute love treat. Those who loved truly and sincerely will grab this movie like me.

Acting wise it was pretty ordinary by Rashmika who just seem to act arrogant and rash. Mrinal Thakur has done decent job with her role and Dulkar seem to be someone who seems to always have a smile, felt that the intensity was missing.Expected a lot out of movie from its build up and start-case but it was a disappointment. The ending was just terrible as the seem to make someone at such a high rank look bad. Someone compromising National security and continuing to serve, that act of treason unacceptable.Yes, if you want just relax and watch it. It can be watched with patience.

Madras regiment has south Indian officers and Sardar soldiersBut what was the most shocking was the pro Pakistani Army and Anti Indian Army sentiment that is being peddled.The Pakistani Army is being shown as kind, peace loving and large headed.Whereas the Indian army is shown as a force that deserts it's soldiers. After the work is done it puts out press statements labeling it's soldiers as traitors. The Indian Army officers are shown as weak hearted who succumb to torture and sell national secrets.The Pakistani Army on the other hand is shown to uphold the Geneva convention and treat soldiers with dignity. There is a scene where a Pakistani General goes on to say that the Indian Army doesnt even know how to respect it's soldiers and dead!I am truly shocked at the anti India and pro Pakistani sentiment being sold here under the garb of a stupid love story that lacks any substance.",

It follows the same predictable love story pattern with a set of cringe fest but the writing includes enough incidents to keep us engaged and draws a liking to the movie. Its again the usual role for dulquer but his charm was enough for this one and he was able to handle it well despite a shaky start and will be one of the memorable performances in his filmography. The best for me was mrunal thakur. She was able to fit into the role and there was easiness and great screen presence and however felt her character had less to do towards the later half eventhough its prsence is always there. Rashmika might had a better role compared to her previous ones but acting wise didn't see anything notable except stiffness. The bgm was the best thing for the movie followed by cinematography. The visuals were good and had everything enough for a love story but sometimes felt it was overshadowing the same. There were overdose of songs along with overdose of ram devotion and ram slogans used by Pakistan official which didn't seem cool. Kashmir and military were easily accessible, not sure if it's because of the timeline but looked silly. We could also see woman wearing sarees in snow and its irritating to see such scenes even now. Overacting by one of the central character and the artificial props and effects can also be added to the irritating list. Despite these shortcomings, the final output qualifies as an enjoyable cinema owing to the genuine effort of the team.",

The climax scene made my eyes watery. Such a touching climax. The bgm is created based on classical raaga. Since the movie is based on backdrop of war, which adds intensity of the film.

            "content": "For the first time in Cine Industry The True Meaning of Romantic Genre is very well defined by our brilliant director Hanup Garu. The film takes place in two circas which suits the film the best as it happens in both time lines. The story revolves around two major characters Ram (Dulquer Salman) And Sita Mahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur). The letter Which Ram writes to Sita gets the story to move at the first place. Rashmika Mandanna as Afreen was the reason why the story starts as she takes the responsibility to deliver the letter. Both Dulquer and Mrunal delivered an unforgettable performance that their characters arc was framed well. Not only the main characters were given the entire focus but other characters were also equally concentrated according to their roles. What I personally felt and experienced is that After A Long Time I've Seen a Great Film that Truly defines the meaning of Love and the film also Depicts an Extraordinary Romance without intimacy being portrayed. Even though the film's story is so complex it avoids all the lags and gives the audience a wonderful time with beautiful and fascinating frames and segments by having the best direction. Last but not the least the music and background score by VC is the soul of the film and peaks our emotions in every scenes. SITA RAMAM isn't just a movie it is beyond that it's an exact Art depicted by the Artists.",

I just want to tell you that those ratings by some people (haters) are just because of the massive success of Sita Ramam. Believe me, THIS IS JUST a PURE LOVE STORY of the current generation. Max I can compare is with the classic cult ROJA.The best part was I watched the Telugu version (with English subtitles) with very basic knowledge of the language but I realized that beautifully crafted movies neither have any language barrier!Coming to the performances, in Sita Ramam I could see only characters who are memorable for a lifetime! Whether it is an empathetic Ram (DQ), an elegant Sita (Mrunal) or a rebellious Afreen (Rashmika) they will just be loved as characters forever. Every character, big or small was so beautifully penned & executed and I was in awe of the fact.Apart from all the actors who have already proven in their careers, the surprise pack was Mrunal as \"Sita Mahalakshmi\" (pardon me DQ)!!! An epitome of beauty & career-best performance. What a dream debut she had! She is going to stay here in Tollywood for sure. Congrats...\nMusic by Vishal Chandrasekhar has been ruling the chart and connects with that era of 1960-1980. Cinematography by PS Vinod sir, Choreography by Brinda master, Costumes by Sheetal Sharma and what else everything was perfect.Coming to Mr Hanu Raghavapudi, we are indebted for gifting us the pure love saga of our lifetime... Even after 2 weeks since I watched it, every scene & the emotions are afresh in my mind! Also thank Vyjayanthi Movies & Swapna Cinemas for the production values which echoed their passion for cinema!Lots of love guys.... All the best for all future ventures...",

Well that was a mistake!Not only could I not help myself with the whole helping of the movie, it was so good that I had to make some popcorn in the middle of the damn night.The story is about love, hate and the miracle of life. I don't know why people don't think so, but I sincerely believe that Mrinal Thakur is amongst Bollywood's new generation's most reliable actress along with Alia Bhatt. She has done a great job throughout the movie.The cinematographic brilliance, the direction and the performances of the two female leads and the dialogues (Important to rate after Brahmastra) are enough to call it a good movie, but the script truly makes it great. The twists and turns in the dramatic love story of Ram and Sita are thrilling and quite surprising at atleast 2 places. The second twist just blew me away.Besides Mrunal Thakur, Rashmika Mandana also has a lasting impact (No surprises there right?). Its the male stars of the movie who have stolen the one star that would have made it an absolute perfection!",

You feel joyous, elated, sad and at times you are blushing as well while watching it. Imagine that pure and sweet feeling of love that makes you feel your heart is full to overflowing with the effervescent emotions it evokes. The movie is about that love. It also shows that when you have your heart and soul filled with that love and those memories, your life still goes on as that is what your love wants for you. How ever far they are, Raam and Seetha will always unite as only they can complete each other. Rather than becoming decrepit, she celebrates her love along with fulfilling her goals and duties.No love story is complete without soulful music and eternal lyrics which was abundantly present and such perfect rendition of the songs by the singers that all the songs are going to become melodies which has not happened for a telugu movie in a very long time.Overall it made my weekend one of the best on the recent weeks. Kudos to Dulquer Salmaan for showing why Raam will always be the ideal choice when choosing a husband. Mrunal is ok but Seetha still needed to be played with more conviction as Seetha is beauty with brains. Rashmika was a perfect brat.",

Kudos to Dulquer Salmaan for showing why Raam will always be the ideal choice when choosing a husband. Mrunal is ok but Seetha still needed to be played with more conviction as Seetha is beauty with brains. Rashmika was a perfect brat.",

The chemistry between the couple was good and both Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur played their parts convincingly. It was refreshing to see Rashmika playing a character that was relatable and had grit. One more fact I loved about this movie that heroines or female leads haven't been portrayed as plain blank stupid which is an issue with 99% Telugu movies. The female leads had a meatier part to play with a variety of shades. Sumanth also played his part well. It is a great one time watch.

Its really a rare gem in Indian Cinema. If you like story about Love,sacrifice, patriotism and humanism...this is the movie. Watch it. Dulqar, Mrunali, Sumanth, Rashmika, Prakashraj have done a great work. Music by Vishal Chandrashekhar is so sootging. Story is brilliant Hanu Raghavapudi & Rajkumar Kandamudi. The movie will not allow you to ditter for a minute for watching it continuesly. Screenplay is perfect. I gave 10 ou of 10 for this movie but it deserves more stars to have bringing the one of the best movie / entertainment. Its a must watch for all. Kudos to the whole movie team.",

I must say, this is one of the best romantic film I have ever watched since the Tamil movie \"96\" which I had watched two years back. The concept of this movie by itself is absolutely brilliant, added to this is the skillful execution of the screenplay by the director. I must say that the movie is as balanced as it can be. You have got light hearted comedy moments as well as heavy emotional moments, all in perfect proportion, in a way that the core theme of the film is never lost. I must say that the emotional moments of the film had really made me cry, so this is not really a film for the faint-hearted. You have got some really outstanding playback songs in the film as well, which acts as the icing on the cake. Regarding the performances, well, what can I say much. I have actually no words for Dulquer Salmaan. The man is so freaking natural in front of the camera, it was a bliss to watch him act. And it would be wrong not to mention Mrunal Thakur. She was also equally charming and stole the moment in every frame she was in. This film is so wholesome and complete that I am regretting the decision of not watching it earlier in theatres. In short, this is a movie which I highly recommend not to miss at any cost.",

While watching it, you experience happiness, elation, sadness, and at times, flushing as well. Think about that pure, sweet love that makes your heart seem as though it is overflowing with the effervescent sensations it arouses. The love in the film is the subject. It also demonstrates that life continues even though your heart and soul are full with love and memories since that is what your partner wants for you. Raam and Seetha will always come together as only they can, no matter how far they are.Sita Ramam is a classic movie, easily one of the best in a couple of decades. Love, emotions, patriotism all breathe life into the film. Dulkar and Mrunal Thakur are outstanding with their life like performance, their chemistry and portrayal just brilliant. What a debut for Mrunal! Her expressive eyes are enough to convey the feelings of love, affection etc. Rashmika does a decent job and so are Suman as Bishnu Sharma, vennela Kishore and others were all used aptly. The narration is excellent starting from delivering a letter of 1965 twenty years later to Sita by Afreen till the climax as many twists and turns awaits us, leaving us with a heavy heart in the end. Photography is fantastic and music is soulful and melodious. A breath of fresh air in the world of mass masala films. Kudos to the director Hanu, photographer, music director, art director, maithri movie makers and all the artists for their fantastic efforts, not bothering about commercial interests. Go and watch the movie for the sheer class and masterly narration.",

The background, costume design are perfect to the occasion and enhancing the beauty of this movie. We need more scripts and direction like this. Rashmika's character lacks some spark but she has done justice to her role. Coming to script, it keeps taking twists every 10 minutes so you can't guess where the story is leading.

The story revolves around two major characters Ram (Dulquer Salman) And Sita Mahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur). The letter Which Ram writes to Sita gets the story to move at the first place. Rashmika Mandanna as Afreen was the reason why the story starts as she takes the responsibility to deliver the letter. Both Dulquer and Mrunal delivered an unforgettable performance by living exactly as the characters of Ram And Sita that their characters arc was well framed.

The actors, director, music etc did not have stronghold on filmgoers opinion at that time. But this film proved that Honest Film-making is the key. Just pure craft. The locations, the dialogue, the acting, the music, the costume design, set design, cinematography, screenplay, direction and what not! There is 100% honesty and commitment in this endeavour. Biggest plus here is the filmmakers have not taken audience for granted and have diligently delivered their best product. These are good signs for Indian movies and a breath of fresh air for audience as well. This film has broken all barriers that ever existed. It has shown Dulquer's acting range and Mrunal's magnetic charm. Must watch. This one is here to stay.",

We get to know why every main character is there in every movie..Looking forward to see some more movies with dubbing in Hindi from Hanu Raghavapudi as really loved the way he directed this movie, hats off to director and entire cast..",

The cinematography is astonishing, songs are great. Mrunal Thakur looks stunning in saari and the cinematography enhances it pretty well. Feels like watching a classic old movie with a charm of new actors and cinematography.This movie starts like a usual love story but the last 45 minutes are very emotional.Well done team.",

            "content": "This is going to be long and I have not revealed any spoilers to the best of my ability.I am not the one to write reviews but this movie has started haunting me to write one especially Mrinal's eyes.As they say \"love begets love\" and a pure and all knowing love can transcend anything.Mrinal(Sita) truly imbibes an aspect of the Sith'e tatva that no-one has captured so far. Mrinal as her name suggests is a lotus stalk and her namesakes in the movie have been aptly named. She is a bewitching beauty in the lines of Aditi Rao Hydari and Diya Mirza. Her potrayal is true to her natural self and majestic in every way. She comes out so much that it pains me to see Sita's yearning. Her eyes are bewitching and her performance is majestic. Mrinal is going to be winning hearts and I am quite sure that she is not going to get a taller role than this in her blossoming career.Dulquer(Ram) is an accomplished actor and I am not going to comment much. He has delivered the emotions and pain of his situation and the turmoil that he has to endure due to the circumstances that are thrown at him. Ram's character is bound to his kartavya as well as well as his longing to have a family of his own. He cannot deny his nature nor letgo of his longing.Sumanth(Brigadier Vishnu Sharma) has delivered the tryst associated in the most convincing way ever. He is an uptight character who is caught between having to go through various complex motions and make the tough calls that are needed to survive. Vishnu as the mythology suggests is one of the supreme trinity. His role to preserve the balance in this case his own calls for acts that are only justified for a god. A complex character that has been played flawlessly.Tharun Bhascker is refreshing and looks fresh. A special mention goes to the costume design team, the sarees reminded me of my mom's \"Garden Varelis\" from back in the day. Visually the movie has been aesthetically pleasing to watch.For the west this is going to be another \"Notebook\". For the south of India this follows the \"Mahanati\" template and is a \"slow-burn-love-reveal\".I would definitely look forward to the directors full extended cut if it ever comes out. For most this might be a long movie but this will be a killer watch on OTT. I would watch this all day long and get lost in Mrinals \"doe\" eyes.A must watch for romantics!Not sure why this hasn't been release in Hindi!",

Moreover the progression of the storyline has been well thought out which will keep viewers connected through out.Dulquer is exceptional as Ram, he is at his charming best. His expressions and body language throughout the script was to the point. Mrunal delivered a strong performance too, didn't try anything extravagant but carried the role extremely well. Rashmika's role in the storyline was kind of one dimensional and could have been better written. Other actors supported really well within the given scope.Must watch movie and deserves strong rating.",

Sita Ramam is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language period romantic drama film written and directed by Hanu Raghavapudi and produced by Vyjayanthi Movies and Swapna Cinema. The film stars Dulquer Salmaan, Mrunal Thakur (in her Telugu debut), Rashmika Mandanna and Sumanth. Set in 1964, Lieutenant Ram, an orphan army officer serving at the Kashmir border, gets anonymous love letters from Sita Mahalakshmi. Ram is on a mission to find Sita and propose his love. In 1964, Ansari, a Pakistani extremist, does not approve of the brotherly relationship between Kashmiri Muslims and Hindus. He plans on severing the bond and separating them. He strongly believes that the Indian Army is the reason for the unity. He resorts to brainwashing teenagers in Pakistan and sends them to Kashmir. He advises them to live in disguise to make his plans work.In 1985, Afreen is a fierce Pakistani-based rabble-rouser in London, who dislikes anything about India. She sets fire to the car of an Indian philanthropist, Anand Mehta, in retaliation for burning Pakistan's flag. The management board of her university asks her to apologize to him. As Afreen doesn't like to say sorry to Indians, the philanthropist gives her two choices: either to give him 1 million (10 lakhs INR) as compensation or go to prison. Being a stubborn and unapologetic patriot, she decides to compensate him and goes back to Pakistan to meet her grandfather, Pakistan Army Brigadier Tariq, for giving her the money to compensate him. However, upon her arrival in Pakistan, she finds out that her grandfather passed away. In his will, he asks her to deliver a letter, which he could not, written in 1965, by Indian Army Lieutenant Ram to his lover, Sita Mahalakshmi of India. Upon successfully doing so, she will inherit his wealth. Though relucant at first, Afreen agrees to deliver the letter to her, so that she can inherit Tariq's wealth.",

Mrinal's birth seems to have been successful because of this role. I don't think anyone other than Mrinal could have thought of this role to this extent. Mrunal looks very beautiful in Indian wear. By the end of the film, Ram and Sita settle in their hearts.The film surprises at every turn. Refreshes at every turn and fuels our curiosity. The direction is of high quality. The actors have been successful in giving their best. There are many such scenes which I feel like watching again and again.Rashmika makes a grand entry in the film. Rashmika dominates the film but only until Mrinal enters the film. By the end, only Mrinal remains in the film. I will just write about Ram - Amazing.Thank you that it was also made available in Hindi. Otherwise, the Hindi audience would have been deprived of a great story.According to me this is a better love story than '96'.Must see.",

As they say music has no language; I will add \"beautifully crafted romantic cinema\" neither has any language!After ages, I have witnessed a movie that may be compared to cult classics like Roja. Director Hanu Raghavapudi has put a stupendous effort into making this poetic romantic tale with breathtaking visuals captured by cinematographer PS Vinod sir. Every scene was nothing short of a painting with such aesthetic the production house Vyjayanthi movies did & hats off to you guys! Another important aspect has been the music & BGM by Vishal Chandrasekhar, what a classic feel from the bygone era! As came to know from his video, all the traditional instruments only were used for composing the songs and it was creating such n impact suiting to the 1960-1980 kind of feel. Choreography by Brinda master was superb.Coming to characters, DQ as Lt. Ram played so effortlessly with his boyish charm, blushing face in love scenes & most importantly dubbed in his own voice! Mrunal Thakur as SitaMahalakshmi urf Noorjahan just lit the screen every time they appeared together! Dream debut of Mrunal down south & must say that YOU HAVE ARRIVED!

Watched with English subtitles as the Hindi version was not yet available(on OTT platform), even when it was a bit of a pain watching the movie with subtitles, it was worth it. Movie might be a bit stretched at some places, you might feel bored for a very very brief period for which, it losses one star (from me) otherwise its a perfect 10 on 10.I would recommend this movie anytime in place of meaningless (nowadays ) Bollywood stories/scripts.",

This proves that the Cinema is not about the language or Industry(Tollywood,bollywood,sandlwood etc.,)its just the art of showing what the director had in mind for us to see.I have watched all the movies of Hanu Sir, he have the talent to make audience cry. But this movie every scene in the movie is like a painting and every dialogue is like a poem.Performance of the star cast is picture perfect. As the movie starts you no longer see Dulquer Salman & Mrunal Thakur on screen its just Sita & Ram & the magic of Sita Ramam.Music: Vishal Chandrashekar - KGVPG & PPLM are still in my playlist for any mood. But Sita Ramam music is on another level to all this albums. Best Suited for the movie & the characters. Every song have such a poetic lyrics & Singers gave life to them, Vintage cinematography. CLASSIC BGMIt is not just a love story but it touches so many other qualities.\"Desham Kosam Yuddham Chesevadu Sainikudu\nDharmam Kosam Yuddham Chesevadu Ramudu\"I still have so much to say but i'm not finding proper sentences to appreciate the movie that will explain how it felt to watch it.Guys., one request just because your fav Hero & heroin are not part of such a classic or someone you hate is in the casting don't give negative ratings & Comments here.Even if one person is not going to movie because of such hatred its not the loss to production team but the audience who will miss to see it on big screen.Thank you @Vyjayanthi movies for making such a master piece. Its been years that Tollywood have seen such amazing story which is delivered in such a great way.I created new imdb account just to give rating to this movie. Please do watch the movie on BIG SCREEN.Don't believe any negative comments. I wish it was made a PAN INDIA movie to reach more audience (as there are many people who might not manage with subtitles).MOVIE OF THE DECADE.Thank you!",

Going back time is something DQ is exceptionally good at and this is the first time I'm watching Mrunal Thakur and she was so beautiful in that vintage look and Rashmika is cute as always. One down side is the movie took a bit of time in the first half to deliver the context to the audience but it is safe to say that it is worth the wait and it all came together beautifully in the second half.

Must watch \ud83d\udc4dJust go and watch the movie... I am sure you will love it...

I also recommend people to go and watch this movie it is an inspiration for us and show what is love. In this movie Hero is a army and i am also a army lover and i like the way how they make and feel for an army.and also i have seen that in this movie that is emotion even the girl is from pakistan but our India army save the girl and he got caught by the Pakistani army and get ded. Despite a compelling lead performance by our hero and a great soundtrack, Forrest Gump never gets out of the shadow of its weak plot and questionable premise. No Country For Old Men's bold decision to skip music entirely pays off in spades. The eerie silence of the desert, punctuated by the brief spells of violent, up-close-and-personal sound effects of hunter and hunted, keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat. While he's fantastic whenever he's on the move, using his cool stoicism to counteract the rampaging bus, Keanu Reeves can't quite match his costar in the quiet moments of Speed, which falter under his expressionless gaze.",

Special thanks to PS Vinod for an absolute eye catching cinematography.Background music is the heart of the movie, fantastic music by Vishal and equally sung by the singers.

It's better than Ok Kanmani and Charlie combined, take it from me \ud83d\ude01. I think what works for the film beyond the grand scale at which it's mounted is how lovable the central characters are. Their chemistry sizzles and they both sparkle on screen, so everything around them naturally becomes appealing. From the moment Rashmika, who plays an extended cameo, decides to take the plunge and help herself by helping Ram and Sita, we know Sita Ramam could become everything that Radhe Shyam promised. Each frame is like a therapy for sore eyes, such is the brilliant cinematography. Although the songs are just hummable, the BGM is truly soul stirring and there are so many epic moments in both halves that I probably need to watch this film again just to revel in them.

There is also a very intelligently woven subplot featuring the fight against Pak supported Mujhahideen. The cowardice of the countries that decided to ban the film is truly astonishing though. About the lead pair: Mrunal is gorgeous and her costume designer deserves every accolade in the book. She slips into the role of Sita so easily that you really can't take your eyes off her. Dulquer brings his career best performance in the role of soldier Ram and his honest performance will leave many teary eyed.

            "content": "What a movie, Really heart touching story. It is nice to see a romance drama. Unity, and there is Sitamahalakshmi and Ram. Before his death, Afreen's grandfather gives her one last task. If she were to complete it, she will inherit his wealth. In need of some urgent money, Afreen accepts the mission and in this journey she unlearns the hatred that had been buried deep within her for her neighboring country. She learns about Ram's life, his love for his country and the gorgeous Sitamahalakshmi. Her mission is to hand over his last letter to his lover.As the film unfolds, we learn important bits and pieces of information about Ram and Sita. It comes in fragments, as it is a story that is narrated to Afreen by different people who had known Ram and Sita in the past. She learns about a person who proves every belief of hers about Indian wrong. She learns about a woman who gave it all for her love. The idea is interesting. To introduce hate first, and then reveal things that which would destroy hate from within - love, hope, dreams and more. So in that vein, Ram's life symbolises the hopes and dreams of many who want a world absent of hatred. Now, the problem arises for me personally when this very symbol of hope that the film took hours to built is destroyed within minutes. From the first letters that arrived from Sita (voiced to perfection by Chinmayi), to the last letter that Ram had penned for her, just this back and forth induces old world nostalgia. It also underlines how desperate humans were for contact in absence of all the communication devices that the world has today. The closure that Ram seeks with his last letter, the one that Sita seeks every year when she visits Kashmir in his absence, is a treasure trove that could have been explored further. Maybe then, a sad ending would be befitting of this film that aims to be a classic love story.Otherwise, I beg to differ. Do all classic love stories need to have a sad ending? I understand that they illicit emotions that are more intense, but where do we gather hope from? If the film had not thrown in certain elements, like the reds and blues, or the interfaith element, maybe I could've bought their fate. However, it is almost as if the film baits the audience into a false sense of security before it bursts their bubble. Beyond the film's visuals, what really strikes a chord is the music by Vishal Chandrasekhar. It is sweet and charming, just like the film which stops short of being a classic.But at a time when the world thrives on mega-action films with gore, blood and violence (not that I don't love it), it is nice to see a romance drama. A well-made one at that, which also fleshes out its female lead as more than a skeletal being. Sita has layers, and she is a mystery. One that Ram doesn't intend to solve, but only to enjoy. He has no intentions of changing her, her life or her choice. Sita's one worry is that her secret remains unshared with Ram. However, with his last letter, Ram gives Sita the closure that two decades of living without him couldn't. So, if sweet moments, and heartwarming hugs resulting in a heart break is not your cup of tea, give Sita Ramam a miss.",

The screenplay and direction of the movie is really good. These kind of movies should really be promoted. No one would regret watching this movie as waste of time and money. The dub cast has really done a fabulous work. The way they used present and past its really very good. This shows the difference between bollywood and south movies.

So, for example, a person might say he or she loves his or her dog, loves freedom, or loves God. The concept of love may become an unimaginable thing and also it may happen to each person in a particular way.Love has a variety of feelings, emotions, and attitude. For someone love is more than just being interested physically in another one, rather it is an emotional attachment. We can say love is more of a feeling that a person feels for another person.

Another important aspect has been the music & BGM by Vishal Chandrasekhar, what a classic feel from the bygone era!

Director Hanu Raghavapudi has put a stupendous effort into making this poetic romantic tale with breathtaking visuals captured by cinematographer PS Vinod sir. Every scene was nothing short of a painting with such aesthetic the production house Vyjayanthi movies did & hats off to you guys! Another important aspect has been the music & BGM by Vishal Chandrasekhar, what a classic feel from the bygone era! As came to know from his video, all the traditional instruments only were used for composing the songs and it was creating such n impact suiting to the 1960-1980 kind of feel. Choreography by Brinda master was superb.Coming to characters, DQ as Lt. Ram played so effortlessly with his boyish charm, blushing face in love scenes & most importantly dubbed in his own voice! Mrunal Thakur as SitaMahalakshmi urf Noorjahan just lit the screen every time they appeared together! Dream debut of Mrunal down south & must say that YOU HAVE ARRIVED! You are going to stay here for long. What a chemistry between Ram & Sita and I was just sucked into the world of Ram garu & Sita garu and the journey further was nothing short of a spectacle!And the rebellious #Afreen (Rashmika) through whom the whole story unfolds did a completely different role and your combo with #Balaji (Tarun Bhacker) gave many giggles as well. Fantastic job by both of you! Appreciate Sumanth garu for his Vishnu Sharma having grey shades but he did a tremendous role as well. As a viewer, I felt angry upon you & that's just bcoz of your depiction of the character. Thank you Vennela Kishore for \"Durjoy\" & those comedy.I must say that every character was aptly chosen whether it's GVM as major Selvan or Sachin Khedekar as Major Tariq, PrakashRaj, Rohini, Shatru, Murali Sharma, Sunil, Rahul Ravindran, etc. A special appreciation for Chinmayi Sripada for the beautiful dubbing she did for #Sita's character done by Mrunal.Though it's 2 days since I watched the movie, still unable to come out of it & there is still an urge to watch it again! Such is the addiction of #sitarmam Thanks to Hanu sir for reminiscing the world of letters & the strong bonds of love that it used to carry and also proving that epic romantic tales can be told so artistically as well. You rocked man.Wish all the best for the whole team of #SitaRamam to reach more success & accolades in the coming days.Watch it in any language in the nearest cinemas guys if you don't want to miss the magic of #SitaRamam#SitaRamam #SitaRamamMovie # love.",

            "content": "Full of emotions Jabardast\nEpic one\nMrunal and DS nailed it \ud83d\udc95\nDulquer Salmaan has pretty much exhausted all the lover-boy tropes and cinematic cliches in his short but substantial filmography, from the college kid finding his way in life in films like \"Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi (2013)\" to the more worldly, commitment-phobe in \"OK Kanmani (2015)\" and it has seemed like he is playing the same characters over and over again in recent projects. So it is with much trepidation and lack of any expectation that I heard the announcement of yet another romance drama with the young scion of Mollywood in the lead, that too in Telugu.The man, however, seems to thrive on throwing conventions and expectations to the wind, combining forces with director Hanu Raghavapudi and two charming leading ladies to deliver one of the most gut-wrenching romantic tales of the year, that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. The period story set against the backdrop of war and terrorism, immaculate production design, colorful costumes, combined with an intrepid lead romantic pairing make \"Sita Ramam\" the perfect concoction of romance that the box office has been missing for some time.Rashmika Mandanna stars as \"Afreen\" a cynical, rebellious Pakistani teenager in 1980s London, tasked by her grandfather on his deathbed to return a mysterious letter to an Indian lady who he was never able to locate during his dying days. As the stubborn youngster starts her search for the peculiar person named \"Sita Mahalakshmi\" (Mrunal Thakur) addressed in the letter, she uncovers more clues that unravel her story as well as that of her dashing lover, \"Luitenant Ram\" (Dulquer) and their star-crossed romance during the war-ravaged 1960s in Kashmir. While the first half gets sluggish and boring in places, the second half reveals that these initial set-up scenes were crucial to complete the intricate character arcs of our three principal protagonists.Trio of superb performances.",

Many old Bollywood movies have done a far far better job of executing these same tropes.The story of Sita Ramam had so much promise, but it was all wasted by excluding any nuance, depth, or reasonable context. The movie doesn't pick up pace until well into the second half. When it does pick up some pace, it ends abruptly by killing off an important character off-screen (?!!?!??!!). All the characters are flat and one dimensional, but Rashmika Mandana's character (and acting) is a whole new level of annoying. She is given no screen time to redeem herself in the end. The character starts out with such an extreme entitled personality, that even stronger story/character arc would have barely made any impact. The only saving grace for the movie is that the lead pair makes for a very pleasant couple.I have an increased appreciation for Veer Zaara after watching this overrated movie. I am not a huge fan of Shahrukh Khan or Bollywood either. But, everything that is wrong with Sita Ramam has been done far better in many movies before. It is disheartening to see so much hype for a subpar movie like Sita Ramam, when a true masterpiece like Veer Zaara went underappreciated.",

            "content": "Director Hanu Raghavapudi's Sita Ramam is a lot more than just a love story. The story, screenplay and dialogues by Hanu, Raj Kumar Kandamudi and Jay Krishna ride on the idea that humanity matters more than war, boundaries and religion. The idea is ever relevant especially in times when discussions of 'them' and 'us' threaten to take over the discourse all around us.Sita Ramam unravels the mystery surrounding its title characters, Sita Mahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur's debut in Telugu cinema) and Lt Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) through two timelines - 1964 and 1984. Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna), a Pakistan-origin student arrives in India from London, when she is tasked with tracing Sita to hand over a 20-year-letter written to her by Ram. She takes the help of her college senior Balaji (Tharun Bhascker), who is now in Hyderabad.With Sita Ramam, Hanu manages to deliver a story that's moving and a film that's visually aesthetic and pleasing. Go watch this one if you're looking for a breather among all the mass masala.The 1960s are presented like a dream. Posted on the borders of Kashmir on the snowy terrains is Lt Ram. His fellow soldiers are his world; there is a dear friend (played by Shatru), a jealous officer (Sumanth as Brigadier Vishnu Sharma) and a commanding officer Major Selvan (Gautham Menon). An All India Radio journalist (Rohini Molleti) terms Ram a lone ranger and requests listeners to write to him. Letters pour in, Including one from Sita who chides Ram for forgetting that he has a wife back home and that he isn't an orphan.",
