            "content": "\"Are We Done Yet?\" Let's hope so. A phenomenally bad movie and, worse yet, a completely unfunny comedy that rips off \"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,\" among a dozen other, better films. Oh, did I also mention it's a sequel to one of the worst movies of 2005, \"Are We There Yet?\" In that picture, former gangsta rapper Ice Cube (now flattened and mellowed down to a pathetic, bumbling caricature) was Nick, the idiotic boyfriend of Suzanne, mother of the most untalented and unsympathetic kids on the planet. No wonder his character hated children, with these horrid spawn underfoot, I'd have a vasectomy immediately.In this version, he actually marries Suzanne, but four people living in a small apartment causes him to move to the country. Very far out in the country where there's no malls or cell phone reception.Here he meets the wacky Chuck (John McGinley, \"Platoon,\" \"Wild Hogs,\" TV series \"Scrubs\") village Realtor/contractor/building inspector/idiot, who convinces Nick to buy a huge Victorian mansion (even though he could only afford to live in a small apartment in the city).Of course, once the papers are signed, the domicile begins to fall apart; the electricity goes out, the roof leaks, floors collapse, walls crumble, and so does the marriage.Meanwhile, Nick has taken out a big advance to start a sports magazine and is trying to woo Ervin \"Magic\" Johnson for a relevant cover story (didn't Magic Johnson retire from the NBA like 400 years ago?!).Nick also seems to have an unlimited income for these repairs, and Chuck keeps bringing in more and more bizarre and not-at-all-humorous workers (a pair of huge Samoan dry rot specialists, a blind plumber, etc.) to fix the money pit.Also, Suzanne is pregnant, and in a scene that has graced thousands of comedies in the past, she goes into labor at a most inconvenient time. And while this film is clearly for youngsters (as well as the severely brain-damaged), and should therefore not be judged like a Shakespeare sonnet, I nevertheless cannot abide comedies which do not make me laugh \u0096 at all.We know what jokes and pratfalls will take place minutes before they occur (Nick falls through floors, roofs and walls, is struck by lightening and is attacked by bats, raccoons, deer and a crazed sturgeon.Not one of these situations is even remotely interesting, let alone smile-inducing. Friends, I've seen funnier memorial services.Ice Cube's talent peaked in \"Boyz in the Hood,\" (and he had funnier lines when he was singing with N.W.A.), while the other leads are absolutely abysmal, especially the two kids, who've lost any cuteness and most of their acting abilities since the first picture.In fact, the only saving grace (and I mean that term in the loosest way possible), is McGinley. Sure, he was funnier as the syncophatic sergeant in \"Platoon,\" but his presence here is really the only thing that saves \"Are We Done Yet?\" from total burial in the dung heap.His inclusion makes this one slightly better than the first, which is like saying that Lee Harvey Oswald was a better shot than John Wilkes Booth.",

I mean, if they know the first one was bad why are they making another one, what is wrong with these directors. They are making some bad squeals or remakes that are in the bottom and they still continue. Soon another one is going to be called Are We Having Fun Yet, well guess what, no. And for sure this movie would at least be better than the first, but it is worst. I should be stupid for watching this piece of crap. Let me tell you for all that didn't see this movie yet, you made the right choice. Soon, these dopes will make the third, then the fourth, then more. Make sure you will never see this, the only funny jokes are in the trailer. That's it.",

I enjoyed the first one, so naturally I wanted to see the sequel. Sure, it was a bit hokey, but a lot of family movies are. This movie was funny, and it had some serious moments too.If you haven't seen this movie yet, here's my recommendation: a. If you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like this one either, so don't waste your time watching it and then complain about it on this website.b. If you liked the first movie, you'll probably enjoy this one as well, so go ahead and enjoy it, no matter what the complainers say.c. If you haven't seen the first movie, watch it first, because it's a good movie and gives you the background on the story. Then watch this movie.",

I got it as a Christmas present from a family member. She said I knew I liked the first one, which she was wrong, so she went ahead and got me the sequel. I made a fake smile, and before I put it away for life, she suggested we watched it. My heart was pounding out of my chest, for I knew I could not escape! I hated the first one and even though I am willing to give any film a chance, I was not anywhere near excited.Well, we started it up, and pretty soon we were all sitting down watching it. Here's a clue as to what my families thoughts on it were: The family member apologized for buying it for me, my brother fell asleep, and my mom sat there with a disgusted look on her face. Even my eight year old cousin and five year old nephew did not laugh! I still can not believe that this is the filth that caused the wonderful movie Grindhouse to bomb, and I will hate this film until the very day I die for that, and I feel tremendously sorry for anyone who decides to watch it. It's just as poor as everything is in the first. Lame jokes, lame acting and lame plot.If another film is made I assume it will be titled, \"We're Not Done Yet, Sorry\".",

This film starts of with Nick and Suzanne, newly married, living in Nick's apartment with their kids. They decide it's too small, so they move to the country. They find a house to their liking, not knowing it's a broken-down piece of crap. After the house falls apart, the Persons hire a contractor. Can he help make the lives of the Persons get any easier? You will just have to find out. First of all, the acting is great. All the original cast is excellent. The new members of the cast was just as great, especially the contractor(the funny John C. McGinley). What surprised me was the score of the film. I thought there would only be rap with a few classical notes, but there is only a few rap songs. Overall, this is a family film that I recommend. I rate this film a 9/10.",

            "content": "I went to see this with a good friend over the weekend b/c I had nothing to do and she really liked Are We There Yet? and convinced me that this would be funny. Please, I urge you not to see this movie if you are over the age of 8. This was an hour and a half of my life that I will NEVER get back.**SPOILERS (I guess)**I'm thinking the makers of this \"movie\" just ripped off and pieced together parts of other bad movies like The Money Pit, The Great Outdoors, Troop Beverly Hills.... or any of those family films where the new stepparent or annoying relative is trying to win over the kids/other relatives and a bunch of wacky adventures (in the wilderness, on the road, with a crappy house, with a rebellious teen, etc) ensue. Nothing in this movie is wacky or funny. Seriously, there are jokes like \"I don't know karate, but I know Ka-razy\" and a wife giving birth going \"You did this to me! I hate you!\" Nope, never heard those before. Then, there is everyone blaming our hero, Ice Cube, for all of the terrible things going wrong, when either: a) they are the fault of the bafflingly annoying con-artist/psychopath that serves as their realtor, contractor, house inspector, electrician, connection to Magic Johnson, midwife (yes, midwife) and \"baby whisperer\" (don't ask).b) no one really seems to care that the 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is either prancing around in next to nothing or going to a huge party with (I assume) a lot of alcohol and a guy who looks like he's probably 18 or older (Hello, statutory rape, anyone?). The mother is completely unconcerned and/or chooses not to get involved. Instead, she lets a man who her kids barely know do the parenting. I could go on. There are so many things in this movie that don't make sense or are just plain dumb that I guess the producers thought would be funny. They were very, very wrong. This movie bites.",

            "review_title": "Good for the family",
            "content": "I've never seen Are We There Yet?, and I had no intention of watching this film. I thought as many that the funny parts were in the trailers and that the actors were sub-par. For the most part that is true. There were some surprises in the humor, mostly from John C. McGinley, but it was far from side splitting. Even though it was not a great movie on the whole, it was a great family film. Today, with the exception of Disney, most movies are far from family friendly. Even Dreamwork's cartoons have a great deal of crude humor in them that make most parents cringe when watching them with small children. Are We Done Yet? actually has a lot of great family values that are missing from a lot of movies that have come out recently. The film shows a man who is forced to take care of a family that is not his own and also to prepare for his future children with his new wife. This step-father acts more like a dad should to his teenage step-daughter than most real father's do. Very rarely will you see some one in a film telling a young girl to put on more clothes and yelling at her for sneaking out of the house. If you are looking for something that is more than okay to watch with the kids then this is a movie to check out. Don't expect anything close to award winning, but parents can watch this safely with their kids without wondering if their kids know what the last innuendo meant every couple of minutes.",

            "review_title": "Why is everyone picking on this movie?",
            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that 'Are We There Yet?' is pretty atrocious. In fact, thinking about it, I have to wonder why I even wanted to see 'Are We Done Yet?' when its predecessor was so awful.To my surprise, this turned out to be one of the most entertaining family movies I have seen in a long time. Admitedly, I don't go and see too many, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this movie was. I find it incredible that this film is, as of this writing, number 29 in the list of worst films ever on IMDb. That said, 'V for Vendetta' (one of the worst films ever made, in my opinion) is in the top 250, so what does it really mean? What astounds me is that 'Are We There Yet?' is better rated than its sequel, which outdoes it in almost every way. Don't get me wrong, this is not Tarkovsky. It's stupid and childish and essentially pointless, but guess what - that's the point, it's a family film. Taken in this context, it is a more than passable way to spend 100 minutes of your time.Ice Cube, who looked and felt a little out of place in the first film, has eased into this character nicely and has really developed some fine comic timing. To be able to go from \"the nigga you love to hate\" to a genuinely amusing turn in a family comedy is not something many people could do with any degree of success, but Cube pulls it off.The kids are less annoying than they were in the first film, but the writers have again failed to give the audience any reason to like them, even a little. Consequently, the most unfeasible thing about Cube's character is that he hasn't murdered them yet. What the writers have managed to do here is give Nia Long a bit more to work with. In 'Are We There Yet?' it was hard to imagine what Cube's character saw in her (aside from the obvious) but she's actually a lot more endearing here, and she looks divine.The real surprise was John C McGinley, whom I expected to suck royally. While he's not known for comedy and has made some ropey choices over the years (notable exceptions being 'Platoon', 'Point Break' and 'Seven'), he almost makes this film. His character is ridiculous, and the biggest mistake he and the director could have made would have been to try and ground the character in any sort of reality. Thankfully they didn't, and McGinley consequently provides some of the best moments in the movie. The twist in the character's back story actually manages to be quite moving too.All things considered, its hard to fault a film that is under no pretence about its intentions. This is nothing more or less than good family fun. The fact that it is also well paced, well designed and has fantastic music supervision only adds to my admiration.If you go to see this film for the right reason, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised (I urge you not to be put off by its predecessor). If you go into it looking for a reason to bad-mouth it, I have one thing to say to you; Get a life, it's a frigging family film!",

Add to that the most annoying character in the history of cinema played by John C. McGinley and we have a turkey of a movie roasting to perfection. It breaks my heart to say this as i have seen, Are we there yet like 20 times and it still has me in fits of laughter, my 2 year old nephew wants to always watch it and i am more than happy to. They should have called this Home Improvement as the whole story revolved around McGinley's character. it was also embarrassing the way the movie tried to cling to successful scenes from the original movie, Aleisha Allen singing and the scene with the rabid Deer.In conclusion i am sorry to say that this film is another poor excuse this summer on a bandwagon of shocking Sequels.",

There is a raccoon on the roof that won't go away, bats come through the chimney, the whole floor gets torn up, etc...But Nick comes around and takes Kevin fishing, in what is perhaps the silliest part of the film with the cgi giant catfish. But Chuck the contractor is extremely annoying and I can't believe even the wife would think he is great after he sells them a torn up house and tears it up himself fixing it. But since this is a kids film, you know Nick will learn the value of family in the end.FINAL VERDICT: It's for kids. 10 year olds will probably like it.",

Not only were many of results clich\u00e9, especially the ending, but many of the characters were just unfunny. And that is being nice.John McGinley, who initially seems welcoming, becomes a nuisance. He sells Ice a lemon of a home and has a monopoly on every main job for the community. But instead of getting rid of him, he becomes liked. Even Ice Cube likes him at the end.Many of the jokes were bad or badly set up. I admit blind plumbers could have been funny. But instead, they just walked about with stereotypical blind sticks. But nothing funny happened. Nothing. How could anybody blow a bit like that? Apparently this crew could.Ice Cube could have done worse. But I am not happy with his work. Nia Long is very nice looking, but the plot, direction, and screenplay is all wrong. Better luck making \"Next Next Friday\" or \"Barbershop 3\". They probably would be better. \"D\"",

Along with her two conniving but lovable children, Lindsey and Kevin, the couple is living in Nick's smallish apartment in Portland, Oregon. As Nick has sold his sports collectibles store and is trying to launch a new magazine, the lack of space is giving him fits. Then, Suzanne drops a bomb, too...she's pregnant. Needing a larger living space as soon as possible, the family goes into the woods of northern Oregon and finds a lovely home, with five bedrooms and charm in abundance. Despite the kids not wanting to leave their friends, the family makes the move. But, shortly after, their dream house has an electrical problem. The realtor who sold them the house (Ted McGinley) turns out to be the area's contractor as well. As more problems emerge for the house, Nick begins to think he has purchased a money pit and he becomes very cranky. He alienates Suzanne, the kids, and the entire village. Will there be a happy ending? This is a fine sequel to the first film and is loosely based on that old classic, Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House. Ice Cube is really terrific as the much put-upon dad of the family, generating the film's biggest laughs with his expressions and antics. Long is lovely and the two children are quite nice as the supporting players. McGinley is pretty much of a hoot, too, as the goofball realtor/contractor/midwife! The scenery is gorgeous, the costumes well selected and the look of the film is very fine indeed. Although the fixer-upper-turned-nightmare theme is nothing new, it still can be presented in a fresh way, as it is here. Most important, this is a good and humorous film for the entire family, with much to say about parents and children sticking together when the going gets tough. Are you and your loved ones feeling down today? Go get this film and turn everyone's day around.",

John McGinley was brilliant, Ice Cube made me chuckle every time something went wrong. He was so likable even when he was the most frustrated. It was a lighthearted family film, that given the chance, rendered some bonafide giggles. This movie didn't deserve a 2.8. I'd easily give it a 6.",

Note to whoever paid to have this movie made: It did not work. And the entire premise that a \"smart\" business person who obviously is spending a lot of money to buy a house on a large parcel of land would choose to not pay to have the house inspected, well, what can one say about this concept, other that it tells the audience that the rest of the movie is going to just get worse? Not that this movie was all that close to the original it was trying to copy, since the house was already built. The house just needed a lot of work to make it habitable, and thus our plot of the hapless and idiotic father who slams his thumb with a hammer, falls through roofs, has a run-in with electricity, and of course, the weird, but has a heart of gold, contractor. And then there is the scene where our main character is out showing his step-kids nature and they come across a deer. Everyone, including the deer, are scared and go running off, screaming the entire time. Same as the audience would be my guess.",

            "content": "\"Are We Done Yet?\" is probably the only film in movie history to be both a sequel to one movie (\"Are We There Yet?\") and a remake of another (\"Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House\").The movie picks up where \"Are We There Yet?\" left off, with confirmed bachelor Nick Persons having tied the knot with his main squeeze, Suzanne (Nia Long), and adopted her two children, Kevin and Lindsey. Desperate to get his new family out of his two-by-four Portland apartment, Nick purchases a home in the country, a dilapidated relic that gives a whole new meaning to the term \"fixer-upper.\" \"Are We Done Yet?\" starts off with a clever animated title sequence that brings to mind the work of the great Saul Bass in the 1950's and 1960's. Unfortunately, it's strictly downhill from there. For bad as it was, the original found at least a modicum of comic tension in the conflict between Nick and the two bratty kids who hated him. Here Nick is forced to wage an endless battle with an assortment of woodland creatures, shady contractors, loose floorboards, insect infestations, dry rot and a whole host of other homeowner inconveniences. Far from being antagonists, the other family members are reduced to little more than a grating Greek chorus cynically commenting on the hapless man's nonstop travails.Ice Cube demonstrates a certain minor flair as an actor, but even Jim Carrey would have trouble making a silk purse out of this pratfall-laden sow's ear. With its bland mixture of anemic slapstick and gooey sentimentality, \"Are We Done Yet?\" is about as dreadful a movie comedy as has come down the pike in quite some time. Perhaps a more appropriate title would have been \"Is it Over Yet?\"",

Anyway, our sports-obsessed step-dad hero tangles with one of the more frightening friendly characters in a light comedy played by the distracting-ly athletic John C. McGinley. McGinley's character controls the local real estate market, government and contractors effectively seizing control of Cube's life, breaking up his marriage, imprisoning him, delivering his baby and reuniting his family but on his terms. Take out the half-hearted pratfalls by Cube and his low wattage comic meltdowns and you have yourself an eerie stalker flick. Maybe one of the writers threw in a little \"Single White Female\" as well. In short, the movie does follow a familiar arc and there's just enough goofiness to avoid being really awful.",

I decided nonetheless to at least say I finished the franchise by reviewing the sequel \"Are We Done Yet\", one of the most repetitive slapstick bull movies I've ever seen that is filled with borrowing jokes and overusing them. Our disgruntled sports fan and stepfather Nick Parsons returns to buy a house that needs some fixing, resulting in simply hilarious slapstick scenarios where tough guy Ice Cube falls down or does something stupid or childish. To make matters worse both for Nick and for the audience, John C. McGinley steps in as Chuck, the small quaint town's real estate agent, inspector, construction worker, etc., also this wacky guru like comedic element that really overuses his bland and frankly embarrassingly dumb personality. The plot is poor, boring for a kids film and unfunny - it also \"borrows\" heavily from the 1986 Tom Hanks' film \"The Money Pit\". The humor is predictable and unfunny, Ice Cube can't do much as a comedic actor, he's just grumpy most of the time. Our previous main characters from the first film, Nick's stepchildren, have little to no importance and are rarely seen to make more time for wacky Chuck. AWDY's main problem is that it's not appealing to kids or adults, it's troubled in every aspect. What a disaster.P.S. Answering to \"bobyvsamos\" comment that says this atrocious film was great, your name is a portmanteau of Bob Saget and John Stamos, go watch \"Full House\" instead of this abomination.

I believe many audiences who watched this movie felt the same way.The storyline has been used times and times again, and it got boring. The casts, especially the kids were just plain and boring. They seemed not to have any chemistry between them, and they can't convince the audiences that they were siblings. They looked more like schoolmates to me. Only the contractor, Chuck (whose real name is John Ginley, who also plays for the TV show Scrubs as a doctor) was able to bring some entertainment to this otherwise extremely abominable movie. By the way, I like the scene when Chuck had to walk all the way to the hospital because his car broke down. It was pretty funny!Other than John Ginley's performance, I think the other aspects of the movie suck. The casts need more training in acting, the producer must find new ideas to this well used storyline, the writer must learn how to better connect the scenes in the movie. And less spastic jokes, please.People argue that just because there was no violent scenes or cursing than the movie has gotta be good. I beg to differ. A good movie can be both entertaining and fun to watch even without the negative elements.So a score of 2/10.

Basically Nick Persons (Ice Cube) and pregnant Suzanne (Nia Long) have married, which means he has adopted the kids Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden). They know they don't have enough room for a pleasant life in Nick's apartment, so they make plans to buy a house in the suburbs, and they find what they think is the ideal home from eccentric contractor Chuck Mitchell, Jr. (John C. McGinley). It is obvious though that the house needs a lot more work than originally thought, and Nick trying to fix the house up is distracting him from finishing his work on his new sports magazine. He is also being constantly irritated by Chuck, he's not just the contractor, he's a house inspector, a real estate agent and a midwife, oh, and he may also be getting more affection from Suzanne and the kids. Eventually Nick loses his patience, forcing Suzanne and the kids to leave him alone in the still unfinished and torn apart house, but he slowly manages to find his way to finishing the job. In the end, Nick lets Chuck help out again, including during the birth of the new baby, and they all get the dream house they always wanted. Also starring Jonathan Katz as Mr. Rooney, Linda Kash as Mrs. Rooney, Alexander Kalugin as Russian Contractor, Dan Joffre as Billy Pulu and Magic Johnson. Once again the kids are a bit irritating, the story is overly sentimental in most points, and it doesn't compare the high chaos comedy of The Money Pit, at least the first film was more bearable.

Who directs, writes and just watches this garbage?Although it's half a quarter of a star better than the first movie, it's still incredibly irritating and annoying. First of all, the children are older but are still the brattiest and most childish movie characters of all time. The creators believe that complete slapstick mess will make you laugh and boringly constant pratfalls will entertain you.If you've seen the first film, Are We Done Yet? Is all the same, except it's a different story and it's just more potty laughs. How many times do we have to say \"don't watch this utterly pointless, unfunny and terrible garbage!\"?If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

But, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.My son and I have watched this movie 3 or 4 times (at my son's request) and it's really not as bad as the previous rater stated. At first, I was completely put off by the kids' behavior in this movie; they were disrespectful and rude throughout 90% of the film, which made me almost hate the movie. But their horrible behavior, due to their father being out of their life, is exactly the point of the movie. Accept that and you'll enjoy some laughs resulting from the kids' antics and Ice's responses to them.If you're looking for a movie suitable for the 7-12 year old crowd, this one is probably a good choice. They'll enjoy it. And you may find, as I did, that you can't resist the urge to remind your kids that they are NEVER to behave as poorly as the kid actors in this movie.As an adult, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating for the reasons stated above. However, my 9 year old would likely rate the movie an 8. Overall, it's not so bad.",

            "content": "\"Are We Done Yet?\" (2007), the title of this movie is the last question you'll be asking when you see this film. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations and perfect special effects. The only setback in this film is the soundtrack, but we'll get to that later. The story at first glance may sound like your average moving away plot. However, in this film it's depicted in a unique and funny way. The beginning may seem a little slow, but it does not hurt the movie in any way. Once they get out to the countryside, it's nothing but non-stop comedy and situations right to the end. The acting is just as good as in the first movie, all of the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Once again, the shining star is Ice Cube. However, the rest of the actors accentuate his performance and have great chemistry with him and they bring this movie to life! All of the sets/locations are great. Especially the countryside! This film takes place in Oregon, but it's shot in British Columbia. Still, it's just as scenic! You can't go wrong with filming your movie in the Pacific northwest! Finally, all of the special effects are well-done and hold up to this day. The only negative in this movie is the soundtrack. Now, it's not bad, but it's just your average run of the mill film score. It does it's job, but it's nothing to write home about. \"Are We Done Yet?\" is a fun ride from beginning to end. It's not quite as good as the first film, but it's definitely a worthy followup though. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. If you enjoy \"Are We There Yet?\" (2005) then you'll most likely enjoy this film. Go check it out today, and see for yourself!",

This is what Ice Cube's sequel to Are We There Yet? sets out to display, with fun and slapstick PG comedy packed in to it. However, I don't think I've seen a film so frequently unfunny.Are We Done Yet? (AWDY?)tells the story of Ice Cube as he buys a new house for his family, who are expecting another member soon. So, he buys a house, and guess what? Unknowing to Mr. Cube their dream house is a mess, falling apart and has termites scuttling around in every room. The following 90 minutes consist of Ice Cube running around and falling in holes in floorboards. I'm afraid to say that I didn't laugh once, and I was in a mood for comedy. AWDY was so relentlessly laugh-less that I was despairing as the film barely crawls along, tediously moving from one predictable slapstick moment to the next. Ice Cube is so bland and wet he has no screen presence or power, he is an annoying fly moaning and shouting in your ear. As for the talented comic John Christopher McGinley from Scrubs, he consistently fails to hold the screen for barely an hour, and is more annoying than quirky, a sad and badly misted reflection of his Scrubs character.I judge comedy on whether I laugh. The Wikipedia definition of comedy reads: 'Comedy has a popular meaning (any discourse generally intended to amuse, especially in television, film, and stand-up comedy).' I'm afraid I was never at any point entertained, and I forgot the existence of my funny bone. A successfully direction-less and unhilarious slapstick joke stretched out to 90 minutes.",

            "content": "I suppose it's worth noting that \"Are We Done Yet?\" is better than the first movie in the \"series\" (2005's \"Are We There Yet?\") but even then, there's not much of a reason to actively seek out and watch this film. As you might have expected from the end of the first picture, Nick Persons (Ice Cube, proving once again that he's not very attached to his tough guy attitude as long as he gets paid) has married Suzanne (Nia Long) and is now the stepfather to Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Lindsey (Aleisha Allen). For some unexplainable reasons, the entire family has moved into Nick's apartment instead of the house Suzanne and her children were living in the previous film and they have adopted a huge dog. Nick has also sold his sports collectibles store and is now following the dream he's had all along: publishing a sports magazine (Maybe that was in the director's cut). When Suzanne informs him that she's pregnant with twins, Nick decides that it's time to go. He leaves these leeches and never looks back! OK, that's not the case, unfortunately. Instead, they move to the country and buy a house that turns out to be a total piece of junk. Now the repairs required and the bills are piling up and it's making Nick increasingly frustrated, which is leading to the family being torn apart! On the positive side, the jokes in this film are less obvious and the children less annoying than they were in 2005. I guess you could also say that Nia Long has a bigger role and the overall plot is better (Which I attribute to this being based on the previously existing film \"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House\"). Nevertheless, the jokes here are still far from what I would call clever. Most of the comedy concerns Ice Cube getting angry at the repairs that are taking place, him getting hit in the head or falling over when he finds yet another spot that is badly rotted or needs to be patched up or him being bewildered to find that Chuck, his multi-talented neighbor (played by John C. McGinley) has yet another job. The story arc overall is pretty predictable, with the kids not wanting to go to the country because for Lindsey, there won't be any cute boys there (guess if she'll find at least one before the movie is over) and Kevin being scared of the outdoors (do you think he'll conquer that fear at some point?). We've also got the drama with the babies coming around and Suzanne being upset that Nick isn't there to support her because of the repairs (you'd think Nick would have learned his lesson with the first two demon children Suzanne gave birth to and learned to use some birth control). We've also got this running plot about Nick struggling with material for his dream magazine. You could say it's JAM PACKED! with stuff that's not very interesting.I guess \"Are We Done Yet?\" is harmless enough, but it's not really that funny unless you're really little, not really that dramatic or difficult to predict unless you've seen very few films and overall not that original. I liked it better than the first one for what it's worth, so if you thought \"Are We There Yet?\" was awesome, then you're going to love this.As a grown man cursed to always watch a film all the way to the end, no matter how much it doesn't appeal to me, I'll admit this was a breath a fresh air compared to stinkers such as \"Dune\" or \"In the Name of the King\" but I can't really recommend it, even as family entertainment. Unless you just loved the first one and are able to suspend your disbelief because of the fact that Suzanne had a huge house in that first film, then you'll eat this up like a bowl of ice cream covered with sprinkles. The reason for me not being able to recommend it is that these cheap family comedies are a dime a dozen and they don't really do anything for the family. They don't create lasting memories or contain memorable laughs, impactful lessons or anything that stimulating otherwise. Sure, it's harmless but that's not enough to make \"Are We Done Yet?\" legitimately good. (On DVD, July 26, 2014)",

Where Brian Levant might have reigned him in Steve Carr let's McGinley run away with himself and I just didn't enjoy what he was doing here, although I really like him as an actor.There have been better remakes of Mr. Blandings, most notably Tom Hanks physical star turn in The Money Pit (1987), but Ice Cube is as good as he was in the first one and manages to carry this and makes it worth watching. It's still light, fun family fare with a warm heart but where Are We There Yet is a strong 5 Are We Done Yet is a very weak 5 but ok as a companion piece to the first.",

Another reason why I detest this show is because the kids' misbehaviours go unpunished and undealt with. If I were their father I'd really teach them a lesson or two. Another reason why this show spells \"trash\" is that Chuck Mitchell, Jr., who sold The Persons the rubbish house, is a juvenile delinquent who destroys the house and rips it to pieces and that is supposed to be funny?!!

            "content": "If you've ever seen one of Ice Cube's films before, you know what to expect when sitting down to watch ARE WE DONE YET? Delinquent behaviour, silliness galore, a touch of potty humour and lots of rap music. Well, we can't fault Ice Cube for the latter since he was one of the biggest rappers of the 1990s, but the kind of humour found in his films is quickly becoming stale now, and his hijinks don't seem as funny as they did back when I was growing up in the 90s grunge era.ARE WE DONE YET? is a sequel to the 2005 comedy ARE WE THERE YET? and some Hollywood execs even claim that it is a remake of the classic MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (1948) which we have reviewed here in the past. Personally, I find that a little hard to swallow but there are definite signs of this modern comedy being influenced by the likes of the beloved classic Hollywood film starring Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. I think it's just incredibly difficult for me to wrap my head around the fact that movie audiences have been told to expect comparisons between this film and its classic predecessor.Produced by Revolution Studios, RKO Pictures, and Cube Vision, ARE WE DONE YET? starts where ARE WE THERE YET? left off: Nicholas \"Nick\" Persons (Ice Cube) has married Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long) and together with her two children \u2013 Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden) - have moved into Nick's small, compact apartment. Chaos (and a whole lotta mess) ensues when the four of them try to navigate their way through the tight hallways and diminutive rooms of Nick's former bachelor abode. Milk is spilled and eggs go flying and when Suzanne reveals that she is pregnant, and expecting twins no less, Nick makes the executive decision to move the family out and into a larger home.Suzanne, Lindsey, and Kevin are not impressed when the search for a new home leads them into the countryside. Nick waxes lyrical about the clean, fresh air, the serenity of the landscape and the wide open spaces and tries to convince his wife and stepchildren that moving into rural Oregon is the best choice for them \u2013 until he comes face to face with a deer and then it's every man for himself! They somewhat reluctantly set their sights on an outwardly beautiful historic home built in 1889 and consider buying the property from real estate agent Chuck Mitchell Jr (John C. McGinley).Chuck describes the property as a \"fixer-upper\" and rightfully so because it seems that everything the Persons touch either crumbles into little tiny pieces or savagely tears apart with no warning whatsoever. When Suzanne expresses concern over the dilapidated structure, Nick insists that he is perfectly capable of renovating the home himself and fixing any little problems that crop up. I can pretty much guarantee that you're sitting there, reading this review and shaking your head in disbelief right about now. Believe me, so am I.Realtor Chuck wins himself a sale and the Persons move in (albeit grudgingly). Now that the family is based in the country, it's time for Nick to introduce his wife and stepchildren to the beautiful outdoors. He takes them on fishing and canoe trips, quiet walks through the wilderness, and jaunts across open trails reminiscent of the open plains of the English countryside. Nick obviously wants the best for his new family and tries really hard to help them all adapt to their new surroundings, but at every turn they encounter one obstacle after another. If they're not being attacked by a shark-like fish, their house's electrical wiring is blowing up. If they're not being chased by a swarm of bats, they're falling through holes in the floor and muddy trenches in the ground.Admitting defeat and at the behest of his wife, Nick calls in the local contractor who happens to be realtor Chuck (he wears both hats apparently). Chuck quickly gets to work and upon his initial inspection proclaims that the home's issues go a lot deeper than his original diagnosis of it being a simple \"fixer-upper.\" Needless to say, Nick is not impressed especially when he re-enters his home and finds it nearly gutted soon after Chuck's arrival. Frustrated and emasculated, Nick takes out his anger on his expectant wife and stepchildren, not to mention realtor/contractor Chuck whom Nick swiftly fires. To add more fuel to the fire, daughter Lindsey sneaks out of the house one night to go to a party and when she gets caught, Nick grounds her which further provokes the ire of pregnant Suzanne.As with all family comedies, it's pretty much inevitable when the husband and wife clash and the situation is brought to a head; in this case, Suzanne takes the children and moves into the guesthouse, away from her frustrated spouse. Unfortunately, the stress of the situation and her already fragile condition culminate into labour pains \u2013 looks like the twin babies are on the way! Turns out the nearest hospital is an hour away so Nick and Lindsey are stuck having to deliver the infants themselves. In comes Chuck and it's a full house of frantic, panicked people. Oh joy!Fast forward to six months later and we see the Persons and their friends (including Chuck) enjoying a big barbecue in the home's backyard. The house has been renovated, the Persons family is living together again, and everyone's happy \u2013 just in time for the film's animated end credits to roll. How charming! Except that it's not. The whole film seems juvenile and horribly contrived. Yes, it's billed as a comedy, but I honestly didn't laugh once and it was due mostly to the cast's poor performances and deficient humour (if you can even call it humour).",

            "content": "I am a big Fan of Ice Cube. He has done some funny movies in the past. But this movie was worst than RV with Robin Williams, or Father of The Bride. In reality this movie should have had a minus five stars. I was getting tired with the beginning credits that went on for almost 5 minutes. Then it was hard to believe that Nick would move his family into a house that was smaller than their house in the first movie. Nick was at least a well meaning and resourceful guy in the first movie, but in this one he comes off looking being the biggest loser, while Chuck on the other hand was \"Mr. I can do everything, including being a mid-wife!\" That is where the absurdity really kicks in. I was waiting for Nia Longs character (Suzanne) to stop acting so blonde, and get on Nicks side at some point. But When she flashed him a dirty look about getting rid of Nick and just rolled over and went to sleep, I was ready to go and get a refund on this movie. And then I almost lost it when there is a birthing class that Chuck and Suzanne have set up. Hmmm! It seems like she's bonding with Chuck more than her husband. Wow and can you believe it when Nick walks in on it, flips out and chases the guy off the property? This is not even a black comedy. I like the idea of Ice Cubes character trying to be successful as a writer of a magazine, but when he winds up being such a joke that the dog doesn't want to be around him, then don't come talking to me about a sequel. Comedy should have a realistic plot, peppered with funny moments. And stop giving us the predictable plots where all fathers are a joke, the wives act like teenagers, and worse of all the black family is completely white washed.",

The tag for the movie should be \"an emotionally disturbed contractor, still mourning the loss of a loved one, is helped by a young family whose house he renovates.\" Ice Cube is the straight man here. I felt like it was false advertising.Overall, the movie was an enjoyable Hollywood flick. But my other issue was Nia Long's pregnancy. The time line was all wrong. The whole movie looked like it took place over one or two months. So how was she delivering at the end? I liked it for what it was, but it wasn't what it could have been. My kids loved it, however. They've watched it several times. Funny moments, but they all belong to McGlinley.",

McGinley's multi-tasking entrepreneur and the actual house itself. There is an underlying theme here; the love-hate triangle which develops between the home-owner, the contractor and the house. The home-owner begins to despise his property, while the contractor has a vision of what the property can mean to a family. As the film moves on the house changes from an ugly duckling into a beautiful home, paralleling the transformation of the home-owner's relationship with his family and would-be friends. I know people dislike this film, but I happened to enjoy it. It's a rare occasion of a sequel being better than the original. The first film was awful.",

On the day that they decided to go look for a new house, Suzanne surprise Nick that she is pregnant. The whole family went to a suburban area looking at a house that was built long ago. The Realtor Chuck (John C. McGinley) told them that the house is very nice and it is perfect for the family to but they house. Nick and Suzanne eventually decided to buy the house. Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) didn't want to move away to live in the suburb area at all because she won't get to see her friends again. They eventually move to live in their new house. While living in the new house there are many ups and downs that happen in the family. Once Chuck was involved with family, Nick didn't like it at all. See how well the family get along with each other after Chuck was fired from his job. And will Chuck come to rescue Nick when he needed help? The movie overall is a great movie. It shows how members of the family should support each other especially in a crisis where one of the members needed support. It's also a comedy movie too.The director Steven Carr made the movie tied so well to the first one. The characters were the same and their costume was about the same. The setting just took place different from the first one and has a very good moral lesson to it too.",

I may be missing some other stolen material but I assure you this may be the only reason to watch this movie is just to say how bad this one is. Ice Cubes acting is one of utter discuss. He just is not an actor and the other actors in the movie are equally as bad. Even the extras from this film have no talent and if they did it was not shown in this movie. The jokes of the film to play off well at all. The slap stick style comedy is lame.",
