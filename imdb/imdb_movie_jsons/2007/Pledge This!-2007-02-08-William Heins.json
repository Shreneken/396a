That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one. Ill admit I thought I knew what I was getting into when I saw this movie. I knew that it was National Lampoon and how that name no longer means what it did in the 70s and 80s. I knew that it was staring Paris Hilton so that I shouldn't really expect anything majestic. But I thought that it would be a more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted to watch a simple brainless sex comedy with lots of fart jokes. Boy was I wrong. There is nothing good about this movie. Not the story obviously or the acting. But I was almost stunned to see how bad the rest of the movie was. It was poorly edited, the quality was awful. One whole scene took place in a white room and the walls were so bright that I couldn't even see the characters. (unfortunatly I was still able to hear what was being said.) Now I'm not the type of person to normally go around bashing movies without reason. But I almost feel that I cant review this movie other than to repeat that it was bad bad bad. I planned to end this by saying that you should see it just to put every other movie you ever saw into perspective but I've decided that I couldn't even suggest you do that.",

No, they are really great films in comparison with this scatological, brain-wrenching, gut-tearing, blood-sucking, mind-eating monster of a film. This is not a film, even. There is nothing there - no real script, no good casting, no good music, and finally there is Paris Hilton, an epitome of a bad taste. Man, she doesn't even pretend to play. All she can do, is a set of learned-before poses and smiles, wry and false, as she always was. This is not good, in addition to the \"pleasure\" of watching her legs and body too too much, which is not the most yummy part, either. I cannot even imagine anyone, except for sex-hungry, 12-years boy, or a little, brainless girl of 10, who could watch this abominable terror. Never allow your kids to ever think of going to watch this. Never recommended, to anyone. Rate - 0. But since here is 1 as the lowest, I give it a 1.",

            "content": "Some films get a score of 1 because they are ineptly filmed or the acting is terrible due to incredibly low budgets. Given what they had, they couldn't do much better.. This film, technically speaking, isn't that bad--it looks professional. But, it is also the ugliest and most shallow film I have ever seen without a single thing to recommend it.The film stars Paris Hilton and she also narrates much of the film. The premise is that she's the ultimate hottie and she goes to South Beach to help a sorority become hot enough to win some pointless award. And much of the narration consists of her finding fault with everyone and it abounds with her put-downs, as no one could possibly be \"as hot and sexy\" as her. She forgot to also add \"as narcissistic and pathetic\".Here are a few of the highlights in this uplifting and sublime film: a bathroom where the toilets and sinks become geysers of liquefied human waste and it spews on everyone, an Indian lady who learns about the joys of a vibrator, a lady showing off her horribly scarred breasts following breast surgery, stereotypes as opposed to realistic characters (such as the obligatory fat girl with a suitcase stuffed with snacks and the religious zealot), some anti-lesbian and anti-woman remarks/jokes (I'm not super-sensitive about politically correct stuff and still it clearly offended me to hear women referred to that way), bestiality as well as the crudest language I've ever heard (not funny crude, just classless and crass). Clearly, the film shows all the imagination and grace of a movie written by a 13 year-old--a very nasty and talentless 13 year-old. Currently, this and several other Paris Hilton films are in the hallowed Bottom 100 on IMDb. Considering it consists of Hilton dispensing advice to others on how to be a better person or just her torturing people for fun, I could certainly understand it making the list! It's nasty and cruel--without a hint of grace or cleverness. If you think that Paris does not get enough time in front of the camera and you have absolutely no values (other than to look 'hot'), then this movie is for you. Otherwise, find something else to do...ANYTHING else!",

And I was not disappointed! Everything is bad. All the gross toilet jokes makes it bad, and that scene with breast augmentation scars is simply downright insulting and distasteful. The story is completely ridiculous. What's the worst bit though, is that the film keeps on portraying Paris Hilton as the Goddess that everyone worships. The minor characters says \"Oh my god she is so hot\" once every minute, and Paris Hilton uses every opportunity to degrade and humiliate everyone else to show that she is superior. From the name of her character \"Victoria English\", one can see that she thinks she is Queen Victoria. Oh she's even got a crown on half the time. Believe me, the film is really not hot!",

I think she is a terrible actress in fact it didn't even seem like she was acting to me it was pathetic.To all of you who watched it just for Paris Hilton and drool over her grow up she is a spoilt slapper who can't act.

There is barely any continuity between scenes, and major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by the next scene. Gags and jokes are lame; every part of the movie seems to be designed specifically to insult your intelligence as a viewer. Worse, the entire movie is based around the idea of the sorority being \"hot\", but there wasn't a single part about it that I found hot. Truly, I don't think there's anything in this movie that anyone but a hotel heiress can relate to.In short, if you think Paris Hilton is beautiful and amazing, then you will love this movie!",

            "content": "\"Pledge this!\" is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have seen to date. It takes a tired concept and manages to make it worse in every possible way. The acting is horrid, the plot makes absolutely no sense, and the execution is dead on arrival. All this and more spells doom in a project that should have been left on the cutting room floor.It doesn't help that I find Paris Hilton to be extremely annoying and totally unworthy of the screen time she has been given, but to make matters worse, she narrates a movie in which she constantly tries to reaffirm her \"character\" as better than everyone else, but what was vividly clear (at least, in my eyes) is that she is talking about herself as a person, not the character she so poorly portrays.You would figure that someone like Paris would be able to handle playing the spoiled rich girl since the role hits so close to home, but unfortunately, even she seems like she doesn't know what is going on. She appears disoriented and dumbfounded as to what exactly she is doing, as do those surrounding her.This film doesn't have a saving grace. It has nothing to redeem it except for the fact it ends. And the ending is as predictable as anything you will ever find. In a movie where a snobby, rich girl gets all the admiration and respect, one easily expects the ending to knock her down a peg.... and that is exactly what happens. No curveballs here. The screenplay is bland and extremely unoriginal.Every single aspect from beginning to end was both predictable and poorly executed. It is bad enough to make a movie in which nothing new is attempted, but to do what has already been done and do it in a lackluster manner? That is inexcusable.If I am to pledge thee one sage drop of advice: Avoid this and you'll be forever better for it.",

No-one who isn't past puberty can find this funny, I watched this with 3 of my friends. We all like high school movies (we all go to college), especially when we are hung over from last night which we were when we watched this \"movie\".First we wanted to shut it off and go watch paint dry, but then some randomly placed (very nice) T&A came in to the picture and we decided to continue watching. We didn't understand anything about the plot and if you do, you have probably written the manuscript. There is no logic at all in this movie.This is what I believe that the movie is about: Paris Hilton is the head of some girl sorority, her biggest dream is to be on the cover of FHM (soft-playboy) and now she has her chance. FHM have a competition where the most beautiful sorority gets to be on the cover, awesome! But (oh no) the sorority has to have a nerd girl too so now they have to let in a group of nerd-girls in the sorority.Actually the only thing that kept us watching was that every time one of us started to complain about how bad this movie was one of the girls in movie showed her titties. Kudos to the director who actually saw when the movie sucked so bad that titties was the only thing that could save the movie. There are a LOT of randomly placed tittie-scenes which have nothing to do with the \"plot\" in this movie. And they're needed.This movie has no logic, actually not even scenes that fit together, it is for no one that isn't IN puberty, the few laughs you'll get is when the movie makes so little sense that it's actually funny. The girls in this movie are very nice tough, but they don't manage to make it watchable.Unless if you really-really like tits, then maybe this movie can make you not vomit. If you do like tits (I know I do) rent American Pie 5 instead, it's funnier. Or rent porn, it has better acting.",

I have to admit that I didn't care too much for the Dorm Days series, either, and was even whispering then.......What happened to National Lampoon's??? Anyway, I have seen quite a few Paris Hilton films and enjoyed them all, and to be honest, I didn't think she did a bad job here guys. I've seen her do worse, like her performance in Bottom's Up with Jason Mewes. It almost appeared as if she didn't really want to do that movie, as she was not making an effort to making her character believable. As for the rest of Pledge This? The movie was filled with extremely lame punchlines and a predictable outcome. I watched the Special Features, and one of the actors, I believe it was, actually called it a great script! You could have put, I don't know, Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid in this movie and it still wouldn't have been a great script! I will give it 3 stars because even though it was predictable, I thought with funnier punchlines, it actually could have been a hilarious movie. All in all, I think Paris has the potential to be a good actress if she'd stop accepting roles that are based on, well....her! Oh, and WHAT HAPPENED TO NATIONAL LAMPOON'S????",

He said that there's a woman there who claims I trashed one of her car doors while leaving the parking lot.

For some reason, the film makers have failed to make this very simple concept work. The problem lies in two things, one, the narrator, why a brain dead film like this even needs a narrator is beyond me but anyway. The narrator is no one but the obviously evil queen hot chick and the narration is right along the lines of her stuck up personality. Essentially, having a jerk be the narrator doesn't work.The second problem is that the movie, or at least the first half of it, is filled with jokes that are not only childish and unfunny, they are also very strangely executed and really rather haphazard.

The second half of the movie is also cringe worthy, but what stands out is that it is very inconsistent, it feels like he movie makers forgot to record several scenes and just skip straight to the end. Narrator suddenly, and for no reason, becomes good, tells everyone about her background yada yada ya, then everyone lives happily ever after, including evil hot chick - so strange.",

They probably hardly ever even yelled \"cut\" cause they were so OK with lousiness. Yes, tough life Paris has had. Hollywood used to have work incredibly hard to film their great films. Judy Garland worked very hard for about 14 hours a day and slept about 4 hours a night, had brilliant amazing passion and singing voice, and she touched our hearts. Judy may've been a drug addict but it was not her fault, the studios made her take addictive stimulants to give her the energy she needed for those long hours. Today, the celebrity drug addicts like Lindsey Lohan and Brittany Spears got into addictions becsuse they chose 100% on their own to take them because they wanted to be wild and party. And today we have \"Pledge this\" and horrible flops like \"disaster movie\", \"epic movie\", etc. Oh, how Hollywood has fallen. And America's way, and, well society in general.

This so incredibly mind-numbingly terrible I had several acute urges to destroy my TV-set. The jokes aren't even poorly executed, they're simply non-existent. Pledge This makes American Pie look like a Kurosawa-classic. The film suggests Paris as a sort of bad guy, but even when she acts like the most despicable person upon earth, the film manges to focus on her as some sort of role model goddess. And, dear GOD, I can't stress this enough, the acting, plot, and jokes are so appalling my brain is melting right now. At one point Paris actually comments, upon viewing her sorority pool: \"What are all the people from MySpace doing in MY pool?\" I was seconds away from dying. Also, the film randomly chucks tits your way, and features a \"smoking hot\" scene where Paris rubs up against her teacher in an awful attempt at showing him why men are simple and easy to manipulate. Your ghastly, bony ass couldn't charm the most sex-depraved being, Paris.It's also worth mentioning that despite the desperate attempt to pull through \"nerds save the day\"-ending, the nerds are first of all not nerds/freaks/whatever, but simple blond cheerleader-esquire airheads (despite being labeled as \"freaky\" or \"nerdy\") or lumbering idiots from another dimension, and they're constantly portrayed as utterly bloody useless. Apart from the stereotypical \"nerd-wins-the heart-of-the-good-looking-guy\"-girl, only she's NOT a nerd is she? And Paris doesn't even WANT him, does she? GOD, you can't even execute the easiest plot in the book?!

Paris Hilton delivers the greatest performance of her career (yes even better than her jaw dropping acting in House of Wax or the recent film The Hottie and the Nottie). Not only is this Paris best performance ever, but it also rivals the greatest acting performances in the history of this industry. No other actor this decade has come close to the mark Paris Hilton set in this film and I highly doubt anyone else will. Now enough about Paris, on to the film.This is a film where acting isn't all that is going for it. Along with Paris Hilton's fabulous exertion of the acting art, there is also an excellent script and on top of that an out of this world director. Lets focus on the script. This is truly a script that will make you laugh, cry and come back for more. The script is so fantastic that the second and third tier characters have the most beautiful lines, that they deliver with absolute care for the art form that only this talented cast could show. The quality of the lines is apparent as well. This movie is not without its fair share of repeatable quotes, which are both clever and deep intellectually. The script is one for the ages.The directing of this film is superb as well. Both directors William Heins (also an excellent actor in the film) and Strathford Hamilton (known for his excellent work with The Pact) put their hearts and souls into the crafting of this magnificent film. The choices for the camera shots were nothing short of amazing. It seems as if it spoon feeds you an amazing tale, but is full of deeper meaning, like why am I being spoon fed, just to give an example that corresponds with my original metaphor. They directors make this film work on so many levels. It is a master piece for the unwashed masses but also challenges the greatest minds with deep meaning.Overall Pledge This! is the best film of 06 hands down no questions asked.",

The directing and cutting of the scenes is amateuristic and reminds me of a cheap pornographic movie, only without the meager pay-off one usually gets from nude-scenes. Paris Hilton is her usual infuriatingly shallow and boring self. She hops about on screen with fixed poses and her lines make you believe she has the depth of a glass of champagne. Facts show that the suicide-ratio has increased exponentially since the release of this movie, and I can understand why. This movie needs to be buried somewhere no-one will ever look.

So I checked out the bottom 100 and I was curious how bad a movie could be. Since Paris Hilton stars at least 4 of the 100, this movie seamed to be a good choice. And it was. I managed to get though the whole 90 minutes, but not without pauses to reanimate my brain.So what is the problem with this movie? Story: It is sort of a simplified \"Revenge of the Nerds\" storyline, if that movie was to complicated, check this oneActing: Paris Hilton is \"playing\" a bimbo with very rich parents, interested only in fashion and style. Amazing how she does that. To be in a sorority, I would say you need to go to college as well, and actually we see 2 scenes in a classroom. One class on fashion, in which a teacher is explaining something about Dolce & Gabanna, the other is on Kama Sutra. College according to Paris.Targeted audience: Jokes are maybe funny to <12 year olds It has a strong sexual content, both verbally as well as visually. In many countries you'd have to be 18 to see it You would think it is a movie for girls, since it is all pink and fairytale like situated, but that does not match the shots of nude girls and lesbian insinuations.So what do I think about this movie? It is probably funny if you are a 12 year old boy, and manage to get a hold on it and secretly watch it with your first girlfriend. For every other sane human being, abstain from this thing, or you might suffer irreversible brain damage.For me it is a new baseline for my movie scale, I will need to rate some other movies that I rated 1 before up, because they were way better than this. Hopefully in a few weeks I will be able to do simple maths again.A well deserved 1/10",

There are some funny scenes where they show the different sororities the \"losers\" see. Also some inappropriate scenes, as I would say. This movie would've been absolutely perfect for teen girls - a classic sleepover movie. However, the inappropriate scenes that don't really have a impact on the movie, build up the R rating.

The constant background music was poorly matched to the screenplay, and was of low quality anyway.Overall I wish I could burn the part of my brain out that remembers even thinking about watching this movie. I would recommend that if you have at least a mediocre intelligence, you should steer clear of this movie. I've seen porn with better acting.

This film, however, takes the equation one step further with its quirky characters. The film stars Paris Hilton (House of Wax, The Hillz), Simon Rex (Scary Movie 3, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th), Sarah Carter (Final Destination 2), Paula Garces (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Clockstoppers), Geoffrey Arend (The Ringer, Bubble Boy) and many other young, up-and-coming actors and actresses.Victoria English (Paris Hilton) is the wealthy, snobbish president of Gamma Gamma sorority at South Beach University in Miami, Florida. When Victoria learns that FHM Magazine is nominating them for \"Best Sorority of the Year\", Victoria plots to have more \"diversified\" co-eds pledge her sorority to integrate her all-blonde and wealthy sorority. One of Victoria's pledges, Kristen Haas (Sarah Carter), suggests they pledge her ex-friend Gloria (Paula Garces) and six of her misfit dorm mates; DJ spinner Monique; an Indian exchange student nicknamed PooPoo; divorc\u00e9e Kathy, who is seeking to relive her youth by going back to college; fat Southern belle Maxine; weird goth girl Babs; and lesbian chick Tonya. The seven pledges are force to go through the most outrageous initiations to be accepted. But when they learn that it was all an act just to get the front cover of FHM magazine, Gloria teams up with Victoria's boyfriend, Derek (Simon Rex), to settle the score.Surprisingly, the acting in Pledge This! is quite solid, but the script is pretty lacking. It just does overused clich\u00e9s one after another until we hit the extremely obvious ending. However, the clich\u00e9s are actually most of what makes this movie work. If this tried to be some original romantic comedy, I couldn't see it working on any level whatsoever. I wasn't expecting much from Paris Hilton, as I had seen her in House of Wax and her acting was so wooden and boring that, basically, I wanted to throw up. However, Paris Hilton somehow manages to surprise\u0085 and this is supposed to be direct-to-video fare! I've never really thought that Paris Hilton was very attractive, but in Pledge This!, the lighting, outfits, and hair style that Paris is given really make her stand out. Simon Rex was great as usual--he has rapidly become one of my favorite actors through the very few films that I have seen him in. His acting style is always hysterically funny, and the movie was worth watching just to see what sort of wacky performance he would appear in next. Paula Garces is perfect as Gloria, and the love story between she and Derek was believable, although, again, quite clich\u00e9d. All of the other characters were very creative and fun.In terms of sight gags and nudity, they're in plentiful supply here. One of my favorite scenes had a dog giving Simon Rex a blow job! Classic! There was a lot of female nudity, and while I'm not one to complain, some scenes just felt thrown in there for the sake of nudity alone. I really liked the story; something new filled with old stuff.Overall, Pledge This! is a fun movie for what it was--a direct-to-video National Lampoon film that does very little to break from the mold. See this for nudity and laughs, but don't expect a masterpiece.",

There's something deeply perverse about this movie. Now a lot of movies are full of perverted humor and are very funny, there are many more that are full of lewd humor and are not so funny, but this one is not only unfunny. There's a sadistic undercurrent to it all.This film is like a propaganda piece made a by a dictator in an attempt to seem self-effacing: it only makes him appear more ruthless. Here Paris Hilton thinks she is making fun of a \"hot chick\" image she imagines herself to have! Instead of humor, however, follows a series of unbelievably barbaric and dehumanizing hazing ritual/pranks inflicted upon other girls and Hilton's boyfriend. For instance, getting the girls to pick up used condoms which results in their bouncing a ball of used condoms; getting the girls to advertise themselves as sl*ts by the side of the road; fooling the boyfriend into copulating with a poodle. Intentionally or not, there's something about the way the movie's shot which makes it seem as if this is to be enjoyed, that Paris is enjoying it, and that's what makes the movie especially disturbing.I don't know to what extent the plot and feel of the movie are the brainchild of Paris, so maybe she's not the one to blame. But she seems right at home in the movie. If this movie came from any one mind, it must either be a twisted mind or a vapid mind, probably both. This tripe makes \"1 Night In Paris\" look like Casablanca. It makes a classic like \"Animal House\" look tasteful, and so it is, because any gross and irreverent humor is included with precise effects in mind, not shoveled on gratuitously.

            "content": "Pledge This! is officially the WORST 'movie' I have ever seen.. I am so embarrassed that I wasted my precious money on getting out the DVD that I will never ever tell anyone that I watched this piece of crap. There is absolutely NO plot, no decent acting, WAY too much focus on irrelevant posing and looking 'hot' by Paris Hilton (who will never be and never was hot, she is mildly pretty and is her own biggest fan) and even falls sadly short of passing as a D-grade bad slapstick attempt at a 'movie'. This is not worth the time or money of any person in the whole world and would be classified best as a form of torture due to the high level of crappiness. That is all I ever need to say and hopefully that DVD will NEVER cross my path again.",

            "content": "This movie is not worth the 3 bucks to rent. Paris Hilton is an ungodly, talentless parasite on society. Why the hell anybody would pay her to display her pathetic acting skills on camera is beyond me.If you're planning on fast-forwarding to the nudity (as I did), again, don't bother. It isn't that great. Even the topless scenes with Angela Dodson (the cute blonde 'Molly' from the \"Joe Schmo\" reality show) are pretty lame. You get to see just how bad her implant job is. If she's going to take her top off, she really shouldn't move around too much.Wait for it on cable - watch it for free. Then you'll have only wasted time, not money.",

Do not go into this thinking that it's a regular 2000s Paris Hilton movie about a college sorority, it is meant to be a joke.",
