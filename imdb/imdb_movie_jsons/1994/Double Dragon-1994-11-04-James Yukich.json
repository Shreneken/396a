It is a campy flick, but it's not the wanna-poke-your-eyes-out-to-stop-the-pain campy, but rather in the realm of a guilty pleasure.In agreement with an earlier post, this was not supposed to be a film that took itself seriously.  Notably, the action was on par with any other martial arts movie being made, and the script had a bunch of smart-assy humor (which I must admit that I'm a big sucker for).  It's meant to be a fun film, and that was the end result.As far as a video game movie is concerned, it's not the worst ever made...Mario Bros is still the king, with Street Fighter in a close second, and Final Fantasy in third place.  So you see, there are worst movies that have been made.And folks, I'm not ashamed to admit that I have the DVD for this film in my collection.",

I believe that if any film bases itself on a computer game, then it stands to reason that is not going to take itself seriously for a split second! I played some of the DOUBLE DRAGON games for Nintendo when I was younger and they were pretty jokey themselves.  This little picture has great fights, great action and most importantly of all, a great sense of humour.  Robert Patrick camps it up wonderfully as bad guy Koga Shuko.  A young Mark Dacascos (DRIVE, THE CROW: STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, CRYING FREEMAN) kicks less butt than usual but is still enjoyable.  Alyssa Milano is great as the sardonic revolutionary Marion, and both Dacascos and Scott Wolf as the Lee brothers (Dacascos is 'Home Lee' and Wolf is 'Ug Lee', geddit?) both have a fine line in sarcastic remarks.  The car chase near the start with the 'Dragon Wagon' being pursued by Abobo's van is brilliant, especially with the use of computer graphics. Again, a classic example of good, mindless fun!",

            "content": "One of my favourite childhood games gets the typical nineties Hollywood makeover and only just entertains for all the wrong reasons!Set in the future, well, if our year of 2007 really turned out like this, in the city of New Angeles. With vehicles powered by burning rubbish, police curfews, buildings held up by jacks, and lots of colourful clothes and bad jeans, we enter the god awful world of James Yukich's Double Dragon.In a nutshell - Embarrassing acting from most cast members, all but Dacascos, Wolf and Nickson, that only adds to the unintentional humour, terrible make-up, costumes and direction. Its only saving grace is its two gorgeous leading men who give us some decent fight scenes and a number of funny enough one liners!In my opinion - Hollywood, oh Hollywood... For many years you have astounded us with your inability to chose directors that know what they are doing, that suit the project in action, or generally just can't stop ruining great things! Taking a documentary film maker and handing him one of the ultimate and most popular games of that time, should have been the first sign to the studio fat cats that this was going to be as much of a success as the previous years, Super Mario Bros.Haunted by that typical mid nineties costume department that helped make a lot of then films look naff, there is pretty much nothing in this 90 minutes of madness that stays true to the game. Every extra looks ridiculous and is annoying as hell, with most of it playing out like some bastard child from a Power Rangers episode!Is there anything good in Double Dragon I hear you ask? Well, yes if I'm honest. Both its leading men are absolutely gorgeous and perfect leading men material for such a film. They probably act the best out of everyone, and Scott manages to hold his own in the fight scenes alongside the always incredible Mark Dacascos. It is only a shame though that Hollywood executives thought this would be the best film to introduce Mark as a leading man, instead of his classic Crying Freeman which went unreleased in the US for many years!Double Dragon has its moments. It just makes me so angry to see such a great thing wasted, and another case of what could have been if it was in the right hands. In one scene, the spinach feeding scene, the actor in terrible make-up states, 'I'm not acting...'Never a truer word said.",

            "content": "Having played the original Nintendo game myself, it is actually a small miracle that I managed to miss this movie for so long, and I guess it is no more than justice that I finally watched it in the year of its 25th anniversary.Movie adaptations of games generally have a bad name for a number of reasons, like not being able to replicate the gaming experience, poor production values, or taking itself way too seriously. Although Double Dragon makes a valiant attempt to replicate the game's theme of urban decay and street gang martial arts (I was never aware that it had much of a story), it is definitely poorly made, with laugable acting and direction, ridiculous story and dialogue, and hokey fight scenes. But what saves it from my Wall of Shame is the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously for one moment.I don't know what the cast thinks of it today, but it looks like most actors had a pretty good idea that they weren't doing Shakespeare, and tried to have as much fun on screen as possible. Some performances, like Scott Wolfe and Alyssa Milano's, are funny in a particularly cringe-inducing way, but Robert Patrick (who had already shown his sense of humor in a Wayne's World cameo) steals the show by chewing the scenery at every opportunity he gets. The dialogue is cheesy and unintentionally funny throughout (\"You're weak, like your father!\" \"You're ugly, like your mother!\"), but Patrick delivers a line so immortally preposterous that I had to make it the titel of my review (who said there was no Shakespeare?).The art department clearly did most of the work, by putting Escape From New York, Mad Max and Big Trouble in Little China into a blender for the film's convincing post-apocalyptic punk look. That obviously left very little budget for fight choreography, so they settled for some kicks and punches in the air mixed with a lot of goofy slapstick and bad-pun jokes. What few dollars were left were spent on make-up for henchman Abobo's transformation into what looks like a hilariously bad paper-mach\u00e9 imitation of Sloth from the Goonies.Many call this one of the worst game adaptations of all time, but you have to recognize cult potential when you find it. This would actually be a 4-star movie if it wasn't so enjoyably B- or even C-grade. Really, I had a big smile on my face the entire time, and couldn't help laughing at the extremely cheesy running gag where the protagonists are startled by something, stay silent for a beat, and then yell \"WHAAAAAH!!\" in unison before running away.This film doesn't make the mistake that Streetfighter (both versions) or Doom made, which is thinking that anything in it actually matters or should be taken seriously, not even for a second. It is such unpretentiously bad pulp that it's fun, and I'd say that after 25 years, it is ready for a re-appraisal of its camp value.",

I first saw this movie when I was fairly young, and I absolutely adored it. I had a crush on the brothers (the \"Double Dragons\" of the title), and I borderline-idolized the glow-in-the-dark punk kids. They were just so cool to me!About a year ago or so--maybe two years ago--I watched this movie at about 2:00 in the morning during the summer, when there was nothing else to watch except infomercials or music videos. I was either 17 or 18. The movie wasn't as good as I'd remembered, but, to my very pleasant surprise, it wasn't nearly as bad as other people remembered it to be.This is a good late-night movie, or nice if you're in the mood for something cheesy and nostalgic. I give it a 6 out of 10. A little above average--but I think that's just nostalgia. For most people viewing it, it's probably worth a 5.",

I remember that movie!\"\n\"It's been a long time since I've seen that!\" So you can imagine I got a little\nexcited to see it. When I viewed it I thought this fun a little corny but fun.Fast forward to 2018, and I still like this movie (now onto the film).\nIn the future, the year is 2007 and Los Angeles is a dystopia with a toxic\nwater supply and the city is burnt out (Oh my god It already happened LOL).\nMark Decoscos and Scott Wolff play the Lee brothers who are fairly\ngood martial arts fighters but at the same-time goof balls as they are linked\nto a mysterious talisman which is in two haves (why is it always two haves?)\none is power over the mind, the other is power over the body and spirit\n(as I understand it). Robert Patrick is the main baddie as I understand it he is\na shadow spirit person who wants the talisman for world domination.\nThe Lee brothers have to team up to stop him and save the word. And how\ncan I forget the sexy Alyssa Malano, she has a fun part in this as well,\nshe has a cyber punk look to her, sorting a blonde pixie cut which is cool and she looks great in boody shorts they fit nicely on perfectly formed ass.

            "review_title": "It's not as bad as they say... it's even worse!",
            "content": "My first acquaintance with the Double Dragon feature film was through a collection of video captures hosted on the X-Entertainment web site. Even they could not prepare me for the purely abysmal experience that the film proper represents. Like so many video game films after it, Double Dragon takes a perfectly good idea for a video game and turns it into an abysmal feature film. The film itself has a few things in common with the video game: the title and a few character names. The game featured one or two players moving a character from the left of the screen to the right, punching and kicking seven bells out of anyone who dared to get in their way. Unfortunately, Greenleaf Productions and director James Yukich thought that by aiming the film at children too young to remember any of the video games, they might make some money. Fortunately, the adults who were old enough to have played the classic video games ignored the film as it deserved. We certainly would not want the powers that be in Hollywood getting the idea that we actually like this kind of crap, after all.The first problem lies in the screen writing. What made the video games so compelling was that they made as little effort as possible to differentiate its setting from the reality of the player. The story, such as it was, was secondary to people beating each other senseless. In the feature film, the writers attempt to give the story of Double Dragon a background, a motivation, or a reality. They manage to get all three, that much is true, but they all come out the same way: incredibly silly. Making matters worse is some incredibly stupid costume design. I do not know who designed Alyssa Milano's attire for this flick, but I am just betting they spent much of the time when they first saw what they had made laughing at poor Alyssa. Whomever designed the makeup effects for the Abobo character should have been arrested for crimes against the viewer. I do not know exactly what they were trying to achieve with all the lumpage on his body, but whatever it is, they failed. Perhaps his best scene is when Milano is force-feeding him spinach in one of the weirdest interrogations on film.Also looking to fire their agent is Robert Patrick, who was at the time struggling to capitalise on his burst of fame after Terminator 2. Perhaps his agent told him that films based upon video games were going to be the new big thing. What the agent forgot to mention was that while they were a new big thing, they were a new big thing in unintentional comedy. Preceded by one year with Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon set a new low in cinematic history that it took another five years to worsen in the form of Wing Commander. I have no doubt in my mind at all that when Patrick looks back at this film, he thinks to himself \"this is the moment I took what was still a salvageable career, and flushed it down the can\". His performance is utterly terrible here, so I am inclined to blame the level of pathetic that Double Dragon reaches upon the director. After all, he has shown already that he is more than capable of turning in a good performance with halfway decent direction. Not that a good performance from either would have saved this cinematic abortion.Another problem for a film based upon a beat-em-up video game is that the fight scenes are terribly executed. The camera rarely sits still long enough to make out what is going on, the choreography is utterly terrible, and the actors chosen for the parts clearly have no idea what they are doing. Was it really that difficult to get some people who really know their martial arts for the task? Hell, let's farm the rights out to Golden Harvest, they at least know how to choreograph a halfway decent fight scene. Especially poor are the scenes with Abobo, where none of the superhuman strength the film goes to great pains to tell us he has is actually utilised. Much like Michael Beck in Xanadu, he is really there as window dressing. Part of the problem here is that the canonical character Abobo is meant to appear superhuman in size, and the film just goes too far in trying to maintain that illusion. It would be better to have left the character out of the story altogether than present us with the tumour-encrusted visage we get here.Even as an unintentional comedy, Double Dragon is a failure. Sure, there are moments when the viewer is either going to laugh or cry, the moment when Marian force-feeds Abobo spinach being a prime candidate. However, these moments are too infrequent, and the film takes itself far too seriously otherwise, for this to be anything other than a mean-spirited laugh at the principal actors. Half of the dialogue sounds like it was ADRed by prepubescent children, and none of the actors save Robert Patrick look like they could punch their way out of a bag of potato chips. I can still remember when the advertising corps. made a big deal about this being a film based on a video game, back in the days before films based on video games had a reputation for being universally terrible. And I still wonder what the hell Alyssa Milano's costume designer was smoking. In at least half of the shots she is in, she looks like she is contemplating force-feeding spinach to her agent until he vomits up a lung.For these reasons, I gave Double Dragon a one out of ten. Between watching this film again and being given a spinach enema, I would choose the spinach. You must be wicked hardcore if you can sit through this.",

Double Dragon is easily one of the worst video game adaptions and from what I remember about the video game, this isn't one that is all that hard to adapt. Indeed had this been done as an Indianna Jones style thriller with numerous martial arts fights, we might have had something. What the movie ends up being is a cheeseball adaption that fails to engage anyone over the age of 11. Although i'm not sure even if small children will enjoy something so stupid. It's a bad movie.

I can probably guarantee that most of you butt heads, that's right I called you butt heads, hated any martial arts style movie that ever came out.

            "content": "Back in the 90s video games were still popular in arcades and home video systems were just taking off. Noticing the popularity of the games as well as the fact that they were siphoning off money that once headed their way, movie studios began making feature films based on the games kids were playing. The thing was that the movies weren't great, most were kitschy at best and then majority were forgotten not long after they made their way to video at the time. Now those kids who were brought up popping quarter after quarter into those machines and flocking to see those movies are looking back with fondness at the time and looking for those movies on disc. DOUBLE DRAGON is one of those making its way to disc now.The movie tells the story of an ancient symbol, a medallion broken in half with two dragons on it. One represented the soul and the other the physical aspects of the world. Joined together they wield incredible power. To insure this never happened the two pieces were split apart and secreted in different locations. But today men still seek the medallion pieces with the hope of taking control of that power.In the near future (at least when the movie came out) the world has changed. As with most movies at the time we now live in an apocalyptic world strewn with garbage on the streets, an ineffective police system that only covers the streets during daylight hours and gangs running the streets at night. Not average gangs by today's standards but flamboyant gangs featuring Mohawk hairstyles, clown makeup and more.Koga Shuko (Robert Patrick) is a crime lord in search of the Double Dragon. He finds one half, the soul half, and it provides him with the power to change into shadow form. But to have complete power he needs the other half. He sends his henchmen out to find the missing half of the medallion.Billy (Scott Wolf) and Jimmy Lee (Mark Dacascos) are two young men living off of fight matches where they use their martial arts skills. Billy is the more hot headed or the pair, quick to act and get them in trouble. Jimmy on the other hand thinks things through and plan a strategy. Both are being raised by Satori (Julia Nickson), an ex-archeologist who was close to their father.One night coming home after dark the duo is accosted by a gang led by Abobo, a steroid fueled Mohawk wearing gang leader who chases them, eventually catching up with them. As he is about to take them down the pair is rescued by the Power Corp, another gang that's intent on restoring law and order led by Marian (Alyssa Milano) who happens to be the daughter of the police chief. She also happens to be someone Billy has a crush on.Abobo tells Koga that the boys have the second half of the medallion. Koga rewards him with a dose of super steroids and along with his henchmen they set out to retrieve the much sought after trinket. Arriving at the abandoned theater where they are hidden a back and forth fight takes place with the duo getting out in time but with Satori being caught in the explosion that takes down their home.Koga assembles the gangs and unites them, instructing them to find and bring the brothers to him or at least let him know where they are. Seeking the help of Power Corp the brothers, along with Marian, decide to bring the fight to Koga rather than wait to see what transpires. But will they be enough to take on this evil genius, unite the medallion and save the world?The movie is played for camp from start to finish. Best of all is Patrick as Koga with so many over the top scenes that he steals the film. And that's saying something with the martial arts skills of Dacascos on display. But even Wolf, who in the extras notes he had no training ahead of time, comes off well in the fight sequences and provides comic relief. And Milano was just at that stage where she was changing from pre-teen princess to young adult here. All work well together to give the story life.MVD is releasing this film as part of their MVD Video Rewind collection. That's great news for fans because the film had only been available as an expensive import for some time now. Here we not only get the release on blu-ray but in the best shape possible with plenty of extras. Those include a new documentary \"The Making of Double Dragon\" that includes interviews with Wolf, Dacascos, writers Peter Gould & Michael Davis and producer Don Murphy, a new featurette \"Don Murphy: Portrait of a Producer\", an archival making of featurette, a behind the scenes featurette, the pilot episode of the 1993 animated series (coming soon from MVD as well), a storyboard gallery, press and behind the scenes photos, TV spots, the VHS home video trailer, the original theatrical trailer, a collectible mini-poster and reversible sleeve artwork.If you grew up with this film and it brings back fond memories for you then take advantage of the fact it's being released in such a fantastic offering like this one from MVD. You won't regret it.",

It may not have had the potential to be a great film but it is an enjoyable one. Truly, the movie becomes what the viewer makes of it. I for one consider it a must have for any fan of 80s martial arts. Even though the movie was produced in 1994, it still retains a sort of 80s feel. But all in all it is a great film to have in your Martial Arts DVD collection if you are lucky enough to find a copy. That is one of the reasons this critic considers the movie a treasure. This movie gets an 8/10 film wise but for entertainment and classic cinema it gets a 10/10. -A true must have movie for a true martial arts movie fan!!!Be sure to check for my comments on Street Fighter and Who am I?!!!!",

            "content": "This movie is a childhood favorite of mine. I especially loved Billy played by Scott Wolf. His clumsy way of using objects around him in fights. Now looking back I still love it. I love the chaos of the movie. It's all over the place and seeings the ratings I think people didn't really like that. However for me it was the feature not the bug.This movie simply aims to entertain. Create a world that is outrageous what better place than a movie. It doesn't get appreciated enough. Los Angeles is a dystopic 'New Angeles' with all kinds of oddities and eccentricities. It doesn't really follow a lot of the templates of successful movies but dares to experiment with corny jokes, outrageous clothes and odd but captivating settings.I'm not a believer that one era had better movies than other eras. I believe good movies get made every year, I do feel that nowadays this sort of so bad it's good on a big budget are missing. Just throwing everything on the wall and see what sticks. A lot of times it does fail but the few times it works you'll have very unique movies. From a studio standpoint I understand they are not comfortable taking these risks when the Internet came. I read that this movie tanked at the box office. So even then it was apparently not the best gamble as a lot of people simply don't like these type of movies.Besides a lot of cheesiness Double Dragon also has a big heart. The brothers and Satori felt like real family. Jimmy in red as the tall and skilled fighter. The more serious brother and Billy in blue as the more silly brother with improvisational fighting. The brothers are always looking out for each other. Very distinct and memorable personalities. As are the bad guys. In my opinion this is my favorite role of Robert Patrick after T2. Again as a menacing villain. But also his sidekicks were memorable as were all the supporting characters. I think the reason for this is because the movie dared to experiment. So the characters said more things - no matter how bad - that somehow stood out from the usual interactions you see in movies. Funny, lively and adventurous Double Dragon is a great movie.",

            "content": "A year ago, I posted about Double Dragon on this site. What could bring me to talk about it all over again? Well, the maniacs at the MVD Rewind collection have put out a blu ray release of this movie that has the kind of care that you'd expect from a Criterion Collection film. But it's for Double Dragon.Kids of today - let me blow your mind. You may get movies based on board games, like Battleship and Ouija - but we had movies based on video games. Double Dragon took its inspiration from the arcade beat 'em up - indeed, producer Don Murphy talks about it on the bonus feature included in this collection - but it goes way, way, way out there after that.In the year 2007, all that's left of LA is New Angeles. The city has been decimated by earthquakes and tidal waves. No one goes out after dark, thanks to the gang activity. And 2000 years ago, a magical medallion called the Double Dragon (everyone cheer when the name of the movie gets said out loud) was split into two pieces.Now, crime lord Koga Shuko (Robert Patrick, giving what he referred to as a \"pretty extreme performance\") already has half of the Double Dragon. Now, he's coming after Billy and Jimmy Lee (Scott Wolf, the one who is funnier than he fights and Mark Dacascos, who does the opposite) to get what's his.Too bad they're on the rum from gang members, trying to beat the citywide curfew. Luckily, they save their mother Satori with some help from a vigilante gang called the Power Corps and their leader, Marian, who is played by Alyssa Milano. For some reason, she has an outfit on that can best be described as short jean shorts with stockings and a baby doll t-shirt. She also has super short platinum hair. None of the above are complaints.One of the Mohawk gang members, Abobo, tries to tell Shunko he saw the medallion and is mutated for his blunder. This will not be the strangest thing in a movie packed with gangs made up of newspaper boys and mailmen falling into neon green pools of water while fistfighting.Of course, the boys' mom sacrifices herself - moms always have to die in the 1990's hero's journey - and they join Marian in battling Shuko's forces. Jimmy gets kidnapped and has to fight his brother, Linda Lash shows up and uses a whip on everyone, then Vanna White, George Hamilton and Andy Dick read the news. Literally, this is a movie that continually gets stranger and stranger and you just accept it.This still isn't my favorite movie of all time, but my score has gone up somewhat since last year. That said, if you love it - or just love great physical media packaging for movies - you can't go wrong with this purchase!",

            "content": "Released in 1987 by Technos, Double Dragon is the spiritual successor to Nekketsu Koha Kunio-kun (known to the US as Renegade), a game that was inspired by the high school life of creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto. Basically - you fight to survive.When Renegade was released in the U.S., it was localized so that it appeared to be a video game version of The Warriors, with punk rock inspired bad guys. Double Dragon takes that to the next level, where Billy and Jimmy Lee (or Hammer and Spike, as the original cabinets called them) have to battle through hordes of post-apocalyptic punkers to rescue Billy's girlfriend Marian. There had never been a game like this before, where two players could beat up a near endless array of bad guys and even steal their weapons from them. It felt like you were in a movie. So making a movie of Double Dragon - and its many sequels - seemed like a great idea.Koga Shuko (Robert Patrick, Terminator 2) is a crime lord looking for a magic medallion called the Double Dragon, which has been broken into two pieces. He already has one half, but now he needs the other.Meanwhile, brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee (Scott Wolf of TV's Party of Five and Mark Dacascos, the American chairman of Iron Chef and Mani from Brotherhood of the Wolf) and their adopted mother Satori (Rambo: First Blood Part II) are racing home to beat curfew after a martial arts tournament. Oh, a curfew? Yeah, it turns out that in the Los Angeles of 2007, an earthquake has made the city an apocalypse, lorded over by gangs. One of those gangs, led by Abobo (one of the game bosses) attacks, but they're saved by the Power Corps, led by Marian (Alyssa Milano, Commando, every 90's boy's bedroom wall). Coincidentally, Satori has the other half of the medallion and Shuko mutates Abobo so he can go back out and get it.The gang attacks again with Shuko even possessing their mother. The boys escape thanks to her sacrifice and go on the run as Shuko unites the city's gangs, which have Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) among their members.If you're reading this and thinking, \"This has nothing to do with the video game I've played and loved so much,\" congratulations. Welcome to the world of 1990's video game adaptions!Will Billy and Jimmy finally stop being dweebs and learn how to fight? Will there by rollerblade attacks on an evil shopping mall? Wil they fight over Marian? Will there be fart jokes because all video games are really for children and not adults despite all evidence to the contrary? Who are the Power Corps and what do they have to do with Double Dragon?Amazingly, this movie was written by Paul Dini, who created the most perfect media adaption of Batman ever, Batman: The Animated Series and also wrote for Lost. There are some weird Frank Miller-esque talking heads on Channel 69 News, played by George Hamilton and Vanna White that try to make this movie into Robocop. Oh yeah - Andy Dick is also the station's weatherman. They have nothing really to do with anything else in the film.Because I come from Pittsburgh, allow me to make fun of Cleveland, where this was filmed. The boat chase sequence was filmed on the Cuyahoga River and ends with a gigantic explosion filled with 700 gallons of gasoline and 200 gallons of alcohol. Despite warnings in all manner of the news, the explosion caused a panic, leading to 210 phone calls to emergency services in 10 minutes. Oh Cleveland.This movie defines the word missable. I have probably played hundreds of hours of the video games they inspired it and have often written my own tales in my head of my character's motivations. Every single one, even back to when I was 16, are miles beyond this film. I've never seen a movie before where a bad guy hugs someone until he passes out, so there is that.Then again, if you always wanted to watch a kid-friendly version of The Warriors, I guess this could be it.",

There are one or two recognizable video game bad guys like Abobo and the lady with the whip, but other than them this movie has almost nothing to do with the game.

And, as any seasoned cinema-goer will know, any film based on a computer game is often not worth the celluloid it's made with. And, as with Streetfighter, Super Mario Bros and House of the Dead, Double Dragon is pretty bad. But not that bad\u0085 although certain conditions apply to that statement.I grew up in the eighties and played the original Double Dragon video game religiously, therefore I'm always going to look upon the film version through slightly rose-coloured spectacles. Secondly, I seem to have a mild appreciation for really 'so-bad-they're-good' films and this is so bad it's good.It's about brothers, Billy and Jimmy Lee, growing up after some sort of great earthquake in a rebuilt Los Angeles. The police struck a deal with the gangs that no 'gang warfare' or crime will take place during the day, putting a curfew in place at night where law-abiding citizens can hide away from the hooligans who rule the streets during the dark. They find half of a magic medallion which isn't really that magic. Although it would be if the other half was found. And the other half is in the possession of the leader of the gangs \u2013 the T1000 himself with a really bad haircut \u2013 Robert Patrick.I think one of the main reasons Double Dragon is widely regarded as such a flop is because it really didn't have the budget to be anything special. It kind of comes across as a 'made-for-TV' movie and the script is pretty awful. Even Robert Patrick (normally reliable in everything he does), struggles to bring anything to his role as 'generic bad-guy.' Plus the film is rated '12' yet I think that's a little strict. I'd say the primary audience for this film is eight-year-old boys who are watching this on a Saturday morning. A film based on fighting should at least have some violence in it, however all the fight scenes are almost comical with the heroes using everything from frying pans to random object to despatch their foes. Oh, that brings me onto the foes. The gangs Billy and Jimmy fight seem to be dressed in completely different uniforms to each other. It's like watching the two boys beat up the Village People. Seriously, you have one gang member in a bowler hat and suit, one dressed as a workman, one as a postman and so on.Unless you're like me and loved the computer game, or can appreciate camp rubbish films like this, you'll have to be a young boy to get anything out of this. I've now re-watched Double Dragon and, although it killed an hour and a half of my time, the fact that the two heroes spent much of their screen time screaming (supposedly) 'comically' into the camera even started to get on my nerves. But it was fun \u2013 silly fun. Pretty bad, but I've seen worse (House of the Dead \u2013 I'm looking at you!).",

            "content": "It's obvious why the Super Mario Bros. live action movie bombed? The games themselves didn't have much of a storyline to begin with. The Super Mario games was about a fat italian midget plumber who suddenly becomes huge after eating magic mushrooms and had to rescue his princess from a monster who looks vaguely like Godzilla. Which is why they ditched the original plot and made a movie that is nothing like the material it's based on. However, the Double Dragon series, unlike Super Mario, has a believable storyline and settings that could had been converted very well into live action. Let's take a look.Double Dragon 1 (Arcade Version): In this game, Billy & Jimmy Lee are martial arts masters out to rescue their girlfriend/student Marian from a street gang known as the Black Warriors, led by the machine gun toting Big Boss Willy and his two right men, Abobo and Jeff. Not exactly Shakepearce material, but they could have add an extra dimension to the storyline and give background details about the characters. The game itself draw heavy inspirations from Enter the Dragon, especially at the names of some of the villains (Williams, Roper, Linda and Bolo).Double Dragon 2 - The Revenge (Famicom Version): Taking place a year after the above, in this sequel, a terrorist group has killed Marian and now Billy and Jimmy are possesed by anger to avenge her death. This sequel is more inspired from a Japanese comic book series called Hokuto no Ken (AKA Fist of the North Star). The setting is that of a semi-apocalyptic New York (as if NYC wasn't bad enough already) and featuresa horde of supernatural villains such as Burnov (a fat man who's body dissappears after dying, leaving behind his mask and clothes), the Phantom Doubles and the Shadow Warrior at the end of the game. At the end, Marian is bought back from the dead and everyone lives happilly ever after or something like that.Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stones (Famicom Version): Taking place two years after the events of Double Dragon 2, Billy & Jimmy returns home from a training mission only to meet an old fortune teller named Hiruko. Hiruko tells them that in order to proved their strength, they must go on a wild Goose chase to collect the three Rosetta Stones and solve the mystery at Egypt. They go to China, Japan and Egypt to collect the stones and they meet two unlikely allies: Chin Seimei from China and Yagyuu Ranzou from Japan. Upon going to Cleopatra's tomb, the heroes eventually realized that Hiruko took advantage of Billy and Jimmy so that she could steal the treasure at Cleopatra's tomb. Hiruko dies mysteriously and the heroes are force to fight Cleopatra's reanimated corpse. After Cleopatra is defeated, the heroes donates Cleopatra's treasure to charity and the powers of the stones is left in question. Although, it has a cheesy storyline, the game itself took place in exotic locations and the Dragons fights agaisnt several enemies such as punks, monks, ninjas and strongmen.Return of Double Dragon - Sleeping Dragon has Awoken (or Super Double Dragon): Probably the best storyline in the series, too bad Technos forgot to program it into the game. The storyline is essentially a remake of the first game. A female cop named Marian Kelly is kidnapped by a drug cartel known as the Shadow Warriors. Billy and Jimmy engaged a war agaisnt the Shadow Warriors and it's leader, Duke, to rescue her. The storyline is very realistic (no post-apocalytip settings, no medals, no Rosetta Stones) and most of the characters has interesting backstories that are only explained in the manual. This would had been an ideal storyline to adapt into a movie, especially since it doesnt follow the previous games, but stay true to the original.NOTE: Double Dragon V is excluded from the list since it's not a true Double Dragon game and was made by Tradewest and not Technos Japan. Same thing with Battletoads & Double Dragon. Plus both games sucks.Sadly,  Paul Dini and Jim Yukich decided to ditch the storyline behind all the games and made some cheesy Power Rangers-ripoff about two idiots played by Scott Wolf and Mark Dascacos trying to save the world from some evil businessman named Koga Shuko by trying to find some cheesy medal called the Double Dragon. They team up with the film's good gang called the Power Corps, a group of hippies and clowns led by a tomboyish Alyssa Milano, and they get chased by several gangs including Clowns, mailmens and zombie basketball players. Eventually, Scott and Mark gets the medal, which allows them to change into their \"Game\" suits (they still don't look anything like the real deal) and they beat Shuko up. Eventually, Shuko is arrested and the main characters dies a horrible and painful death after Bo Abobo crashes their Dragon Wagon (not really, but I wished it was true).A really horrible movie that insults fans of the Double Dragon series. What could had been a decent martial arts flick turn out to be a total train wreck that was made to torture little kids. I watched this movie when I was younger and I hated it.

There was Van Damme's awful and woeful attempt at making a Streetfighter film and then there was this pile of rubbish.Most of you \"older\" readers will remember an old arcade game called Double Dragon - although it was not the first scroll-a- long-beat-em-up game, it did start a trend in the arcades and on consoles for beat-em-ups such as Dragon Ninja, Final Fight, and so on.This film is nothing compared to the game.  It has virtually no martial arts (its all comic book stuff - watered down to please the kids), and all the stuff in this seems cgi enhanced which makes this film pretty tacky.  It could have been a lot better, it could have stuck to the plot, but considering the fact that the game didn't really have all that much plot to begin with - you could see where they had problems.Some history of the game: Double Dragon was released on the SNES (amongst other versions and consoles) where the franchise ultimatley met its death.Double Dragon 1 which this film is supposed to based upon is a kill off the drug dealer who kidnaps your girlfriend (if you play this is two player mode - you had to fight each other for the girl).Double Dragon 2 had a ridicolous plot of a magican wanting total, ultimate power (I think this is where the scriptwriters got their lame story from) - this was a very bad version of the game.Double Dragon 3 (depending on which version you had) was either a: save the president,  b: save the girl (again!) or c: find some sacred treasure by going around the world (which was only three countries) to beat off the bad guys.  A pretty poor effort.Double Dragon 4 (includes BattleToads?) This is just pants, avoid.Double Dragon 5:  Oh dear, lets copy Streetfighter shall we?  This was the final nail in the coffin.Super Double Dragon: This actually felt like the original sequel, it concetrated on martial arts and action rather than stupid plots about power and scrolls.Anyway the film is pretty pore, I was expecting the bad guy (played by the T1000, Robert Patrick) to use a machine gun (just like in the game), but he doesn't.This is a VERY bad game, please someone make a serious kung fu martial arts version of this game - before its too late.If you want a serious version of a martial arts game, its probably better to stick with Mortal Kombat, avoid this trash.",

If it vaguely resembles the subject matter you were fired or something! Mario Brothers featured bleak landscapes and a cast that was tipsy the entire shoot because of the awfulness of their film. Sadly, that film followed the subject matter better than this one did! I know you have to add some stuff to give the film more depth, as it cannot just be Billy and Jimmy roaming the streets beating people, but why make the film about Billy and Jimmy constantly screaming in terror like teenage girls and running!?! I mean, a car chase, a boat chase, these are things that do not fit Double Dragon.The story, basically a convoluted plot that centers around a medallion that is referred to as the double dragon. The bad guy from the second Terminator is the bad guy here and he cannot fight and neither can Milano. I am guessing all the positive reviews of the film come from her fans, because they cannot be from fans of the game! Billy and Jimmy get wrapped up in this and they are mediocre at best fighters who run at the first sign of a strong opponent. We get the leftover vehicles from Mario Brothers and the sets as it is set in a gritty future where Vanna White and George Hamilton rule the airwaves along with Andy Dick!The film has fighting, but the fighting sucks. They made that big dude from the game a total mutant who does not fight, like at all, just stomps his way up to people. You got a gal with a whip that gets beaten by a move that would not hurt an elderly person and you have the guy from Terminator showcasing some seriously lacking moves! Double Dragon!So, this film sucks, if you like it, you may have a serious issue or a fan of Milano's butt. This thing made that Fist of the North Star film with Downtown Julie Brown seem totally awesome by comparison!

Even though I have never played the arcade game before, I know how cool this character is. He reappears as an awful special effect and looks just plain stupid. He's beaten easily. He later looks at a beautiful woman and sees himself as being ugly. I guess this, motivates him to be a good guy? When he comes back, he still doesn't do any fighting. His character was mostly pointless. I have played this amazing flash game called \"Abobo's Big Adventure\" which shows the character much better represented. He's force fed spinach which makes him fart. It's as dumb as it sounds. Most of this film is completely pointless. There's a subplot where the characters try to steal the other half of a medallion. You could literally take those ten minutes out and nothing would change at all. Did they really think they could get the medallion half while the villain was right there to easily see them? The costumes in this film are downright tacky. There's a postal worker who just jumps off a building into mud. What? The effects are awful as it features the villain using his shadow powers with awful CGI.There's a scene where the brothers crash into a sign and their boat is blown to pieces in a firey explosion. They then appear just fine, but how? There's a scanner that outright says they're dead. What's going on? The villain is eventually defeated by turning on lights. Yeah. He drains all the lights in the city and then he's defeated by them being turned back on? He uses the medallion's power to turn into two blue people. What am I even watching? The acting is awful too. You should at least watch the \"Killer Tomatoes\" movies for intentionally being dumb. Go back to \"Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie\" for a video game movie that's actually good. *",

            "content": "Since the Super Mario Bros. movie in 1993 video games have been met with fiercely negative reviews from critics who savage almost every single one of them based purely on their origins. I understand now that we live in an age where video games are movies in their own right, if not even more poetic and innovative than most movies themselves, but in 1994 they were not considered to have any literary or theatrical merit, and even to this day (with a second attempt at a Hit-man movie only just being released as I type this review) they still cannot seem crack the code on how to make a coherent and worthy adaptation.Double Dragon is not the exception, it's the rule. The classic arcade game featured two dudes, Billy and Jimmy Lee, who walk to the right in an apocalyptic cityscape and beat-up thugs who have kidnapped their (apparently shared) girlfriend Marian. She obviously enjoys double (CENSORED). This could not and was not going to make a good movie.With a writing team consisting of Paul Dini and Peter Gould any additions or expansions on this thin premise was welcome and the resulting movie is a live-action cartoon with way too many ideas for its budget or its director's abilities.Double Dragon is an ex-treme-ly 90s flick. Martial arts movies for the kids became a big thing (or at least attempted to) in the early 90s after the success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Drivel like Surf Ninjas and 3 Ninjas never managed to capture the edge that made the 1990 TMNT so good. Double Dragon almost gets there, but chooses goofy humor instead of darkness and pathos.The year is 2007. Instead of suffering a dismal summer of an awful Die Hard sequel and a Simpsons movie with no laughs in it the people of New Angeles long for clean air and safety in the streets. The old city has been destroyed by an earthquake (another popular 90s trope) and gang roam at night while smog smothers during the day.Scott Wolf and Mark Dacascos play \"twin\" brothers Jimmy and Billy. They look nothing like each other. Tom Cruise could play Scott Wolf's twin easily, but the budget couldn't stretch to Cruise. They are also supposed to be 17-years-old despite being 25 and 29 at the time of filming. They are orphans looked after by Satori (Julia Nickson) who holds one half of a sacred amulet (yes, it's one of THOSE kind of plots) which can grant super powers to anyone with both halves.A clean air industrialist (Robert Patrick) wants the amulet so he can take control of New Angeles, despite running a pretty tight monopoly already. And so the streets are raging as a final fight with a vendetta is unleashed upon the thugs of New Angeles. An overweight and blond Alyssa Milano plays a more dynamic version of Marian, wearing short shorts that barely cover her vagina. Robert Patrick manages to avoid embarrassment by being surprisingly game about the whole thing too.By all rights the movie is terrible, but there's an infectious vibe to the eccentric production design and cinematography, and some of the matte paintings and establishing shots are quite impressive. James Yukich (his name creates an appropriate onomatopoeia) has no real vision of his own and lets the chaos take whatever shape it naturally wants to be. You either go along with the low-brow cheese that it is or you'll hate it. Personally I was never once bored by it nor did I really dislike it. The crudity of its assembly (half of the dialogue is ADR) and the tacky synth score helped turn it into a surreal, almost auteur experience. But why on Earth Yukich figured that \"Altogether Now\" by Scouse band The Farm made for a fitting end credits song is beyond me. It doesn't match the film at all!Since the day of its release and the resulting internet notoriety over the years I have always been curious about the big screen bomb of Double Dragon, but honestly it's not that bad.",

Nowhere in the video game is there the talisman cliche' common to movies. This should have been just a straight beat em up like the game. A generic martial arts film. But it tries to do too much at once. Some of the settings get pretty ludicrous with the punk imagery, such as the green water in the one gang's hideout, which takes things too far.",

            "content": "Its really quite amazing to see how campy the 90's could actually be. Its also mind-blowing to see just what movies actually got full cinematic releases back then. Case in point, 'Double Dragon', easily one of the most 90-iest 90's movies ever made.K so just in case anyone wasn't in the know, this movie is based on the hugely popular scrolling beat 'em up videogame 'Double Dragon' released in 1987. Double Dragon was basically the game that kick-started a wave of martial arts inspired fighting games throughout the 80's. Interestingly this videogame adaptation was made two years before the dumpster fire that was 'Street Fighter'. But both movies were released in late 94, 'Double Dragon' coming first in November. I'm guessing the studio knew they had a piece of crap on their hands and possibly thought to release it during the height of the beat 'em up craze with 'Street Fighter' (?).So what do we have here? Well its pretty much the standard 90's fantasy plot mixed in with lots of hokey oriental mysticism. Thousands of years ago in ancient China an army of shadow warriors lay siege to a city. In order to save his people the King sacrificed himself to create a powerful medallion. Said medallion gave its owner immeasurable powers over the body and soul. This power was so strong that the King (presumably before he died) split the medallion in two; one half giving power over the soul, the other the body. Naturally both halves have since been apart and hidden from each other. No clue who the shadow warriors are or were. No clue why they were attacking this Chinese city. No idea how the King made this medallion by sacrificing himself. Why would the medallion be so powerful? Was the King a wizard or something? Did the medallion save his city and people? Why am I asking these questions? Well I guess because it all seems kinda important to the plot and its a huge chunk of exposition.In the present (then) futuristic day of 2007 a nasty villain called Victor Guisman (inexplicably changing his name to Koga Shuko later on) is after the medallion so he can rule New Angeles (Los Angeles). He finds one half (on a bad set made to look like a Chinese village) but of course the other half is owned by the Lee brothers. The Lee brothers are of course based on the two main characters you can play in the videogame (Billy and Jimmy). Unfortunately they couldn't even get that right as they cast Scott Wolf and Mark Dacascos. Now whilst I agree Wolf has the boyish looks and Dacascos has the martial arts skills, they most definitely can't pass as brothers. Putting all things aside, you have to remember this movie is terrible. That's the only reasonable excuse. But they did get their individual red and blue outfits right, so there's that...I guess.Billy and Jimmy also have a guardian (adopted mother) that just happens to be an Asian lady with martial arts skills. Lucky that innit, image how crap things would have turned out if their adopted mother was a boring white woman who worked as a bank clerk. Satori Imada (Julia Nickson) is essentially the stereotypically wise mystical Asian character, thing is she isn't particularly mystical in this. As for the villain we have the glorious Robert Patrick hamming it up...gloriously. The character of Victor Guisman/Koga Shuko was created for this movie but added into the 1995 Neo Geo videogame. For some reason this character has hair like Vanilla Ice, an obviously dyed goatee, eyeliner, and dresses like an evil oriental sorcerer of some kind (the usual obligatory dress code). His sidekicks are Linda Lash (Kristina Wagner) who is based off the whip wielding female fighters in the videogame. And finally Huey (Jeff Imada) and Lewis (Al Leong) who are your bog standard Asian martial arts henchmen (but not based on any game characters). I believe the duos names are a nod to the actual Huey Lewis for some reason. At one point Shuko asks 'Huey, Lewis, any news?'. A reference to Huey Lewis and the News.Lets not forget Bo Abobo (Nils Allen Stewart) who is also another videogame character. This villain in the game was a huge roided up meatbag, obviously this being pre-The Rock there weren't that many guys as big back then. But Stewart is initially a good similarity. Alas they fudge this character right up by mutating him into some ginormous hemorrhoid. He then proceeds to do literally nothing for the rest of the movie. So being a movie set in the future, and made in the 90's, there's only one direction this could possibly go. Yes that's right, its a dystopian, post apocalyptic, flooded hellhole that's overrun with various punk gangs and skateboarding vigilante groups. A massive earthquake destroyed half of California yadda yadda yadda. Its remarkable how cities seem to crumble into wastelands filled with gangs when natural disasters happen. Why did half of the youth decide to join scummy street gangs after the quake? How would that make your life any better? And where do they get all their gear from?? Is there a big leather, spikes and chains store in the area? The most utterly bizarre thing about these gangs is the fact some of them dress in postal uniforms, mime makeup, clown outfits, and posh grammar school-esque uniforms.Then you have the Power Corps vigilante gang that...well I'm not sure what they actually do but they're all kids. Do they fight back against the baddie street gangs? Do they fight back against the police and their curfew? Not really sure but what I do know is their attire is totally tubular dude...not! Seriously this gang is the most 90's thing about this entire movie, its unbelievably cringeworthy. A large gang of kids of various ages in a large secret base filled with arcades, skateboard ramps, electronic equipment, some weird green water...hell its just an adventure playground covered in graffiti. And their leader is Marian (Alyssa Milano) from the videogame, only this time she's a badass with cropped bleached blonde hair and dressed in rainbow coloured clothes. Seriously I think the director forgot this was a kids flick at certain points. Like the shot of Milano's ass in tight cut-off jeans whilst she's on all fours crawling into a vent.So as you might expect there are tonnes (and I mean tonnes) of fast, not so witty, quips and mugging into the camera by virtually all involved. All the action centres around vapid childish martial arts sequences that just looked bad even back in 1994. You can see no contact is being made, the sound effects are way too much, everybody is over acting when getting struck etc...Its legitimately embarrassing to watch at times. Other actions sequences focus on vehicles which are just as bad because its all very slow and basic. It makes no sense why the vehicles are the way they are (seemingly no petrol but running on anything you can stick into furnace-like tank). And how would a common street gang get a hold of a massive Humvee-like 4x4? Oh and they stuck metal teeth on the front grill, because that's hella intimidating right...right??The speed boat chase sequence is the epitome of how naff this really is. Billy and Jimmy find a speed boat and escape on the river. The bad guys just happen to be all suited up in all black wetsuits with a couple jet-skis ready and waiting to take pursuit. I think the only positive thing I can say about the movie (and this sequence) are the nice looking matte paintings dotted throughout. These images of a ruined LA alongside live action shots do genuinely look quite good. I quite liked the idea of these large metal struts that hold buildings in place, because of aftershocks. And the special effects on Shuko in his shadow form (when activating his half of the medallion) were very effective. The creeping living shadow on the ground was a nicely realised idea.I think the question here is, should we have expected more from this kids movie? Well at the time videogame adaptations were just starting to flood the market so to speak. 'Street Fighter', 'Mortal Kombat', 'Resident Evil', 'Tomb Raider' were all to come, looming on the horizon. Sure we had already suffered 'Super Mario Bros.' but that was merely seen as a one off mistake, a blip on the upcoming genre. So yes I think its fair to say we were expecting more at the time and looking back they should have done much better. Clearly this should have been an adult movie, I think an over the top violent adult flick could have gotten away with more here. As it stands a dopey kids movie was always gonna be tough because you're simply restricting yourself so much.The plot is weak as hell, cookie cutter stuff. The characters are basic bland stereotypes. There is absolutely no risk involved in anything (no one dies). WAY too many kid actors, also the background extras are hilarious to watch. Just focus on the odd one in crowd scenes and watch them 'act'. The costumes are a literal joke. The weapons all look plastic. The pop culture dates the movie terribly (George Hamilton as a newcaster, digs at Madonna etc...). Dreadful looking early CGI sequences are dreadfully ghastly. Oh and the actual arcade cabinet of Double Dragon is clearly seen in the movie...ugh!!! In short this movie is a pantomime of crap. Its not 'so bad its good', its just bad.2.5/10",

            "content": "I'm going to start by saying that there has only ever been one great video game to move adaptation and that was the terrific Mortal Kombat and that should give you an idea of what direction I'm going in with this review.I'm not your average movie goer, I am first and for-most a retro gamer and in the 80's and 90's I lived and breathed computer and video games with Double Dragon being one of my all time favourite games. It's now 2014 and for 20 years I have avoided seeing this film. I deliberately dodged it when it came out because I just knew in my heart of hearts that not only would it have nothing to do with the game but it would be watered down kids action with bad acting all round.Well guess what, I was right!Double Dragon: the Movie is atrocious!!! Seriously, it really is that bad. Now I'm a big fan of low budget post apocalyptic action films from the 90's but even then Double Dragon takes the biscuit for just sheer lack of quality on all counts.The film features I think THE worst acting I think I have ever seen. the delivery of the cringe worthy lines is so bad it makes King Of The Kickboxers look like an Oscar winner, but then those kind of films are backed up with a quaint charm and great fight scenes, Double Dragon has absolutely none of that whatsoever and is a magnificent turd from start to finish.I'm convinced that video game adaptations were simply cash makers given to first time or music video directors to dip their toe in the film world because the name would generate at least a bit of revenue and it really didn't matter whether the actual film was good or not.As for the game well, it had a pretty thin story I'll admit, but there was no reason why they couldn't have taken that thin story and built on it instead of making up this mystical nonsense and almost completely changing everything which just p*****d off fans of the game who should have been the films main target instead of the simpering under 10 year old's that it was aimed at.I will be fair, there are one or two positive points in the film but they are extremely trivial. One is the matte paintings used for wide shots of the earthquake ravaged city, they are quite nice and add a bit of atmosphere. Two is Mark Dacascos, he is a fine martial artist and a decent actor but even he struggles in this film. Third and finally is Robert Patrick who genuinely looks like he's having some fun. When he accepted this role Mr Patrick was either desperate for work or he is the absolute King and master of not giving a f**k and I suspect it is the latter because he seems to take a lot of glee in hamming it up and ham it up he does, but with a bit of a wink.Another small point I'd like to make in the interest of fairness is that if you were young and saw this film when it came out then I can totally understand the nostalgia value attached to it and how that can make any film seem so much more enjoyable but being such a huge fan of the game I was never going to have that even if I saw it in 1994 so this review is completely objective.That's about it! I don't think I've ever given any film a 1 before but Double Dragon truly deserves it. A great, steaming pile of utter s**t that bears practically zero resemblance to the great game on which it is based and is an absolutely terrible example of film making in itself.",

            "content": "Oh boy. There's a lot to take in here.Make no mistake, some parts of the craftsmanship are all too over the top, gauchely imitative, or downright questionable - John Carpenter's 'Escape from New York' is an obvious point of inspiration, as are 'Mad Max' and 'The warriors,' and who conjured the design for Robert Patrick's hair and makeup? CGI and animation feels outdated even for 1994, recalling contemporary videogames for the PC or Sega home consoles; specific special effects inspire definite skepticism; the look and feel of the picture often recalls other title from the same approximate timeframe that are in turn both imaginative and garish: 'Super Mario Bros.,' 'Theodore Rex,' 'Dick Tracy.'Yet even at its worst the work behind the scenes was merely informed by decisions of the producers, and director James Yukich, and the crew involved turned in fine work regardless. Truly, the production design and art direction are pretty terrific; practical effects are well done. The costume design and hair and makeup work, though dubious at points, are nonetheless solid. The many stunts and actions sequences are superbly executed; hats off to co-star and stunt coordinator Jeff Imada for a swell job. Though not necessarily true across the board, no small amount of the original music is actually really solid and fun - and hey, what a cast! Even if only in bit parts, there are some recognizable names and faces here; not just Patrick and Imada, but Vanna White, George Hamilton, Alyssa Milano, and Michael Berryman, and it's always an especial pleasure to see Al Leong.On the other hand, the more confounding elements of the fundamental building blocks are small fries compared to the storytelling. Both in the root story and in the subsequent screenplay, there are all too many decisions that were made that raise a quizzical eyebrow, or possibly one's hackles. Please understand, there are some genuinely fantastic ideas here in all regards - the setting and scenario, the narrative, the characters, and no few scenes. Yet in an attempt to widen the audience, and especially to appeal to a younger audience, the writers injected extra silly or even juvenile humor that borders on cartoonish. The plot is rather simplified so it could be easily parsed by the youngest of viewers, yet the writers go a step too far and reduce concepts to their most basic form. Some characters are weakly two-dimensional, but mostly not; antagonist Shuko is just blandly power-hungry. The tale introduces ideas and themes of extreme corporate malfeasance and environmental meltdown, but doesn't do anything with them; in real life the heavily militarized Los Angeles police are the real villains, but in oversimplified \"New Angeles,\" they're heroes. (A gag near the end in which the police are described as \"underfunded\" and handed enormous new funding is downright disgusting.) The narrative effectively belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon.Sure, you might say it's just a ridiculous action romp, and particular criticism doesn't mean a whole lot. Yet of everything that get thrown into the movie at one time or another, what we didn't get was any honesty or authenticity. It's well made, yes, but in striving so hard to attract younger viewers, it became less enjoyable for anyone else. In boiling its ideas down, it ensured it wouldn't age well, including not just the \"copaganda\" but also passing instances of fatphobia and ableism. And between the emphasis on Youthful Fun and the action-oriented slant, there's not much for the cast to do except overact in the living cartoons that are their roles - Patrick not least. I hope they at least had a good time making it. I can see how 'Double dragon' could have been entertaining for a broader general audience. But to do that, the writers would have needed to aim higher, and not take the cheap and easy paths. As an easy example of how the film could have been improved, living anime monster Abobo gets far more time on-screen than he needs or deserves, while Shuko henchmen Huey and Lewis, played by Imada and Leong, are mostly just fleeting set pieces. Yet in the seconds before the end credits start to roll, Huey and Lewis get one last scene, and are given the best lines and the most genuine humor in the entire feature!In my opinion this is saved from sinking lower by virtue of the hard work that went into it from behind the scenes, and those elements that are done well, including much of the visual design and the fights and stunts. It's sad and a little frustrating that the writing is so tawdry that it becomes a detraction rather than an advantage, but here we are. I'm glad for those who get more out of 'Double dragon' than I did, but when all is said and done there's no question that this belongs on the mountain of videogame adaptations that just didn't pan out.

I'd never have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, but it's true. Dazzling special effects, an involving storyline and some brilliant character acting all blend together to form possibly the most gripping martial arts adventure I've ever witnessed.No, alright, fair enough. But if I'd just started off by saying \"Double Dragon is possibly the worst thing ever\" then you wouldn't have needed to read any further, would you?Let's get on with it. I first saw the trailer for this the same time I saw the teaser trailer for the similarly classy Street Fighter, and DD is still loitering on the New Release shelves of my local Blockbuster - so that should give you some idea of how long it was missing in action, in the UK at least. Why they saw fit to bother releasing it at all, I don't know. Okay, it's not as bad as some cheesy chop-socky teen ninja efforts I've seen, but it's hardly a coup for even the mangiest little video company.The storyline - I think that's what they're calling it - revolves around the Double Dragon amulet, a couple of brothers (only one, mysteriously, Oriental) and a nasty bloke with a stupid name who wants to get his hands on both halves of it for ultimate power, world domination, free bus pass etc. etc. etc. And if, going just by that, you can't imagine exactly how the 'plot' 'unfolds', then there's something seriously wrong with you. We get stunts, fights, goodies, baddies, even a vague suggestion of lurve interest, but it's all done in a nauseatingly slapstick kiddie-friendly manner (so there's people hitting each other with cymbals instead of sticks with nails in, for instance, and the nearest we come to a rampant sex scene is a brief glimpse of Alyssa Milano's upper thigh followed by a shot of the two brothers exchanging witless grins).There's a single special effect on display throughout the entire film which, I admit, isn't bad in itself, but does start to grind when it pops up every ten minutes or so. And fortunately for the acting average, there's one relatively credible actor on hand in the form of good old T1000 Robert Patrick, who launches a valiant attempt to save the film by - oh no. He doesn't, actually. He's even worse than the rest of them. Sorry.It's not much good, then.

            "content": "Movie critics hold up Double Dragon (DD) as a beacon of what-not-to-do when it comes to motion pictures, but I'm going to explain exactly why they're wrong, and DD is a bastion of film-making legend.Overall: Along with a couple B-list celebrity cameos and a helluva lot of tongue- in-cheek comedy, DD delivers many a humorous scenario with lovable, over the top characters. A product of its time, an overtly obvious wit and subtle charm accompany a glorious 90's soundtrack.The Future: While the predictions of the 1994 movie fall far short of how the future actually played out, this time capsule offers an excellent view of what would happen if LA Street Gangs got a hold of virtual-reality technology integrated into their leviathan-esque vehicles. Other: Also the portrayal of the right-wing stance on gang culture is phenomenal. Use of puns by gang members added to the realism, and therefore the viewer's immersion.Double Dragon: The double dragon medallion is a symbol of the duality of the soul, the struggle each man and woman must cope with from the day they are born: the duality of being an invincible, unstoppable ghost; or not.Combat: The fighting style is unique and original, and many scenes require the fighters to improvise with any object they find around. For example, one scene shows a protagonist fighting an enemy with a broom, showing the person has immense versatility as a warrior. One protagonist, Annoying Italian Guy #1, is so moving with his power and speed that I would go so far as to call his fighting style \"Poetry of the Fist\". Random Asian Henchman #2's incredible ability to take multiple kicks to the face was a nice touch as well.Cross-dimensional similarities: The realism between the fictional Power Corp bears striking similarities to Al Qaeda, in that they are both called terrorists at one point or another, and they are both phallic entities of almost incredulous enormity. A good amount of dialogue is puns that reference other movies and indulge in intertextuality. Dialogue: The only way to describe the dialogue and punchlines in this movie, would be: brave. Seriously, these writers must need wheelbarrows to carry their 200-pound man-berries in.SFX: This movie was incredibly eye-catching from the get-go, but what kept my attention was the time that was clearly spent on the special effects. So compelling was the detail and smoothness it flowed with that I was almost moved to tears.Final thoughts: This movie is a masterpiece - an emotional, action- packed, thought-provoking thrill ride that no self-respecting human being should miss. People will be watching, enjoying, and writing essays about this film for years to come.A+ and 10/10, would see again and recommend to friends.",

            "content": "But it's still a 4/10 piece of tripe that could've been great had it been well choreographed, well written and not aimed at kids (most of the people that were fans of this series would be young adults anyhow!) It's got a PG-13, but there's no real violence, nudity or cussing!!! The only thing I thought was cool was the settings, they'll stand out in my mind, as well as Alyssa Milano and Robert Patrick. Even Mark Dacascos is OK, but he would've been a help w/ the novice fighting choreography. Not to mention the bad guy who KILLS they're mother (close enough) got arrested to be let out on bail anyhow rather than being mutilated is beyond gooey and nice to me. Get me a real martial arts movie w/ broken necks and intestines being ripped out!!",

            "content": "This film clearly insults fans of the classic NES side-scrolling beat em' up. I can imagine the seared minds of those who loved their classic game when exiting out of the theater. And how right I am. Not only is the film a disgrace to the games, it also shows that Hollywood is only interested in $ signs rather than the material. For starters, the production values (WHATEVER THAT IS) are laughably bad, the acting is akin to that of a lobotomized inmate in an asylum, and to top it off, the horrendously awful fight choreography and special effects. Who, and I mean WHO can't forget the disgusting portrayal of Abobo, the coolest and meanest brute in the games. That name struck fear and terror in the hearts of those who played the games.The greatest joke played on the fans is the plot. It is clearly a direct contradiction to the games where the focus was on the brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee out to rescue Marian from the clutches of the Shadow Warriros. Here they fight against a nameless gang led by a totally cheesy and lame villain who's very weak for the brothers. It was supposed to be set in a post-apocalyptic version of New York!!! Why must Hollywood insist on having the film take unnecessary liberties when making video game movies? I can't recommend this travesty to anyone. It is bad I tell you, BAD!!! Stay far away from this piece of trash.",

Robert Patrick is, of course, the old pro here and gives the best performance he can with the script he was offered. Special effects are actually quite good and the make-up is tolerable. Again, it's no \"Titanic\" but it's just a fun, mindless movie.  Besides, any movie with Alyssa Milano in tight clothing in it can't be all bad ;)",

The other half hangs around the neck of Billy,,, (you see where this is going)This is obviously based off of the DOUBLE DRAGON video game,, and it does not take itself too seriously either. It's cheesy, corny, and a lot of fun.",
