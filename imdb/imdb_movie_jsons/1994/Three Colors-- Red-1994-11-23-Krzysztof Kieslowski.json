            "content": "It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will, against the odds, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people's lives.This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob), who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway. Not that she is without some baggage: she has a boyfriend, unseen, who also demands to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who troubles her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. She strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. \"I want nothing,\" he coldly says, and elements of BLUE suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent, free-floating freedom, conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character at first shocks Valentine -- she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror, but a chance event has her back at his place, and here is when he begins revealing who he is, and his great loss.At the same time Kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from Valentine -- but they keep missing each other. Chance is the word. Like Valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits, elements of chance pepper her life and Auguste's. He has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather. One of them happens to be the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste does, and he's never met her. Like God, or Prospero, he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression \"We meet again.\" It's this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in reality, a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it. There are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames, so many things would be different.Such is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond: she is that woman whom he did not meet -- by chance or not -- and is, whether he knows it or not, trying to make amends, hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast. But it doesn't end there. One of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyhow), and Karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking, \"Someone is worse off than I am,\" Valentine is the one who helps her. Frailty in need can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character.Now, RED is so much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita the dog: these aren't characters confined by storytelling. An American version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed-down ending. RED is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place.Adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal. This is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays Olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead. In WHITE, Dominique has Karol listen to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) as she has sex with a man while the billboard of Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT looks on. In RED, the old judge's tale of love and betrayal gets re-enacted. And all this time, Valentine's billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that Rita, the dog Valentine's car struck, bears seven pups, life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love. Why do I say six? You'll have to watch the movie and wonder.",

            "review_title": "Krzysztof Kieslowski's Testament",
            "content": "This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film!'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life. Several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final, which only a great artist could have staged.\nLittle else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times. Yes, the film starts slowly, and the fans of the American style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers. They deserve it. The film gets quality as it advances, and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. Cinema quality is very original, the image being a 'Study in Red', as the title shows. Acting is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age. A great film. Seeing it again probably adds, and I am happy to have it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.",

            "review_title": "A Sublime Shade of Red",
            "content": "The last film in the Three Colors trilogy, RED, is deceptively simple, yet it rounds out everything that came before in an enlightening way. It slightly resembles THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE in its theme of fraternity, and in its casting of Irene Jacob, who manages to exude a sense of curious innocence and integrity. She interprets the role of Valentine, a young Swiss model and student living in Geneva and experiencing a kind of emotional limbo as she awaits her boyfriend's return from England. Through a seemingly trivial twist of fate, she  encounters a cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who leads a lonely, world weary existence and eavesdrops on his neighbors' telephone conversations. Initially she finds his detached indifference appalling, and wants to report him, but her compassionate nature enables her to comprehend the greater plight of the man, one of leading a fruitless, lovelorn life. They form a touching friendship, and this sets the stage for another turn of events. Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) is young judge who is in many ways a mirror image of Trintignant's character. He lives near Valentine, but through possible lack of synchronicity, they never meet. Upheavals in his life are accordingly similar to the old judge's, but this time, due to the presence of the noble Valentine, an old adversity can be turned on its side, bringing fulfillment for everyone.With Red, there is a real sense of culmination unlike any other. Wistful, melancholy, yet life-affirming, the film offers hope in world full of supposed mistaken paths. Tritignant remarked on Kieslowski's talents in augmenting the emotions of the actors through his technique: \"I'm very pleased with my work on this film - and I don't think it had a lot to do with me. For example, at the end of the film when my character goes to the window, looks outside, and starts to cry - I couldn't do it, I couldn't summon the tears. I tried to make myself cry but couldn't manage it. Krzysztof called the make-up lady who shot menthol into my eyes. We shot the scene and Krzysztof said 'It's good, next shot.' Recently I saw the finished film. I waited anxiously for this scene. And I cried when I saw myself.\"Tritignant's nuanced portrayal is augmented by equally good work from Jacob who bears insight into her role as well: \"Something really great about RED are the 'non-encounters' between Auguste and Valentine. They pass each other without ever meeting. They might be great for each other but they never meet. It reminds me of THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE where the two identical Veroniques are face to face but don't see each other. In RED this idea is reflected by the way Valentine can't face up to her life, her love, her sorrows. How can Auguste see her, or she him? How can they both release themselves from this blindness?\"The uplifting aura of this film shines even brighter given the pettiness with which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences brushed it off. Due to the fact that is a multinational co-production, with a Polish director, mixed Swiss and French cast and crew, Red was not allowed to compete for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar as a film from Switzerland. Indeed, the trilogy itself is without a country as it transcends borders and even culture in its solemn inquiry into human nature and that is a prize in itself.",

            "content": "Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. One conversation they listen in on is of extreme importance- the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife. We discover that the live of the young judge parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them. As we find out more about the couple, the more the mysterious man reveals about his own story. As he continues his tale, we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. Little does Valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge will soon become entangled together. Her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate- a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner- and an event which would allow Valentine to become the saviour of the young judge who seems to be traveling down the same path as her now dear friend. She is driven to prevent the young man from suffering a similarly grim future- one filled with loneliness and solitude. And with this it seems the old man's dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days.An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. Usually signified with a subtle pause, or late focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.",

            "review_title": "The Film I Will Always Remember Krzysztof Kieslowski For.",
            "content": "The final and most haunting of Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski's (Oscar-nominated) \"Three Colors\" Trilogy. \"Red\" completed a trilogy which paid homage to France and also sent a gift of philosophy and originality to the world cinema. It is once again modern-day France and a beautiful young model (the illuminating Irene Jacob) accidentally runs over a dog in her car. She discovers the dog belongs to an old retired court judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Trintignant is an elderly man who is a natural cynic and proves that the world is not what it seems by spying on all those around him in the neighborhood (even going so far as tapping into others' phone conversations). Jacob and Trintignant then go on an emotional journey together to learn that we are all connected in this topsy-turvy world. Thus the film ends up representing the French flag's red which shows the nation's fraternity. In the end the series is wrapped up with the strangest of twists that admittedly feels a little a forced. All three films in the trilogy are neatly tied together and that is really the only problem I had with this otherwise fine motion picture. Kieslowski and long-time co-writer Krzysztof Piesecwicz (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominees in 1994) put a yellow ribbon on a strong professional partnership that always toed the line of greatness and went over the top here. When the \"Three Colors\" Trilogy was completed, Kieslowski (who had dominated the French and Polish cinema for nearly 25 years) vowed that he would never work again in movies. Sadly that would become a reality as the famed director would die in 1996, still in his mid-50s. Krzysztof Kieslowski's works are highly deep and very philosophical in all major respects. His trilogy was a fitting conclusion to a wonderful career and \"Red\" is a crowning achievement to one the finest film-makers who ever lived. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I found \"Three Colors: Red\" to be a strangely disorienting but compelling film. Of the three connected movies by director Krzysztof Kieslowski, I thought the color motif played out the strongest in this film, with Auguste Bruner's (Jean-Pierre Lorit) red Jeep, the awning above the Chez Joseph caf\u00e9 and the red counters within, Valentine's (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) photo shoot, the d\u00e9cor at the ballet studio and the bowling alley, and the presentation of the fashion runway. The bold use of red proclaimed the title throughout the picture, much more effectively than in the stories of 'Blue' and 'White'.One of the things I appreciate and value in a movie is originality that's brought to the creative process, something that seems to be lacking in almost every story you might come across elsewhere. This does not seem to be a problem with Kieslowski. His ideas are novel in a way I haven't experienced before, as in this story where a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) eavesdrops on his neighbors' phone conversations. That struck me as bizarre as it did the story's protagonist, Valentine. What I found distracting though was the way she comported herself in Judge Kern's presence. Upon first meeting him, he seemed an unsavory character, yet Valentine quite frequently got within arm's reach of the man. Not knowing what he might have been capable of, I thought she was taking an unnecessary risk, especially since he used a cane and could have used it as a weapon. I found that very distracting.What's clever, yet seemingly too coincidental in the story to occur, is the way Judge Kern's life already lived parallels that of the young man Auguste. Both were judges of course, they were both dog owners, and both were betrayed by women early in their relationships. Being older, I found Kern's insight into the human condition to be almost prophetic, as in his dream interpretations for Valentine. What was particularly insightful, especially in light of the way the story ended with Auguste and Valentine finding each other, was the manner in which Kern stated early on that Auguste hadn't found the right woman yet. And how Kern himself felt about Valentine possibly being the right woman for his younger self. Having watched the three connected films of Kieslowski out of order, with 'Red' being the first, I felt compelled to return to it once again after watching \"Three Colors: Blue\" and 'White'. It was rewarding to do so, as elements from each film come together in a way that carries more resonance than if viewed as stand alone movies. The main twist of course is witnessing the survivors of the doomed ferry in the English Channel, not only Valentine and Auguste together as a couple, but the principal characters from the prior movies as well. There's also the connecting thread of an elderly citizen in each movie observed by one of the primary characters trying to use a recycling bin. It's probably noteworthy that the recycling bins stand in stark contrast to red, white and blue; they're bright green in each picture.",

Who says foreign cinema is boring? This film is riveting! There is too much in this movie to begin making comments. I reckon this is the best film of the 90s(although I heven't seen Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction). It is JUST underneath \"Citizen Kane\". I love it! I recommend it to anyone in the right age!

            "review_title": "The final chapter in a flawless saga",
            "content": "Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in obscurity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: \"Three Colors Trilogy\". This chapter in the trilogy, being the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In \"Blue\" we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in \"White\" it was more of a light hearted, narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. \"Red\", however is focused on the \"what ifs\" and \"how comes\". It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced spying equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring a lot more to the story. Consider in \"Blue\", the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character's behavior. \"Red\" is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life, but it is also about chance, hope, and fate.Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Though through self reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives across from another, younger judge, who highly resembles the old man. This is the \"what if\" that keeps circling in the movie. What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, since he so closely resembles the older one. Valentine doesn't know this, only we do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in. We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence, as almost a suggestion of Irene's fate.I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man. Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motif of the telephone, to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life, to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak, and to the old man, it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.All three \"Colors\" films stand for a certain principle, most common in France. \"Blue\" stands for Liberty (the personal being), \"White\" stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one), and \"Red\" is Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle, Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well, in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the Equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene.\"Red\" is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both \"Blue\" and \"White\", it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.It's hard to imagine that \"Red\" was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed!",

The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy.I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching.

In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by. You sense Red is really an allegory, a reenactment of Prospero's omnipresent gestures in The Tempest, yet it is more than its story appears. Red demands countless viewings, and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.Although Red stands alone as a masterwork from Kieslowski, it's best viewed as part of the trilogy.

This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness. In my view, Valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other, the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one. Finally I would like to stress Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's performance, she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the \"Three Colours\"-trilogy.",

The judge-with- qualms monitoring. And all of these folded against the others.And on top of it, Kieslowski has assembled a design team that produces one of the lushest visions on film, taking the folding metaphor into the framing, especially in the various rooms.If you know what he is attempting here: three essays on the role of the viewer in creating the `time' of the film world, it makes all three that much richer. But here we have his most sublime success, a perfect synthesis that people can enjoy even if they know not why.

            "content": "Kieslowski gives us a tapestry of interwoven stories in this, his last turn. I welcome films of this kind that go on to show how, if no life exists in isolation, then our troubles don't either, they have roots that surge forward and back, and so there's a road that leads out of the thicket.Blue was about memory, how the past surfaces to color reality. White was about desire, how the imagined future surfaces to color reality. This is something else, even more penetrating in its coloration of reality, in my opinion the best of the three and Kieslowski's crowning jewel. He would retire after.It begins with an opening shot of phone wires running between interconnected lives, carrying voices and stories that circle the ether. We then begin with two lives on the same street and how they begin to interconnect. One of the ensuing threads is self- referential about Kieslowski.A chance confluence of stories brings a young woman to the house of an old man, Kieslowski himself. Retired \"judge\" and spends his time eavesdropping in the lives of people, inserting himself as observer of stories. In his days as judge he similarly inserted himself in the stories of people brought before him, deciding right from wrong. Now he no longer feels the need to arrive at verdicts, he simply observes the coming and going. One scene revolves around her discovering his habit and how it's a wretched thing to do. How dare he insinuate himself in the secrets of people? Also self-referential, Kieslowski critiquing the job of presuming to know peoples' innermost selves.Better than personal commentary, this is self-referential in a larger way about observing and living a life that has to make sense of how stories and images surround us. Kieslowski does some of his best work in ushering us along that path, all of the Dekalog pays off here.The old man not just as cynically indifferent observer but as someone who has given up on life, broken by something in his past. Now he has taken up the habit of vicariously inhabiting other peoples' stories as substitute for a lack of his own. What we have is a narrator at the center of narratives. Someone who is burdened with the memory of dashed dreams. Someone who lives in the mind, the mind as this house of fictions.The way Kieslowski decenters the reality of what happens next is magical. Something more mysterious is starting to take place, isn't it?Not all narratives are innocuous the old man shows us, or express a simple truth. There's a neglected old mother somewhere who lies to her daughter about having a heart- attack to get her to visit. In a court that punished lying she would be found guilty; but she only wants the company of her daughter. We see here how narratives (including dreams and memory) are extensions of self, ways of bringing close to us something we need.And then Kieslowski shifts again. Only now can he begin to show us how not everything that we see is actually taking place. He makes it a point for example to reveal that he never climbed on the top floor of her house like in the bizarre scene that we saw earlier (he saw her in a mirror). The book didn't fly open to a certain page in the middle of a street but in an auditorium. Some of it may be an old man's story that reinvents in order to reveal, some of it might be dreamlike fantasy. But precisely the point isn't to say what is true and what not. To decide what is true would be to show a great lack of humility, the judge says. The sailor in his story may have been guilty; but not convicting him allowed him to live a peaceful life. It culminates in a marvelous scene in an empty theater with doors flying open by the wind. But the way Kieslowski has decentered us from rigid truth, we can surge through a whole life to see many possible ones now. Is this his dream from 20 years later and he's going to wake up next to her? Is it a confrontation between her and him about an affair, taking on this dreamlike shape? Is it about finding her or losing her? Lynch was not forthcoming about whether or not Kieslowski was an influence when bluntly asked. But I believe that part of Inland Empire is set in Lodz (where Kieslowski went to film school) for a reason, a more eloquently playful acknowledgement. He would take us so very far.",

            "content": "All three films in the \"Three Colours Trilogy\" are must watches, and even me considering 'Three Colours: White' the weakest of the three is not saying anything to discredit it. That is still a great film which is testament to the brilliance of 'Blue' and 'Red' for them to be even better.'Three Colours: Red' is my favourite of the trilogy. Even with less emphasis on action and dialogue (though not devoid), it has the most layered, thematically rich and thought-provoking story of the trilogy. To me, 'Red' is not just the best film in the trilogy but also one of the best films seen by me in a while and one of the finest final films for any director.It chiefly focuses on the electrifying relationship between Valentine and the judge, and like with 'Blue' being a poignant exploration of grief and liberty and 'White' a blackly entertaining one of equality and revenge 'Red' explores the theme of fraternity, as well as other themes of morality, free will and destiny, and manages to tell a powerful and thoughtful story out of those themes. Again, like 'White' and particularly 'Blue', 'Red' is heavy in symbolism, such as the recycling of bottles (here representing solidarity), the use of the colour red to emphasise the theme of fraternity, links to the protagonist's past (here with fountain pens and never shutting doors and gates) and juxtaposition of physical levels, but in a way that's always fascinating and never incomprehensible (even if it takes more than one viewing or some research to fully get the significance of it all).Visually, while all three films are superbly made, 'Red' is perhaps the most visually stunning. The cinematography is stunning in its elegance and beauty, with bold use of colour and handsome production design. The music score is the most powerful of the three films and the most memorable and fitting, not as symbolic or as intricate as 'Blue' but stirring stuff indeed. Kieslowski's direction as ever is assured and unobtrusive, his style is unmistakable and he does a lot of interesting touches that make the film visually and dramatically fascinating.Again, the writing is thought-provoking and makes the most of the film's rich themes. The central relationship is portrayed electrifyingly while the ending is quite the masterstroke in figuratively and literally tying the whole trilogy up. The two lead roles are immaculately acted by luminous Irene Jacob and commandingly nuanced Jean-Louis Trintignant.In summary, a brilliant film in every sense. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

When she brings the dog to his owner, she finds a man full of anger and cynicism. He also has a depraved hobby of listening in on the phone calls of his immediate neighbors. Valentine is shocked by this. She is pushed by him to act on her judgment. When push comes to shove, she falters, regretting her posturing. It turns out that he is a retired judge and there is something in his past that intrigues her. From this point on, she and this man begin to develop a unique relationship.

Three Colours: Red was directed and co-written by Polish Kieslowski and is set in Swiss Geneva. Although if you have ever been to Geneva Airport, there is an exit which takes you to French soil.The film in his heart has two stories that could be interchangeable. Is it a story about the law student Auguste or the experiences of the judge in his younger days?Valentine is a student and part time model living in Geneva, her boyfriend is in England. She runs over a dog and goes to see the owner, a retired cynical and aloof Judge. She discovers that he uses devices to eavesdrop on his neighbours phone conversations.One of the neighbour's Karin is the girlfriend of Auguste, the law student who lives near Valentine's house. Although horrified by the Judge's actions she gets to know the Judge and they become friends.This film was the last of the Three Colours Trilogy and it signifies Fraternity. The characters who are disparate are connected somehow. Auguste and Valentine are neighbours and so is the Judge and Karin. Judge's relationship with a past girlfriend mirrors the unravelling of Auguste's and Karin's.By the end the characters mingle with some of the characters from the other two films. Kieslowski brings his films full circle.It is a thoughtful film but it also has lots and lots of talking.

            "content": "It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite:  view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work.  It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry.  They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.  Collectively, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.The color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad, the profiled model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters.  The other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad, posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection.  This ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie, yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons I have called Red a `mind-bending' film.  This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, based on the Blue-White-Red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, `Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.' The films stay primarily focused on these themes, keeping with the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality, White) to social (Fraternity, Red). Red is my favorite of these films, and I give it a 9.  It stands by itself as a great film, but one should see Blue and White first for the fullest effect.",

The story is centred on Valentine, a part time model who is studying at the University of Geneva and whose boyfriend is in England. One day she accidentally runs over a dog; she tries to take it back to her owner but he is initially unkeen to take her back. She returns later and gets to know more about the man; he is Joseph Kern, a cynical retired judge, who spends his time illegally listening into his neighbours' phone conversations. As they talk to each other they have effects on each other's lives.I found this film to be a real delight. The story is perhaps the simplest of the trilogy but it is none the weaker for that. While there are more characters this is mostly about the relationship between Valentine and Kern; it is interesting watching her attitude to him change as the story progresses and a strange friendship develops. There is no suggestion that there is anything sexual about this relationship which was refreshing. Ir\u00e8ne Jacob does a really great job as Valentine and Jean-Louis Trintignant is very solid as Kern. As anybody who has seen the first two films will expect the colour red dominates; be is the colour of cars driven by key characters or the background of a giant advertising poster featuring Valentine. Finally as the film ends there is a nice link to characters in the previous two films; I won't spoil that with details though. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different; it is a must see if you enjoyed 'Blue' and 'White'.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",

This film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story. The film is very much a puzzle, but the message is pretty straightforward: Everything happens for a reason. Love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. The title, \"Red\" refers to the French flag, where red represents \"fraternity,\" or brotherhood. The color dominates the visuals of the movie.

            "content": "I find Blue, the first film in this loose, thematic trilogy, to be a little ponderous... brilliant, but ponderous. White is exceptional, though I'm aware that not many viewers would share that personal opinion. However, what is clear - having been noted by a number of professional critics and Internet fans all over the world - is that Three Colours Red is really the absolute creative pinnacle, not just of this series of films, but of Kieslowski's career as a whole.The film has many similarities with Kieslowski's earlier film, The Double Life of Veronique. Here, as in that film, we have Irene Jacob portraying a deeply sad young woman, searching for a sense of meaning within the confusion of everyday life. Now, this brief assessment is in no way an accurate retelling of the events of the film, with Kieslowski once again drawing on his favourites themes and motifs, including cultural and chronological dislocation - in which two seemingly disparate story lines come together alongside a different story which could very easily be seen as a retelling of the actual film - and the prevailing notion of chance, which was a major component in much of Kieslowski's work, not least, the Three Colours Trilogy as a whole. However, what really makes this film work, is the attention to narrative detail, story development and character depth... with Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz making sure that for every sublime image, or poetic moment of transcendence, the film still offers the viewer an emotionally engaging story, and characters we can believe in.Like much of the director's work, particularly films like Blind Chance, No End and certain moments of his classic TV series The Decalogue, the seeming simplicity of the story actually goes deeper than we first believe, with Kieslowski and Piesiewicz's script taking many labyrinthine twists and turns, suggesting actions through symbolism (the crumpled cigarette carton and the broken beer glass at the bowling alley), prefiguring actions through images (the poster of Jacob's character, Valentine, and how it relates to the final image of the film), and suggesting character history through conversation and subplots (the back story of the judge so central to the film, and the way that it mirrors the story of the young law-student who's life could very well be seen as a flashback to previous events).There's much more to the film that that, though, with Kieslowski also working with the theme of fraternity (or brotherhood) and the sense of sight and sound, as well as the continual use of the colour red (and the various connotations that this colour would suggest) in the production design, costuming and photographic composition. We also have the inter-weaving strands from the previous films all connecting in a gloriously metaphysical and entrancing final scene that should leave most viewers completely satisfied. These various layers always work alongside the story and the characters, so the film never seems pretentious (as some viewers have criticised) or distancing, but rather, interesting, intelligent and, for me, completely life-affirming. The real hook to the film, for me, was the relationship between Valentine and the mysterious old-judge (who some might argue plays an almost god-like role in the proceedings here... although you don't have to view it like that), which is layered with sadness and pathos but ultimately seems quite beautiful.Despite all the clever narrative framing devises, the use of chance and coincidence within the story and the always beautiful design, music and photography, the film was never better than in those few scenes between Valentine and the Judge (both perfectly performed by Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant) in which their characters dither around their attraction for one another, and manage to find solace in their shared sense of heartache. The particular highlight of these scenes is the final meeting between the two characters after Valentine's triumphant fashion show, in which she finally, after an hour and a half of the film, is able to tease out the root of his twenty-year anguish... only to find that it refers to a situation, which, surprisingly, mirrors that of her own. Other strong performances in the film come from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Feder and Jean-Pierre Lorit (as the young law-student/judge-incarnation), whilst the aforementioned climax brings together Juliette Binoche, Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent, Julie Delpy and Zbigniew Zamachowski... the respective stars of Three Colours Blue and White.For me, each of the Three Colours Trilogy are absolutely essential viewing for anyone mildly interested in the art of film-making. Whilst both Blue and White are great films, this is my personal favourite... it remains a testament to the creative genius of Krzysztof Kieslowski and stands as a beautiful, tragic, though ultimately hopeful film, which could, quite easily in my opinion, be proclaimed the greatest film of the 1990's.",

            "content": "The Swiss/Polish/French film Trois couleurs: Rouge was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Three Colors: Red (1994). It was co-written and directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski.The movie is set in Geneva where Valentine (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) works as a fashion model. Early in the film, her car hits a dog. Many people would have driven on, but Valentine stops and carries the injured dog to her car. She brings the dog to the owner, a retired judge played by Jean-Louis Trintignant. (Incidentally, carrying an injured animal from the roadway into your car is an extremely dangerous act. It works well in the movie, but don't try it at home.)The rest of the film consists of the Judge's bizarre behavior, and the effect that Valentine has on his behavior, and on his life. He, in turn, predicts things about her life that we know will come true. (Almost in the manner of magical realism.)There's also a sub-plot about a young judge (who drives a red jeep) and his girlfriend. This subplot is attached in an unusual way to the main plot. It sounds complicated, and it is, but it works.Ir\u00e8ne Jacob is very beautiful. Obviously, that's essential for her role as a fashion model. (She's also in advertising--there's a huge red advertising poster depicting Valentine, which we see occasionally.) However, this role calls for more than beauty. We have to believe in Valentine as a caring, sensitive, and compassionate human being. Jacob is a superb actor, and she carries it off.Jean-Louis Trintignant was surely one of the great actors of 20th Century cinema. He is brilliant in his role, and he works very well with Ir\u00e8ne Jacob.Their interaction made this my favorite of the \"Three Colors\" movies. In \"Blue,\" Juliette Binoche carried the film; there wasn't a true male lead. In \"White,\" Julie Delpy barely appeared. The star was Zbigniew Zamachowski, who is a good enough actor, but not interesting enough to carry a film by himself. However, in \"Red,\" we see two extraordinary actors working together to make this an engrossing and powerful experience.We saw this movie at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. It was shown as part of the \"Three Colors: Remembering Krzysztof Kieslowski\" series. The movie has a very high 8.1 IMDb rating, which puts it into the IMDb top 250 films of all time.If you're fascinated by European films of the late 20th Century, \"Red\" is a must-see. I'd recommend it to any person interested in watching a brilliant movie, with two great stars acting and interacting extremely well. It will work on the small screen. Just don't miss it!",

The color red in the French flag stand for \"fraternit\u00e9\", which of course means fraternity. Blue is freedom or actually liberty and white is equality.All three movies are build up from coincidences. This movie probably the most of all. It feels more real than most other movies we watch, most Hollywood-movies, because isn't it true that life itself is all based on coincidence. Early in the movie Valentine (Irene Jacob) hits a dog with her car. Because of this event she meets the owner of the dog, a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Other persons could have hit the dog, other persons could have met the judge, or not at all because they didn't bring the dog back. It is all coincidence.The retired judge is tapping phones from his neighbors. Although Valentine therefor does not like the judge at first, she feels some connection with him. We also meet Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit). He is a law student and lives across Valentine. They have never met although they have probably seen each other more than once. May be they never will meet. Life is a coincidence.Slowly we learn the story of the judge and his life. We see parallels with stories around Valentine and her boyfriend, who she only speaks over the phone, and even more with the life of Auguste. If the judge was a lot younger he and Valentine could have fallen in love. But the judge is not younger.The movie and therefor the trilogy ends with the final coincidence. Do certain characters meet? It is not for me to reveal here, but we learn that people never have to meet. They can, but if they do it is all coincidence.Having watched the three movies I think this is the best one. May be that is because it is the last one, I am not sure. The cinematography here is a little different, it looks great. The music, as in the other two movies, is perfect. With fine performances and a great direction, Krzysztof Kieslowski's last movie, this is a real masterpiece.",

My last hope was that the movie doesn't go too far into serving the older-aged male director's cliche of connecting a young and pretty female character to a much older, wise, male character but it did anyway. I gave a six because the camera and the acting from the male lead was good. It was still a very disappointing watch overall.",

It's hard to find a reason to care.Sure, the wide-eyed, preternaturally patient Valentine (Agnes Jacob) is pretty to look at. And French screen legend Jean-Louis Trintignant (playing retired jurist Kern) creates somewhat of a compelling presence. But when you throw the two characters together, it's underwhelming.We're supposed to believe that successful catwalker Valentine, whose face graces billboards, is fascinated by Kern, whom she meets after hitting his dog with her car. Not only does Kern seem indifferent to the canine's health, but he reveals he's rigged a system that lets him eavesdrop on neighbors' phone calls. Oh, how very charming -- and Valentine can't resist returning to visit the wizened, unshaven curmudgon.In red herrings along the way, we observe that Valentine's boyfriend seems less than thrilled with her, though she never confronts this problem. And we voyeuristically follow the perambulations of a morose law student and his cheating girlfriend. These plot twists lead nowhere, serving only to extend this production to the length of a feature film.I watched this movie till the end based only on Trintignant's\nand the director's reputations.

Potential viewers are cautioned to be paitient and attentive with this film.  Since it is a foreign film it does not dramatically spell out everything for the viewer, like most American movies that often lack something called subtlety. Rather then give you a detailed character and plot synopsis that might spoil the pleasure of discovering the details of this unique film I will attempt to comment more from the perspective of the films themes and merits...The story very basically follows a young woman named Valentine whose life is shown with its intersection with other people and events that are to shape her life, particualry, leading her to two important strangers in her future. Now, granted, the interactions of one's daily life is nothing very extraordinary from a surface level but what makes this movie extraordinary is the way in which it takes the viewer from one seemingly random incident to the next and begins to connect them to reveal a larger puzzle of life, beyond any single person.  This is one of those movies that doesn't wear out upon repeated viewings, in fact it may reveal more of this well layered film.  On a visual level the film communicates story through carefully placed images (this might be obvious after watching the movie for a couple minutes, but there is a specific visual element that is sustained through every scene of the film).  On an auditory level the film has a great soundtrack that has music that is actually incorporated into the plot.  On a mental level the film challenges the viewer with ideas of life, directly through thoughtful dialogue and implicitly through events portrayed.  On a personal level the viewer is drawn into the film through very tangible characters whose inner lives are revealed, expanded, and connected to people around them.  The film \"Red\" was able to effectively and creatively weave together characters, lives, images, and ideas like a carefully designed masterpiece.",

The film is about a young woman who is a model named Valentine Dussaut. One day she accidentally hit's a dog on the road with her car. Looking at the dog's collar she brings the dog back to it's owner who is an older man who doesn't really care about the dog or that she hit it. Valentine runs into this man a couple more times and soon finds out that he listens to other people's phone conversations. At first she wants to turn him in, but the more she finds out about this man the more she visits him and starts to like him. He soon starts to like her back and they begin a special friendship, but eventually one of them knows they have to turn him in and do the right thing.

I have very much enjoyed the Three Colors trilogy and now that I have seen all three films I can say that Red is the best of the three. I really enjoyed the look of this film with it's beautiful cinematography and I thought the two performances were great. I also really liked the friendship between the two characters and how it really is a unique film and the relationship came from something completely original and not like any other film. I really got to like and care about these characters while I was watching this film and I found the film to be very touching and sweet. It is also very compelling, mysterious and fascinating. There were a few things going on in the side of this film that I couldn't always follow and didn't really care for, but the film is so excellent and well made that these two mild things were easily forgettable. Red is a masterpiece and there are certainly not a lot of films like this which makes it all the more original and special. A truly great film.",

            "content": "In its own quiet way, \"Red\" is one of the most involving and emotionally effective movies I've ever seen.  The third movie of Kieslowski's \"Three Colors\" trilogy, it is also the best.  As is the case in the previous two films, the titular color plays a significant visual role, used to draw attention to significant objects and places.  There are a number of fascinating, beautiful shots that move from inside a room to a window to show the street below, or from the outside through windows of multiple rooms.  The two central characters, Valentine and the Judge, are carefully and delicately developed, as is their relationship.  Valentine is sympathetic from the beginning, while the Judge grows more so as we gain insights into his history and motivations.  Both of the actors portraying the leads are wonderful, with the dazzlingly beautiful and highly charismatic Irene Jacob turning in a performance that is at least the equal of her performance in Kieslowski's earlier film, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (which seems, in retrospect, to be almost a prequel to the \"Three Colors\" movies).  The ending, which is perhaps my favorite moment in all of cinema, requires that the viewer has seen the previous two movies in the series to fully appreciate it, but to say anything more about it than that might spoil it for anyone who has not seen the film.Although I would not necessarily contend that \"Red\" is the \"greatest\" movie of all time (whatever that means), it is probably my favorite; I've seen it at least 5 times already, and I get more out of it each time I watch it.Overall Rating:  10 (out of 10), or 4+ stars (out of 4)",

            "content": "There's at least one certainty to gather from the \"Color\" trilogy: it is the work of a man with such a deep interest in human interactions that it almost overshadows his artistic talent, which says a lot.The three stories Krzysztof Kieslowski tells us go beyond the usual narrative techniques: people act, interact or react, provoking and undergoing the chain of events that go, and no matter how unusual some situations feel, and some artistic licences distracting, the \"Blue\", \"White\" and \"Red\" films work. Maybe because there was a sincerity in the making. It's an epitaph work not just by the laws of Providence because Kieslowski died two years after \"Red\", but also because the director (according to his editor Jacques Vitta) felt he had outdone himself. It's narcissism when it encourages people to go on, humility when it tells them to stop.Anyway, what is cinema about if not telling stories? What are stories if not dictated connections of various events in a pattern that either lead to a particular statement about life or is life itself expressed in style. The former better be spectacular or entertaining, the latter deep or artistically viable. If you can't understand it, at least enjoy it. And on that level, every film of the trilogy follows a direction which we never quite get it until the end, but they have such an attitude, such a style and a mature patience that we're as intrigued and fascinated as with a Bergmanian masterpiece. In \"Blue\", Juliette Binoche buried her grief in the ground of a new life only to see the past reemerging as a lantern of hope, in \"White\", a Polish man reconquers his girl by toying with morals and yet never turning into a bad guy.The two films supposedly treated the themes of Liberty and Equality (a reference to the French flag) but these interpretations matter less than the narrative achievements. So in \"Red\", the point isn't Fraternity, or passion or anything to associate with the color -though the chromatic leitmotif is more prevalent in this film than in any other- but it's about the fascinating way lives can connect. It starts with a phone-call that takes us from the caller to the other line, going through all the cables and electric devices, in a time where cell-phones weren't a commodity. The film shows people living through these connections and yet having lives of their own. Valentine, an aspiring model, played by the beautiful Irene Jacob, regularly calls her possessive boyfriend in London. Her neighbor, Auguste, a law student, calls his girlfriend who handles a weather reports \"hotline\", and their conversations are eavesdropped by Joseph Kern, Jean-Louis Trintignant as a retired judge who is like a freelance Gene Hackman from \"The Conversation\".Valentine meets Joseph when her car hits his dog and I wonder if Inarritu was influenced by the film for his \"Amores Perros\", an interesting coincidence since he also walked in Tarantino's footsteps with \"Pulp Fiction\" (both Tarantino and Kieslowki were nominated for Best Director in 1995). So Valentine can't accept the way Joseph disrupts in people's lives and listens to all their secrets, she despises him and is ready to alert his neighbors until she finds out one of them is already spied by his own daughter. What is interesting is the way the two people who look mostly concerned with people they have on the other end of a line, end up finding common denominators and a beautiful relationship unfolds as the fruit of crazy hazards. It's just as if destiny worked in the oddest way in order to make people meant to each other to meet, and the way, one's failure can be the basis of someone else's success as if love would always find a way in the great cosmic scheme of things.Joseph's failures find a strange echo in the storyline involving Auguste, it seems that everything that happens to him, happened to Joseph, as if the judge's destiny was a draft to something more beautiful or as if Kern, lucid about his failures, knew they would eventually influence one destiny positively. Kern isn't just a passive observer, he's a God'like figure without any pretension whatsoever, he listens to people, cares for them, observes them, and in his own intuitive ways, manages to provide some guidance, in the name of that love he seems to be lacking of. And I guess, there's something of Kern in Kieslowski: that capability to listen, to show, to inject a certain truth even in the oddest situations (\"White\"), the most tragic (\"Blue\") and the most random (\"Red\")... and maybe we believe them too because besides the director's sincerity, there's a sincerity in the actresses' performances and I confess I enjoyed \"Red\" as much as \"Blue\" for the beauty and quiet intensity of their female leads (Delpy was more of an overarching presence in \"White\"). Julie needed love in \"Blue\" and so did Valentine, but Karol's story was less driven by love but a revenge and had more masculine and somewhat selfish undertonesTo conclude, this is a trilogy that paints a remarkable picture of love through three different dimensions and where \"Red\" has an edge over its predecessors is in the presence of Irene Jacob and the character of like Kern who might be the screen-incarnation of the genius behind the screen, something exemplified in that unforgettable ending where he sees the faces of many protagonists from the trilogy (why it happens is a twist I won't reveal), freezing for a last moment, as to tell us goodbye. And after the powerful still frame on Valentine's sad face, I love that serene and humble smile of Trintignant, perhaps the reflection of Kieslowski's own satisfaction to have completed his three-part masterpiece, one for the ages.",

Make no mistake: this is another fine entry in the saga and a good film in itself, but it just does not throw a punch like the first two films. It is very slow moving throughout, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however the purpose of the pace is a bit ambiguous, and in addition the events and characters are not all clearly defined. It still has very interesting individual ideas, some good cinematography and lighting, plus there is a lot of attention paid to sound. There is quite a bit to take out of it, but I personally found more to take out of 'Bleu' and 'Blanc'.",

With this one obviously named Red and dealing with the value of brotherhood.A young woman, Valentine (Irene Jacob), works as a model and studies at the university. One day a chain of events leads her to an old house where she meets a retired judge, Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who she learns spends his days spying on his neighbours and their illicit affairs. Horrified, she flees, but ends up returning and learning more about this strange man, to whom she feels fascinatingly connected.All three films in the trilogy are pretty even in quality, but if I had to name my favourite, it would be this one. It contains all the good aspects of the two previous films, from amazing use of colour to great characters to an intriguing plot, but it also seems to have the most to say. The conversations between Valentine and Joseph are genuinely good and I also enjoyed the side plot dealing with the neighbours of the two main characters and how their life draws parallels to Joseph's past. Very neat, inventive storytelling there.Granted, the ending is a bit weird, trying to tie all three of the films together in a rather ham-fisted way. It has to be a joke, at least I hope, but nevertheless it made the ending feel watered down. But, the movie leading up to that was more than good enough to make up for it.The whole trilogy was an enjoyable watch and they're very much to be watched together. They're also short enough to make it viable and filled with enough content to make it worth your while.",

Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him.\"Trois couleurs: Rouge\" is based on the concept of \"UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD\". The phone may be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in \"Dekalog 9\" it gives in the beginning the encore to Kieslowski's onlookers, followed step by step in its fast run across the world. The director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings, without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events, venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years. Inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations. - Some books falling to the pavement. - One of them opening casually on a fatal page, predetermining the destiny of a future profession, as in a past similar occurrence. - Glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly, ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes marked by the most ill-fated coincidence.In this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart's eyes instead of our mind's ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge Jean Luis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob, maybe the sweetest actress of our times, together with the beautiful Winona Ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way. Kieslowski talks about \"dialogue tests\" between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future, between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness.And the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air, with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence, saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written, gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema. Only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill. GOOD-BYE KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!",

This is one of those films that works no matter which angle you approach it from; as multi-layered as an onion, as absorbing as a Mozart quartet, as fluid as quicksilver and as unforgettable as Citizen Kane. Kieslowski was clearly a genius at pegging the Human Condition and it is fitting that this turned out to be his final film because he'd have had a hell of a time topping perfection. For reasons best known to himself it's also the only one of the three to feature a genuine heavyweight male actor in Jean-Louis Trintignant and the males among us surely owe him a vote of thanks for showcasing three of the most beautiful as well as talented French film actresses - respectively Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Irene Jacob - in his three colours trilogy. Much has been written here about the story, technique etc and it would be superfluous to repeat it, suffice it to say this is a masterpiece and leave it at that.",

Eventually, the two form a relationship, and Valentine learns that Kern is a former judge whom has a habit of listening to other people's phone conversations. This film has been interpreted by some as an anti-romance, where \"Blue\" was an anti-tragedy, and \"White\" and anti-comedy.I think the thing that works best about this film is the themes, and the symbolism that is brought to light when looking at the characters in a certain way. This film is about an old Judge that has the ability to listen in on people's conversations, in a way, he's just short of omniscient (think about him as God). This film, in a way, is allegory- a rumination- about the character of God- a being set apart from the rest of the world, but still very attached to it. But, this film in no way is only about that. It's also a film about people not judging people for things they don't understand, have no business understanding. It's a movie about all being on a journey together, knowing that there is hurt and pain out there, and choosing to cling to one another for love, compassion, and support.",

But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England. By some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old Judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. The story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy Rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... But the film is not about this, even. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. She did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.",

Meanwhile, Auguste, who has passed an exam to become a judge, learns that his girlfriend, Karin (Frederique Feder), has been unfaithful.The film then follows the relationship of Joseph and Valentine and the ultimate meeting of Auguste and Valentine in extraordinary circumstances.This is a film about relationships. One of Kieslowski's gifts is showing more significant concepts in tiny shots, like blowing over a glass of water during a storm. His use of color in the trilogy is remarkable throughout.

Jean-Louis Trintignant plays a retired judge, corrupted by an all-consuming cynicism, who meets a beautiful girl, but doesn't fall in love with her. Instead, his reincarnation does, and he mystically orchestrates their predestined meeting. The girl is played by Irene Jacob, who is earnest, warm, uncorrupted and beautiful. She's a French model unloved by her boyfriend (fool that he is) with a demeanor proud, but not vain, vulnerable, but not weak.The judge is so pathetic that he spies on his neighbors' phone conversations to spice up his lonely and pitiful existence. Their love affairs, their spats, their crimes are piped into him as he sits alone in his house. But she has the genius to appreciate him and to understand him, and so frees him from his bitterness.We see in this, the final third of director Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy, something reminiscent of his countryman, Roman Polanski, in his passion for young actresses and his ability to bring out the best in them. We see further in the character of the retired judge a projection of ideas about how an old man, past any pretense, might love a young woman: wisely, delicately, from a slight distance, without a hint of lechery.Irene Jacob makes us believe that innocence and instinctive goodness are wondrous qualities, regrettably not much touted these days. More often depicted are women who would rather sing proudly of being bitches while acting out violent, two-fisted, emulations of a bogus masculinity, e.g., see \"Single White Female,\" etc.Red is for her lips, for the color of curtains and theater seats, for the color of her true love's utility vehicle (often in her sight, but not yet recognized), for doors and panels and for the warm beat of her heart. Her name is Valentine. She is the dream of the worldly man who has known many women, whose head is not easily turned. And red is for the ringing of the phone, heard in its urgency as red.I liked this better than Blue or White, both of which were very good; but the clash of innocence and cynicism here, with youth and age so aptly contrasted, along with a clever plot (Kieslowski loves to surprise us), highlighted by captivating performances from the leads, make this the best of the three.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

In it, we meet Valentine Dussaut, a beautiful fashion model living in Geneva who meets a reclusive, retired judge after accidentally injuring his dog with her car. Despite her initial repulsion (the judge is a high-tech Peeping Tom of sorts, fond of listening in on his neighbors' phone conversations), the two become close friends (the color red on the French flag is symbolic of \"fraternity\"), and their relationship, and what they each get out of it, is at the heart of the picture. Meticulously acted by the two leads, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant, and featuring remarkable direction and photography (dig those stunning, soaring crane shots between apartments!), \"Red\" holds the viewer fascinated throughout. The film sports the most blatant use of any of the trilogy's titular color schemes, and is completely unpredictable from start to finish. Especially interesting is how the judge's early life parallels exactly that of Valentine's neighbor, Auguste; how their three lives seem to interweave unbeknownst to any of them, like something out of a \"Lost\" episode. Trintignant's judge character is reminiscent of Juliette Binoche's character in \"Blue\"; two people who have tried to divorce themselves from life after some cruel setbacks and find that life still has a fascination for them. \"Red\" also ties itself to the rest of the trilogy in the person of that little old lady by the recycling bin, who strangely appears in all three films, and, most notably, in those stunning, final five minutes. Without giving anything away, let me just say that \"Red\"'s finale will have fans of the previous two films broadly grinning from ear to ear. The finale shows that the three films really do comprise a trilogy that should be seen in the proper order, that of the French flag's colors: blue, white and finally red.",

That at some point it all has a meaning, if not to me, then certainly to someone.Trois couleurs and especially \"Rouge\" comes closer to making me touch, feel, experience the \"truth\", the \"meaning\" than perhaps any other of his films. The only problem being the paths of the \"puzzles\" explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still plenty of joy to be had here.

            "content": "Red was the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Three Colors trilogy and at the same the last film by the director. After Red was released Kieslowski announced to retire and quit making films; by which he wanted to get himself some peace. Two years later on March 13th 1996 Kieslowski passed away, during an operation. Many have said that the stress caused by actually making three films at once may have been the reason for his heart failure. All the three films, Blue, White and Red, dealt with the paradox of freedom and love (which was a leading theme throughout Kieslowski's career). How they could never fit into the same relation; one couldn't be free when in love. But the films went much more deeper. All the films had their own main theme from the ideals of the French Revolutionary (Blue / Freedom, White / Equality and Red / Fraternity) often portraying it in a complex ambiguous way. Red was about fraternity, about a bond between all of us, it was a psychological drama against disregard.A young model Valentine (Irene Jacob) hits a dog with her car and because the dog's collar has a name on it she goes to return the dog to its owner. The owner of the dog is a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who spends his time listening to other people's phone calls. First Valentine doesn't care about what he is doing but over time a psychological tension build between them.An important motive in Red is a phone. In the beginning we get to follow the wires from one phone to another for which no one answers. Valentine takes care of her love affairs and family relations by phone, the judge listens to other people's phones and Auguste dates a girl who offers daily weather reports by phone. The phone means both connection and separation. By repeating several times the motive tells us about a world where people desperately want connection to each other.Red can be watched from many different perspectives and there are several interpretations for it. In the end it summarizes the most important themes and characters of the trilogy. It's about the collision of youth and old age, optimism and pessimism, positivity and cynicism. But at the same about so much more; coincidence, morality, guiltiness, loneliness, separation and connection. In Red we can see what would happen if a person had noted the presence of another human being and tried to get in contact with the other person. The consequences are vast if you do injustice on other but so if people pass each other without ever meeting. This is what the screenwriter Piesiewicz told that they tried to reach and it reinforces the idea that Red is also a film against disregard and apathy.Red is the top of Kieslowski's production - it's his cinematic legacy. In Red he worked with the writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the composer Zbigniew Preisner with whom he had worked since No End (1984). In Red Valentine comes across with a composer called Van der Budenmajer who, of course, doesn't exist - because he is Zbigniew Preisner. In Kieslowski's interview book, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, he tells that he and Preisner made up Budenmajer and used him in The Decalogue, The Double Life of Veronique and The Three Colors. He even has a date of birth and death.Red builds around the emotional theme that plays throughout the trilogy. All the films are about the yearning of love; in Red Valentine longs for her lover but then meets the vision of distorted emotions in the judge. The love of Valentine makes the judge hatch from his hard shelf. Love doesn't recognize freedom, equality or fraternity, but without it there's nothing - love is above everything. On this emotional level the viewer can see the portrayal of Kieslowski's individualism. The international films by Kieslowski were characterized by aesthetic styling - and Red is amazingly beautiful to every single detail. Unlike in Blue and White; in Red Kieslowski didn't use red shades and screens. Instead he put the color into the story; the cars, the phones, the clothes etc. \"The color red isn't just a piece of decorative, it has a dramaturgical role.\" Kieslowski. And the color indeed means something - for instance when Valentine sleeps with her boyfriend's red jacket; red means memories and the need for another person.In the early films by Kieslowski he dealt with the society of Poland and the harsh Polish reality. He liked to call his films unpolitical which they were; they usually dealt with so much deeper issues - humanity and morality. In The Decalogue (The Ten Commandments) Kieslowski achieved to bring the eternal moral dilemmas to the modern society but at the same managed to describe Poland of that time; better than anyone else could have. Later, he moved to even more personal and unique subjects; The Three Colors trilogy dealt with equality, freedom and fraternity but not in a conventional, universal, simple way. The way he dealt with these ideals of the French Revolutionary went very deep which offered some very personal views. In the trilogy Equality and Freedom were illusions, whose true natures could only be exposed by love. Red is the color of love. It is a connection between people in spite of age, gender or other shallow limitations. Fraternity was the purest manifestation of love for Kieslowski.",

While the three can be viewed independently of one another, the greatest impact will come from watching them in the correct order, and thinking of them as one whole. They are quite different from one another, and stand out in different ways. This further proves that the scope was indeed growing through these; from personal (liberty), through (equality of) relationships, and now to social (fraternity). The subject is dealt with masterfully, and with none of the deplorable ignorance and black and white approach of a mainstream Hollywood flick; this takes it seriously, and provides plenty of excellent food for thought. Editing, cinematography and lighting, all amazing. The acting is impeccable. Every character is credible, well-written and nicely developed. The plot is interesting, engaging and satisfying. There is a bit of disturbing content, a little violence and brief but strong sexuality in this. The DVD comes with 1 hour and 31 minutes worth of informative featurettes and interviews, as well as trailers for the Colors Trilogy.

Certainly Red is the first, but as for the other two? On the philosophical side, certainly there is the old man's nihilism for much of the film, but what does Kieslowski counter this with? The final scene? I fail to see how that does anything aside from connect several disparate people together in a rather trite _Magnolia_-esque manner, to which I say (as I did in that movie), \"So what?\" And as for being involving or affecting, this film totally strikes out for me. Both of the two main characters are vastly underdeveloped and largely unsympathetic. The newly-robed judge was somewhat more interesting initially, but due to his role as a sort of meta-character, he came up shallow in the end as well (where is the payoff?). I found myself repeatedly shouting, \"Who cares!\" at the screen whenever anything of importance happened to these characters. Indeed, the only figure in the movie I found myself to be remotely sympathetic to was the dog.Blue and White are wonderful pieces of film.

The pouting, silent and pliable French lead is so seriously dull how can u watch her? The old man is supposed to be wise in the ways of the world and people, yet with that jaded disdain that gives him a sense of superiority. He really KNOWS people. The stuff this guy spits out is so outrageously phony and dull it's hard to keep a straight face. I suppose he is the sly fox who educates the innocent babe, never mind how false and boring it is. This is 'serious' filmmaking, remember.This movie is like a boring sculpture sitting in a vacuum-it's hard to breathe in here. Each scene seems as if carved from lead. It violates what i think is one of the rules of effective dramaturgy: Not every single scene should be dramatic. These movies are supposed to move us and make us feel something, but they only put us in a trance with their emotional sameness.\nWitness Woody Allen's Interiors, another narcoleptic masterpiece of dreadful seriousness. There are scenes in both these movies which go so far in trying to be heavy and dramatic they are comic. Further, they betray the labored effects of an unimaginative writer.

But it is the same in life. We are connected with some people and never meet others, but it could without difficulty have occurred differently.To thoroughly comprehend how chance and capricious life is, how boundless the probability is against any one situation taking place, would be mortifying. In Kieslowski's animal-loving, brotherhood-centered anti-romance, the final film of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, which examines the French Revolutionary ideals, none of the major characters knows each other at the beginning of the movie, and there is no rationale that their paths should cross. Not precisely.The narrative doesn't take too long to be absolutely subduing, supported by deeply convincing performances by the sensitive and complex Irene Jacob, one of the preeminent French actresses of her generation, and the intense Jean-Louis Trintignant, one of the most gifted French actors of the post-war era. We have no clue where it is going, where it could likely go. There is no plot to relieve us, no intention that the characters wish to fulfill. Will Jacob and Trintignant ever meet again? What will emerge from that? Does it make a difference? Would it be good, or bad? Such proposals, in Red, become enduringly more fascinating than those in underdeveloped vendible mainstream movies, about whether the hero will kill all of the bad guys or only some of them, or the high school kids will lose their virginity by prom night, or the bomb will be diffused.Seeing a movie like this internationally European production, which philosophizes on the relationship between the law, ethics and socially acceptable behaviour and how not all of them coincide, and rhythmically symbolizes the minutiae of spirit, freedom, love, hate and the extension of life and forgiveness beyond humans into the realm of vulnerable animals, we recall that watching many commercial films is the cinematic parallel of watching a mime or a juggler. The conundrums of day-to-day existence are so much more penetrating and inspiring than the maneuvers of formula. The probability in opposition to either of us ever having been are higher by far than one to all of the molecules in existence.",

After a while the different shades of red take on a warm and life-giving comfort, almost like being held securely in the womb. This is kind of at odds with the drama, but shows interestingly the tendency the characters have to keep themselves mostly indoors rather than walk around the world at large. This has its own meaning when placed in context to the ending, and also the strange love that occurs between two characters that almost never meet on screen and the strange love of two characters that spend a lot of time together.I find this movie also very interesting in how it deals with law. Even though it seems arbitrary to connect it with the Dekalog episode that went on to become A Short Film about Killing, there's something similar in the two works' view of justice, mostly a sense that the pure and naive can be blind to the future they may decide.The ending of this film is, I consider, it's only weak point. The pointed connection with the other films and the expected meeting of the two future lovers feels not only contrived, but also obvious. However, it's at least satisfying enough to bring closure to the trilogy and to Kieslowski's career, though once again it feels unfortunate he couldn't have graced us with a few more works before being gone for good.--PolarisDiB",

It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion into human morality, Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that none can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was better still, but still not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. In Red, one may find meaning on one of its several levels. On the first level, Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. It is as if Kieslowski is saying: \"Ceci n'est pas la r\u00e9alit\u00e9\". In effect, in pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de V\u00e9ronique, but not until this, his final film, did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and circumstance. The actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant's Judge Kern, a cantankerous man, who, by the end, becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. It won't happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define, but all possess. A synopsis of this film read: \"A film about a woman who runs over a dog\". Well, it is.Isn't it?-Simon Huxtable",

            "content": "According to some moviegoers, Blue is the best of the trilogy, for some of them, Red is the best one, it fulfills the \"picture\" White? Unfortunately, the people who think White is the best are not many. Despite, in my opinion, Blue is excellent, another masterpiece, White is my favorite film in the trilogy. Roughly, Blue was about death, White was about marriage and Red is about senescence or is it? The film is not mesmerizing, instead heavy in contrast with the previous films, and the story is not powerful, instead it was not sound and not dramatic. The film mostly consists of the conversations between the woman and the old man, but it does not say anything about its theme. Is the film about senescence? Then, the film does not say anything about senescence or is the film about friendship, but the movie does not say anything about friendship. May be just aging or isolation gets people do odd things, nothing more. However, as seen, some people derive a lot of meanings from every single scene. In addition, there is an unbalance in the places (and the characters) As a result, it seems that Red was not made by Kieslowski, instead of him, a young director who admires him did it or completed it. Therefore, Red is like a film made a bit unwillingly, in order to complete the trilogy, in order to make a film which meets the color, red. For example, the scene which the camera follows the telephone cable (by the way it recalled me Bound) was unnecessary for such a film (I don't want to say amateurish), but if Kieslowski liked it and wanted to do it, no problem. Red is pure art may be, but it does not look mesmerizing or impressive in this film, there is something wrong in Red. Lastly, if you were disappointed or did not like an art house film which was made by a master director, some people don't accept the fact. Red might be an example of it.",

            "content": "The final film of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy, Red (Rouge), released in 1994, is almost universally acclaimed as the best of the films. For once, the common consensus is correct. Of course, if one is to believe some of the online reviews of this film, and the whole trilogy, there are plenty of people who seriously question whether or not Three Colors is a better trilogy than the two Star Wars trilogies, that of The Matrix, or even The Lord Of The Rings. Let me end that debate, once and for all. It is far better than those comic book level films, and real comparisons need to be made with some of the truly great cinematic trilogies, such as Ingmar Bergman's Spider trilogy, or Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Alienation trilogy (L'Avventura, La Notte, and L'Eclisse).As with the prior two films, Red was written by Kieslowski and his writing partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz. It is a brilliant film, with the depth of Blue, pathos of White, and character definitions better than either prior entry. The film follows the parallel lives of a small group of people in a town just outside of Geneva, Switzerland. The main character is a beautiful brunet model named Valentine Dussault (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), whose boyfriend Michel is never seen, but ever calling her. The film opens with him calling her, and getting a busy signal, shot in away that recalls the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. He is clearly an unstable and jealous man, who harangues Valentine, whose insecurities keep her attached to him, despite knowing, somewhere inside of her, that they are wrong for each other. Jacob is in one of those roles that defines an actor- a career making choice; even more so than her dual role in The Double Life Of Veronique. Her character seems to embody decency and goodness, and radiates love and compassion throughout the film, both visually and personally. It is the sort of role that recalls that given by Setsuko Hara in Tokyo Story, or, more recently, Claire Danes in Shopgirl (although she reminds me of British actress Finola Hughes in looks). Hers is the sort of dream woman that a man never meets; not because she's a model, but because she is almost preternaturally good and filled with a love of life and others- even down to her name. She believes that people are not bad, merely weak\u0085. It is the sort of art that if you ask, 'What is it about?', it cannot be answered in a sentence or two. Dozens of small details suffuse it. Valentine lives near a caf\u00e9 called Chez Joseph, then meets Joseph Kern; Auguste abandons then retrieves the dog given to him by Karin while Kern's dog is abandoned then embraced by him once Valentine saves it; Auguste has a photo of a dancer in his apartment, and Valentine dances; the veterinarian she takes Rita to is named Marc, like her brother, etc. This is a tale that is not so dumbed down, ala Hollywood films, that even a detailed syllabus could justice it. It is linear in spots, yet intuitive throughout. One could easily see it going off tangentially to follow any of a dozen minor characters, and the thrust of the film would have remained intact, even though it would have been a wholly different film. Still, it would have been a great film, for there is an undeniable immanence to greatness, and this fact is something that few critics can grasp. The greatness of Red, and to an extent, the whole Three Colors trilogy, is that such intellectual grasping is not necessary to feel greatness. Thus, art at its best.",

Shortly thereafter, the dog runs away and returns to the judge with Valentine in pursuit. A second time at his house, she begins to learn his secrets, and slowly enters his life.

It's that good, and if you really love movies you will love this film!The story revolves around a young model, Valentine, played exquisitely by the beautiful Irene Jacob.  After accidentally hitting a dog with her car, she is brought face-to-face with the cynical Judge Kern, perfectly played by Jean-Louis Trintignant.As the movie unfolds and the relationship between Kern and Valentine becomes more complex, we realize that the film is a unique look at how people trust each other and betray each other under the cloak of friendship or love. Valentine cannot accept Kern's view that people are selfish, and Kern is secretly in awe of Valentine's innocence.  How Kieslowski does this without making an over-the-top, pretentious \"foreign\" film is truly a joy to watch. You will have to see for yourself.The movie is also part of a trilogy, and characters from _Blue_ and _White_ make appearances in another, layered aspect of this film.  It is also in my opinion the best of the three, and can stand on its own with its sheer powers of imagery, symbolism, and fascinating characters.",

Subtle details make for careful viewing but it is a rewarding watch and a visual treat , thanks to brilliant cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski . Dealing with young model's (Irene Jacob) life is changed forever after a chance encounter with a strange neighbour . So Valentine accidentally runs over a dog , she tracks down the owner , a reclusive retired judge, called Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant). He seems unconcerned by the accident or the wounds sustained by Rita , his dog . He results to be a retired judge whose outlandish hobby is to listen in on his neighbours' phone calls . There're also some emotional connections among other unlikely couples that go wrong . Joseph lives lonely but she discovers the dark secrets of the peculiar judge . The flick turns out to be an interesting story of relationships between some human beings, Valentine and the judge, but also other people who may not be aware of the relationship they have with Valentine or/and the old judge.Third of a thoughtful trilogy of films dealing with contemporary French society , it concerns how a beautiful model meets an elderly judge and she gets in trouble with him and director Kieslowski uses the ending to tie up loose ends . This is an agreeable film , a symphony of pain as well as knowledge and filmed in enjoyable style , good sense and high sensitivity . The picture has various subtle references about the important and highly-valued trilogy . Being necessary to keep an eye on cinematographic use of the deep color Red, including a colorful and evocative photography by Piotr Sobocinski , it is essential to be understood the story. The last and most acclaimed of Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, the film was nominated for three 1994 Academy Awards : Best Director, Best Original Screenplay : Krzysztof Kieslowski , Krzysztof Piesiewicz , Agnieszka Holland , Music : Zbigniew Preisner and Best Cinematography : Piotr Sobocinski . \u00a8Trois Couleurs : Rouge\u00a8 boasts a good cast , such as Irene Jacob , Jean Louis Trintignant , and nice support cast as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Feder , Jean-Pierre Lorit , Samuel Le Bihan and cameos by protagonists in the earlier films , Juliette Binoche , Benoit Regent , Julie Delpy and Zamachowski . Magnificent acting by Jean-Luis Trintignant who makes a real tour-of-force , he relies on the internalized affection rather than overwhelming displays for expression . And awesome Irene Jacob, this is second collaboration between Krzysztof Kieslowski and Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, they had formerly worked together on The double life of Veronique (1991) . As well as the musical score , as Zbigniew Preisner composes a rousing and impressive soundtrack . There appears some characters from the first two films of the trilogy ; Julie and Olivier from 'Blue'; Karol and Dominique from 'White'; and Valentine and Auguste, who finally meet for the first time, as well as an English bartender named Stephen Killian. As with the other movies, the film's final sequence shows a character crying. The 1995 Annual Cesar Awards , presented by the French Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences, it is France's main national film awards, considered by many in France, and internationally, to be the French equivalent of the American Academy Awards gave to this film several deserved Cesar prizes . Rating : 7/10, Good , above average film , worthwhile watching .The picture belongs to trilogy referencing to the structure of the Three Colours trilogy - blue, white, red-, in that order, mirroring the French flag : 1\u00ba \u00a8Blue\u00a8 starred by Juliette Binoche , concerning a tragedy by a car accident and the subsequent consequences on an affecting woman , as the grieved widow retakes her life after surviving a car crash which killed her family , here \u00a8Blue\u00a8 stands for \u00a8Liberty\u00a8. It is followed by \u00a8Trois Couleurs : Blanc\u00a8 regarding a bittersweet comedic story spiced with lasting love and vengeance , in which a bewildered Polish hairdresser is divorced by his disdainful French spouse and returning to his family in Poland when he decides to fake his death ; being starred by July Delpy and Zamachowski , including cameos by Juliette Binoche and Florence Pernal . And, finally, this Trois couleurs: Rouge (1994) that many critics considering to be the best entry in the compelling trilogy. Essential and indispensable seeing.",

            "content": "\"Red\" is the best of the three of Kieslowski's \"colour films\".It is much more complex than the other two although there are links among all the three films.This film is an artistic piece of work-very few films nowadays can claim such a description.There is much psychology,philosophy and symbolism throughout the film and there is a great sensitivity in presenting the plot.The cinematography(the way the camera has presented the images to us) is simply brilliant.I should mention the long pauses in and between the dialogues-they are, I believe, deliberate.There are several lines in the plot which constantly intertwine and \"mirror\" each other.However the main idea around which everything revolves is compassion among people-the \"fraternity \" which ends the whole sequence-\"Blue \"(liberty),\"White\"(equality) and \"Red\"(fraternity).By the way, I give the following marks:Blue-5,White-4,Red-9. The backbone of the plot is the relationship between young and kind Valentine and her old and cynical neighbour -the judge to whose mysterious personality she is gradually attracted.Irene Jacob's beauty -delicate and somewhat fragile- fits her character ideally.Their relationship is totally devoid of any sexuality.In our time,crazy about sex, I find this very refreshing-to watch a film which concentrates on the soul rather than on the body.Gradually they start to \"read\" each other's thoughts and deepest emotions and to influence each other's behaviour.Parallel to this goes the story of Auguste who will probably repeat the judge's unhappy biography.Nearly every small detail is heavily loaded with meaning but often the meaning is revealed not immediately but later in the film.Yet the whole story is absolutely realistic.I have always believed that this is what art should be-realistic but at the same time symbolic and this film manages to achieve this uneasy balance.If the spectator does not watch this film carefully many important aspects of the story will be missed.I myself have watched it twice and I must say that the second time it was even more interesting for me.The end of the film is especially beautiful as it does not have a typical happy-end-rather this end is hinted rather than explicitly shown-this is what I mean when I talk of sensitivity and sophistication.Yet we do think and believe that Valentine and Auguste will achieve the love that has evaded the judge.That is why I perceive the film as rather optimistic: hope and fraternity seem to prevail in the end.This is a brilliant farewell from a great artist.",

Not that a great deal happens in a hurry. Sometimes cinematography takes over, as it often does, and coincidence is used (again!) as the central plank of the movie.The director is master of timing and angles. That is his big secret, he never stays on anything a beat too long and his angles, while unconventional, give a feeling of reality.  He gives us strange breaks such as watching workmen struggling with an awning or a sunset over a valley.\nHowever there is excess: The telephone line montage at the start is a bit too clever-clever given that we all know that a telephones are just connecting pieces of electronics. We don't need to be told. Indeed you could read that this piece of gadgetry allows people to distance themselves from one another without breaking the chain completely.  Here people live \"telephone lives\" and only by tapping in you get the truth.The judge and the young model need a dog to communicate and without giving too much of the plot away, it becomes their telephone line to one another. Their excuse to interact. Quite how feasible the story is I don't know given that telephone tapping is not my strong point, but I presume it is at least possible to listen in on the neighbours conversations. Not that it really matters.A very good and careful film, but not quite a classic because it doesn't set its sights much above conveying emotion. In reality young models don't care less about their own parents no matter elderly people that they barely know - but let us just let that pass for a moment. Let us pretend we live in a better world of care-and-share and that people really have time to hear about our inner thoughts and feelings.",

Irene Jacob (as the model), and Jean-Louis Trintignant (as the retired judge) both turn in superb acting performances, which are necessary to keep their unusual relationship believable.Beneath the surface (of the movie, not the plot), there is more dense layering than I've ever come across in any other movie. Every sentence in every conversation shimmers with alternative meaning:  meaning for the speaker, meaning for the listener, meaning in the context of the film's plot, meaning in the context of the film's intent and, not least of all, meaning for the viewer. All these meanings are also mirrored in all the things that go UN-said.Most of the important themes of human existence are touched upon: love, trust, loss, meaning (there's that word again!), fate, friendship and brotherhood (as in the interconnectedness and interdependence of ALL human beings). This is all done without any reference to religion, politics or even children, keeping the focus purely on human nature.Kieslowsky manages to achieve the rare feat of producing a movie which is light and simple on the surface, yet is thoroughly compelling, thought-provoking and so rich in content that I could happily re-watch it time and time again...",

It takes a director of strong moral character to craft films like Kieslowski did, with Blue, Red, and especially his Decalogue series. In Red he has two people who shouldn't have anything to do with one another - a young model/student and a retired judge - but puts them together and has them finding a connection to one another in an extraordinary but human way (all about a dog - and eavesdropping).There is also a metaphor in the film about there being a sub-plot that may really be all about the judge as a young man (at first I wasn't sure what it had to do with the main plot at all aside from the guy being the neighbor of the young model, but wanted to stay with it). It ends up also functioning as a critique of knowing too much or too little about the ones one loves.The acting is so strong and touching in what is communicated in such short (or long) stretches of time, and yet so subtle. Kieslowski cast his actress Irene Jacob I suspect for her eyes as they are kind, generous but also hungry-for-knowledge and emotion type eyes, and they invite the audience to notice everything she does but that she does so well. And Trintingnant (sic) is amazing here as well, having to convincingly be a curmudgeon but then switch to being somewhat sympathetic in the second half of the film. And it succeeds because of how Kieslowski fleshes out the character and that the girl brings out the best in him.Bottom line, it's not by much but more satisfying than Blue (which I liked but had some stylistic issues with), and quite the opening that is amazing in its scope and originality, but doesn't have much to do with the plot of the film. And the ending... I'm not sure why Kieslowski felt the need to connect all three films with one incident, but why not? Act of God and all.",

Liberty (Blue), Equality (White) and this one, Fraternity (Red). They explore the gamut of the human experience of love. Although you are watching film making at its finest,  masterpieces.. and these are 'art' films, they need not be dense and inaccessible intellectual ordeals. They can be best understood in the emotional realm within the complex, interweaving relationships that thread each individual together and the trilogy together as a whole.  Loss & homage, betrayal & revenge, seeking & salvation are the epic dramas  of love, universally understood.  Red should be saved for last because it is the one with the happy ending.. the sweetest and the saving grace, yet clearly the most personal to Kieslowski's message and the most moving.",

            "content": "I love this film. I don't know how many times I've seen it, and I still love it.When you've seen enough Kieslowski, you know that the seemingly random meetings and connections between people reveal a filmmaker obsessed with his art, craft, and in particular, with his precision. It's been said that his montage, or editing techniques, could reveal plot elements more quickly than almost anybody else. In Red, we see a woman's boyfriend purchase a pack of cigarettes, Marlboros. We see Valentin in the bowling alley. And after watching her bowl, the camera tracks left to reveal a broken beer glass and crumpled pack of cigarettes. Instantaneously we know that he has broken up with his girlfriend. (It's a bit more obvious than it might seem here, of course!)In his use of the camera as a way of revealing the story to the audience, then, Kieslowski is not unlike Hitchcock, who also revealed information to his audiences behind his characters' backs (we see Jimmy Stewart's neighbor leave the apartment in Rear Window, while Jimmy is momentarily looking the other way). What Hitchcock did, in this way, was create thrillers in which the audience has to decode the crime's logic. As Hitchcock used to say, he never made Whodunnit films. We know who dun it sometimes at the very beginning. His films involve a logical third, and where the filmic third (camera, actor being the usual relationship) is the audience, the logical third is the person for whom the crime was committed. His films are built around this question, not the question of who did the crime. For whom was the crime committed. Kieslowski is a reverse Hitchcock. Rather than find out what will happen, we find out what has happened. Kieslowski plants repeating places, camera angles, objects, intersections in his films so that as a film progresses, we realize that indeed we have seen this before, and they were already connected... The connection was latent, as if destined, and \"suspense\" is the time we wait for this revelation to unfold, rather than for an action to resolve the initial crime\u0097the convention of suspense films. Might we say \"subspense?\" Logically, Kieslowski also works in triads, or thirds. But this time, the benefactor (for whom was it done) is unintended. The logic is meant to be one of serendipity, chance, magic, luck... For every chance encounter between two people, there is a third person who will benefit. A force of goodwill, or love, operates in Kieslowski's universe. A samaritan's helping hand (the old women so often seen recycling bottles; the Jesus is your witness who appears in each of the decalogues... there is a witness, your acts will be seen, we are not alone, your actions are not all in your power). We could say that Kieslowski makes \"gift films,\" not crime films; and that his domain is \"subspents\" because the currency of love spent by his actors subsists and benefits a third... The gift is an additive logic, and when two exchange, a third is created.",

            "review_title": "The Best of the Trilogy by a Considerable Margin",
            "content": "Three Colours: Red\" is the third and final part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, the other parts being Blue and White. These are, of course, the colours of the French flag, and according to Kieslowski these three colours symbolise respectively liberty, equality, and fraternity, although this is not an interpretation that has ever officially been adopted by the French government. Red in this scheme is the colour of fraternity. This was also the last film ever made by Kieslowski; he was to die in 1996 but had announced before his death that he would be making no more films after \"Red\".Fraternity is the runt of the litter, the odd one out among the three revolutionary triplets. I doubt if anyone has ever exclaimed \"Give me fraternity or give me death!\" or \"O fraternity, what crimes are committed in thy name!\" Politicians rarely orate about their wish to build a more fraternal society. Liberty and equality have entered the political vocabulary in a way which fraternity has not, and this is possibly the reason why Kieslowski here feels free to interpret the concept of fraternity more literally than he did those of liberty (which in \"Blue\" refers to \"emotional\" rather than political liberty) and equality (which in \"White\" means approximately \"getting equal with your enemies by taking revenge\").The main character is Valentine Dussaut, a university student from Geneva and part-time model and dancer. While driving she accidentally hits a dog and tracks down its owner, an eccentric, grumpy old man named Joseph Kern, who seems unconcerned about what has happened to his pet. Despite the cool reception she initially receives, Valentine gradually becomes friendly with the old man, who turns out to be a retired judge. This is Kieslowski's conception of \"fraternity\" in the sense of the bonds which can develop between people who might seem to have little in common.For a man who spent his working life enforcing the law, Kern has little respect for the law himself. Some retired men might take up a pastime like stamp collecting, gardening or playing bowls, but Kern's retirement hobby is bugging his neighbours' telephones so that he can eavesdrop on their conversations. When Valentine discovers his guilty secret she is horrified, and threatens to inform his neighbours of what is going on, but decides not to do so because she does not wish to distress them; she is particularly concerned about a woman whose husband is involved in a sexual affair with another man. Despite her distaste for Kern's activities, Valentine does not break off her friendship with him. There is also a sub-plot involving Augustin, a young law student, and his girlfriend Karin, who is cheating on him.Kieslowski's use of colour symbolism seems to increase as the trilogy progresses. In \"Blue\" a few scenes are shot under blue light and there is one prominent blue object, but otherwise the colour (and, indeed, bright colours in general) is little used in that film. In \"White\" there are rather more white objects, and some scenes take place among the snows and frost of winter. In \"Red\", however, there seems to be at least one prominent bright red object in every scene. Another way in which Kieslowski ties the three films together is by using recurring characters. Karol and Dominique, the main characters of \"White\", appear briefly towards the end of \"Blue\" and are referred to at the end of \"Red\", as are Julie and Olivier from \"Blue\".Irene Jacob, who also appeared in Kieslowski's earlier film \"The Double Life of Veronique\", is the best female actress in the trilogy. Juliette Binoche in \"Blue\" is too emotionally restrained for a woman who has recently endured the death of her husband and daughter in a car crash. Julie Delpy in \"White\" has the thankless task of playing a woman who is written not so much as a rounded human being than as a sacred monster, an Aunt Sally set up for her ex-husband to knock down. Jacob, however, gives a well-judged performance as a caring, compassionate young woman who because of her chance encounter with Kern finds herself suddenly confronted with a situation which is beyond her experience and almost beyond her power to deal with. (It is perhaps significant that she is named after the patron saint of lovers). Another great performance comes from Jean-Louis Trintignant as the enigmatic Kern, a man who has spent his life sitting in judgement on others and who would seem to as a result to have developed a pronounced God-complex. He is not, however, altogether unsympathetic; he is capable of recognising his errors and admitting to them, including one case where his error turned out to have an unexpectedly happy outcome.As I said when I reviewed \"Blue\", Kieslowski has never been my favourite director, and I have never regarded the Three Colours Trilogy with the reverence accorded to it by some of his admirers. \"Red\" is, however, in my opinion the best of the three films by a considerable margin. Although the sequence of events is not always easy to follow, a criticism I would also make of \"White\", there are two excellent acting performances. The film also seems to have a greater philosophical depth than either of its predecessors. It might ostensibly be about fraternity, but it also deals with some complex issues surrounding such matters as law and morality (not always the same thing), age and youth, loneliness and companionship, love and hatred, forgiveness and revenge and even that unfashionable subject, right and wrong. Not a bad end to its director's career. 7/10",

            "content": "Representing one of the three ideals of the French Revolution, Red is the third & final instalment of Three Colours trilogy, and meditates on the fraternity aspect of the principle. Certainly the most complex & intricately layered of the three, it poses several interesting questions from start to finish, and is one of those films that benefit from multiple viewings.Co-written & directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the plot follows a set of characters whose paths cross each other in curious ways, and it also has the most impressive ending of the trio stories. Decorated & brushed with shades of red, the imagery & interactions evince extra care & consideration this time. More contemplative than previous entries, the film examines our longing for human connection.The bonding between a young model & a retired judge is what provides this film its sturdy backbone. And both Ir\u00e8ne Jacob & Jean-Louis Trintignant are excellent in their given roles, and render their respective character's understanding of one another in a heartfelt manner. There is more to the story than meets the eye but one viewing isn't enough to decipher everything even if the events are intriguing.Overall, Three Colours: Red is a multilayered story of human relationships, and is hands down the most ambitious chapter of the trilogy. Kieslowski here strives for more than what he delivered with Blue & White, and adds thematic complexity to an otherwise straightforward plot. A satisfying finale to the Three Colours trilogy that also marks the last outing for its Polish filmmaker, Red wraps up the saga on a fine & fitting note.",

By literal accident, she meets a retired judge who spies his neighbours' phone calls, not for money but to feed his cynicism.The film is primarily the story of the relationship between Valentine and the judge, and their relationship is evolved and portrayed in a very convincing manner, thematically centrering around love, loss, forgiveness and redemption.Visually, once again it is a masterpiece, just as impressive a film as \"Blue\", and again drawing on symbolism in its visual storytelling.\nAlso, Kieslowski's intelligent directional style, combined with an interesting plot, made me really like the end of the trilogy.The ending is particularly intelligent and interesting in its execution.

Why? Out of sheer cynicism. He is a man alone, bitter and unhappy. What follows is a journey in which both characters will go through very similar situations.The film continues to have notable points in terms of cinematography, sets and costumes.

Despite being elegant, the music is intense, almost a prop for the scene, and contributes to the overall harmony of the work. As in the previous films, the duo of central actors is responsible for an interpretive tour de force, which is absorbing and impressive: Irene Jacob is an excellent actress, but it turns out to be Jean-Louis Trintignant who stands out the most.The script is quite interesting, for the way it explores the cynicism of the judge's character, and for the way it addresses interpersonal relationships, the honesty and sincerity of love and relationships, the application of the law and the moral and philosophical consequences of judgments. Humans. There are some details that are a little unbelievable, like how the judge's character evolves from someone resentful and intractable to a more human person in a short period of time.

            "content": "I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', Poland could play the role it did in WWII, being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. Flashbacks are magically-realistically intertwined with the present, although totally coincidental, such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge's red jeep passing by the now young woman's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it. That we leaped through time in those same camera moves, is what we grasp later. His love was unanswered, so that his life wasn't as he had planned it. He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels he is actually spying on other peoples' lives and when he retires, he simply continues to do so, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally getting into his life, reinstalls his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police, accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through his windows. In the process, history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman not the same. Kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said he was infatuated by Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in his psychology, of the one (!) who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him, even as an old man! It is as if the 'powers in the air' are, or God is, bringing them together. Coincidences are *too* coincidental to just be chance or even good luck. There has to be some mystical, supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life-decisions. The study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on TV, after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip. These moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer).",

Near the end of the film Valentine and the retired judge come to the conclusion that believing that you know the truth about someone is nothing but vanity. It really makes you think..",

            "content": "Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.",

More deeply this event brings together two people who never would cross paths otherwise and asks the viewer to wonder what if they had met at more similar points in their life as they soon become intrigued by each other. This is one of those films that is probably enhanced by a 2nd viewing as there are many purposefully and subtly placed story clues. Even some connections to the previous two films in concept and characters. Upon reading reviews, I was like, oh yah...now I see it and that makes sense now while adding a dash of cleverness. Alas the film doesn't intrigue enough to give it another viewing...unless in a film class where this trilogy I'm sure will be dissected.",

This trilogy comprised both the colors of the French flag as the ideals of the French revolution.The third and final film is about the color red and the ideal of fraternity. Fraternity is the most vague of the three ideals covered in the trilogy, and that is noticeable. Concepts such as \"chance\" and \"(mis)communication\" are just as prominent as the ideal of fraternity in \"Red\". In the film real communication is mostly oral, the miscommunication mostly by phone.At the end of the trilogy we can conclude that we not only have three colors and three ideals, but also three genres. \"Blue\" is a drama, \"Blanc\" is a comedy and \"Red\" is a romance.The general opinion is that the lightweight \"Blanc\" is nothing more than an \"entre act\" between the philosophical masterpieces \"Blue\" and \"Red\". In my opinion the somewhat drifting \"Red\" is the weakest link.",

In this movie, Kieslowski has been playing God and has done it just as magnificently as discretely. I have never noticed a film that can transfer so many strong philosophical messages in only an hour and a half. Every frame and every scene is built with such care that you get the feeling of a great purpose and it does not disappoint. On top of everything, Red is visually stunning and subtly paced, so it does not feel like a difficult story of human life, but rather an interesting ordinary one. I would recommend this piece of pure art to everyone, but especially those with the power of enjoying beauty in its unobtrusive form. You will love the plot, the characters and life as it is.

Oh, how wonderful it is to be blissfully aloof in a maze of verdant hedges of ingenuity! The Polish director last trilogy piece skilfully epitomises and gracefully wraps up the tensions and questions raised by the three films. It exposes the contrasts of French and Western civilisation values and ideals, and how people reconcile them with their own needs and sentiments.Three Colours Red depicts the life of Valentine, a part-time model who becomes linked to a retired judge. Their flawed relationship and latent desires of the latter reflect the grim and contradictory nature of the our judicial system. The film shows that \"justice\" is conducted by human beings \u2013 who are just as biased, fallible and susceptible as those who are being judged \u2013 and therefore vastly flawed in principle. It is also an allegory of corruption and a reminder that one often has to barter for \"fraternity\" (one of the French/Western ideals represented in the trilogy)",

I had to force myself to pay attention and that speaks volumes about what my experience was like. Music remains essential creating atmospheres, simple performances, a clear direction, a very present and significant symbolism of the color Red but a not very dynamic script accompanied by a flat story.Without a doubt my favorite is: \"Blue\" by far, in addition to the fact that i managed to take things with me when I saw it, I found it hypnotizing at times, something that I did not perceive in the other two. Undoubtedly it is a personal trilogy by the director and beyond that it was not to my liking, I think they are one of those films that mature over time and you can get things out of it by watching them after a time and a different mood than this one.",

Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White.Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message.Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction.An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film.Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius.Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life.My Rating: 10/10",

I loved how sometimes it would become confusing whether the young lawyer is exactly the same person as the old man... they were same up to this point it seemed. But I think pushing of the glass bottle was a symbol for breaking the infinite repetition. As if with their innocence and kindness Valentine, Karol and Julie managed to stay alive in the big crush that happened. And they would be happy, despite all the difficulties.In Red, there were many red things:) first the poster, then the apartment, and her lipstick.

            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and \"The Judge\" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations.Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't \"cute\" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character.Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself.Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world.As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled \"A Breath of Life\", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent.The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the \"Breath of Life\" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.",

But there are no such emotional clues, or cues for that matter, in this one. It's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment.

It doesn't need great music or stunning portrayals of color to support it, although both are present. The plot and sub-plot fit together beautifully. The conclusion is quite fascinating, especially for those who have seen the entire trilogy.Not as in awe of the direction as others, I again commend the choice of actors. Irene Jacob possesses a very natural grace. She portrays her character extremely well. Directed to speak in an almost breathless tone, she doesn't miss a beat.Only one question, although I realize that Geneva is very French: why was Red filmed there and not, for instance, in Lyon? The choice of locales still baffles me since I truly believe the trilogy would have been much more interesting had it been filmed entirely in France. Makes sense, doesn't it, since it is all a depiction of the French flag's meaning?",

            "content": "\"Rouge\", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's \"Three Colors Trilogy\", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema.The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? \"Rouge\" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant \"Bleu\" and \"Blanc\". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to \"Rouge\" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?",

The story revolves around two people, both surrogates for us, but the images are not only part of the story, they become the story.I like how Trintignant's Judge is made out to be the surrogate both for our filmmaker and us, since it is him that comes to attain information about other people without their knowledge. He gives himself up because of Valentine. She is a Miranda-like figure: she suffers all, endures all, and emerges victorious. On one hand she seems to be very unaffected by all the people in the film, yet on the other it's to her most of the things happen. Yet still, she is the force that bends the Judge's will to surrender.",

The essential theme of the film(as in the other Colors)is the mysteries and subtle complications involved in human relationships, and in the ways that we are all interconnected with one another.

            "content": "In the third and final film of his celebrated TROIS COULEURS trilogy, Krzysztof Kieslowski demonstrates how all persons, whether they know it or not, are connected by a principle of universal 'fraternit\u00e9.'  Just as THE DOUBLE LIFE OF V\u00c9RONIQUE (1991) had dealt with the parallel lives of two identical women on either side of the Iron Curtain, RED deals with the parallel lives of an old man and a young man.  An elderly retired judge, Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant), spends his days spying and eavesdropping on his neighbors with an arsenal of surveillance equipment. His malaise and dissatisfaction with life is the result of a divided spirit that is, either in whole or in part, restored by his Platonic relationship with a young French fashion model, Valentine (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob).  The film's general themes seem somewhat analogous to those in Bernardo Bertolucci and Alberto Moravia's THE CONFORMIST (1970), which also starred Trintignant, and used chronological dislocations of life experience to mirror the protagonist's dislocation of identity, offering them as pieces in the psychological puzzle of how a man comes to be what he is.Kern's inability to reconcile with his past and get on with his present life may be a metaphor for the inability of Europe as a whole to deal with its history since World War II and confront its current situation.  Similarly, his need for distractions and deliberate sublimation of personal guilt and disappointment in an obsessive voyeuristic interest with the lives of those around him may also be a reflection of how modern communications technology has altered human behavior and ways in which people perceive themselves and the world around him.  Historically, it may express Wim Wenders' view that `the Americans have colonized our subconscious' as well as the broader phenomena of an effective colonization of people's lives by those of people whom they have never met through the omnipresence and pervasiveness of mass media.  And so, Marshall McLuhan's 'global village' has resulted in a concomitant alienation of the individual from his fellows and of the individual from his sense of sovereign identity.The catalyst in Kern's life is, of course, Valentine.  Like Goethe's Faust, Kern ultimately abandons the pursuit of forbidden knowledge for the redeeming love of a woman.  Her name, Valentine, connotes love and human companionship and, throughout the course of the film, that is what she offers him.  Indeed, her life is perhaps even more of a mystery than Kern's, perhaps because she is still young and has not acquired enough of a personal history yet.  Valentine's problem is that she does not have an autonomous identity of her own.  As a fashion and advertising model, she is required to project to others an image of their own narcissism.Valentine's growing self-awareness is measured in the images she constantly sees of herself like the fashion-layout photographs and the billboard. However, these are not 'true images' of herself in the sense that they have been determined by the will of others.  Her increased fascination with her own face as reflected in car windows signalizes an internal change.  And in the end, the artfully constructed mirror image of herself in the billboard -- an encounter with her conscious self and her double -- becomes transformed into an actual image of herself as she really is in a real-life situation by the final shot of the film.  She has evolved from her former passive status as an opaque photographic object to a new serene kind of subjectivity and solipsism.This is all well and fine but Kieslowski's film is not entirely convincing. Indeed, RED and the whole TROIS COULEURS trilogy qualifies as one of the most blindly overrated film experiments to come out of Europe in recent memory (but then again, look at the ecstatic reception some of those mediocre-to-gawdawful Dogme 95 films are getting these days).  His Felliniesque emphasis on man's spiritual life is intriguing but the overreliance on 'fate' or 'chance' as the determining factor in the characters' lives - as the mysterious force that ultimately brings everyone together -- seems vague and facile.  Consequently, the narrative often feels contrived and opportunistic - it just doesn't sit right and you get the impression that Kieslowski is cheating with the story, that he is groping for some kind of fuzzy-headed New Age revelation that he hasn't properly earned.  It's a seductive con at first but the dialogue, particularly Trintignant's, is full of quasi-cryptic, pseudo-profound banalities (e.g., `Perhaps you were the woman I never met.') that come across as merely pompous and half-heartedly nondescript attempts at gnomic wisdom.  And while Kieslowski is no doubt a master visual stylist, I am rather suspicious of his rather monotonous and all-too-obvious use of filtered light to create an atmosphere of supposed inner awareness and expectancy.  His images aren't really any more interesting or meaningful than the fashion layouts and chewing gum advertisements he seems to be obliquely criticizing.  As Pauline Kael once asked, `do symbols plus pretty pictures equal art?'",

The difficulty of making lasting connections is a major element here: the model is forced to spend most of her time alone as her boyfriend is away for work and can hardly find the time even to call her, she also would like to visit her ill mother but can only rely on her drug addicted brother to take care of the needy relative; the most developed relationship in the film, the one she forms with the judge, comes about because she happens to run over his dog.While the film-making devices used here are still top-notch, there's much less of the subjective camera work that made the characterizations so strong in Kieslowski's previous film White. Still, the plot here has enough inherent interest to work and the character development is solid if not remarkable. The camera work is a bit more restrained but the visuals are still strong, some of the lighting in the street scenes in particular stands out as being unusually atmospheric. All in all, Red manages to sum up some of the major themes from Kieslowski's earlier work-including parallel experiences and the effect chance has on human interactions-and it works quite well as a standalone work.",

I still think \"Blue\" is the best, with \"White\" a bit better than \"Red\". In the first two films, the main characters undergo major changes themselves; in \"Red\" the major changes happen TO Valentine; she simply reacts to them. She's ultimately the same good, decent, kind-hearted person in the end that she was in the beginning; it is SHE who changes the judge from misanthrope to human being. The heroes in \"White\" and \"Blue\" certainly react to change as well, but it's their response to it and their characters' metamorphosis that constitutes the backbone of each film's respective plot.Which is just a long-winded way of saying: see all three films.

Some authors might describe the brotherhood between two people, would go far to be always close with each other, no matter how much distant they are with each other; other authors might describe the brotherhood between two people, would arrive to a certain point to be not anymore close with each other, where the first one tries to find a new contact to be in touch with and the second one tries to get distant from everything around. After Trois Couleurs: Bleu and Trois Couleurs: Blanc, the auteur filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski has arrived to the conclusion of the trilogy, by exploring the theme brotherhood; to connect it with the last French flag color, which is the red one that represents brotherhood. In 1994 came out Trois Couleurs: Rouge by Krzysztof Kieslowski with Ir\u00e8ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. The movie's plot: The model Valentine Dussaut (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) finds a dog in the streets, to lately bring back to the retired judge Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who owns the animal. They would lately develop a strange bond with each other, not a romantic connection, but a bond to stay connected with each other. To arrive the last chapter of a trilogy, is usually difficult to develop a conclusion which would not be repetitive or if it would use elements to be not convincing enough. The movie worked well to be an interesting conclusion of the Three Colours Trilogy, which uses some interesting elements connected with the themes of the story; without using the same elements, which were already explored in Trois Couleurs: Bleu and Trois Couleurs: Blanc. The movie differently from the previous two chapters of the trilogy, is a much complete story of the trilogy; even it presents some moments which were unclear, including the reason of the main characters to take some actions. The production designer Claude Lenoir has created the settings, by showing how much the main characters are close with each other, since their first meeting; by seeing how much both of them needed a contact, which they were looking for a long time. Especially by using the red color to visually create, the spaces and objects around the settings, connected with themes of the movie. The cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski has captured, some of the essential frames, needed to create powerful images; by even get helped by the lightings, to create emotions which visually express the feelings of the main characters and how the story would move on. The editor Jacques Witta has elaborated a narration's rhythm, which gets clear how the movie would be told, from the beginning to the end; to find a way, where the main characters would encounter, the main ones of the previous chapters of the Three Colours Trilogy. The score by Zbigniew Preisner has been elaborated by creating musical notes, which would musically describe the emotions of the main characters and the themes of the movie; by being fused with the moments of the movie, needed to create some unexpected emotions. Ir\u00e8ne Jacob did an excellent performance as Valentine Dussaut, a model who is busy with her job and get pressure by her boyfriend, who lives in London and wants her to be with him; once she would meet the retired judge Joseph Kern, she would develop a strange bond with him. Even there should have been more details, about how much does affect her emotionally the distance between her with her boyfriend and some of her closest friends; some details about her loneliness, to see how much has been changed, since her meetings with the retired judge; if she has any kind of wishes, to give a change on herself psychologically. Jean-Louis Trintignant did a well done performance as Joseph Kern, a retired judge who has a dog that was lost and lately found by Valentine; from their first meeting, they develop a bond with each other, not necessarily a romantic bond but a connection which they both were looking for a long time. Even there should have been more details about, if he has in once a similar connection with someone who was dear to him; if he notices some changes, in the way people connects with each other, from his time until the current days; some specific details if he sees more or less improvements, with the current judgers. Trois Couleurs: Rouge is an interesting conclusion of an important trilogy, which contains some unclear of the specific moments, as well as some unclear motivations of the main characters.",

            "content": "Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music.i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love",

People most likely find something artistic in this movie so the ratings are good but this is a terrible and boring movie with scrambled plot that makes you sick. Even with full attention, you wont figure out what is happening as the director did a terrible job explaining the plot. Ending is very sudden and bad too but I was happy to see it as it was end to the misery I was going through.",

            "review_title": "Powerful resolution, best in the series",
            "content": "Red is the best film in the three colours series as it manages, deftly, a fine balance between the moody tragedy and the comedic lightedness of White. On all aspects it is done just right, avoiding each extreme marvellously. For instance, a common complaint of Blue is that it is overly stylistic without any plot substance, while White has too much plot and too little grace and style. Red does it just right- we can see camera movement and colour use which has become a trademark of the director, while the plot of a flourishing friendship between a judge and a woman keeps us in mystery, entertains, then soothes us with a satisfying resolution. The directors intended the theme for red to be fraternity- on how everyone's lifes are connected- and with its pleasing resolution, we see this theme play out clearly and intelligently, more so than in the other 2 films. We follow an aspiring judge for no reason at all, until it is revealed to us in the end. My reservations with this film are deeply personal- don't let my rating of 9 affect you- I'd imagine this film is easily a 10 for many people. Ultimately, this film remains us how little each of us are, that our mindsets are parochial and narrow, and it is only with an omniscient narrators eye, which this film provides, that we can see how no man is an island entire of itself.",
