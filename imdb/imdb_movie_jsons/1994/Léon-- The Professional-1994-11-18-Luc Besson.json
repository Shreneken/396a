            "content": "I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.On the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.Portman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.10/10",

Then again in the mid 2k on a dvd i own.Revisited the remastered extended version last night with my family.This movie is more than just a hitman or an assassin movie.The music is top notch, the characters are very well developed, the action scenes n direction are stylish.But the best part are the scenes between Reno n Portman. Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same \"safer than the usual bank story\".",

            "review_title": "Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart",
            "content": "Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.Luc Besson doesn't disappoint with this film, offering us his typical lashings of wit, and drawing charisma and charm from his cast. While THE FIFTH ELEMENT bordered on being silly in places, it was still a fun science fiction film, and kudos to the man for experimenting with different genres. LEON is probably the first film that brought him to the typical American's attention, and I would say deservedly so. While masquerading as a typical action-filled gun fest, it is in fact a film of three parts. The beginning is packed with horrible, unflinching violence from killers who don't have the slightest feeling of remorse - Jean Reno expertly massacres a squad of bodyguards, while Gary Oldman shotguns children and people in the bath. The middle of the film is more like a conventional drama, and it tells the story of Leon, the hit-man, and Mathilda, the young orphaned victim, and their growing love for one another which draws the human side of Leon out of his impassive shell. The ending is indeed all out action.All parts of the film are great, and Besson frequently shows his American contemporaries how it should be done. As the box says, it is extremely hard-hitting at the beginning, with deaths shown in all their bloody impact. The ending is also brilliant, with a SWAT team laying siege to Leon's apartment; this is non-stop, violent action and easily rivals any blockbuster like FACE/OFF. However, the film's main triumph is that it really makes us care about the two central characters, thanks to the script, Besson, and of course the actors involved.This is the film that really made Jean Reno something of a star. He's great as the Bruce Willis-like ageing hero, even if he does mercilessly kill people. Natalie Portman is also likable as the child who is old beyond her years, and almost unrecognisable from the bland role she played in STAR WARS. The villain is a drug-taking maniac, brilliantly played with startling intensity by Gary Oldman, who frequently shows his competitors how it should be done. LEON may be sentimental, but this sentiment slowly grows from the start and is realistic and believable, it is not shoved down our throats. Also, check out the ending, which manages to be very good and fitting, and yet sad at the same time. It will make you yell and cry in equal measure.",

            "review_title": "A Perfect Chemistry",
            "content": "In New York, Le\u00f3n (Jean Reno) is an Italian professional hit-man, who loves drinking milk and has a plant as his best friend. His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello), who loves Le\u00f3n as if he were his own son, and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), Le\u00f3n lodges the girl in his place, beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is, she presses Le\u00f3n to kill him. 'Le\u00f3n' is a wonderful movie, having one of the most perfect chemistry in the cinema between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The storyline recalls some parts of John Cassavetes' 'Gloria', but the performances of the debutant Natalie Portman and the always-excellent Jean Reno upgrade this film. There are at least three scenes that I really love: the light on the corridor, when Le\u00f3n opens the door for Mathilda; when they are walking together in a New York street, coming towards the camera; and when Stansfield hits Le\u00f3n. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'O Profissional' ('The Professional')",

            "content": "Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbour. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterisations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself.  This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history.",

            "review_title": "Gripping story with well-crafted characters",
            "content": "Luc Besson's movie L\u00e9on (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",

            "review_title": "Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece",
            "content": "Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.\nIn \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It's in me, I'm a beast!\" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",

Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!",

Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made.",

Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of \"La Femme Nikita\" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, \"The Fifth Element.\"",

            "content": "An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in L\u00e9on. L\u00e9on was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and L\u00e9on are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the \"Version Integral\" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an \"offending\" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. D\u00e9cors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. \"The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar.\" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"La Cit\u00e9 des Enfants perdu\". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter.",

It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.

            "review_title": "A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date",
            "content": "I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clich\u00e9s, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",

However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hitman who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a  frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story -  this picture has it all!",

Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, \"Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exercise\u2014a slick urban thriller\u2014it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.\" Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here.

Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkward\u0085Sporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with L\u00e9on rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is L\u00e9on's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from L\u00e9on. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",

A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.This was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.While I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while L\u00e9on does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material.",

Natalie Portman was grossly sexualized in this, we had scenes of her wearing lingerie, calling Leon her lover, telling Leon she's in love with him, and waking up in the same bed as Leon which is shot like you're typical \"morning after\" scene. While Leon never advances on her confused romantic love, it shouldn't even be in here as it adulterates their supposed father-daughter relationship. Some of the action sequences were ridiculous: ex Leon getting blown up and then changing into an officer's uniform in less than 10 seconds.

            "content": "\"L\u00e8on\" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 including a French and English version of \"Nikita\". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like \"V for Vendetta\" and \"Black Swan\", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to L\u00e9on. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to L\u00e9on.The film begins with an introduction of what L\u00e9on does. He is a contract killer, who, in fact only wants a little talk as we find out in the first sequence. The way he disappears into the dark is pretty cool. What is a more sad than cool is the one scene where L\u00e9on's loneliness is displayed. However, when we see him in the theater he does not seem to mind at all. His face expression while watching the movie is so much fun. He is also a milk junkie (just like myself). Sadly, I got no little girl that brings all this milk to me. There are many cult references closely connected with this film: the shades, the long coat, the piggy, the plant (rootless like L\u00e9on, nice quote), the chewing gum trick... After the intro, Portman and Oldman (character name Stansfield, a pill-popping Beethoven-listening psychopath cop) pretty much enter the film at the same time. Oldman's character is really scary, even his colleagues fear him. If you listen closely, Matilda's dad only dares to shout at Stansfield's partner Malky, not at him. The fact that Oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be a complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him. Another little snippet: One of the actors who play Stansfield's helpers died during the terrorist attacks on 9/11 during his work as a firefighter seven years after the movie. When Mathilda's family is killed, the writers already gave it their best to make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent to their daughter/sister, except the very small one of course. It's pretty sad when Mathilda describes him as a kid who only wanted to cuddle. However, we also find out that her dad paid a tuition fee for one year in advance, so he can't be all bad. I wondered about Oldman's character why the internal commission isn't getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying.One of my favorite scenes from the film is when Mathilda returns with the milk, hears her family is dead and knocks on L\u00e9on's door. Very intense moment with her begging going against his principles. Finally he lets her in, physically and mentally into his life. He becomes her mentor, she becomes his housewife and quickly develops some sexual tension (quiz game for example or talk about virginity as well being at an age where girls start dating their classmates. She doesn't go to school, so there is no such possibility.) At the same time, L\u00e9on also turns into some kind of father figure to her. She looks up to him and also starts dressing more and more like him. Even if she seems very tough, there's a handful scenes where we see how immature and naive she really is, like when she tells the hotel worker that L\u00e9on is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours in the alcohol.The movie is at its most entertaining when the two go to work together. The scene with LaSardo (great actor) is pure gold and when they shoot the jogging politician from far away, it is also slightly special. Another funny comment by L\u00e9on is the \"hurry or he will never shut up\" after they run into gunshots. An emotional highlight is Mathilda's attempted suicide. She asks him what she is to him. He says nothing, yet contradicts himself by pulling the gun away in time. Almost a bit of a spoiler scene is when L\u00e9on tells Aiello's character to give Mathilda the money if something happens to him. One of the most intense scenes is when Stansfield and Mathilda meet in the bathroom. Edge-of-seat stuff and it shows that Stansfield is really scared of nothing, not even killing a girl in police headquarters. The possibly most beautiful camera shot of the film is when we see L\u00e9on and Mathilda reunited at one point and the camera shows us their feet. The last half hour is almost exclusively action sequences. I enjoyed these despite generally not being a great action movie fan. Maybe the reason is that you have made such a strong connection with the two protagonists at this point already. Oldman's way of handling the final act says a lot about him as well. He stays outside of the action to not put his own life in danger, but is a coward who prefers to shoot his victims in the back. When L\u00e9on hits the ground, it is a pretty sad moment (just like the farewell scene a couple minutes earlier) as we see it from his perspective. The film ends with Mathilda deciding to go back to school and a beautiful Sting song before the credits roll in.Wonderful movie, over two hours very much worth watching.",

I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version (\"The Professional\") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw \"Leon\" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldman's single dimensional evilness.",

And when Stansfield (Oldman) is questioned about the massacre, he storms out yelling that he doesn't have time for this spit? What police force allows it's own to go renegade like that without stepping in? Then you have Mathilda (Natalie Portman). OK, I know we're pushing our kids like never before into a maturity they can't handle, but come on. Was anything about Mathilda believable? I can understand her wanting to get revenge on the scum that killed her family, but she was more than ready to go out and target practice using live rounds on joggers in the park. Who comes up with this stuff? There was nothing remotely believable about anything that occurred in the second half of the story, especially after Leon (Jean Reno) wasted the two cops right inside police headquarters. After that, it all became too absurd for comprehension.So then I call up this flick's stats on the IMDb, and it sits at #35 in the Top 250 of all time! What's that all about? That's just a total perversion of any kind of integrity in the rating system. This film is an escapist action adventure flick where one's sense and rationality is best left checked at the door on the way in.

But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.Let's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second \"Star Wars\" trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.Oh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He \"chews up the scenery\" to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.In order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.Of course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?And speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.The biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to \"adopt\" a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.While watching this movie I was often reminded of the film \"Taxi Driver\" which deals with many of the same themes. \"Taxi Driver\" is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. \"The Professional\" does not.",

            "content": "Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or \"hit men\". They're the standard \"badass\" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). L\u00e9on, however, flips this clich\u00e9 on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.L\u00e9on begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for L\u00e9on, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. L\u00e9on is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, L\u00e9on also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of L\u00e9on is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, L\u00e9on is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994.",

There is something interesting - well more than something, but let's start from the top/beginning, no pun intended.The movie starts off quite out there. It is almost comical - not just how Leon looks (the long coat and generally the way he dresses and walks - influences from the silent era? Quite possibly), but how he but even more so, the bad guys act. There is an air of amateurish and not proffesional vibe in the air.Leon of course seems to be in control of everything. So much so, that it seems his hand is detached of his body - especially when he has a knife at someones throat. A great dissapearing act commences.Leon has some very fine action scenes and has some very fine actors too. Take the three main ones - Jean Reno obviously in the main role, but also Natalie Portman as a kid and even more so Gary Oldman as the main villain. More about Natalie and her role in a second, but Gary Oldman is the ingredient that really elevates the movie above others. His performance made this movie work on many different levels.And maybe make you forget about certain things that seem weird in hindsight. There is the strange humor and the incapable almost cartoonish goons (though apparently they seem to be able to work the other side of the law - without consequences). No pun intended.The movie also has a weird relationship that builds between Natalies and Jeans character. You may have issues how she connects with him and how she is portrayed. But if you remeber being a kid, a teen, you may remember saying inappropriate things as well. She doesn't know any better - that is the best way to look at it. Otherwise you are making a case agains the movie and what it portrays.A few years later a still not adult Natalie Portman was still making men go crazy. Beautiful girls - you can see Natalie Portman and you can recognize her. Her performance is magnificent. We came to expect that from her. And I don't think making this movie scarred her in any way shape or form.There is the music the movie has and the New York vibes (mostly second unit shots I reckon). Then there is also the late great Danny Aiello. A terrific actor, who is shady, but also loveable.And back to Reno: his grumpy performance really works best. He seems to channel some heroes from the past. Strange he is not able to recognize Charlie Chaplin in a game of guess who. Even stranger still that the young Mathilde (Natalie Portman) does know Marylin Monroe and Chaplin ... especially because she only seems to be watching cartoons.As good as Leon is, there are certain things that do not make much sense. Like entering a bulding he has no business being in .. and without much resistence either ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Because this looks and sounds good ... and is the movie that made Reno and Portman the stars they are ... or at least send the on the trajectory they are (still) on.Edit: Matthilde is cursing a lot - okay? Hopefully you answer with okay, even if that would make Leon angry (if you know, you know)",

            "content": "Just when you thought the large majority of reviewers on IMDb were reasonable and constructive in their analysis, along comes a film which destroys completely that impression!This movie is relentlessly and thoroughly implausible from its opening scene to the improbable closing where the sole remaining possession of Leon, a potted plant which has miraculously survived, amongst other things, walls of fire, smoke bombs and bazooka attacks, is planted in what appears to be an open lawn!Unbelievable that seemingly 80% or more of near 900 reviewers here have very strangely anointed this movie a near masterpiece. My score of 5 is over-generous considering the litany of implausible character and plot situations. The most incredulous situation is the fact that Mathilda is a 12 year old, sometimes acting her age but more often than not engaging in conversation which is not only that of a mature woman but also appears quite disturbing in light of the sexual tension depicted. And for goodness sake, what 12 year old blithely refers to long dead couples such as Bonnie and Clyde?!The age factor of Mathilda and the implausibility of her words and actions in every scene remain front and center at the startlingly obvious weakness of this movie, regardless of how brilliant Natalie Portman's performance may appear.How incredible that she seems to have taught the near illiterate Leon to read in what seems just over a week. Considering that Leon has been in the US since age 19 and has developed skills as an ace hit-man and YET still can't read English defies credibility. As for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Stansfield, how could the actions of a vicious, destructive pill-popping police officer of seniority go unnoticed? How did he reach such a position in the first place? Totally unbelievable. And how can the near destruction of a hotel in Leon's pursuit of the gangster in the opening scenes, with innumerable rounds of machine gun fire, go unnoticed by anybody else in the building. Unbelievable. No police response until the climax where seemingly hundreds of highly-armed police and commandos with flame throwers and bazookas and smoke bombs and.......absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!So over-rated, so implausible. This bilge borders on parody. Ridiculous movie-making.",

            "content": "Well well. Luc Besson takes on John Cassavetes for the first time in this pastiche (for the first half, anyway) of Gloria. Jean Reno is an illiterate Italian (? it's not totally clear, but this is how he's referred to) hit-man in his 40s in New York, a simpleton with no friends other than his plant, an assassin of inordinate skill (though we see no real evidence of this until the very end of the film) who takes in an orphaned Natalie Portman, a pre-teen when this was filmed but dressing like a hooker through most of the film, eventually agreeing to teach her the assassin's art so she can revenge herself upon the killer of her horrible family, Gary Oldman as an insane, dirty-cop drug-addict DEA officer. Got it? Yeah, I got it, it wasn't hard to figure out....though none of it made any sense, ever. There are a few reviews of this film that have suggested that it be looked at as existing in sort of a fantasy world, and that would seem to be a better way of looking at it. Not much makes sense if looked at in real-world terms, even less sense than in usual in a violent action movie; but the film doesn't seem to have any internal logic. Reno is the hit-man to end all hit men despite being an illiterate simpleton? Oldman is some fairly high-level cop despite being so obviously, categorically insane? There never seem to be any extras around in most of the indoor scenes; there's a whole 5-minute scene in a washroom between Oldman and Portman and nobody intrudes. None of this works in a film that ostensibly takes place in a real New York City Let's talk about the acting. Though I didn't think Reno's character made any sense, I rather liked him, I got taken in by his charm; Oldman on the other hand played a complete cartoon character. Did he play him well? Perhaps. I don't know. Was he supposed to be a cartoon? Did Besson think this was a cool idea? I guess so. It didn't work for me, at all. It was awful. And Portman; I'm not going to necessarily argue that her performance was bad, I'll give a 12-year-old the benefit of the doubt when playing a character that has to alternate between cutesy, slutty, and determined; but again, I didn't buy the person she was supposed to be. And although at the end the film never....quite....indulges in the pedophilic fantasies that it seems to be heading towards, it still comes to close for comfort. Portman wears skimpy outfits throughout, and the camera pays more attention to her ass than is probably necessary. Were this my first Luc Besson film, I might have given him a bit of a pass, but given his usual predilection for waifish, very young model types...ewww.The ending is sentimental, trite, and completely unbelievable. It's an extension of the film as a whole, which probably doesn't even deserve the 3/10 I'll give it.",

It is the year that created cinematic masterpieces, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, the great Lion King and another masterpiece, that some may forget, Leon: The Professional. This alone makes the movie a must see Leon the Professional is a masterpiece Crime Drama movie about a hit-man named Leon and a young girl, who after the loss of her half family, seeks revenge on the people responsible for their murders by training alongside Leon. This movie has a plot that is extremely simplistic and just very easy to follow. The movie is also absolutely amazing in pretty much every way.The acting in the movie is superb. Young Natalie Portman really shows exactly how good an actress she could be at the age of 13. Since I haven't seen Black Swan, this, to me is her finest performance. Jean Reno as Leon was absolutely wonderful as the two shared some great scenes but the star of the movie, to me, without any doubt is Gary Oldman. There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable. He does that Heath Ledger's Joker type performance and is absolutely amazing as Stanfield, the one who murdered Mathilda's parents.The story itself is incredibly movie. By now, its a story that's being done to death with a bad guy falling in love with kids and growing a heart but no movie has ever nailed the idea like Leon. Seriously, the 2010 Despicable Me is the exact same story and is done horribly when compared to this. Leon is far more detailed. I mean, its not like Leon saw Mathilda and just loved her straight away. No! He tried to kill her during her sleep. He gets annoyed at her, he plays with her and he does everything. The way the relationship was executed was phenomenal.The characters in the movie are just absolutely wonderful and are extremely detailed. Mathilda is probably the finest child character I've ever seen, as Empire Online have said themselves. I could NOT agree more! There is just so much depth to her and not just she lost her brother and wants revenge. You understand her as a character for some strange reason and everything feels real. Leon is just an exceptionally cool character who keeps reminding me to the Terminator. The way his life turns on its head after meeting Mathilda is fantastic. However, my favorite character of the film is the one they didn't give enough screen time, which is a pity, and that is Stanfield. Seriously, he was such a great character in the movie. When Mathilda stated that the only one whom she loved in her family was her younger brother, we get a bit of an idea as to why but I honestly wish, that it was shown more so we could perhaps care for Mathilda EVEN MORE! The cinematography is great in the movie, the soundtrack is well composed and the editing is very nice.As part of my IMDb Top 250 quest, I'm glad I actually saw this movie as its pretty much a flawless classical 90's movie. 5 Words to describe this movie would be: Classical 90's Masterpiece, Great entertainment! To conclude it here, this movie is certainly one of the very best movies of the 1990's and when it comes to the great movies of 1994, it sits alongside the three masterpieces of '94. Please watch this movie as I'm sure you will be emotionally involved in this movie and have an absolute great time with the film. Its a great example of '90's movie magic.",

Now I am not saying it's a bad film but it's certainly not THAT good. In fact, it's not among writer/director Luc Besson's best (\"The Fifth Element\" and \"La Femme Nikita\" are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? The film stars Jean Reno as a top ninja-like assassin. However, in an odd twist, this lone wolf killer falls in with a girl (Natalie Portman) and he becomes her foster dad. This is hard to believe but even harder to believe is his training her to be a killer as well as he going after the baddie lone wolf style! And, speaking of the baddie, Gary Oldman pretty much plays the same guy he played in \"The Fifth Element\". Saying the film has some ridiculously difficult to believe aspects is certainly an understatement. Now I am not saying it's bad...but it cannot be a great film, in my opinion, if so much of it is difficult to believe. Interesting, yes....top 100...no way.By the way, I think it's safe to assume that Portman was named Mathilda in the film because of her and her family's strong similarity to the characters in the Raold Dahl book \"Matilda\".",

            "content": "L\u00e9on is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why L\u00e9on is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering \u0096 IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope \u0096 at its core, L\u00e9on could be seen as exactly this.The film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clich\u00e9s and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.The ingredients work in L\u00e9on. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage L\u00e9on (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Bj\u00f6rk song \u0096 it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.But this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on L\u00e9on's door \u0096 the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.The film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with L\u00e9on himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a caf\u00e9 run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of L\u00e9on are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money. But the following scenes of L\u00e9on happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to L\u00e9on's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is \"always like this\", this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for L\u00e9on \u0096 she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that L\u00e9on was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.The villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that \"we were doing our job\" hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds \u0096 they are not to be messed with. L\u00e9on is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same \u0096 Besson has made few English language films but there will always be L\u00e9on.",

Its story is complex and riveting, and its theme echo's the realism of living a lonely, unhappy life.This story of a man's journey to be able to find an emotional connection, and new meaning in his life thanks to Mathilda is heartwarming and satisfying.I have seen nowadays that controversy seems to surround every classic released in the past in one way or another, it festers on destroying what was real, and had a soul, and in this film that involves the connection between Leon and Mathilda.In all honestly, people need to open their minds to reality. And see how deep and meaningful people can be. This is what happens in life, and these are the feelings of young people who are affected by traumatic incidents in their past towards mature adults which leaves them a little confused and vulnerable.It's a shame that topics like this get sensationalised, but luckily it takes absolutely nothing away from the performances within the film.Going off Luc Besson's personal life, the relationships could easily be considered a truer story in a lot of ways that could potentially delve deep into a person's past.The language, the scenery, and the dialogue all just seem so natural. It's so relaxing to be visually satisfied to see the personal growth, and development of Mathilda, the good intentions, and the human side of L\u00e9on.The devotion you form with the characters is emotionally moving, and the performances show such naturalism in their roles, that it feels like these are ordinary people, having to deal with extraordinary circumstances. It grabs your attention and gives you a sentimental attachment to the story.The acting was phenomenal. Gary Oldman (Norman Stansfield) has played a villain that will be remembered for the ages. He was so charismatic, calm, cool, collected, and vile that you detested, and feared him. When he is on screen he captures your attention and draws you in so intently that every scene feels like something sinister is just about to happen.This was Natalie Portman's platform to the big time. I have seen her in countless films and always regarded her highly as an actress. But this was something different. To play such a controversial, emotional, and demanding part would be tough for even the best performers and she handled herself extraordinarily.When I rate a film a 10.

The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it.

            "content": "Luc Besson's \"Leon\" AKA \"The Professional\" ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his \"La Femme Nikita\". The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this) Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as \"Mathilda\" the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot. The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin).

            "content": "N.B. Spoilers within. Part action/thriller, part character study, \"Leon (The Professional)\" is a sure-fire bet for lovers of both categories. The story is about the meticulous hit-man and determined loner Leon (an amazing Jean Reno) and the precocious 12-year-old Mathilda (the equally amazing Natalie Portman) who crashes his party. They are vastly different from each other, separated not just by wide gaps in age, culture, and experience, but by their basic psychologies. Leon runs a strictly one-man show by sheer will and by necessity: it allows him to survive and flourish. But as bottled up as he is, he is marked by tragedy and sorrow. These feelings he keeps tightly compartmentalized, which makes him so successful as a killing machine. Enter Mathilda, the product of a wholly dysfunctional home, where she was regularly beaten and abused by her drug-dealing father and loveless family. Despite this, she is by nature a strong, hopeful, and highly intuitive girl. The movie throws these two together and lovingly documents their emotional journey toward each other. All of this is skillfully woven with Leon's violent line of work, providing the film with some spectacular action sequences. It gets even better when the savvy Mathilda joins Leon on the job, giving her a sense of purpose while forcing Leon to join the human race, or at least one headstrong member of it. The movie really succeeds when it goes deeply into the emotions driving each character. Mathilda, after all, is just discovering love and sexuality, which she presses on Leon, the object of her newfound desires. As for him, Leon can barely stand this nuisance at first, but gradually becomes the caring father figure she never had. The more she gets under his skin, the harder he looks into himself to do the right thing for her. This whole process becomes incredibly touching. You root for these two oddballs; they flesh out a unique love story.Meanwhile, Leon and Mathilda are up against one of the stranger villains of the 90s, the malicious D.E.A. agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman: he scores again). Stansfield is also an oddball: he is outrageously high-strung (always being pampered and brought back to reality by his fellow nasties), he pops weird pills, and rambles on about Beethoven to his soon-to-be-dispatched victims. In any case, he is a creepy, ruthless dude. Besson keeps the tension high for much of the film, letting go only long enough for the occasional scene where Leon and Mathilda have some time alone. (The two actors really shine here.) Otherwise, the film has a running undercurrent of menace and unpredictability. Compassion and cruelty weave continually in and out. The film's climax is gripping, and the do-or-die moment when Leon and Mathilda say goodbye is positively heart-wrenching. The two have come a very long way. A good word should be put in, too, for the always dependable Danny Aiello as Tony, Leon's boss and a father figure himself. This is a smart, highly enjoyable film \u0096 tight, focused, and personal. It's a rush for the senses and a gratifying story of memorable characters.",

            "content": "Leon the Professional (1994)A tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's \"the best\" without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.The bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension. So whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.Director and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen \"La Femme Nikita\" or \"Fifth Element\" knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called \"cinema du look\" style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the \"Taken\" movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.If some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list.",

The plot is more than complex than you could think. First, we can see the movie through 2 points of view.The first, in my opinion, deals with Mathilda being literally rescued by Le\u00f3n and then him taking care of her life (as a consequence of rescuing her; he couldn't leave her alone).The second deals with Mathilda wanting to be a \"cleaner\" or a hit-man (girl version). She's obsessed with taking revenge for her little brother's murder.Anyways she and Le\u00f3n grow a special relationship based on tenderness and loneliness. Both have similarities between them as they are alone in the world and then they have not a secure future.The performances are top notch, Oscar worthy. Jean Reno delivers a spectacular performance although he does not speaks that much; but his corporal acting and facial expressions are excellent. He's one fine actor. Natalie Portman demonstrated why she's one of the most talented young actresses in the world. And the girl was only 11! Her performance is brave, sweet, and dramatic. A one of a kind performance.The Direction is excellent. A perfect Action movie with Dramatic tones that looks modern, classic, and stylish. Very good visual experience.I can't praise this movie enough and I can't think how many times I've seen it. Le\u00f3n is a movie that deserves to be watched by everyone.The crucial part of the movie in my opinion is when Le\u00f3n helps Mathilda escape from the attack Stansfield sends against them. Le\u00f3n makes everything possible to save Mathilda and even risks his life and in a moving scene he tells her (my words are not that accurately) something like \"we're gonna make it, you gave a new meaning to my life; I want to sleep in a bed (he never slept fully), drink milk, etc. Sadly, only Mathilda escapes but now her future is secure as Le\u00f3n's money will pass to her. Then she signs into a private school for girls; now her future looks shinny.Le\u00f3n is the best hit-man in town but at the end he can't survive a massive attack against him. Still, a satisfactory and moving ending. Even the sexual tension between Mathilda and Le\u00f3n is justified and totally comprehensive. I mean, Mathilda is about to explore her sexual needs and feelings and Le\u00f3n is a lonely man who has little or non existent contact with women; not to mention Mathilda is extremely beautiful.Anyways, a movie that you can dig the whole time.",

Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.Things I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells.

            "content": "Luc Besson became the 'it' director ever since he dust French cinema with his 1985 \"Subway\", embracing the 80's as if it was a new millennium, a time where French movies could look American without it being an overused gimmick. And on that level, \"La Femme Nikita\" was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit \"Nikita\", would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.Jean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!Somehow I like the English title even more than plain \"Leon\" (though \"Le Professional\" was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..And on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.And before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a \"mission-giver\" played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And \"The Professional\" becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and \"Leon the Professional\" shines with its contrasts.Mathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!There's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in \"Interview of the Vampire\", both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a \"guess\" game with him. When Mathilda plays \"Like a Virgin\", it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.It's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. \"Do you love life?\" he asks. She nods, \"Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care\". Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.It is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot.",

One could easily assume there are sexual subplots going on here, but they would be mistaken. Leon is acting upon his instincts as a father might have in the same given situation. Gary Oldman is wonderful as the over the top cop out to get Leon from beginning to end. Portman does a great job as the young orphan, and shows why she would become a magnificent actress later in her career. Catch this film for the performances, if for no other reason.",

I don't know what it is that makes this movie so attractive. I guess it is because of the great acting by all actors and the fact that Besson has made a really surprising movie with characters who aren't what you would expect. L\u00e9on is a professional hit man, but he isn't cold hearted as you might think. He's a nice man who doesn't know how to read, who only drinks milk and who's best friend is a plant... Admit it, that's not what you would expect from a hit man. The same for Matilda, the 12-year old girl that he protects since her family was blown to pieces by a crazy Beethoven-loving drug lord. She's only 12, but she already acts like an adult and she wants to become a \"cleaner\" like L\u00e9on so she can take revenge on her little brother's murderers. This movie isn't just an action movie or a thriller. It's also a drama with a lot of comedy. You might think this wouldn't work out well, but it does. Don't ask me how, but Besson has made a solid movie out of it that will grab you by the throat from the first minute on, not to let you go until hours after it finished...

Opening to a lukewarm reception, L\u00e9on has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named L\u00e9on in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean \"EVERYONEEEE!\". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a L\u00e9on in their life.",

Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon. Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique.",

            "content": "Leon The Professional is purely and simply one of the best films ever made. From Natalie Portman's stunning debut performance, to Gary Oldman's absolutely nightmarish baddie, to Jean Reno's lovable and eccentric protagonist, it's a classic, a piece of achingly beautiful cinema that I could watch on the daily and never get tired of. The three actors are the bricks which make the film so special, and Luc Besson's fluid, sensitive direction is the mortar which holds them together. Portman is simply miraculous in her first film role as Matilda, a young girl whose entire family is murdered by psychotic DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Highly introverted assassin Leon (Reno), takes pity and allows the orphaned girl into his home and his life. Matilda is a strange girl whose specific idiosyncrasies both clash and amusinly interact with Leon's. He is an exile of sorts as well, with a tragic past and not a whole lot going on in his life besides the contracts he carries out for kindly, paternal mobster Tony (a phenomenal Danny Aiello). Leon and Matilda makes an interesting team; she is brash, unfiltered and lively, he is reserved, awkward and deafeningly quiet, resulting in unique character building and bonding that Besson handles wonderfully. Now, there's two versions of this film, because apparently American people can't handle slightly taboo undertones, even when they're handled in a caring and tasteful manner. You definitely want to see the longer, European cut which has some interesting scenes that crackle with sexual tension on Portman's part. Yes, she's twelve years old, at a very confusing crossroads of her life, the stark black and white mindset of a child dissolving into the very ambiguous and complex psyche of a woman. She believes she loves Leon, and he handles her advances in a way that requires maturity and intuition that he never had to begin with, but rises to the occasion. Call these scenes what you will, but there's no denying their esential place in the film's complete story, and to censor them for the sake of prudeness is a straight up crime. Matilda wants revenge against Stansfield and his team, which means going up against his wrath, and also means Portman sharing some incredible scenes with a voracious Oldman. Oh, Gary. This is his final form, the most terrifying villain in his stable, a flamboyant, deranged lunatic that one can scarce believe ever was allowed to be a cop. There's a fairy tale esque feel to the film, where the bad guys do what they want in the urban forest, never in uniform and free to roam, kill and terrorize with the full might of the NYPD at their dastardly disposal. Oldman is the Joker on mescaline, and in fact Stansfield pops mysterious pills from a little casket, when he's not murdering people while listening to Beethoven. He's loud, scary, stylish and animalistic, so intense one feels like his very presence will melt the TV screen. Portman is so superb it's hard to believe this was so early on in her career. In my mind she did her best work right out of the gate, in this film. Matilda is wise for her years, which she uses to mask the gulf of vulnerability residing in her, a hallmark trait found in children from abusive households. The family and friendship she finds with Leon strengthens her as as human being, and we start to see the emerging person she will continue to grow up to be. Natalie displays all of this uncannily well, and is the bruised, beating heart at the centre oft the film. Reno sells the eccentricities (Leon loves golden age Hollywood musicals) and sorrowful resolve of Leon so well, taking a character that is all action and very little talk, and speaking volumes with both body language and silence which, take it from me, is tough stuff. Besson, whether directing a quiet, introspective scene or a balletic action sequence, gives everything a stylized, earthy quality that makes the film stand out amongst other action ventures. You could spend a billion dollars on production design, but it all comes down to the human element behind the wheel, and if you don't have a director, cast and team that has the current running through them to create something special, all those dollars go out the window. This one has all of that, and is a solid gold classic.",

Action is just the extra salt to the delicious cinematic plate Luc Besson is offering to us.Natalie Portman requires a special praise. This is not only a stunning performance from a 12 year old girl, this is even not only a great performance from an accomplished actress, it is absolutely Oscar material and, judging from her next projects, easily her best role to date.It is no coincidence that Luc Besson, Eric Serra and Jean Reno are French.

Gary Oldman was phenomenal, and this was Natalie Portman's first acting credit, and she did so well considering how young she was. But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda's relationship.Mathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn't do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It's clear that this film is a reflection of Besson's own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing.",

            "content": "This film is not a masterpiece, and even if you remove the fact that it has some extremely disturbing scenes where the goal clearly was to sexualise a minor for no reason, the film has little to offer and is deeply flawed.The only good think to point out is the acting by Gary Oldman; as with all his roles, he does a great job of playing an unhinged DEA agent.Moving on to the plotline. It's garbage. A corrupt group of DEA agents, headed by Oldman, proceed to kill a family in their apartment as the father has been cutting up their drugs. How are they able to get away with such blatant murder? Unclear. Why are they doing this? Unclear. Why does Oldman take a pill, and what is it, before he kills? No idea. Will we learn anything about this group before or after they're killed? No, no you will not.The reality is that the storyline is a romance between a middle aged man and an 11 year old girl. At the time of filming, Natalie Portman was 11, and this is also very clear with how she looks and acts (FYI: not very well). While people say the romance is not reciprocal and is therefore acceptable, the romance is is indeed reciprocal. In one extremely unsettling scene where 11 yr old Natalie Portman asks Leon to take her virginity, his reason he won't is because he'd be bad at it. Not the fact that she's 11, but he'd be bad at it. That is the sort of paedophilic wet-dream content found in this film that somehow managed to get past everyone, yet Cuties is apparently socially unacceptable.A good comparison to see how deeply wrong Leon is, is to compare it to American Beauty. When Lester realises that Angela is a virgin, his fatherly instincts kick in and he becomes protective of her, realising that she is a vulnerable young girl and not something sexual. Leon on the other hand buys a dress for Portman who then tries to seduce him with said dress. Plus, throughout the entire film she is dressed like a hooker. Why is she dressed like that? No idea, no explanation is given.In short, even if you were to change Natalie Portman's age to something appropriate/legal, it would still be a bad film with a poor script and lazy plot. Though given how heavily and deliberately it sexualises a minor, Leon: the Professional is clearly just the product of a paedophilic mind trying to pass the film off as something else than a twisted romance between a minor and middle aged, socially awkward man.",

At the heart of this masterpiece lies substance and ferocity that is done in such style and flair you would be blown away.Beeson, who, previously had directed such films as Nikita and The Big Blue has simply crafted a film that no other director in Hollywood could have crafted. The music, acting, direction and story all pay off brilliantly and shed a light that hadn't been seen before. Take for example the acting, genuinely moving and emotionally charged. Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman all excel with dynamic and star powered performances. Gary Oldman is as brilliant as ever before making Stansfeild a corrupt and violent character one wouldn't want to cross. As for Reno's and Portman's performances they remain unchallenged.Beeson delights when coming to the big action sequences. Fast, brutal and stylish in approach are the Beeson payoffs. The music plays like a self taught orchestra, scene after scene has a meandering and thoughtful score.Verdict:Leon is full of memorable scenes and characters.

            "content": "I remember watching this film as a kid and being blown away by how awesome it is. From the action, the characters and the chemistry between Leon and Mathilda it was just all so darn memorable and cool. Sure, the relationship between an adult hit-man and a 12 year old girl may sound like it's messed up. But Luc Besson makes the whole thing work by making the hit-man Leon to be so darn likable, professional and yet naive. This is the role that Jean Reno will be known for throughout his acting career. He plays this secluded, introverted and yet sensitive hit-man who is very likable for a hit-man. Maybe because of his naive personality and how he doesn't live a rich and fulfilled lifestyle because of what he does. Maybe it's because Leon is a character that has certain codes and rules that he abides by. And for a hit-man he has some integrity and compassion. Some of it comes from Jean Reno's personal idea to make his character a bit mentally slow when it comes to things that didn't involve killing. This movie was a big hit in Asian countries, especially in japan. And a some Japanese movies, anime and manga tried to emulate some elements from this film. The ideas about the character Leon and his relationship with Mathilda came about because of Luc Besson's personal relationship with a teenage girl who is much younger than he is. Even Gary Oldman puts on a very memorable performance as a corrupt cop. His performance might be a bit over the top, but it stuck with me and it works when it comes to the context of this film. This is Oldman's performance I mostly remember him for despite him being a great actor. It's close the the performance level of Denzel Washington from \"Training Day\". This is even the performance that made Natalie Portman who played Mathilda into a star. Again it's the performance I remember this actress the most for. She brings about a lot of raw emotions for a very young actress. The first door scene where she is trying to get inside Leon's apartment by saying \"please\" made me feel for her character. In another words, overall this is the film that I remember all three actors for the most. Mix that in with one of the best script that Luc Besson has written so far and you got one of the best movies from the 90's. What made this film very lasting, impactful and memorable for me wasn't just because of the cool style of it all. And because of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. But because it has one of the best ending I have ever seen in film. It's explosive figurative and literally when it comes to Leon's final mission. Overall, this is a brilliant film with marvelous acting, characters and direction. This is part action movie, part revenge movie and part controversial romance movie that doesn't take it too far. While having a bit of artistic ambiance to it without it being pretentious. I personally think of this film as a masterpiece.10/10",

That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find \"beauty\" in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.I think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this \"Big Blue\" with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).I don't know if a \"Lolita\" vision is acute here but i think that anlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship!

This film, with some very sick messages, is uniquely appealing at the same time. To use a popular word of today: it is \"extreme.\"The extreme GOOD: 1 - A very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; 2 - A very intense drama at times with tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. 3 - The little girl \"Mathilda\" (Natalie Portman's first role) does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child, and I've seen a number of good ones over the years. It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star. 4 - Despite his profession, \"Leon\" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. 5 - Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. 6 - A very satisfying ending; 7 - Great camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.The extreme BAD: 1 - Not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but.... 2 - the latter (on the extended version) gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her ; 3 - Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) 4 - Another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys.

            "content": "Let us talk about the elephant in the room: the 13 year-old Natalie Portman as Mathilda...with that choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. I suppose it was OK for me to drool over her because I myself was about the same age as her when the movie first came out and yes, my eyes were eating the screen when she was on it. The creators knew very well what they were doing with the subject matter because they emphasize that stuff and make it part of the plot, especially in the extended addition of the movie. In the end they do keep it clean. In fact, while parts of the movie go to lengths in order to sexualize the situation, the other parts go equally far in order to keep the material palatable. For example, the main premise of the story is that Mathilda ends up living with and developing an affection for Leon the hit-man, played by Jean Reno. However, Leon's character is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life, which evens out the psychological levels of these two characters and makes the relationship more innocent and acceptable. Luc Besson's obsession is with showing distressed but strong hot women with guns that get thrown into the men's world. This creates a contrast like when a woman poses on a bike contrasting tender flesh against masculine machine. And Leon is perhaps the best of Luc's female experiments. In the movie \"La Femme Nikita\" it was a woman but she was at least a grown woman. In a movie like \"Lucy\" the character quickly becomes completely overpowered and the vulnerability factor is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters - you cannot get any more of a contrast than that. Sadly some of the effect is lost due to the way Mathilda ends up being portrayed. This character as well as her relation to the world around her are interesting. Her interactions and chemistry with Leon are also interesting. The performance put Natalie Portman into the spotlight as an actress, but her dialogue is not great.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the dialogue. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic cheesy action-movie dialogue, pointing out the obvious and not giving the viewer anything deep to think about. It sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy, perhaps for a comic book. Matilda's character suffers most of all because she sounds nothing like a kid of her age would sound (which I suppose is a problem more movies suffer from). Just take the title of the film, which is a typical example of this movie's writing. There is nothing wrong with just \"Leon\", since that is a main character's name. But the full title of the film is \"Leon: the Professional\". \"The professional\" is just such a cheesy thing to put in the title, like something from a teenager's comic book or an 80s B action movie. The acting is great though. My favorite and never disappointing is Gary Oldman as the main baddie. It feels like this guy puts all of himself behind this performance. There are scenes in this film that make you wonder how close he came damaging his vocal chords or dangerously increasing his blood pressure. One could say that his performance gets very close to overacting, but he totally pulls it off. This is one of his best performances.The movie looks phenomenal. It has peculiar grungy look. When I was younger watching this movie dubbed in my language it left an impression in my memory that it took place somewhere in Europe even though it is supposed to be New York. People's sweating faces and the cramped apartments with their run down dirty walls combined with Jean Reno's French accent and shot in a warm sepia tone give this film a foreign look. Its looks have characterThe soundtrack of this film mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric hums. Those violins give weight to the torment and I swear I could feel the heat getting heavier. If we want to find another problem with the film we have to go back to the girl. Look, for men who are not parents the whole age limit thing is bullsh*t, whether they would like to admit it or not, and by default guys are basically dogs, so parading a 12 / 13 year old girl in a choker is a cheap trick for a movie maker. Arguably, Leon is an exploitation movie. It just happens to be a very good one, but I feel like our guard is down when reviewing this film due to our mind having been affected by the material. It is like Nabokov's Lolita. Suuure you are reading the book just for its literary quality\u0085This may calculate in your consideration when deciding which version of the movie to watch. The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny. The short version is cleaner but far less emotionally loaded, cutting out one especially important heart to heart scene.Leon is a little silly and exploitative but it is one of the best thrillers and one of Luc Besson's best work.",

Jean Reno gives a highly engaging performance as the Hitman. Natellie Portman performs at her best with a strong female character at hey very first movie as a debut. You will experience a strong maturity of life through her acting and dialogues. Gary Oldman also surprises us with his impeccable character as the DEA agent.The bonding between Leon and Mathilda is warm, heartfelt, emotional, and funny. The apprenticeship between them is equally engaging and badass.Overall it's an acion-packed movie also filled with love that will melt your heart!",

            "content": "Possibly one of the best movies ever made. By reading about the movie, it looks like the movie is just a blatant action movie, where a 12 year old girl gets trained by a professional hit-man and then becomes an extreme war machine, killing everyone on sight. Fortunately, that was not the case with this movie, the movie was exceptionally executed. I can bet nobody expected the movie to go like it did, didn't actually had so many killings as everyone would expect from a movie like this.The ending was not what everybody expected, i expected an insane bloodbath, which it kinda was, but not to the extent it usually goes in action movies. And the thing that the ''bad guy'' actually outsmarted Leon at the end was, of course, unexpected, since that never happens.The movie was something incredibly original, have not ever seen a movie quite like this, little girl Mathilda completely changed the life of cold hearted assassin Leon, who knew only how to kill, she learned him about compassion and friendship. The bond Leon and Mathilda were able to make between them was something special and hard to imagine, where else can you see a 12 year old girl ''loving'' a 40 year old man. Leon didn't express his love until the very end, when they made their separate paths, but i think he felt something special, maybe he finally remembered his old love and the feelings he had and embraced Mathilda as his love.Even though Natalie Portman was only 12 in this movie, her performance was excellent, by watching this movie, everyone can see the reason why she grew up to be such a great actress, obviously had great skills in her youth.",

I truly believe they should both win Oscars if they didnt already. The characters were so well developed and interesting. The actors did a phenomenal job at making you feel so many emotions and connections with them. Even other supporting actors and everyone in between did great in their roles. Well done.Cinematography:\nGreat shots and scenes that are filled with purpose and emotion. It feels like the director took inspiration from many things and spliced them into cinema. Everything was well done and stands the test of time.Story:\nWho ever wrote this deserves a glass of milk. Extremely interesting story all the way through. It has many moments where the viewer gets connected with emotion and suspense with the duo. It has funny moments, sad moments and perfectly timed action moments too. Theres something in the film for everyone. The writing, dialog and plot direction was perfect. The only reasoning this is getting just shy of a 10 is because of a few things. I didnt like the awkward kind of crush/love Matilda had for leon. It was really strange and took away from the sweet father daughter relationship they had. Also I didnt really like the ending. I'm all fine with a good send off but the Tony guy seems like the biggest jerk in history. It looks like to me that Tony is just manipulating the girl and isnt going to pay her out. (Without giving things away) what happens from there? Its extremely tragic as there is no proper carer or family left. Other than those things I did throughly enjoy this movie throughout.Summary:\nThis film has everything you could want as a viewer. Its almost perfect besides the things I stated above. I would highly encourage anyone who is reading this review to give this a watch, its fantastic.",

            "content": "This is the first Jean Reno film I saw. After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.The other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.Now we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.Now when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.Full Plot: Leone \"L\u00e9on\" Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or \"cleaner,\" as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the \"Supreme Macaroni Company\" restaurant. L\u00e9on spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his \"best friend,\"[3] and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.On a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman \"Stan\" Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant L\u00e9on.Mathilda discovers that L\u00e9on is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a \"cleaner;\" she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. L\u00e9on shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying L\u00e9on's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to L\u00e9on several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.After increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from L\u00e9on's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. L\u00e9on, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that what he calls the \"Italian hit-man\" has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering L\u00e9on's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate L\u00e9on's apartment. L\u00e9on ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, L\u00e9on creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.In the chaos that follows, L\u00e9on sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. L\u00e9on places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is \"from Mathilda,\" then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open L\u00e9on's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by L\u00e9on. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune L\u00e9on had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can \"clean\" as L\u00e9on had. Tony sternly informs her that he \"ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!\" Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and L\u00e9on's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with L\u00e9on's houseplant in hand. She digs a hole and plants it, as she had told L\u00e9on he should, \"to give it roots.\"Verdict: 10/10. Buy the FULL UNCUT EDITION on DVD",

Leon is a very simple man from a poor background in Sicily, and although highly disciplined, comes across as very honest and caring. The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above. Their relationship leaps off the screen from perfect performances, tugging our heartstrings. Gary Oldman also gives a no holds barred performance to create a supremely twisted character.

            "review_title": "A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film",
            "content": "\"Leon: The Professional\" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. \"The Professional\" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is\u0085 old\u0085 like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff\u0085 expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all. The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as \"Leon\" are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, \"The Godfather.\" Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. \"The Last Don\" didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it. This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated.",

I was around 16 or 17 I think, I liked watched Jean-Claude van Damme movies for example and many other action movies.So let's start with the beginning, a family is being killed in an appartment. The woman shot in the bath made an impact on me. Maybe it represented the feeling of the scene. Because there was a corrupt cop with a drug addiction who was in a peaceful zen moment killing people. The actor is doing great as a very disturbed person! And there is also some humour in the scene. I have never seen anything like this.So you have Leon and Mathilda. Mathilda wants to be a hitman and she loves old man (she thinks). This is not another action hero girl, this is a disturbed child that comes in contact with a bit of disturbed man. The relationship and interaction between them is amazing, it is this movie that I started being a fan of Natalie Portman. They are acting very good. You see that Leon can learn from Mathilda, but that Mathilda also needs to learn a lot from Leon. Leon needs to deal with the 12 year old stubborn behaviour but also with himself. He needs to enjoy life more, but does he have any reason?Let's skip it to the end. The scene for me was a bit overdone with all those cops, but it was no problem for me. The ending also made an impact for me. All those guys for just one guy and he is managing to escape them! Oh wait... The bad guy wins... What? Mathilda is left with a plant...So when I saw this movie for the first time I was a bit in shock. I watched it a few times again to see more and more details and understanding the movie better and appreciate that this is art. And I am forgettig one thing: the music! That's making the movie complete. I am wondering why I am not giving this a 10... But I must be honest, I have not seen the movie for ages now, so I am not sure what I will think about it now. Maybe I must keep the memory in my head like it is now.But for me this was a game changer, my bar was set higher for next movies. Thanks!",

            "review_title": "Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard",
            "content": "From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.Many actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate. Leon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story.",

Leon and Mathilda however very peculiar and odd but one of the very lovable and sensitive lead pair ever created.the character of Mathilda was of emotionally damaged 13 year old girl who behave like a grown up mature girl,do smoking,filled with revenge and love and above all she is innocent and cute.her feelings can be easily understand by looking into her dysfunctional family.She was neglected by her father,elder sister and mother and due to her protective feelings towards her younger brother,she grown herself mentally or we can say she lost her childhood to become habitual with her harshful life.the dialogs of Mathilda was very mature but you also get sympathized with her and also laugh on her innocence and her naive feelings.Her feelings towards Leon can be easily understood as he saved her and she wanted her revenge through Leon.the character of Mathilda played by very talented Natalie portman she give best performance of her career in her debut.the protagonist Leon is also very complex and hard to understand because instead of being a professional killer, he is very good hearted and sensitive.jean reno played the character of Leon and he did very astonishing job because it was very difficult for audience to grew sympathy for a man whose profession is killing people and jean reno successfully accomplished this.Leon is one of all time favorite character for me and one of my favorite line from a movie \"no women no kids\".the feelings and love of Leon towards Mathilda was totally platonic and nothing was immoral and absurd in it.another character of the movie who was highly influencing and impactful was of Stanfield who is the antagonist of movie and was portrayed by Gary old man.you will always feel fear and shivering when he come on screen,a total psychopath,i wondered how did he passed the medical test for being a police officer.you will hate him as much as you never hated anyone before.also the characters of tony,malky,Mathilda's family and even every small roles in movie were very beautifully and perfectly portrayed.luc besson directed the movie very well,every thing was perfect with movie.the intensity and tension created during many scenes was unbearable and thrilled us from inside.scenes when Standford murdered the family,the sniper scene at roof,or the shootout scenes at beginning and ending of movie,the scene when Mathilda tried to shoot herself were very thrilling and almost stop my breathing. music of the movie composed by Eric Serra was very pleasant and played very important role for making movie more involving and touching for us.i really get disappointed when i saw that Leon was not even nominated for any award.i believe that movie should have been nominated for academy for best movie,best director (luc besson)best leading actor(jean reno),actress(Natalie portman) and also for supporting actor(Gary old man) ,soundtrack(eric Serra).it was very unfortunate that movie remained unnoticed due to low publicity among movies like pulp fiction,Forrest gump and the shawshank redemption which was released during the same year of 1994.this movie has every potential to stand along with these movies.",

            "content": "Updated February 2020: A very intriguing, action-packed 2 hours and 11 minutes. I was bothered a bit by the same thing that bothered Ebert's accurate review, namely the idea of a young girl aspiring to be a \"cleaner\" like the man she adopts after her parents and siblings are killed by a rogue cop when a drug deal goes bad. Also the implied relationship the young girl sought, telling the hotel clerk \"he's not really my father, he's my lover.\" Or the circuitous discussion of whether first-time sex is enjoyable, or the scene where she tells him to sleep next to her in the bed. This character is not a little teddy-bear hugging child, but a mature 12-year-old who wants to have a relationship with the older man, no matter how absurd it seems. Probably the French influence.However, all that aside, \"Leon\" is an entertaining and action-packed film. This was Natalie Portman's (Mathilda) first film role, two years before her smart performance in \"Beautiful Girls\", and she is quite remarkable. Gary Oldman is his usual crazy self. Jean Reno is cool as the hit man, a role that fits his image perfectly.The opening scenes, where Leon is hired to \"advise\" a man to stay out of NYC, is one of the best I have seen in any movie and establishes Leon's profession and skill set. And of course the closing OTT action. But the vast middle of the story is a non-sexual love story between Mathilda and Leon, something that neither had experienced before.I initially saw it on DVD, then more recently purchased the BluRay version which has an enhanced soundtrack, especially with inclusion of some really deep bass at appropriate places to heighten the tension. This is one of my favorite re-watches, I've probably watched it more than a dozen times. The BluRay disc also has a set of interesting extras, including actors reflecting on the experience of making Leon.",

The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO, in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.Firstly, the theme of the movie - Isolation and Redemption - The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone (mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she had)The characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.Secondly, the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied, beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice, she says to him \"Is life always this hard or just when your a kid?\" Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.Thirdly, The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The close-ups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.Fourth, the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes, I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.Fifth, the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield - The bad cop - what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.Sixth, Luc Besson, director, writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50% of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience - his film depended on her and he was a little worried, no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.All I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10, of course.",

            "content": "Leon is an adjustment of what a true modern drama genre is. Luc Besson made a real combustion here. He made a genuinely semi drama-action film which for me definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made. Despite lack of rating from movie professionals, I stated that this movie is one of the most impacts to me. The storytelling installment that this movie had was incredibly powerful, precise, and so freaking deep. It consist of a very strong bond of a little girl to a professional assassin which maybe it's too simple as shape but will plunging the audiences into his childish cry at the time, especially at the ending.In the shape of it's plot, I think Leon is one kind of movie that have a similar plot structure as Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\", but had a different style in movie making technique and how the way the story of the plot untold. Most people said the strong point of the genre was It's action. Not for me, It was the drama which intensify the whole movie. Firstly, the director wanted to slowly generated a strong bond of It's two leads. Then in the end, BAMM.. Everythings disappeared, everything destroyed, just in short period of time. It possessing a deep desperation feeling into the audience. Audience want the happy ending because of the caring and daring reason (which accumulated expeditiously because of the two lead's strong performance, especially Portman), but the real fact that Besson was brave enough to change the way of the old happy ending style implementation. Suspense skill from Besson was perfect, giving the audience to wish the ending they want, but unfortunately It's different, It's freaking sad and painful. I tear to pieces. That's what I feel when watched Leon, I had very similar feeling from City Lights (which ending's strong point was It's uncertainty of approval), two of them (the ending) had very strong impact to audience (all age range from my experience asking other older and younger people). Despite of harsh critic of It's Pedofil issue, I definitely still appreciate Leon so much. This was one of movies that truly inspire me. Leon is the true and the most bitter-sweet movie ever made.",

I guess it was receiving the 4K blu-ray of the movies as a birthday present and sitting down to watch it again that was the catalyst but in all fairness, I should have done it a long time ago..I'm going to assume at this point that nobody reading this hasn't seen this movie. If, by some quirk of fate, you haven't...well, stop reading now and go and watch it, that would be a far more productive use of your time. Given that everybody else reading has seen it, I just want to make a couple of observations on this remarkable piece of work.Perhaps the most obvious thing about this movie is absolutely NO WAY would it get made today. Hollywood's woke mafia would pretty quickly see to that. The pitch meeting for a proposed movie in which an orphaned and therefore vulnerable twelve year old girl and a middle aged Italian immigrant hit man enter into a dubious relationship would be a wonder to behold - I'd pay to see that! The movie itself is in no way problematic in this respect, with Leon himself being more of a 'child' than Mathilda is. Still, the issue is an obvious sticking point...I can remember leaving the theater 27 years ago with my friend Tim and, for most of the drive home, he remained quite - most unlike him. After a while, he sheepishly said '...I found that girl attractive. Is that a problem?' to which I laughed and said reassuringly 'you were meant to, that's the whole idea!'All these years later, Leon remains Luc Besson's finest work by quite some way. I enjoyed 'The Fifth Element', 2014's Scarlett Johansson-fronted Sci-fi romp Lucy and even the B-movie mediocracy of Anna. Nothing the man has done before or since matches the artistry of Leon. Story, casting and execution came together perfectly on this movie, the stars were aligned. I don't give marks of 10, that's perfection. Perfection doesn't exist and so I'll go with a 9...",

The young girl who L\u00e9on takes under his wing.\nThe chemistry between her and L\u00e9on is marvellous and drives the heart of this fantastic movie.\nThe extended cut delves further into their questionable relationship and really adds to the story.\nI recommend you first watch the theatrical cut and then see the extended version to truly appreciate its greatness.Cinematography is mesmerising. The opening scene as the camera pans through the city is wonderful as is Leon's introduction.\nThe direction by Besson is very impressive.\nAs is his engaging script.\nThe opening conversation is played out through the reflection in Leon's sunglasses and helps deliver the dialogue with sophistication and style.\nAction is handled tightly with not a gunshot wasted.\nOften brutal to behold but Besson still manages to make the carnage look artistic.'L\u00e9on' arrives on Ultra HD Blu-ray with a tremendous transfer.\nThis film is evidence of just how good 35mm film can look when given the 4K treatment.\nThere's still a noticeable amount of grain throughout which fluctuates in severity but it never becomes distracting.\nThe opening scene does nothing to wow in terms of image quality. It is only when L\u00e9on visits the convenience store for a carton of milk does the image really sharpen up.\nWe are then treated to fine textured detail of clothing.\nSkin looks startling with wrinkles, pores and facial hair strikingly visible.\nHDR is subtle. This isn't 'Aquaman' in terms of vibrancy but daylight scenes are splendid.\nYellow taxi cabs pop and shop signs are very colourful.\nBlack levels are finely detailed.\nThe rundown apartment building where Matilda and L\u00e9on live has fine nuances in paintwork and wooden textures.If this movie looks good, which it does. Putting many modern day releases to shame, then the sound quality is equally impressive.\nThe Dolby Atmos mix does a fine job steering ambiance around the room.\nEach speaker offers a buffet of delicious aural information.\nHeight channels are used sparingly but effectively.\nThe shoot out in the hallway is a good demo.\nThe sprinkler system can be clearly heard overhead.\nLFE has deadly impact when required.\nBullets wiz and hit there target with pleasing thud.\nThe climatic explosion fills the room with a deep chested gusto.\nThis is by no means a go to disc to show off your expensive Home theatre equipment but for a film of this age. The mix is highly commendable.So to sum up 'L\u00e9on' is a masterpiece of its genre.\nA word often loosely used but here it is definitely so.\nWith a splendid 4K release this film has never looked or sounded better.",

Back then I was into action movies, so I've watched movies only to see some action, I didn't care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy.",

            "content": "\"The Professional\" is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. There are about a million things that Besson does to make this movie so one-of-a-kind that you may not notice until the second or third time around. The plot is fantastic in that it continually takes turns towards less desirable paths, which makes the movie all the more intriguing. Rarely does a film successfully walk the tightrope of mildly disturbing without falling into the pit of immorality and pervertedness, but Besson manages to make both Mathilda and Leon likable and peculiar without crossing the line of dementia.Watching this movie the first time through, I cringed at the sight of Mathilda in any type of adult situation, especially sexually. After watching it time after time, her mannerisms began to captivate me, as she is no more a girl than a woman trapped in the body of a twelve year old. Besson is brilliant in his direction of Portman, as Natalie is incredible in her execution of her character. There are countless moments where her words or facial expressions send chills down my spine. The way the camera is placed on Mathilda is so captivating that it is impossible to look away, as much as you feel like you should. This movie almost makes me feel guilty for watching it, but there is nothing else like it; the emotional tensions are so high that it is impossible to resist. Never in my life have I seen such a young star so devoted to her character that it disturbs me; everything about their relationship feels real.The deeper meanings in this movie are also prominent, where love is the major contributor. Not only are there no boundaries to love, but the way Leon acts with Mathilda vs. without her accentuates the fact that without love, he has become nothing, just mere existence. The back-story of his lover and the Russian Roulette scene are key in portraying this theme and Portman performs near perfect to get this point across, which makes the full length version of the film a necessity if not only for those two scenes.This film is not only a film-making masterpiece, but the actors feel so realistic that it's chilling. I have never some across an experience like this before and doubt I will again; this movie is undoubtedly one of the most important love stories I have ever seen, and it makes me think how necessary love is to life.",

After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, \"I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,\" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good.",

While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.It's one thing to ask the audience to suspend disbelief but this film takes that to a whole other level. It goes so far out of the realm of possibility in places that it becomes more of a fantasy/sci fi film than a crime action film. Also what was up with the music? It was always totally inappropriate for the scenes. It was just completely off and awkward. I really wanted to like this film. I have generally been a fan of Luc Besson's other films and I'm a fan of the cast. Unfortunately this movie was a real challenge to sit through. Now there were some redeeming moments. I liked the little moments that established Leon's character. How he drinks milk, cares for his plant, and sits in the dark. I liked some of the little moments between Leon and Mathilda. There were a few good action beats. However none of these positives are enough to give the film the kind of rating that it has here on IMDb. The film is average at the very best. It offers no intelligence or soul to it's story. The concept could have worked if it was done correctly but sadly it wasn't.",

            "content": "\"Leon: The Professional\" is a French-made film with a story that takes place in New York City. The simple plot for this film is a good one. It's a variation on any number of stories in which a woman or man take in a child who has lost her or his parents. This one has some unusual variations that set it apart from the others. Mostly, they make it a far out film and unbelievable film. The acting is good by most of the cast, but nothing exceptional. There is minimal dialog, especially between the two main characters, Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno plays Leon, and Natalie Portman is Mathilda. Leon is a sociopath who makes a living killing people. He doesn't have a thread of conscience. He is antisocial throughout. Mathilda is 12 years old. She was abused by her parents and their various live-in friends. Her family was \nhighly dysfunctional. Indeed, it doesn't resemble a traditional family at all. The only person she felt close to was her four-year-old brother. After drug dealers kill her family, Mathilda has a sense of hurt and loss for her brother. That festers into a desire for revenge. Leon was taken in as a teenager when he came to America as a refugee after his parents were killed in Italy. Tony is a mafia boss who took Leon under his wing and started him on the road to killing as a professional hit man. Leon is illiterate, and Tony arranges special hits for him and keeps his money. The story takes place in New York City, around the neighborhood of Little Italy. Leon and Mathilda lived in the same building. He takes her in reluctantly after her family is killed. When she discovers that he is a professional killer, she prods him to teach her tricks of the trade. One other far out aspect of the plot is that the head drug dealer is also a major leader of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). It appears that his whole staff are in on the deal and nothing but a bunch of wanton killers. Add to that what seems to be a completely corrupt New York police force, and this is a wildly unbelievable scenario. The director and writer expects the audience to believe that the entire law enforcement body in the New York area was crooked, and unconscionable drug handlers and killers. And that no one else in law enforcement would be wise to that fact. The way these guys move around, wildly wield their weapons, and push people around makes it seem like mob mayhem. This film flies in the face of more realistic films about the underworld of drugs. The one performance that stands out is Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the DEA boss. Yet, his character is so unbelievably narcissistic, that it's inconceivable that he wouldn't be noticed by others. This film closely resembles the mayhem madness of sci-fi or fantasy films set in the future when society is mostly lawless. For the portrayal of Leon's clever techniques and the small affection and friendship that blossoms between Leon and Mathilda, this film scores five stars. With a better and more realistic scripting of the DEA and law raids, and a better screenplay overall, it might have reached a level worthy of seven stars. There is nothing artistic about this film. It has no outstanding performances. The screenplay isn't that good. It seems to be little more than a tribute to violence and promoter of revenge - hardly noteworthy attributes of the silver screen.",

Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve.

What makes this action movie stand out from the rest of its contemporaries is that Leon doesn't focus on the action or the hits the man takes. But the hitman himself, his struggles with loneliness and introversion, and how one simple action saves a girl from a pointless massacre, but also seals him to an eventual terrible fate.Leon the Professional is not just my favorite action movie, but my second favorite movie of all time (behind Prince of Egypt of course). Jean Reno and Natalie Portman provide excellent performances as these two lonely souls that find a light-hearted, almost familial bond. Gary Oldman gives the performance of his life as the creepy and psychotic DEA agent, Stansfield who he himself is a drug-fueled maniac (honestly a brilliant irony). Leon is a masterful blend of different tones that could seem contradictory and jagged on surface, but in actuality goes on to make the emotional moments even more potent. It's like an exotic cookie, full of different flavors, and ends in a beautiful bitter taste.Because of its heart and soul, that is why there will never be another film like Leon the Professional.",

It's just brilliant in every aspect - from casting to call, and from beginning to end, without a little distraction in between. Luc Besson has done a good job, and Gary Oldman! My god! Why didn't he win an Oscar for this role? Jean Reno did a terrific acting and so did the young Natalie.What starts off as an introduction to the 'cleaner' takes a whole new direction as the girl meets our Hit-man. Then comes Norman, the bad-ass cop, for a drug related issue with the girl's father. A murderous scene that sets in so naturally that I felt I was in that room. The girl is fortunately safe and credit goes to her mother who sent her to the grocery and Leon who allows her inside after she seeks help witnessing the aftermath.Later on I thought the story between Leon and Mathalda would go somewhat like Terminator-Judgement Day. But there was something even more special. Leon is losing his murderous instinct bit by bit as he grows into a 'Caretaker' and Mathalda loses her craze for killing and adulthood again a bit by bit. The way the climax has been written and presented, boy! 200 cops on one man, and still they struggle to take him out until he finally sacrifices his life to save the pretty girl. Every thing in the middle, that I've left out is something that I can only feel from the experience of watching this movie. Natalie Portman is now a huge star, and she deserves her stardom and acclaim after having acted like this in her very first film, and remember its no small film.It's a type of movie that I get to watch on rare occasions. Something that remains stuck in my mind after days of watching!",

While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies\", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10",

The fact that kids are susceptible to practically all the dangers that adults are today is portrayed in the movie very well.The movie does not have scenes that attract attention by asking the actors show weakness, to cry, to express feelings with words, but everything is done in situations, music, and cinematic tricks of different kinds.This is not a movie to make one feel gooey and tender on the inside, but rather to provoke a spurt of emotion that hides inside every one of us.

Returning from an innocent trip to the grocery she finds that Gary Oldman and his goons have killed her entire family and are rummaging around, looking for some lost dope.Being a smart kid, Portman slowly carries her grocery bags past the open door to the blood-spattered room, past Oldman's lookout man who eyes her suspiciously, and when she reaches the end of the hallway, unable to walk farther, she presses the last doorbell. It doesn't open. The lookout is watching, his pistol in hand. She rings the bell again, whispering, \"Please open it.\" Behind Door Number N is Jean Reno, a professional hit man, also with a drawn pistol, watching the goings on through a hole in the door. He works alone, \"no women, no kids\", doesn't want to be involved in somebody else's violence, and he knows the girl's situation.He opens the door and for him it's like opening Pandora's box. All sorts of irrelevant demands are placed on him and he's subject to threats that have nothing to do with his profession.Oldman discovers that Portman was missed in the slaughter and the gang begins its search for her and, ultimately, for him too. Portman smokes cigarettes, is cheeky, wants to learn how to kill people, and whispers to the manager of their new hotel that Reno is not really her father. He's her lover.The manager's expression is a little hard to read. Natalie Portman may be an underdeveloped twelve but she is angelic with her Louise Brooks hair cut and her black choker and her feline eyes and her plump lips. She's not the most convincing little actress in the business but what does it matter? Any normal man would be abnormal if he didn't want to squeeze and bite her.There is a shoot-out at the end or, maybe, a grenade-out would be better. It's not a very sophisticated movie and it doesn't demand much of the viewer. Lone gunman comes to love a little kid and sacrifices himself. And there are a couple of spots meant to be humorous that only sometimes hit the mark. Reno's imitation of John Wayne is superb.In fact, though, Reno is pretty good throughout. What an \"everyman\" kind of face. It's in no way glamorized. He's balding and his chin is stubbled. He dresses like a hobo and looks as if he might smell like a goat.Gary Oldman is a good heavy too, but the movie makes a clear distinction between bad killer Oldman and good killer Reno, who has a soft spot in his heart for beautiful children, rather like Allan Ladd had his kitten in \"This Gun For Hire.\" But Portman is cute and Reno is appealing.

Two years later a longer version with an additional 25 minutes appeared. This was called the International version. The shorter original version is what director Luc Besson refers to as his directors cut. Both are English language, but have a very strong French influence. Lovers of European crime films and thrillers will love this film.Both version are modern crime classics, inspired by a medieval French ballad about a knight that was in danger of losing his land through battle, until he mounts one last heroic effort and with a blood curdling battle cry (as seen in the end of the film) he hurls himself once more at the enemy and wins the day. This is one of the many spiritually profound things in this film that lift it from a generic crime film, augmented by a timeless soundtrack by Eric Serra.The plot: A lethal foreign hit-man befriends a young girl after sparing her from the same bloody fate that befalls her family, gunned down by a vicious corrupt cop and his merry band of killers. One of whom in real life would later die on September 11 (he played \"Benny\").The young girl is Mathilda (Natalie Portman in a very early role). Mathilda demands to stay with her savior, the recalcitrant hermit hit-man, Leon. This sets up a nice role reversal. The older Man should be the one that calls the shots, but he's a helpless foreigner that cannot read English and so it falls to the younger vivacious Matilda to save him right back.The socially awkward man child Leon wears ill fitting clothes made for a teenager not an adult. He really is just half a man. He spends his time between hits drinking enough milk to raise a brood of orphans, just in case the child motif wasn't established enough already. He also trains and trains his body and mind to be the sort of lethal weapon that negates the need to fully integrate into this new foreign world. Half man half child.Leon is bewildered by Matilda and doesn't know how to handle her. Mathilda eventually becomes infatuated with Leon, mistaking his paternal protective mechanism as mutual love. Some Narrow minded film critics see more to that than what it is.As soon as Matilda realizes what Leon does for a living, she demands that he teach her how to kill, hoping to learn the skills required to get revenge on those that made her an orphan. Leon flatly refuses. He also rejects her naive romantic overtures. Ashamed and rejected She runs off alone toward a bloody showdown with the corrupt cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman in his psychotically brilliant career defining role), who murdered her entire family at the start.Talk of a sequel has been bubbling along for years. Director Luc Besson has written a screenplay, but having left Gaumont (the company that produced this film) it appears they are withholding the screenplay from him as well as the rights to make said sequel, so it may never happen.",

This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes. This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss. That's original.Or how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r. And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives? This film is completely ridiculous.

As she rings the doorbell, she breaks down and starts crying as it finally hits her that her little brother has just been brutally murdered.And so begins a relationship of revenge, healing and mutual affection between two very lonely people. Besson pulls no punches in revealing Mathilda's emerging sexuality as Mathilda begins to fall in love with her reluctant guardian. But unlike the misadventures of an older man and young temptress from Nabokov, the relationship here isn't seedy, cynical or perverse. It is actually quite poignant as the simple-minded hit-man quietly contains Mathilda's amorous advances without withdrawing from her. He is genuinely fond of her and this is beautifully played out by Jean Ruso as he protects and guides, as best as a hit-man can, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.Ultimately, this is a love story between two people who can't have each other yet still protect each other in ways both dramatic and sublime. The love is awkward, clumsy and na\u00efve in a gritty and tender way all at the same time. But it is genuine and heart-felt. Very few directors would be able to pull off this kind of story, so this is a bit of a gem -- I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like this again.I just love this story and Mathilda is one of my all-time favorite characters. Natalie brings a sublimely powerful performance to the screen that you will remember for a long time.I'm just sorry that she isn't proud of it. She should be. It's a powerful story.

            "content": "On paper, the plot line for this film is an absolute nightmare \u2013 controversial and even sick if handled by the wrong director. And yet Luc Besson conjures up an intricate, touching and taught thriller which ranks as a landmark piece of cinema.Leon is essentially a love story between a French hit-man (referred to as a 'cleaner') and a 12 year old girl whose family are brutally murdered by a monstrous DEA official come drug dealer (Gary Oldman). Leon (Jean Reno) is a meticulous assassin carrying out $5000 hits for the Italian underworld. He never actually gets paid as his boss Tony looks after his money for him (safer than a bank) though the reality is that he is being fleeced. He is socially and emotionally like a child \u2013 his simple life consists of drinking milk, watching Gene Kelly films, caring for a plant and sleeping upright in a chair with a gun by his side. He can't read and lives a solitary existence. His life changes when one day, a 12 year girl called Matilda (Natalie Portman) returns to the apartment building with some cartons of milk for him. As she walks past her own apartment to knock on Leon's door she sees that her family have been brutally murdered. In tears, she pleads with Leon to open the door, starting a relationship which ultimately ends in tragedy.Leon reluctantly takes Matilda under his wing and teaches her the skills of the expert hit-man because it's all he knows and over time they form an unbreakable bond.The film works for two simple reasons \u2013 Portman's pre-adolescent character means that she is too young to truly understand the implications of what she saying i.e. about love and sex. In Leon's case, he is in some ways even more of a child and therefore incapable of taking any sinister advantage of the situation. The result is a touching love story without any hint of perversity - their love is genuine but there is no hint of it crossing the lines of common decency. The controversial scene where Matilda asks to sleep with him was cut in the American screening and yet it is clear that Matilda doesn't really understand what she is saying nor does Leon have any intention of entertaining the prospect. The way in which they say goodbye to each other in what turns out to be the very last time is very much in the father daughter mould.Besson came up with Leon's character from a bit part Reno played in a previous film, La Femme Nikita , and the way Reno portrays Leon quite rightly turned him into an international movie star. His understated performance in direct contrast to the brashness of Matilda, is perfectly judged and the empathy you feel for his character is almost immediate.Gary Oldman's role is brutal, terrifying and wonderfully sinister. A glorious, over the top, drug fuelled nutcase with a passion for Beethoven. But it is Portman who steals the film and quite rightly so. When Luc Besson casted for the part of Matilda, he wanted someone young \u2013 somebody who did not understand the meaning of love. In her screen test, Portman was told the scene \u2013 that she is walking towards Leon's apartment when she discovers that her family including her 4 year old brother have been brutally murdered. She started to cry immediately \u2013 Besson had found her Matilda.It is amazing that Natalie Portman appeared in the awful Star Wars Prequels after a giving such a wonderful performance in Leon. There are very few child actors who could have delivered an acting master class like this \u2013 the only comparison I can think of is Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Even more remarkable, Portman had received little in actor training or experience before this film. During the making of the movie, the first time she had to be tearful, the crew used methanol to help her appear to be crying. She only used this once, as she was able to generate the emotion and tears by herself - quite a feat for an 11 year old girl.Fortunately, Natalie had very good parents who had certain control over the way she was used in the film. You never see Matilda draw on a cigarette and she gives up smoking later in the film. A planned shower scene where Matilda prances around naked was thankfully scrapped. Leon is a film of many complexities and one of the best thrillers I have seen personally. Whether you see it in the normal or Directors Cut version (the long version as Reno calls it), it's a must have. We must also hope that Besson writes a script for a new film, Matilda, so we can all see what happens to her character in the future. Portman has already stated she would do this at the drop of a hat, relishing the chance to work with Besson again \u2013 here's hoping.It is a magnificent piece of cinema.",

It was like watching Jody Foster in Taxi Driver. Every other role perfectly played, including Gary Oldman whose character is a bit off the rails. It's a magnificent flick, beautifully directed.

            "content": "\"Leon\" in the top in my list of favorites movies, and I think that is one of the best movies of all times. The story does a great job of avoiding the \"big\" stuff in favor of the smaller, more intimate story. We don't delve into what the whole of the Italian mafia is doing in the film, or about how wide Stansfeld's drug empire goes, his motivations... all the movie focuses on is Leon and Mathilda. Also, it shows so much emotion on everything and the characters they did were amazing, Jean Reno showing how sweet an assassin can be and Natalie Portman how little girl can be so intelligent. The advantages of this movie is the actors play. You can't find two actors who work together so well with such a gap between their ages. Another plus is the music choice of this movie, which makes the mood of the movie more understandable. After listening Sting's Shape Of My Heart in this movie, this song remains in our hearts.\nHence, I really suggest everyone to watch this movie, beccuse you will find not only one of the best movies, but also one the most heartbreaking songs.",

He I feel sees her as the family he has never had. She obviously has a crush and sees him in romantic way, which he doesn't encourage and struggles to cope with!!! its these unexpected twists in the story and clever sub plot that makes the film stand out from the crowd. its a modern classic and needs 10 stars.

I will definitely say that it is easily the most overrated movie in IMDb.I could guess its climax in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The action in the movie is very well done. The saving grace is definitely the climax,the ending is superb and really redeems the movie, which otherwise could have been dull and insignificant.The casting consists of Jean reno and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is a 12 year old precocious child who has an immature love for Jean Reno who happens to be a Hit-man. After her entire family gets knocked out by Gary Oldman, he takes her into his wings and teaches her the secrets behind becoming a hit-man or say a hit-girl rather. Amongst the performances only Portman 's worth watching.. Gary Oldman is disappointing so is Jean Reno.The movie fails mainly because of its poor character development. The characters are very superficial especially Gary Oldman's character. You are left wondering why they are doing what they are doing.Overall as i said IT IS HUGELY OVERRATED.....I would give it7.2\\10..",

It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer.

Gary Oldman is as good being bad as ever, and Danny Aiello provides a classy supporting role.The movie could be controversial in many respects but the sheer class and emotion lift it above any doubt. It reflects real life. Perhaps surprisingly, it is in Leon that emotion surfaces more easily, with Mathilda almost carrying the hardened hit-man as well as the film, through a series of punishing tests.Mathilda is irresistible, cute, practical, tortured, sensual, and yet remains entirely innocent. As is the heartless, simple, cold-blooded murderer, Leon. This is artistic, entertaining, depressing, uplifting, shocking, yet always remains beautiful and true. It is sad that Portman has never come anywhere near to repeating her performance in Leon, and probably never will. Whatever reasons she may have, it is sad for the fans that she doesn't take on more of these 'gritty' roles. But it's one more reason to watch, be amazed and captivated by Leon.",

            "content": "Jean Reno plays the titular character \u2013 regardless of the name on the spine of the DVD \u2013 he is both Leon and the Professional. A quiet intense man who lives a solitary existence of discipline and ritual, honing his skills as an assassin that leaves no trace and carries out his work cleanly and perfectly, a man with only two parameters to his work: 'No women. No kids.' When the family that lives next door in his modest apartment building is butchered by corrupt police after a drug deal gone wrong, leaving only 11 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), Leon has virtually no choice but to literally take her in, lest he break his own rules through deliberate inaction.In the days and weeks that follow, impressionable Mathilda \u2013 who feels she is wise beyond her years \u2013 comes to realise the enormity of her situation. This is only magnified when she learns of Leon's true occupation. Of course being no more than a kid, Mathilda hardly finds this news abhorrent, but decides that she wishes to learn the ropes of what Leon refers to as 'cleaning'.This leads to a strange new existence for Leon, he cannot force pre-teen Mathilda out into the real world, but allowing her to remain compromises his disciplined existence. The mismatched duo settle in to a 'Daddy / Daughter' relationship, with Mathilda remaining home while Leon heads off to 'work', the issue rapidly becomes that Mathilda rapidly starts seeing Leon as less of a Father figure, and more of a crush\u0085 Seeing that Mathilda is so headstrong, determined and convincing, and that Leon is if anything slightly child-like and has been shielded from normal human relationships, Leon ultimately yields a little and tentatively commits to basic training; something his employer Tony (Danny Aiello) is rightfully doubtful of.Regardless of suitability or basic ethics, the Leon / Mathilda relationship evolves into a strange partnership, and bringing your (pseudo) daughter to work days take on strange and uncomfortable significance. As Mathilda develops new skills and confidences unbecoming of her fragile years it is more and more evident that her ultimate intent is to avenge the deaths of her family\u0085 Which brings us to Mr Gary Oldman and his role as corrupt cop Stansfield.Stansfield works for the Drug Enforcement Agency in the police force, however his entire unit is entirely crooked. Oldman toes the fine line between over the top intensity and cartoonishness well for the most part, and I guess if you are looking to forgive some of his antics you could always point to the green and yellow capsules that he takes prior to his more 'memorable' sequences.What is undeniable is that the and inescapable routine that the reserved and measured Leon is bound by is an effective counterpoint to the haphazard and impetuous existence of Stansfield. Having initially innocent Mathilda embroiled between these ying and yang characters provides the film with a centre, and the inevitable feeling that all three characters will find themselves in the same place at the same time.Leon is full of long low key scenes with equally subtle background music, 90% of the dialogue is between Mathilda and Leon \u2013 with a good two thirds of each conversation dominated by the precocious child. These scenes are punctuated by sudden dramatic scenes of violence, especially as the film nears its conclusion and Mathilda finally learns that there are some things that kids shouldn't be subjected to regardless of how 'ready' they think they are.Leon: The Professional was directed and written by Luc Besson, who has managed to leave his fingerprints on several essential action flicks from the last couple decades, Taken, Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter and Unleashed included. Leon seems to be quite a personal work, and while some of the other works listed are very good and worth checking out, in my mind Leon: The Professional stands head and shoulders above them all.This film granted both Gary Oldman and Jean Reno eternal credibility to a generation of young film-goers, and helped launch the career of Natalie Portman. For a moment it almost made me want to buy a skull cap\u0085 Now nearly two decades on I am at odds with the more 'risky' scenes that further the on the job training and 'romantic' aspects of the storyline. I am by no means decrying their inclusion as being abhorrent or immoral, but I similarly don't really see them adding much to what was already an amazing and essential film.Final Rating \u2013 9 / 10. A simple story about a very non-simple situation, Leon remains an all time classic.",

Her father is a drug holder who skimmed a little off the top.

The characters are outstanding with great backstories and development. The dialogue is well written and the cast is perfectly selected. Reno and Portman deliver tremendous performances. The action scenes are a bit spread-out but over the top good and very well done. The family murder sequence, the police station scene, the first hit you see Leon conduct and the final standoff with the police are all legendary action genre sequences. Oldman is a tremendous villain and delivers a fantastic performance as well.Overall this is action genre gold with an amazing storyline, tremendous writing and out of this world acting.

The problem is that this is not a sci fi movie. These are things that are necessary for a crime movie, especially of this nature. This is not the matrix or some sort of martial arts film. It is a organized crime/hitman movie. And in these movies you expect things to be realistic and believable, not overdramatized and downright silly. And thats what this movie is.

Well in the apartment complex he lives in is a family and the father of said family has run afoul of a dirty cop, played by Gary Oldman. Well this family is pretty much wiped out from the father to the wife and the young son, only the daughter survives and this is only because Leon, the hit-man, lets her into his home. This professional hit-man is played by the always interesting Jean Reno who I believed played the character in the foreign and original version of this movie (I think it was a French film). You have some humorous scenes of Leon teaching the orphaned girl how to clean (his term for knocking someone off). He tells her how one goes from long range to short range that you are truly great when you become adept at the close range. Though with all this you know that sooner or later the men who killed the girl's family are going to get back into play and you end up with a very explosive finale.

This film is definitely deserving of a place in the top 50 films of all time.Outstanding performances burn up this stellar flick. If you don't know the show's storyline, here's the short-short version. An immigrant hit-man (Reno) becomes responsible for, and eventually falls in love with a young girl, Mathilda (played marvelously by Natalie Portman) whose family was murdered by a dirty DEA agent (the always superb Gary Oldman) and his team. Our heroic hit-man must protect the girl and avenge her family's death.More than just a compelling action drama, the film focuses its attention on the truth of humanity that people are social creatures and need companionship. While at first Leon is cold and commanding towards his young charge, he eventually warms to her more than he wants to admit to himself. When Mathilda's desire for vengeance places her in harms way, Leon's true feelings burst forth in a hail of bullets and bloodshed that would make the Terminator think twice about messing with this man.The story is solid.

This is a film that conveys how amazing humans are - from sadistic maniacs to tender hit men. The complexity of the behaviors, the abilities of the characters to make largely believable choices based on their moral codes, and some astonishing performances from some incredible actors make this a film you must like if we're ever going to see each other again.The principals give us some incredible performances. Jean Reno as Leon is astonishing. His ability to convey a million feelings with a blink of his eyes, a stiffening of his shoulders, or even the intake of breath make him someone I could watch in anything. I loved loved loved him in Ronin and this has only increased my love of the guy. I'm not gay but if I watch Leon enough, I might soon be! I will have to check out more of his work. His modesty, loyalty, decency, complexity, his tenderness and firmness with Mathilda (Natalie Portman), his steadfastness, and his courage make him one of my favorite movie characters in any film. I thought I wouldn't need to use any more superlatives for Natalie Portman having watched Heat about 50 times but she was younger in this film and she gives a performance with even more range than she showed in Heat. I'm happy to be able to see her work (even though I thought Black Swan was pretentious, predictable, melodramatic pablum). Her ability to convey anger, fearfulness, tenderness, confidence (I loved her peremptory dismissal of the four boys trying to protect their claim to neighborhood turf), and burgeoning sexuality (fortunately this part of the film doesn't quite take the film off course though I was worried for a second) while most definitely being a kid (she loves cartoons!!!) is amazing. Having said that, the best thing about Mathilda is her resilience. She is a survivor and this trait is Mathilda's baseline characteristic. Portman is just an incredibly gifted actress and her performance here is almost enough to leave me speechless.Danny Aiello is fantastic as Leon's loyal friend. He is a rock for Leon and asks no questions. He can always be trusted. Aiello conveys the sense of a man who cannot be shaken and is a true friend. He's probably heard it all and yet he's still there for his friend. Honestly, I thought Oldman was a bit over the top in his role. Obviously he is supposed to be out of control but I thought this was self-parodic, even for him. Luc Besson is never better at the helm and as a writer. His steady hand is much in evidence in keeping such a wild plot on pace and finding the emotional and moral centers of the film. The script is fantastic - a hit-man with a heart of gold, a precocious tweener, and a psychotic, crooked cop. Really, if you don't like this film, we can't be friends.",

Nathalie Portman's debut is to thank for the truly magnificent believability she gives to her role. Jean Reno, Danny Aiello are the other masters at work. Gary Oldman however plays the part of his life. Nothing is scarier than a lunatic who smiles at you. And he plays the part of the mentally deranged corrupt criminal so well that it is a joy to watch again and again.Seen \"Leon\" 10 times or more now and I keep loving it. Every time I think now I have seen it all, but it stays thrilling till the very end. And endearing. How does director Luc Besson do that? How does he make a serial killer so likeable? If I would just tell the story you wouldnt believe me. Objectively speaking this script makes no sense. None. Even a character in the movie who has to explain what has happened isnt believed. A hitman for the mob gets befriended with a young girl. That's the story in a nutshell. But that doesnt come close to what really happened. The story presented in a nutshell sounds sweet, doesnt it? But there are massive amounts of assasinations that take place in between scenes.How can that be sweet? But it can be, because the violence in \"Leon\" is presented as if it were a game of playing cowboys and indians. That \"funny\" tarantino kind of violence in \"Leon\" is produced by a frenchman who came to America: director Luc Besson. This man has an odd talent: he mixes humor and childlike innocence on the one hand with brutal violence on the other hand. And somehow it works. The violence is cartoonlike and funny, but still suspensefull and realistic. Just as in Quentin Tarantino's work. You can laugh about the violent crimes in \"Pulp Fiction\" but you still take Samuel L. Jackson seriously. Oh I could go on and on about this movie. Never felt a bigger urge to write about so many different aspects in a review as with \"Leon\". Because it is extraordinary unique in script and excecution by the director. I think that \"Leon\" is Luc Besson's masterpiece. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly performed.

The action sequences are thrilling, the cinematography is appealing, and the atmosphere is intriguing. Jean Reno as L\u00e9on is great. Danny Aiello as Tony is great. Natalie Portman is also fantastic, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Natalie Portman was 12 years old (give or take a year) when this was filmed. She portrays a 12 year old girl named Mathilda. Throughout the film, she wears skimpy, tight fitting clothes, and repeatedly expresses her \"love\" for L\u00e9on. Although L\u00e9on acts as somewhat of a father figure to her, she makes it clear that she doesn't just see him as a father figure. To put it simply, Mathilda, a very troubled 12 year old girl, wants to bang this middle aged man who is her caretaker. Badly. And this movie isn't subtle about it.It wouldn't be the first time that a young girl had inappropriate feelings towards an older man. The problem is how this film never really addresses the inappropriateness of it. L\u00e9on rejects her advances rather lamely, and never explicitly does so for the right reason (SHE'S TWELVE).Let's not forget that the director of this movie dated a girl when she was 15 years old, and got her pregnant at 16.There's more that can be said about how gross all of that is, but there's more to complain about so I'll move on.Gary Oldman's character is a cartoon villain. He's silly. His performance is good, but his character is so over-the-top that it's laughable.The plot is quite simplistic. That's not horrible in and of itself, but this film is a sandwich of a basic revenge story (that's the bread) and a very inappropriate love story (that's the filler). There's a lot more filler than bread, too.",

            "content": "This film, Leon the Professional, is a very strong and powerful film. It's thought-provoking, but emotional. What I liked about this film the most is how we truly feel for the characters. The scenes that we got to know these characters are great since we learn what kind of people they are. I loved how they try to play out the relationship between Leon and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mathilda.Luc Besson's film, which is his first American film, is about a hit-man named Leon who reluctantly takes in a girl whose family just got murdered by a corrupt DEA agent and his cronies. Wishing for revenge, Mathilda is tutored on how to kill in order for her to unleash her anger.The acting is very good. Jean Reno is very convincing as Leon and after watching this film, I believe this is his signature film. Making her film debut, Natalie Portman is great and really brings substance to her 12-year-old self. Finally, Gary Oldman is always amazing and he delivers one of his best performances. I love him as a villain and his Beethoven-loving character broadens him yet again.Overall, this is a great film that packs a punch and delivers the goods. One would expect this to be an action or gangster film, but it's more of a character study with more subtle moments. Not to say that there isn't any hardcore action, but the emotional punch this movie gives is what gives this film a heart. I rate this film 10/10.",

I have no words to describe him more but all I can say, he is a talented Moroccon actor out there! Natalie Portman looked so young for 11 years, I was surprised to see she did smoked in some scene. The scenes seeing her did seem light instead of hanky panky. I wouldn't have thought her character Matilda and the assassin Leon would actually make out in the movie. It would make it totally sensitive for some viewers. I personally, think it would give me a cringe and feel shocked that Hollywood would go that far. Anyways luckily it didn't happen!It was good to see Gary Oldman, he really does a bad guy so good! His role in this actually reminded me when he was in the 1992 version of Dracula. He really gave an outstanding success as a bad dude very much so. Very good actor!I'm definitely gonna put this as my favorite movie list because literally, my jaw was done to the ground the whole time watching this, and I extremely enjoyed it!I would recommend people who haven't seen this, just watch it!",

            "content": "Generally a love story about a 40 year old man who lives by himself and a 12 year old girl would go down about as well as a porkpie at a Jewish wedding with cries of paedophilia from far and wide.  However Leon is just that - a love story, everything else is incidental or situation, and has become a modern classic.What makes this work is that Leon is the 40 year old but appears more naive and childlike, while Mathilda is the grown up in a 12 year old's body - a modern version of Lolita.  The love between them is a pure love, like the relationship between two children, where Leon protects Mathilda and cares for her and Mathilda provides a life that fills the cold existence of Leon's hitman-focused lifestyle.Portman is excellent in this role - she has yet to do anything better, Reno is well cast and handles the opening up of his character in a very believable fashion - he is totally convincing as a killer and a nervous child making friends for the first time.  Oldman overacts like a madman!  If you look closely at his shirt sleeves you'll see his cuff links are actually pineapple rings because he's such a big ham!  His performance doesn't sit well beside the others and he seems to be in a different movie at times. However he does bring a cold killer element with it that works well and offsets his eccentricities.A classic love story, look beyond the guns at the two central performances and you'll see one of the most beautiful relationships in modern films.  The ending will fill you with happiness and break your heart in equal measure.",

            "content": "Professional assassin L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) ends up with an impromptu foster daughter when he recues Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from corrupt cops who massacre her family while searching for stolen drugs. Mathilda vows revenge and pressures Leon to teach her his deadly trade. Reno is great as the efficient but almost child-like killer, who drinks milk, cherishes his houseplant, learns to read, and ultimately ends up showing his young charge how to kill people, and Portman, who was only 12 when the film was made, is outstanding as a pubescent 'avenging angel wannabe'. On the other end of the gun barrel is Oldman's 'doped-up-psycho-cop' character, but the film has a bit of a fantasy feel to it so his sometimes screechingly over-the-top delivery works (IMO). L\u00e9on and Mathilda's off-beat, asymmetrically innocent relationship is developed beautifully and the story plays out to a great, if somewhat predictable, end. Apparently Besson's original screenplay was sort of a 'Lolita with guns', but Reno and Portman (or maybe her parents) nixed the idea of L\u00e9on becoming romantically entangled with 12 year old Mathilda and Reno was careful to play the part to minimise the chance that the audience would misinterpret the relationship. All in all, a memorable action film (with a great poster) from the '80s. Some of the stories about young Portman's introduction to the world of film make for interesting reading.

            "content": "This is Luc Besson's first American movie, and has been listed by some as simply brilliant. The Professional is far better than a lot of movies, especially with the characters, but did not come out as I expected. Still, I really enjoyed this movie, and still stick to my opinion that Luc Besson is an awesome director, which is not surprising as he is French.This movie is about a cleaner, or hit-man, name Leon (Jean Ruso) who is very good at his job. He is an illiterate loner who only knows how to kill people. He rescues a 12 year old girl, Matilda (Natalie Portman), whose family is all killed by a corrupt DEA official named Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Matilda's father beat her and her sister and mother did not care about her, so she wasn't concerned about that, the thing that made her angry was that they killed her four year old brother, and for that act of brutality, she wants to see them dead.This movie delves into the mind of Leon. We see how he lives well by himself and how the appearance of this girl changes his life. In one scene we see Leon return from a kill with a bullet wound, and we know that this came from the fact that Matilda has changed his life. This relationship is interesting and Besson is portraying it as a father daughter relationship, yet the participants do not understand it. Leon is a man who is completely out of touch with society while Matilda is blinded by desire for vengeance and still childish beliefs. When she says that she is in love with Leon, it is obvious that she does not truly understand her feelings.The main premise behind this movie is how the introduction of this child into Leon's world changes his life and civilises him. Something that he fears at the start becomes something that he adores.",

The protagonist is an Italian hit-man with nerves of steel, grace of a panther and the killing instinct of a great white shark, played with subtle grace by Jean Reno. The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but a by the numbers 90's action flick.Jean Reno is perfectly cast as the title character Leon. As is Gary Oldman as a crooked DEA Agent Norman Stansfield. In her first acting role, a young Natalie Portman is superb as the troubled Mathilda, showing her early potential that would one day win her an Oscar for 'Black Swan' And finally Danny Aiello is as watchable as he always is. As the story proceeds, one by one Leon and Mathilda bond, as he cuts down the ranks of their numbers. Luc Besson's direction keeps the action moving at a steady pace and as the movie builds, traditional concepts of right as wrong are slowly destroyed. Besson is saying life is not so clean cut, and it leads to an inevitable climax in which Leon and Stansfield finally come face to face. Where Besson doesn't state his message, he makes his audience feel it.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Oldman gives the best performance of his career here, achieving an intensity and energy in to his role that truly gave me the creeps at times. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Not to be out done Jean Reno, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years, also provides a career high as the gentle hit-man. Although tough and crafty when he is working, he is almost child like, he is sensitive, he can be embarrassed and feels fear. Reno's likability excuses the unpleasant violence his character uses.This was a stunning first performance for Portman and she deservedly got loads of praise and attention for it. It was a great platform for her career (The year after this, she would again be superb as Al Pacino's troubled, suicidal step daughter in 'Heat'.) Whilst she was just a child when this was made, today she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.With perfect casting and a good story, this was always going to be a winner. Luc Besson's directing of his own story is exceptionally good, his work has energy, wit, visual flair and the breath of life in it, that has been missing in most of his work between then and now. Eric Sena's score is another valuable asset to the movie. Leon is a highly professional (no pun intended) piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.",

A tale about an orphaned girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who happens to fall under the wing of a seasoned yet somewhat simple-minded assassin, L\u00e9on (Jean Reno). From there, an unexpected friendship blooms.What I like the most is the atmosphere. The world of this film is cruel. Officials are corrupt, you cannot trust your own parents, everyone is willing to look the other way and as a whole there's not much hope to be had. Yet the film's tone doesn't reflect that. Many of its scenes are lighthearted, perhaps a bit naive, but ultimately optimistic. In a lesser film this dichotomy would bother me, but here it works. Its part of the message, that there are pockets of goodness to be found, that not all bad men are evil, just like not all so called angels are good.The camera-work is also excellent, the pacing flawless and the characters are interesting. I must admit that I didn't find the story to be as captivating as I was led to believe, but I blame the hype, not the movie. The ending was also somewhat of a letdown, but it just means it wasn't my cup of tea, not that there was anything wrong with it.L\u00e9on is classic for a reason and rightfully considered to be Luc Besson's masterpiece.

            "content": "The Professional is a super charged action piece, an exhilarating violent ride, riveting and terrifying, especially in it's first twenty minutes, with an explosive almost, hard to top ending, that truly blew me back against the wall of the cinema. It's a cinematic movie treat. If you can remember, a year and a half before, came The Assassin, too, a good movie, but this one has more intensity, but still qualifies for an 8. This is also Natalie Portman's first acting gig, and it's a role I'll never forget. When you watch her, you'll see why this was a star in the making, who blossomed with every role. Just check out, her next role in Heat. When Matilda/Portman's family is slaughtered by a force of corrupt cops, lead by DEA agent, Stansfield (Oldman in a perfected piece of villainy) she takes refuge, with a hit-man Leon (Reno) who lives down the hall. One truly intense moment has her pleading for him to open the door, the corrupt force in the close behind, realizing their missing one member of the slaughtered family, you are silently pleading too. The two form a friendship and an alliance, with Reno taking Matilda under his wing, teaching her, the avid prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the art of taking bad guys out, by use of sniper tactics, and other skills required to make the grade of a real hit-man. Leon is the closest thing, Matilda has come to a family for a long time, as if not counting the little brother, his murder sight wisely spared, the rest of her adopted family, weren't saints. The father was a boozing scumbag, the main objective at the hands of this dirty force. The mother (Ellen Page, of all people) is a cheap tart, and Matilda's older podgy sister, who works out, was a bitch. Oldman, too is unforgettable here, who just shows you how versatile he can be, one of the most underrated and unappreciated actors, like Nick Nolte, I've ever seen in my life. What I truly loved about The Professional was just the friendship that developed between Matilda and Leon, and how it played out. One scene having Matilda play dress up, and Reno trying to guess the acted out star and vice versa, I really loved. The build up of friendship and trust between impulsive kid and wise adult is mostly what Act 2 rides on. It's thin, but we can forgive this, because the friendship really involves us, and there really are some funny moments, created ny the two. We see a much more human side of a hit-man too, as Leon is not your ordinary hit-man. He's an ordinary average Joe, you'd pass on the street. He doesn't even act like a hit-man, the sort of guy who doesn't eat out, or live it up. But at first glance, as by example of his work, in it's opening, we really fear him, as a guy you do not mess with. He's a guy who'll find you, no matter where you hide. Danny Aiello who play's Reno's close friend, is only in a couple of scenes, one a weird dream sequence involving him and Oldman, where of course, you first think the scene is real. His short but memorable screen time is appreciated. The climax to The Professional reminded a lot of the one in The Specialist, but here it was beautiful. The Professional uses less scenes than it could of had, and that's a plus, as it's pulled off beautifully in ones 95's cool action pieces, with one tragic, thunderstruck ending.",

            "content": "Unlikely friendships are often the focus of great film and literature as far back as Huck Finn and Jim. Luc Besson's film \"The Professional\" gives unlikelihood a whole new meaning as its focus is on a professional hit-man and a troubled, 12-year-old girl. Naturally there's a lot these two can learn from each other and probably a lot they shouldn't, but it all makes for interesting and compelling material.Leon, played by Jean Reno, is a highly skilled, elusive hit-man who works for an Italian mob leader. He's also an immigrant with no means of being completely self-sufficient (he can't read or write and doesn't keep his own finances). He also lives in a run-down NYC apartment next to a family with an abusive, dope-dealing father. When the father gets into trouble, a psychotic and corrupt cop (Oldman) has his whole family taken out. Only Mathilda (Portman), the youngest daughter, survives. With nowhere to go when she's supposed to be dead, she turns to Leon.Leon and Mathilda form a unique bond. Both Reno and Portman are perfect in their roles. Leon is a creature of habit whose sensitive side comes out in caring for this young girl and Portman portrays both the beauty and innocence of a 12-year-old girl who at the same time is highly motivated by vengeance and a sense of inescapable maturity. You can certainly see why Portman was destined to be a successful actress. Mathilda's persistence to learn Leon's craft and his acceptance eventually is a bit disturbing and hard to grasp at first, but the more time they spend together, the more you love their relationship. You get a sense for how sweet Mathilda is and how good-hearted Leon, an assassin, can be. Besson also focuses on both actors' strongest trait: their eyes, which are highly communicative of these ideas.The complications that arise when Mathilda tries to seek her own vengeance against Oldman's character further complicates the nature of this unlikely friendship, exposing it for how dangerous it is, but also testing its merit--showing us how strong it can be. The action scenes that arise from this plot are also sure to satisfy those who want \"The Professional\" to deliver on that end, even if it's far from the focus. It's really about this friendship and to be honest, there could have been even more from the two of them: it was almost as if (and it may be the case) the American release was stripped in places by producers to emphasize the action pieces for fear the film couldn't thrive on the relationship element.Oldman is another piece that shouldn't go unmentioned. Though his character isn't given much depth to warrant high acclaim, Oldman is quite terrifying in his own way. It certainly offers explanation for his slew of villain roles in the 90s.Besson has really given all of us gun-toting-movie lovers something to chew on here, which is really the film's greatest achievement. While countless crime dramas, thrillers and action films glorify the gun, Besson shows it for how terrifying it is, even if he does have to use Hollywood elements at times to keep the film's pace up. \"The Professional\" really has it's own special place in the wide array of assassin films.",

These are the ingredients of L\u00e9on: The Professional, and they combine to make quite the tasty dish.This is definitely an action movie, but it's the non-action parts that make it so memorable. Most of them are between L\u00e9on and Mathilda. When he first passes her on the stairs with her cigarette and bruises, or when he takes her up on the roof overlooking Central Park for her first real lesson. Scenes like these add a real emotional gravity to the movie, which 75% of action flicks either don't even bother with, or give a half-hearted attempt at, at best. A lot of people may focus on only the violent or seemingly exploitative aspects of the film, but that means that they're missing out on something much deeper.As for flaws, Gary Oldman takes over-acting to a whole new level in this movie. Occasionally, that kind of thing is okay (or even a plus), but not here. This isn't The Fifth Element. He was too wacky to feel sinister or dangerous. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie that is worth adding to anyone's collection.",

Amazingly enough The Professional was the best work done by these four thespians: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello AND Gary Oldman.

The on screen chemistry between Reno and Portman is unforgettable. Their relationship is what makes it work but the real star is Gary Oldman. He is phenomenal repeat phenomenal. His over the top performance is the best of his entire career and earned his character Agent Norman Stansfield the number 6 spot on the Entertainment Weekly's all time greatest villains list.I have read the reviews of the two people in the world who didn't like this film and it doesn't take long to figure out why they didn't like it. The first didn't have a clue about what the movie was really about (readers can draw their own conclusions about that person's mental capacity) and the other somehow arrived at the erroneous conclusion that director Luc Besson is a sellout. I'm not going to bother to respond to that. The acting was top drawer for such a small budgeted film, the dialogue was remarkable and there is enough action to keep you entertained.

            "content": "Not every day you see a film that shows, as its opening credits, the actors who star in it, the composer of its score and its writer and director. Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's \"L\u00e9on\". Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.Taking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after \"L\u00e9on\", all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director. \"L\u00e9on\" is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though \"Le grand bleu\" takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job. The style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from \"Nikita\") putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character. You see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and/or psychological disorders: he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like \"Singing in the rain\". His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie \"Danny the Dog\", shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.The other relationship Besson writes and details in \"L\u00e9on\" is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in \"The Piano\") that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being. I want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so L\u00e9on can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then L\u00e9on does John Wayne. This is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's L\u00e9on is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living. In that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves. The movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like \"Le grand bleu\") and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his.",

            "content": "Where to begin?I put Natalie Portman's performance in this movie alongside Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense as one of the best acting jobs by a preteen in any movie, ever. The reason is this: when a child has a lead role in a movie that he/she would not be old enough to see in a theater, you know that it would take a superior performance to truly stand out. And Natalie does not disappoint.*SPOILERS AHEAD*One scene says it all - she returns from the grocery to find her family massacred and the cops who did it still there. Trying not to show how visibly shaken he is, she keeps walking to Leon's door as if it's her own, and her plaintive whimpering for him to let her in nearly made my heart rip in two.Until that moment, Leon had the luxury of keeping the rest of the world outside his door, not getting involved in anyone's life (except to kill them). Initially, he is resistant to having this young waif invading his comfort zone; he even contemplates killing her while she slept! But we know that Leon, like the rest of us, will fall under Mathilda's spell; she's too beautiful, too alone and too in need of a protector for Leon not to fall in love with her.Much has been made about Luc Besson's using a 12-year-old girl as a sexual icon, but that's subject to broad interpretation in my opinion. Twelve is precisely the age that most young girls discover their ability to draw the eyes of men (of ANY age), and I applaud Mr. Besson for embracing that fact instead of acquiescing to the vagaries of political correctness. Is \"Lolita\" a great work of literature or simply child pornography? Girls that age have always been, and will always be, desired by older men. Call it what you will: reprehensible, disgusting, perverted; but that doesn't make it less true.Gary Oldman has built his career on playing villains, and few play them as well as he. Whether a scene calls for him to be quietly menacing or deliciously over-the-top, he can do it. The Professional, Dracula, Hannibal, The Fifth Element... he brings a dramatic flair to his bad guys that makes him stand apart from many who play movie villains.I don't know what substance it was that Gary's character took (perhaps someone will tell me?), but whatever it was, it set him into an altered state of consciousness wherein killing an entire family was akin to conducting a symphony orchestra. And hearing him scream \"EVERYYYYONNNEEEEE!!!\" sent chills up my spine!And last but not least, Jean Reno as Leon, the title character, was perfectly done. Speaking English with a thick enough accent that we were JUST able to understand what he was saying, Jean was able to infuse a depth of character into Leon with seemingly very little effort. Mathilde, in a very short time, transforms Leon from cold remorseless killer into a valiant avenging angel. We want so badly for them to make that daring escape and have that happy ending that they deserve, but we all know deep down that it just wasn't going to happen.In the final scene, when Mathilde replants Leon's beloved potted plant in the yard of her boarding school, we are left with such a sense of not only happiness but sadness as well, which is accentuated by the haunting strains of Sting's \"Shape of My Heart\", the perfect ending to a fabulous movie.My score: 10.",

It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term \"silent killer\".

Also, the plot has a few other changes added to it which makes it seem more interesting and original than many other action films of the genre.After a young girl's family is murdered, she meets a hit man who takes her in and the two bond over their time together as they develop an odd friendship with each other.One thing good about it is that it doesn't consist entirely of non-stop repetitive action scenes. Large portions of the film are focused on establishing the chemistry and bonding of the 2 leads: Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman). At the beginning of the movie, Mathilda's whole family is murdered. Though she didn't like most of her family, the death of her 4-year old brother has a negative impact on her as he was the only one in her family who she cared about. Her bonding with Leon is an interesting plot point as he was one of the only people who she really cared about. The time they spend together made me grow an attachment to them.Because of this slightly risky choice, however, some people argued that Leon was a pedophile and Mathilda's character was too overly-sexualized. To some extent, I could see why someone would think that, but there are reasons for this. Mathilda came from a broken home where she had a burning hatred towards most of her family members. Leon was one of the only people that she cared for. Also, since she was 12, she was probably just starting to go through puberty and was just starting to discover her sexual feelings towards others. She even admitted to Leon that she was (or thought she was) falling in love with him. Despite her efforts to flirt with him, Leon thankfully refused her attempts and he chose to love her more as a father than to actually share a romance with her. I don't agree with these arguments that much and I think that the movie handled that plot point in the most appropriate way it could.Also, the acting is really great in this film. Most people usually mention how Natalie Portman gave a fantastic performance and I agree with that. It's hard to find a really good child actor in most films, but she was exceptional in her role. Even though I felt like she was a little annoying at times, those few scenes did not break all of the other scenes she was in where she was able to show different emotions very convincingly. She was able to go from a frightened young child to someone capable of killing so convincingly, it makes her relationship with Leon more realistic and plausible.Jean Reno gave an intense and solid performance too. None of his lines were ever cringeworthy and his face conveys a great myriad of numerous emotions and great sensitivity which in a way, made the action scenes slightly better. He did a good job in the movie, but I don't think that enough credit is going to Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman as Stansfield gave an exceptional role as the villain. He is able to look threatening just at the sight of him. Every time he's on screen, you feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense that something bad is about to happen. In one of the scenes when he confronts Mathilda in the bathroom, that scene is very tense not just because of the most obvious reason, but because his performance gives the scene quite an unnerving feel to it. All 3 of them expertly carried the movie and I can't think of any other actors or actresses who would better fit their roles.Unfortunately, however, like many other action movies I've seen, I felt that one viewing was enough for me. At its core, it is a pretty genuine action movie and I felt like it didn't provide enough that made me want to revisit it for future viewings since I was already aware of what happened in it. My reason for this has a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't too engaged by its action scenes. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" has extremely absorbing action so I wanted to revisit that one after I watched it, but I can't say the same about this one. Is this point subjective? Yes, but I can't help the fact that I feel this way.In conclusion, this was a very great movie. I do feel like one viewing is enough for me, but that's not to say that it's a bad movie by any means. It contains original and interesting plot points, characters which I cared for, and outstanding acting performances for the 3 main leads. It is a great movie, and I'm glad that I checked it out. I can understand why so many people like this film.",

I didn't even recognize her as the same dis-engaged pretty face that she has become. Okay, do I really have to write ten lines about the film? I highly recommend it based on Portman's performance alone. Also, the interaction between her character Mathilda--a twelve-year-old--and Jean Reno's Leon is at once touching and horrifying, given the nature of the material. Is Leon criticizing Mathilda for talking to the boy in the street and her liberal use of profanity as a father-figure, or because he's training her to be the \"professional cleaner\" she wants to become. Portman really does steal the show, though. Her ease with delivering her lines, many quite profane and vulgar, is amazing. Entertaining without being vacuous, this is a fine movie.",

It's brilliantly scripted and directed, and superbly paced...long periods of calm, leading up to bursts of intense action. The humour works well, too.Jean Reno is absolutely top-notch as Leon, the awkward, shy guy who becomes an invisible killing machine whenever he goes to work, and exhibits a sort of childish glee when watching Gene Kelly on the big screen. He's funny, deep, mature and childlike all at the same time, and it's a pleasure to watch.Nat, too, is simply amazing. It's her first movie, and she's only around twelve or thirteen, but I don't think she's given a more accomplished performance since (at least, not in a movie I'm willing to watch). The bit where she's standing at Leon's door sobbing her little eyes out kills me every time.It's nice to see Gary Oldman playing a villain for once ;). He's in peak form here, as a linen suit-wearing, pill-popping, Beethoven-loving, ultra-violent sociopath. He's a total nut-bag, but very cool with it. Even when he's slaughtering innocent women and children, you can't help but like him.Or, is that just me...?Eric Serra's score actually WORKS this time. In some movies I find all that weird, French, electronic stuff distracting. Not here.I'm trying to think of bad points about this film, but can't come up with any. I guess that says it all really.",

I found it touching that a hit-man could find it in his heart to make room for an abused, lost little girl, after her whole family was shot to death by the great GARY OLDMAN. I am very proud of Gary because he did such a wonderful job portraying the drug addicted chief of police who loved to kill those who valued life. What a wicked character, and how extraordinary his acting skills are. Natalie was great in this film, and she was a mere child. Some people may think that a hit man would never come to the rescue of a child especially if she is not a relative, but that's the great lesson of this story. Jean's character, Leon, has the ability to shoot anyone for money, anyone that is except for women and children, and that, I find was a good twist. It was best said in the classic story \"BEOWULF.\" Beowulf says to Unferth, \"Yes, I do have evil in myself, but I do not let it out. Even evil people can do good.

Also, I wasn't keen on the ending.It's definitely a different story in most respects which is refreshing and as a film of this genre, personally I am glad that it was as tame as it was, even with its 18 rating. Gun fights I can cope with, but some of the stuff towards the beginning could have been a bit grim and the relationship could have been very sick indeed, but it's quite a surreal little tale and could almost be a comedy. A 12 year old who makes friends with an assassin and has visions of becoming one herself. It would make a great late night cartoon following 'Rick & Morty' or 'South Park'.All in all, it's done well and I don't know what it could have done to impress me more. It doesn't really suit my typical tastes anyway, I'm more romance, comedy and sci-fi, but I think that I may have put too much pressure on it to blow me away, having seen it on so many lists of great films.

So does it hold up with today's standard? Answer: Are you messing with me the flick rocks and here is why!The movie is a pulp or Hard Boiled film through and through. For disclaimer, Hard Boiled/Pulp movies are the crime stories in which a character faces an traumatic event and after that he or she tries to accomplish his or her goals. Also the story takes place in a urban environment, which has seen better days and as for the characters everything goes from corrupted cops to assassins with hearts of gold and anything in between. Just to make it crystal clean this stories are also detective stories but where the stories of Poirot, Sherlock Holmes etc take place in the aristocratic cycles of society , the Hard Boiled ones are more everyday stories , some examples of those stories are Dirty Harry, Sin City,Pulp Fiction and Leon.To our main story ,after the murder of her family twelve year old Matilda(Natalie Portman) is taken under the wind of the professional assassin Leon (Jean Reno) and form an unusual friendship in which Matilda learn the trick of the job. Apart of the amazing performance of Portman, Oldman(from corrupt cop to Comissioner Gordon, wow what a change) and of course Reno the film rocks because it is character-based and not action-based and it deserves the cult status it has.When a crime movie,comic or TV series is based of its cast then though it is harder to make a good action scene, it packs more for you had become invested to the character and you care who lives or dies. Just think that in the first Taken, how much you were nervous about Liam Neeson's character when he tried to find where is his daughter and how bored you were by the Taken 2 and 3 in which the story exist only for Neeson to kill some and not watch his character evolve over time. In the end Leon is a must watch for every person who loves a good crime story and as cult classics go this is one of the best in the area.

Now I realize that 'The Professional' is the most overrated movie on this entire Top250 list. An 8.6! That is absurd! Do not get me wrong, this movie is so great. Gary Oldman is my favorite actor. This is maybe his best performance. All of his scenes are fantastic. It is all of the scenes without Gary Oldman that I have a problem with. What is so 8.6 great about the give and take between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman's characters, which essentially dominates the film. Those scenes are sort of boring. The story is too over the top too, and the things that happen and the things that the characters do seem too unbelievable. The action is not all that believable either, although it is very well done. As great as Gary Oldman's character is in this movie, he does not elevate it enough to be listed as a top 30 movie of all-time. I am laughing at that rating. This flick should be in that 7.9 to 8.2 realm, not 8.6! I would truly give this movie an 8 out of 10 rating, it was an awesome action-drama, but I got to give it a flat 1 out of 10, just because so many people drastically overrate this film.According to the Top250, 'The Professional' is better than 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Aliens', 'The Departed', 'L.A.

Besson loudly declares himself to the world with this work, makes the audience be chained to the screens. And it catches everything: the plot, the acting, the music, the atmosphere.Actor Jean Renaud is very famous. His tired look is always recognizable. And here his hero, despite the sadness on his face, goes to his goal, he is dangerous and, it seems, invulnerable. But confidence, composure, lack of pity suddenly crumble into dust when he meets a little girl and gets into her feelings. And the actor perfectly shows how his character is changing.This film opened for me one of my favorite actresses - Natalie Portman. Today she is known all over the world. And not without reason. The actress is very talented. And this picture is a great start, which helped her already at such a young age to show an excellent game. Natalie plays little Matilda, a little naive, not knowing the world around her yet, but insightful and, as we see, able to melt the ice even of a ruthless killer. And now these two lonely people find a kind of shelter in each other's company.The atmosphere is wonderful, the unique style is sustained. Although all the pernicious boils of society in the form of drugs, murders, crimes are present around the characters, Besson competently weaves all this into the picture, not making a bright emphasis on this, but telling a completely different dramatic story.\"Leon\" is a great film by a competent director who helped at least two actors show their skills in an extraordinary story, probably even a love story. Everyone will see their own. One thing cannot be taken away - the picture does not lose its relevance today and looks timeless.7 out of 10.",

Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer. Only false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional.

In that scene, you hear the heartbeats of the close man and this makes you nervous. Leon gets close to him and put the knife on the men's neck. His heartbeats stops and there are no sound at that time. I gasped at this scene. Matilda, the heroine of this film, is also a lonely although she has a family. Leon refuses her offer to practicing killing at first, but he cherishes her little by little. They spend the time not only practicing killing but also playing and studying and eating. The scenes of Matilda disguises herself as various famous persons is one of my favorite scenes. Of course she is cute, but Leon, wondering who Matilda is imitating is also so cute. They are not on good terms at first. But Leon buys pretty clothes to Matilda. Matilda teaches reading and writing to Leon. They squirt water at each other...they look like real father and daughter day by day. Gary Oldman is one of main characters in this film. He is a merciless man and I was very disgusted at the way he speaks and acts! I hope Leon or Matilda kill him as soon as possible throughout. The climax scene when Oldman mobilizes all the troops is so exciting. The camera-works of this scene is marvelous. I re-winded a film and watched this scene many times. It is very thrilling. When Leon lets Matilda go, I feel very sad. Leon's survival relieves me but at last he dies.

You could put this film alongside any modern thriller and it's stands the test of time and although 24 years old it's not dated at all.Jean Reno is excellent the the role of assassin and the very young Natalie Portman plays the orphan child so so well which I guess added to her repertoire would serve her well for future film casts and has.It's a great thriller which is on medium burn and coasts along just nicely. The story is great and has a little twist or two and an explosive start and end.Overall a truly great film, great acting and a feasable storyline given the location it's set in.",

The Original score, Editing, Performances, Direction and every aspect of the movie is so well that its hard to look for negative points.The Movies portrays Action/Crime/Emotions wonderfully.And its not over violent nor fake (like in todays Hollywood flicks) the movie is authentic.I have to agree that it was Snubbed by all major Awards.I definitely will recommend this to every one, Its entertaining, touching and a very nice 128 minute experience.",

            "content": "\"L\u00e9on. What is it exactly that you do for a living?\"\"I'm a cleaner.\"\"You mean you're a hit-man.\" So says the street-wise Natalie Portman as 12-year-old Mathilda and she is so breathtakingly astute and tough that it just breaks my heart. L\u00e9on tells the story of this young girl as she seeks the help of a professional hit-man named L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) to avenge her family after they are killed by a corrupt division of the FBI, lead by none other than Gary Oldman. Mathilda forms an unusual bond with L\u00e9on probably because they contrast and complement each other; Mathilda is mature and street-wise and L\u00e9on is almost childlike (he drinks milk and he can't read).Zooming in on the tough, gritty crime-infested streets of New York, Luc Besson adds his own street edge (probably from the streets of Paris, \u00e1 la Nikita) to the film and this gives it a European feel and style. It blends this with some American elements like humour and gangster characters. L\u00e9on is a well-crafted and completely gripping thriller that above all features some truly memorable acting performances, in particular from Gary Oldman as cruel FBI-agent Stansfield.The relationship between the 12-year-old Mathilda and the middle-aged hit-man L\u00e9on feels inappropriate on more than one occasion. Like when he sees her talking to a teenage boy outside the restaurant and he storms out and tells her that she can't talk to just anyone (showing more emotion than at any other part in the film). Less than a minute later into the following scene, Mathilda is laying on his bed and says: \"L\u00e9on. I think I'm falling in love with you. It's the first time for me.\" Creepy? Yes. Gripping? Yes.The whole film has a creepy but gripping tone, Gary Oldman bringing forth the creepiness in his character and the gripping part being the struggle of Mathilda. It has some flaws but overall an excellent film. 8/10",

            "content": "\"Leon: The Professional\" is a great movie from 1994. The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie L\u00e9on (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie. I gave it 10 stars. Dale Haufrect",

Soon, she finds out hid profession and seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother......No matter how many times you see this film, one cannot deny the power of it's themes.Yes, we can all balk at the fact that Mathilda has a 'thing' for the titular character, but it's a lot deeper than that. Here is a girl who has had no real affection or love, from her family. Yes, we can argue that she has her brother to begin with, but she has had no one to look up to, no one to give her approval, and most of all, no one to respect.This is why her feelings are mixed with Leon. She is a confused little girl, in a big world, pretty much reflecting Leon, who is a lost soul too. He also has no one to show affection to, or receive affection from, apart from the movies he sees, hence the dressing up scene being one of the most touching scenes in the whole film.Oldman steals the movie from everyone though, and it's probably his most unhinged performance to date, spitting out every piece of scenery he chews on.So all in all, it's an undeniable masterpiece, Besson's most perfect movie, and to think, this was a side project whilst he was developing The Fifth Element.",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 33I think a big part of why this film was so good is that it could've been so bad. Consider the alternate film this may have been: an icy, one- dimensional hit-man somehow pairs with a bratty young girl to face a drugged police character in this summer's brainmelting blockbuster.But it's not that. It came out as Leon: The Professional.Leon is a special film. It channels classics like Taxi Driver, Batman, and many many New York films but has its own unique identity. Part thriller, part drama, the film is touching and exciting, and reels you in from its stellar first scene and takes you for a fantastic adventure.The story, while having the possibility of being off-putting, works. Sure you can question the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (depending on the cut of the film you saw, I saw the International cut and everything was fine), but I found it more reasonable than say the relationships in Doctor Zhivago and Lolita. Anyway, the story- it's original and takes many turns, but stays on track and never slows without reason.A story only goes so far: the biggest success of Leon is its 3 main characters. Jean Reno IS Leon, I can't see anyone doing any better. As the cold, solitary hit-man who is handed a very different responsibility, we grow to love Leon with his quirky persona of houseplant caring, movie watching and chair sleeping. He is an iconic character with his sunglasses and low voice. His developed duality is remarkable to behold.Leon is complimented by the fiery Mathilda played by the extraordinarily young Natalie Portman, the smoking, swearing kid who grew up with a tough life. As unbelievable as her choices may seem on paper, I totally got behind her reasoning and never found her to do anything horribly distasteful. The duo of killer father and eager daughter is one of the greatest in film.That leaves the sick Stansfield as the target of the duo's revenge. Played by Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of all time, the psychotic, pill-popping shady cop is truly despicable, with his scenes of drug consumption and Beethoven rant to be extremely unsettling.The bread and butter of film is great. There are many shots that I found interesting and unique, and the cinematography and editing is all top notch. The music, decidedly the most French thing about the whole film, is juxtaposed to anything happening on-screen and helps make the film's identity, especially in the bonding scenes between Leon and Mathilda.There is a double-edged sword about the film. We see Leon's killer side, and we see him as an awkward caregiver, like in the dress-up game. This mix keeps the audience guessing and keeps the film entertaining. It all culminates in a poetic ending that couldn't be any better or more satisfying.From start to finish, Leon is awesome. It has artistic credibility, awesome action scenes, great characters and acting, as well as the brick and mortar that makes film work. I had never heard of it before seeing the Top 250, and I don't know why it isn't bigger. See this film!9.4/10",

            "content": "Written and directed by French filmmaker Luc Besson, \"Leon: The Professional\" is thrilling hit-man movie on the outside, but a touching friendship story on the inside. The movie begins with Leon, portrayed by Jean Reno, a hit-man who takes in a 12-year-old girl named Mathilda, portrayed by a young Natalie Portman in her feature film debut, whose family has been murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, portrayed by Gary Oldman. With the help of a friendly mobster, by Danny Aiello, and this weird 12-year-old girl, Leon will try his best to protect from this corruptive agent. \"Leon: The Professional\" is a mixture of action and heartwarming drama. This movie takes us on explosive action scenes, while warming our hearts with the friendly chemistry between Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno delivers the best performance of his career as the milk-obsessed hit-man. Natalie Portman makes a pretty-well portrayal for her big-screen debut. Gary Oldman steals the show as the murderous and mischievous agent of corruption. Danny Aiello makes a sweet and tough impression in his character, as well. The dialogue is sharp, the direction is well-managed, the acting is well-crafted, and the action scenes are thrilling. This movie also has a big heart, when talking about this unlikely friendship between this hit-man and a little girl. It's a cinema favorite for all you movie buffs. It has a well-crafted premise, and this is a movie that really works. This movie is definitely a must-watch. \"Leon: The Professional\", in my review, \"an impressive mob story, with unique elements\".",

            "content": "This movie is art in its purest state. It refuses to follow any boundaries of what should be done and what should not be done, what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. I have never seen a freer movie. It flies like a boundless bird above the mountains and hills and cities.The closest thing I can compare it to are those moments when the protagonist takes their love interest on a flight through the clouds. You the viewer are the love interest. The film is the dark and mysterious protagonist.But even looking past all that, and even looking past the mostly fantastic characters (Gary Oldman is hit-or-miss as the villain, but he does not ruin the film), this movie is fantastic because of its blend of art and action. Outside of MM: FR, I have never seen a movie that blends those two elements so gloriously. Under poor hands, art and action neuter each other. But under expert hands, they amplify each other and create something that will last, that deserves to last.I wish Besson would make another film this great, this beautiful.The first shot of the film is a pan shot over Central Park. Now, normally, this would be nothing more than a standard shot to show our setting, but they way they shoot it makes CP resemble a forbidden jungle or something of the sort, thus giving off the impression that this film will cover the dark and wild side of NYC. It is one of the best opening shots I've ever seen.Every time you think the story is going to zig, it zags. But nothing ever comes off as forced or contrived. In every good story, you are confident the creator knows what they're doing. I always got that feeling when I was watching this film. Combine that with the unconventionality I describes earlier and you have a truly beautiful piece of art.I'm willing to bet you'll feel uncomfortable at times when you're watching the film. This is not a bad thing. Art is not meant to keep you comfortable. It is meant to evoke and make you look at the world differently. There is nothing squicky enough to make any reasonable person turn off the film, but some of the interactions between the assassin and Natalie Portman can make some people shaky. Quickly: she grows to lust for him. He does not take advantage of that, but if you're turned off by such things, you're better off either not watching the film at all or watching the far inferior theatrical cut.This film is everything blockbusters want to be and everything they would never think of being. It is my favorite French film and one of my favorite foreign films. If you want a thoughtful and artistic yet adrenaline-pumping experience, go give it a watch.",

Considering it was released in 1994, and I only saw it for the first time in Autumn 2011, my first thoughts after watching Leon were: 'how have I not seen this masterpiece until now?'. It was truly one of the most mind-blowing Television experiences of my life.The plot itself is nothing spectacularly original- a deadly assassin (Leon played by Jean Reno) who keeps his business to himself in order to survive, fosters a young girl (Natalie Portman) whose family is executed because the father was hoarding drugs from a crazy drug-dealer (Gary Oldman) who is also a corrupt policeman. The young girl fortunately went to the shop while her family were massacred, and when she returns, she pleads to Leon to save her life. She discovers that Leon is secretly an assassin, and because she has lost her family, she asks Leon to teach her how to become an assassin so she can claim revenge on those responsible for murdering her family. In exchange, she offers to teach Leon to read and write and improve his social skills. (he is pretty much illiterate). Although at first he refuses her request, eventually he relents and teaches her the tricks of his trade.The three main actors in the film play their parts incredibly; Jean Reno as Leon plays his part so convincingly as an uneducated and detached assassin that you could almost believe that he is one in real life, Natalie Portman plays the mischievous, witty and headstrong young girl who seems older than her age with excellence,arguably her best performance that is only rivaled by her great performance in 'The Black Swan', and Gary Oldman portrays the psychotic drug-dealing policeman with such finesse only a few actors could pull off without spoiling the main villain of the story.What makes this film truly powerful to the eyes of the viewer is the bond between Leon and the girl- at first they are completely incompatible, but as they spend more time with one another, they become more versed in each others manners and skills, and become so in love with one another that they become inseparable, in lifestyle, and in their missions.I originally watched the un-cut version of the film, and after buying the film to discover it cut out several scenes, I was pretty disappointed. I can understand why- there were several scenes that were perhaps unsuitable for a young girl to be seen doing, but these scenes added great character and depth; they were included in the film for a great reason. What this film does excellently which few directors can imitate is deliver violence and explicit scenes with a perfect balance of seriousness and comedy. It brought both tears of joy and sadness to my eyes with equal measure. From beginning to end Leon never ceases to amaze and astonish. I cannot think of anything that could be changed or done to make 'Leon' a better film- it is a film that is as near to perfection as any film gets.",

            "content": "When you see Luc Besson's name on a film, you have to see it. Tu m'en diras les nouvelles !In one of Danny Aiello's greatest performances, he is Tony. Tony owns and operates a small caf\u00e9 but the real money comes from his sideline as an \"arranger\" for the various mobs.One of those is the Badge-toting Dapper Don Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his private crew, where he carries on his own sideline within the NYPD. The sideline being drugs and cold-blooded murder etc. not to mention some mysterious but explosive capsules with which he comes armed for that often needed \"super rush\".The star here is, of course, Jean Reno, aka L\u00e9on. L\u00e9on is not ra complete innocent. Rather, I believe he is simply immature. From conversations between Tony, L\u00e9on's mentor (and \" banker\", we gather that L\u00e9on was a lost kid on the streets of NY when Tony took him in and taught him his trade. The trade of assassination; that is. Clearly L\u00e9on took to that line of work readily because he is now well versed in every sort of weapon and explosive, most of which he carries with him beneath his large loose overcoat.Even here, I have a feeling that L\u00e9on isn't just a cold-blooded natural-born killer, but rather that Tony convinces L\u00e9on that his targets are very bad people and it is L\u00e9on's job to \"take care\" of them.The relationship between Tony and L\u00e9on is so unique that it's a story in itself. Tony treats L\u00e9on like a kid, doling out money as needed to pay the rent on his tiny tenement apartment, corn flakes and milk (apparently just about all Leon ever eats and drinks and the occasional movie where this loner goes and stares as if having a religious experience as he watches Gene Kelly sing and dance. His only friend is a leafy green plant for which he cares consciencially.When the ju ject of money comes up, Tony always reminds L\u00e9on that it's L\u00e9on's money. Tony is just the caretaker. Banks get involved with paperwork and taxes. Tony keeps it all in his head. No paperwork, and Tony assures L\u00e9on that he's not going anyplace, except to the kitchen and back.So while it's obvious to us that Tony is the one getting rich from Leon's work, we still feel that there's a warm relationship between them and in a pinch, Tony would always try to take care of Leon..Detective Stansfield on the other hand has one of his greatest performances as well. As the more than ruthless, drug-fuzzed detective, he doesn't mind - make that, actually enjoys - bumping people off, men, women, children and if one happened to pass by, maybe a dog or two as well.Living on the same floor as L\u00e9on, Matilda is a precocious 12-year-old abused child with hopeless parents. She often escapes to the inner balcony where she and L\u00e9on say, \"Hi\", in passing.Only her little brother is dear to her. When her drug-dealing dad can't come up with the money for Stansfield, he comes back with his crew and murders everyone including Matilda's little brother.\nThus begins another great relationship between Matilda and L\u00e9on. Although only twelve years old, Matilda tries to convince L\u00e9on that he should teach her \"the ropes\" so she can take revenge on Stansfield.Without including spoilers, I just have to say that the relationships between Leon and Tony, the relationship between Leon and Matilda, the relationships between all of them and Stansfield as well as the relationship between Matilda and Tony, all, each and every one of them, is a little story in itself and much more subtle than we're used to getting.We're just not used to subtle relationships. After all, this is a population that apparently believes TV ads that assure us that these are:: \"Real people, not actors\".Another point that has been criticized is that Stansfield seems so \"aware\" I'm certainly no expert, but I can certainly believe that when Stansfield pops those \"super \" capsules, they must heighten all his senses giving him almost extra-sensory feelings about those around him.I've seen this film several times and I enjoy it as mure or even more with each viewing. Best films so far for Monsieur Besson, Jean Reno, Danny Aiello, Gary Oldman and - well,what can we say about Natalie Portman?I have to admit that I haven't see any of her other films. Not because I wasn't blown away by Matilda, but I'm housebound so I only see what comes along.\nI may have reviewed L\u00e9on before but when I watched it last night, I had to say more about it.",

It's a crappily written film with a very very ridiculous premise. I'm occasionally ok with a ridiculous premise, but at other times I am annoyed by them. Leon is an annoying premise. How can I explain to you how annoying? I really am not sure how. All I can say is that the ending is worst then everything that goes before it. Oh and by the way, I have seen Oldham in about half a dozen films and he becomes more and more unimpressive. His over the top, super animated antics in this film, don't convince me of greatness.

She shows the complexity of a strong charactered abandoned girl in a seemingly effortless performance. Jean Reno is extraordinary as Leon, the killer who lives a life of paradox, between the violence of his employment and his apparent naivety.

With Leon however, he got it right.\nLeon (aka The Professional) is the story of Leon (Jean Reno), a lone hit man who lives a bohemian lifestyle, moving from one low rent apartment to the next whilst making his hits. But after his twelve year old neighbour (Natalie Portman) has her family wiped out by crooked cop Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) Leon is forced to take the girl under his wing and eventually both teach the other a little something about life. Leon is a fantastic action film; it has great characters, brilliant use of mise-en-scene and a chic Eric Serra score. It also has a heart, and at times the scenes can be quite touching, \"I wanna have roots, sleep in a bed, never be alone again Mathilda\" confesses Leon as he must make an important decision. The central message also has a lot of importance, as Stansfield says to Mathilda \"It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life\", this becomes clear for Leon, as he realises that this little girl is leading him into a situation that will be hard to get out of. I'd recommend this film to anyone, the final shoot out in the apartment is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen and the three leads (especially Reno and Oldman) are fantastic, and there's fine support from Danny Aiello as Leon's friend and advisor.Leon is a striking film too often ignored by the wannabe cinefile set who dismiss it as an exercise in style, too caught up with the likes of Goddard to expand their horizons to a new kind of film making. As action movies go, Leon is a cool, fast and unmistakably French affair... 10/10",

And although he isn't in this film as much as I would have liked, he performs superbly alongside other great actors in Jean Reno and Natalie Portman to bring this intriguing crime film to life.Reno stars as hit-man Leon who takes in young Natalie after her family is killed. There, she wants to learn the tricks of the trade.At first I wasn't too sure what was happening. A lot of different stories were taking place with many very different types of characters but as the film progressed I began to understand every character and appreciate each situation in which they were involved in.This film works really well in character development. The beginning of the film is well pitched to slowly introduce the characters gradually and as the situations progress; the audience can appreciate their unique situations. It is a truly marvellous character development film.Many crime films such as James Bond try to explore all the different types of genre in crime, action, thriller, spy and mystery. But Leon is very specific towards the spy genre. It doesn't go off exploring others which makes the film very unique. The specifics are wonderful, especially with the central protagonist in Leon, who is well suited to the role of hit-man. It allows the audience to appreciate the specific genre.The realism too works well as there are no over the top scenes with ridiculous car chases and questionable actions. It is all put together so well that it is understandable, energetic but quiet and most of all enjoyable.The acting by everyone involved is superb, none more so than young Natalie Portman who portrays the troubled child so well. Reno and Oldman also fit their roles so perfectly.The plot is slow moving, focusing on the characters extremely well and is a joy to watch. Watch out for \"the plant\" which is a lovely little side story.a must watch for all spy lovers :)",

The equal to Portmans work here is the excruciating character of Penny in the Lost in Space remake. Gary Oldhams performance is this achieves a new height; the height of idiocy.But the movie has much, much more wrong with it; namely the eroticization of a 12 year-old girl, in the movie and in the public reaction. This is deeply disturbing. An entire cult of straight weirdo's has sprung up who talk very heatedly about Portman in this movie. They consider her a nymphet like Lolita.

Most hitmen aren't so genial..Frankly, a lot of bad language & graphic violence in this entry, but Gary Oldman is worth the price of admission. His performance as a crooked, quirky cop is frightening. He showed his bad guy chops 2 decades ago in 'Fifth Element' & 'Air Force One'. More recently, he portrayed Churchill in 'Darkest Hour', but I marvel at his work as the quiet, honest cop, Gordon, in the Batman entries with Christian Bale. Oldman can play under-stated or over-stated, as the occasion requires. In this one, he's a raving loonie, guaranteed to make the weirdo dating your daughter look like a prize catch.If you read the IMDb trivia, you will learn that Oldman more or less improv'd a couple of scenes in L\u00e9on, for effect. He is an immensely unlikable character in this flick-ruthless & heartless-but you can't take your eyes off him anyway.Natalie Portman, in her 12-yr old rookie appearance, shines and Jean Reno, as the 'cleaner'-gunman who becomes obliged to mentor/protect Portman, is outstanding in a role similar to another 90'S flick, Wasabi, in which he played a tough French cop (I didn't say it was a nice cop). 9/10",

Expanding on themes first explored in his \"La Femme Nikita\", Luc Besson's \"Leon\" (aka \"The Professional\") is one the most potent, audacious action fantasies ever branded to celluloid. Primarily, it is a love story that walks a delicate generational line and supports its basic narrative with provocative imagery, beautifully staged action, and simmering erotic tension. Portman is quite incredible as the strong-willed Mathilda and is a joy to watch as she naively seduces Reno into agreeing to father her. Reno, as the simple, boyish Leon, is thoroughly convincing and engaging in a difficult, ambiguous role. Though set (but not totally shot) in New York, the film has a strong European flavor and mixes Hong Kong-style action with intimate, cool drama that is often very funny. Eric Serra's moody score is a major contributor to the film's unique tone while Bjork's sensational \"Venus As A Boy\" is a stunning counterpoint to the darkness swirling around the characters. The events of the film are not realistic and there is a strained logic one must ignore in order to buy into the stylized reality. The extended cut focuses more heavily on Leon teaching Mathilda the tricks of his trade and amps up the erotic tension with a drunken dinner scene. Superb.",

Women and children can be 'in peril' but shouldn't  be killed, especially not with the kind of gleeful sadistic intensity shown here. If you want to make a movie where women and children are goingto be the victims, then for me it's a different class of movie, not an action thriller. It goes without saying that the director's attribution of sexual characteristics to a 12-year old child - and the way he deliberately perverts the friendship between Leon and Mathilda in a sexual way - is deeply sick and utterly reprehensible.

Plus, Jean Reno's accent is clearly french (yet his character's name - Leon - sounds Italian or even Spanish).This film is also known by the alternative title 'Leon: The Professional'. Its title obviously refers to the film's main character: Leon, a professional hit-man (or \"cleaner\", as he says). Leon is a different kind of hit-man: he does his daily life like a normal person in some ways, he lives all alone, he enjoys watching Gene Kelly's musicals and at the same time he is eccentric to the point of having a houseplant as his best friend (LOL!).Leon, despite being a criminal, is actually pretty cool and likable. Besides, his french accent is cool and his voice is nothing of what you might think. The way he talks is usually very calm and cool and he rarely speaks aggressively.The movie takes place in Little Italy, an area in New York City. The modern scenario is one of its qualities and certain angles of view are exceptionally well filmed, which contributes for a nice visual experience.As a movie, it is so modern even now and it shows how messed up this world really is.This was Natalie Portman's feature film debut in the role of Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl from a dysfunctional family and already smoking cigarettes. She and Leon are actually neighbors. But soon Mathilda's entire family is shot to death, including her much beloved 4-year-old brother. They don't actually show her brother being shot (likely for obvious reasons), but still it's horrible to know that that cute and loving little kid is murdered. That is, without a doubt, the saddest and most horrifying part of the film.Mathilda is the only survivor because she was out shopping when it happened. Mathilda then seeks sanctuary on Leon. She soon finds out what he does for a living, however begs him to take care of her and protect her, as well as to teach her how to be like him (a \"cleaner\"), so that she can avenge the murder of her little brother.Mathilda even falls in love with Leon, but he doesn't feel the same way about her, so nobody can say that this movie deals with a certain inappropriate subject. On this, however, Mathilda's behavior is questionable and inappropriate at times.Too bad that Leon dies in the end. But on the positive side, the bad guys are killed as well. The song at the end (Sting's \"Shape of my Heart\") is a good song.Natalie Portman and Jean Reno have good performances. Natalie Portman, here as a younger girl, has a haircut that I just don't like at all. But she already had all the traces of a young girl who was gonna grown into a hot woman. Gary Oldman's performance was awful and his character was so annoying and so devilish that I kept wanting him to be brutally \"cleaned\" by Leon or Mathilda.So, in conclusion, an interesting and intriguing action film, one of the best of its kind, but long and somehow overvalued. It also deals with serious subjects, such as corruption, crime, violence and revenge. There is also brutal violence in this.",

Unfortunately, the film offers an approving view of an inappropriate relationship between the hit man Leon and the recently orphaned girl Matilda (who always dresses like a hooker, btw). He is over 40, she is 12 years old. The original script called for an even more intense or raw exposition of their relationship, and in the international release we get plenty of hints about this. This is a compelling film but I agree with the late great Roger Ebert on this one- the films use of a 12 year old (Natalie Portman in her first role) for the subject matter is creepy. I also find it odd that most reviewers seem to miss what the film is really saying.

Hey, he drinks milk!  How bad could he be?  And he refuses to shoot women and children!  What a guy!  I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child.

And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so \"advertised\" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing \"Like A Virgin\" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe.  Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy?  \"The Fifth Element\" had an equally annoying cute streak.  Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur.  He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing.  They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French.

            "content": "This was a powerful movie. Made in 1994, It tells the story of Mathilda and Leon, a mismatch made in heaven. She is the daughter no one likes or cares for in a family that is over disfunctional, whose family gets killed because daddy was an idiot and made Gary Oldman (Seriously, I love you Gary) get angry. Leon is a slow but solid hitman, so precise that no one can see or detect him before they are already dead.The chemestry was there, with intentional awkwardness making you feel weird watching the movie. Portman was (until George Lucas pretty much butchered her career) an emotional rollercoast that can really act. Hell, I almost cried with her in many ocasions. Of course, Jean Reno is a god, so I can't add a word.Now, the movie still suffers a couple of drawbacks, nothing mayor, but enough to stop it into being perfect: there is a mayor pothole when he killed the chinese, the music was not the most adequate and the movie feels really awkward in some set pieces in a very unintentional way. I know the original script was very much \"12 years old forces Reno\" but you could reduce the awkwardness. You still feel like that was there and it hurts.Still a magnificent movie.

Deep. Subtle. Nuanced. And all at once....The direction by Luc Besson is tight and beautifully minimalist and understated and the result is a film which while stretching credibility in some respects ultimately delivers something sincere, convincing and credible.The male leads are all excellent but they are accomplished and seasoned professionals so I'd expect no less given the right material, freedom and direction and they certainly had it here. The one that took me totally by surprise was one that I didn't even recognise at first - Natalie Portman. A kid at the time, she delivers an excellent performance and her later career success is no surprise given this starting point.If you're yet to see this movie - DO IT!If you've seen it before you'll love it all the more the second (or more) time.",

            "content": "Luc Besson doesn't hold any record in my book for credible filmmaking. Nikita was an interesting take on an unconventional subject (or an unconventional take on a redundant subject, you decide), The Fifth Element was not as good as people will profess, and The Messenger got too weighted down.  Nonetheless, Leon gets marks in my book due to the following characteristics.1) Jean Reno: since this movie, he has been typecast by Hollywood time and time again whether in Godzilla, Ronin, or Mission: Impossible.  It's as if the script calls for \"french or other foreign looking guy who looks like he can kick ass\", they call him.  Either way, Besson uses the role and the character of Leon around him as opposed to making Reno fit a mold.  Smart idea.2) Gary Oldman: yet another guy commonly typecast into villain roles, Oldman goes about hammering the anvil with his character and drawing the most attention to himself.  Best line: \"Bring me everyone.\" \"Whadaya mean 'everyone'?\"  \"EVERYONE!\"  Sometimes I wonder if he will ever get a decent role.  The Fifth Element was too much in the vein of Saturday Morning Cartoons and less out of seriousness.3) Natalie Portman:  as far as I am concerned, Natalie is currently a slave to the promotional department at Lucasfilm.  Until she gets out of that money pit, I will consider this her best performance.  Considering the subject at hand and the level of involvement on her character's part, this is light-years beyond any OO7 flick.4) Shifty editing: the editing is superb and complements with Besson's very European style of film.  Not once did I get the idea that a scene was unnecessary or drawn out longer than it should have.  Kudos to Sylvie Landra.Overall, an action movie less in the vein of comic books and more with pulp writing.  Better than the other blockbuster garbage of 1994.  4 out of 5 stars.",

Trying to cope with that while being on the run by a hit-man who is saving her life, the bonding between the two is unlike anything you will get in most films out there, from any generation. From it's extremely drab look, to the creepy vibe Leon gives, even though you know his intentions are great, this is one film you surely shouldn't miss. In the end, this is one of the best films in this genre that I have ever seen. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are phenomenal, the script is undeniably brilliant, and the score will have your heart racing, even in moments you would least expect.I highly recommend this film to fans and non-fans of this genre. \"Leon: The Professional\" is a brilliant picture.Leon: The Professional is a wonderful character study, enriched by outstanding performances, thrilling action, and a well-rounded script that gives the film an intriguing amount of depth.Luc Besson's original feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about \"The Professional,\" they mean \"L\u00e9on.\"I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. Besson's skill with action is inventive and creative (and of course over the top). ---Yidioo",

            "content": "The too-cool-for-words French actor Jean Reno plays the title role, a hitman earning a living in NYC. One of his neighbors is the precocious Mathilda (Natalie Portman, in her film debut), who lives with trashy parents, a foul-tempered sister, and one innocent, her baby brother. Then one day, crooked, psychotic, and pill-popping D. E. A. Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his crew wipe out the rest of Mathildas' family. She finds a safe haven living with Leon, and becomes obsessed with the thought of revenge. She URGES him to teach her the tricks of his trade; with great reluctance, he becomes her mentor and father figure.Written and directed by Luc Besson (who'd made a big splash with \"La Femme Nikita\" previously), \"Leon\" is not without its share of problems. For one thing, it can get pretty ridiculous at times; master stylist Besson is not exactly going for gritty reality here. Also, some of the scenes with Leon and Mathilda, who's obviously in TOO much of a hurry to grow up (and who thinks she loves Leon), are very uncomfortable. (This, despite the fact that we can sense that Leon is a basically good man who won't take advantage of her.) It also threatens to go off the rails because of Oldman, whose performance is often quite over the top. (His \"EVERYOOOONE!\" scene has become iconic over the years.)All of this said, the film is a compelling combination of dark elements, drama, humor, action (\"Leon\" gets operatically violent at times), and tension. What really makes the difference is that Reno has such presence on screen, and his rapport with young Portman, who likewise gives such a natural performance for a beginner that it's as if she'd been acting for years. Reno chose to play Leon as a simple-minded, almost childlike man, one who dotes on a plant and loves movie musicals, and this makes him quite appealing. They're supported by a number of familiar faces: Danny Aiello as Tony, the guy who gives Leon his assignments, Ellen Greene and Michael Badalucco as Mathildas' parents, and George Martin, Kent Broadhurst, and Robert LaSardo.Most amusing is the montage of assassinations where Leon and Mathilda are working as a team.Seven out of 10.",

Alongside film icons Gary Oldman, who plays a crooked detective, and Jean Reno, the Italian assassin who rescues Mathilda after her parent's death, Portman and crew deliver a powerful performance that calls to question the ambiguity of morality.\nL\u00e9on: The Professional is more than a coming of age film. Although it spends most of its time detailing the effects urban crime can have on a young teenager, it takes several stops to unpack the kindness known even among stereotypical villains. Everything seems backward in L\u00e9on: The Professional. The cops are the bad guys, the hitman is a savior, and the child acts more like an adult than anyone else.\nThere is a lot to like about L\u00e9on: The Professional. The score is modern for its era, even featuring Sting's song \"Shape of My Heart\" which has a guitar melody many modern viewers will recognize from Juice Wrld's song \"Lucid Dreams.\" The camera work is also sound, featuring ingenious POV shots that stick the viewer into the character's headspace. If the technical beauty of the film alone doesn't grab you, the cast's exceptional performance will. Detective Stansfield is perhaps Gary Oldman's most recognizable role. Natalie Portman appears seasoned in her execution, driving a noticeable wedge in between her and other similar aged actors' abilities.\nL\u00e9on: The Professional is not a film to miss. It deals in heavy material like corruption, drug use, murder, and love across age barriers without beating the audience over the head. Without a doubt, It should reside on every film lover's top 250 list.",

Matilda becomes bent on avenging her family's murder, particularly that of her innocent little brother (the rest of the family is either abusive or uninteresting to her). Oldman's character as a corrupt cop becomes the object of her ire, and with help from a reluctant Leon the two set out to settle the score. What I will say is that I was BLOWN AWAY with the fact that, for all intents and purposes, this was the first big screen job for Portman, who was fragile, tough as nails, timid, bold, nervous, and even provocative - all at the same time. Oldman is just plain Gary Oldman. Effortless, believable, awesome as always, and charming even though his villainous role demands he not be, and you can't HELP but to fall in love with Jean Reno, who steals EVERYTHING he does. The beginning of the movie? Riveting. The middle? Absolutely keeps your attention: a perfect....PERFECT mix of tension and comic relief (which by the way is why I pan a lot of movies. In EVERY real life situation there's at least SOMETHING funny). The movie is at times intense and at times tender enough to evoke tears, if you are prone to that sort of thing. In my reviews I always add \" Scenes to Watch For\"..... in this movie: when Portman (Matilda) is desperately knocking on Reno's (Leon's) door for reasons that will become obvious to you, watch her performance there, and the use of light on her face when the door opens but the viewer can't see it....genius direction and use of light. Another scene: the comic relief every time you see them march up the street carrying a plant for, again, reasons that will become obvious to you. And in general, Reno is perhaps the best actor alive at acting with just his facial expressions. Again....genius. the \"Godfather\"? No. But wow, a powerful, powerful movie.

Great chemistry between the leads. Characters you really care about. Style. Carefully crafted action. Artistic cinematography. Rhythmic editing.Luc Besson and his crew really hit the sweet spot with this movie. 10/10Anyways, most other reviewers have covered almost all the strengths of this wonderful movie, so there is really nothing I can add here except a reviewer-neglected element: the music.There are two pieces, one by Bjork and another by Sting for the credits that are really really good. All other music is composed by Eric Serra as far as I know.Eric Serra is known for collaborating with Luc Besson, and here for Leon he puts out one of his best scores. It is well written, and very well edited together into the film. Turn off the music, and you will see how much tension it serves up in scenes like the slaughter/\"please open the door!\" scene, e.g. when the slick hair goon turns toward Leon's apartment suspecting Mathilda just went in there, the music reflects his escalating threat. The soundtrack also features well crafted sound effects that go along very well with the footage -- it is not just music in the traditional sense.The character themes, Mathilda's Tony's Leon's really fit the Wagnerian ideal of using music to define a character. Leon the cleaner's theme is especially moving, yearning frustration loneliness despair. This is one of the most memorable character themes, up there with classics such as Darth Vader's Imperial March. You see Leon the cleaner, you hear the music. You hear the music, you feel Leon the cleaner.The music that is used during the montage scenes (e.g. the gum trick and hitting clients to rhythmic electronica) works great.Enough reading my lame comments, if you have not done so, go and see this movie!",

But thanks to the brilliant performance of Jean Reno (and of course young Natalie Portman as Mathilda), and subtle writing, the relationship between the two main heroes is purely mentor-apprentice. Besides the 'love story', it is also a classic revenge tale and coming of age story. There is nice subtle morale there how sometimes it is best to leave the immediate retaliation onto the hold. Sometimes it is better to wait for justice to take longer. It might hit harder.",

In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and Le\u00f3n are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Le\u00f3ns relationship: she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they say:L\u00e9on: You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda: I finished growing up, L\u00e9on. I just get older. L\u00e9on: For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up. Then it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting: Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.But in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime: all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building? Yet it does, and it's beautiful.",

But I did watch it with a growing disbelief that we are expected to swallow the messages implicit in the story : that because bad stuff happens to people they are entitled to turn into serial murderers, and while they are doing this, somewhere inside they are deeply loveable and can be redeemed by their devotion to one other person. This is peddled by depicting the vast majority of people as mean, evil or stupid so that their deaths mean nothing. And in this bloody universe, the thing to worship is guns. Firearms of all sorts are lovingly depicted as is the mayhem they create. This is the blackness at the heart of America, the sick and probably doomed society. I know Besson is a Frenchman, but he appears to fully embrace the American noir. If the violence wasn't sickening enough, there is extra sleaze in depicting the adolescent Portman as a titillating nymphet. I have a feeling I should have constantly made signs to ward off the devil while watching the film. This sort of film has deadened me to violence to a considerable extent, or I couldn't have watched it through to the end, but hopefully I have retained enough objectivity to know that humanity is reaching a pretty low ebb to serve this sort of thing up as entertainment.",

The professional is about a hit-man Leon (Jean Reno) who befriends young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family is murdered. Mathilda decides she wants revenge and insists Leon teach her how to \"clean\". A very touching relationship then develops between the two which is at the center of this amazing film. I really love this movie!I need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.Then there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film \"State of Grace\"). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to \"send me everyone\" and the assistant incredulously asks \"everyone?\" to which Stansfield chillingly screams \"EVERYONE!!\"...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.I don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...\"this is from Mathilda\"...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.This is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.Real nice song by Sting \"shape of my heart\" over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy.",

I didn't have the courage. Because, from all I have to say about this movie, I don't know where to start. My encounter with this movie was, like many love stories, occasional. It aired in the public television one night, and I had anything better to do. It grabbed me and never stopped amazing me until now. Here started my interest in Luc Besson's career and work, and in Eric Serra's music. Today, after having seen it for maybe the 20th time, I am still an unconditional fan of the sheer experience that this movie is.Maybe the most universally acclaimed movie from Luc Besson, its premiere was surrounded with scepticism: the last movie of the director was almost 4 years ago, and it was an underwater documentary many people dismissed. Even so, people still remembered the hit that was La Femme Nikita (1990), and how it made the hearts beat. So, they decided to try this one. The success was out of this world, putting it right next to all his other movies all of fame, and making it his third most watched movie (remember this was before the Taxi movies and The Fifth Element). All I can say is that this success was not casual.L\u00e9on is by far Luc Besson's finest crafted movie. The means were not too big (which could make the artistic movie to slip) and the actors were not celebrities (which could link their faces to a certain established image). The result was a freedom of speech which let Besson film it the way he wanted to, using wild camera angles, lenses and editing. All this gave the movie a totally new look, which separated it from all the other action movies. But the way of filming it wasn't the only novelty and distinctiveness here.This a movie about love. This is a movie about an impossible world and the possible relationships in it. This is a movie about injustice, and the way things have to evolve. And above all, this is a movie about two characters who find that there is something more about the world than just death and violence. L\u00e9on, under his rigid appearance, has a heart of gold. Mathilda, under her minor age, is a force of nature. And this will give L\u00e9on \"a taste for life\", and making him think that maybe there is more to it than just living like a hitman. Their fates will be unpredictable. Only them, with only their will to help them, can make it. This movie is thoroughly human, and gives us a new point of view of the concept of people on screen. Luc Besson's camera angles and shots (all those close-ups on Mathilda's face) have the power to reveal the true characters and their weaknesses. \"L\u00e9on\" has a special strength in stablishing a new way to reveal the depth of characters, and, like I said, no movie I saw made this again.The casting of this movie is out of this world. L\u00e9on, played by Jean Reno, is the perfect choice: cool and straight but sensible and deep, he is the depiction of innocence, of the people who do what they have to, even if they don't want to do it. Mathilda, played by the overwhelming revelation of Natalie Portman, is a standout in all the other child roles in the history of movies. She takes the screen with a flash, and grabs the viewer. Pure spectacle, in a 12-year-old form. Gary Oldman, in the role of Norman Stansfield, gives \"evil\" a new meaning, as he depicts someone who manages to be on all edges: mental, moral, and physical. Even though these characters are never on screen at the same time, and meet separately only one, they form a triangle which makes us think by all the three. And the perfomance is incredible, altogether.Although this one was filmed in New York, using some American actors, I never seen such a European look to an American film. And the thing that struck me the most was that in the DVD the film is dubbed in French, and the voice-overs are perfect, making the film perfectly watchable. Fact is, let's be straight, no American director could make this movie like this. We have camera angles that strike us in the face. We have wide lenses that take us to another world. And we have a form of editing like anything the world has ever seen. This gives a look like no other American movies do. That's what I like about it: this movie is European, and breathes a style only the European originality has. This makes me proud.It is very clear that this movie marked my life. When I filled the papers to enroll myself at film school, I put this movie as one of the movies that influenced me. And this wasn't casual. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, no questions asked, and it is sitting on the top of my list of Besson, right next to \"The Big Blue\", and \"The Fifth Element\". I could write much more about it, but I'm afraid the limit is 1000 words, and I don't want to have my speech cut off.If you haven't seen this movie, see it now, it is absolutely unmissable, and one of the best movies of the decade.",

How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl \"adopted\" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing. She more than holds her own in her scenes with Jean Reno, and with Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello, whom I consider among the very best. That is extraordinary.",

            "content": "This is a movie difficult to classify in any genre - which is a big part of what makes it a seemingly timeless classic.Other reviews have described in detail the essentials of the plot, and the chemistry between the actors, so I will not go over such things in any detail. Rather, I will concentrate on my impressions while watching this movie for the first time - which I did just the other week.For years, I had been vaguely aware of this film, but I never bothered to check it out. The reason was that I assumed that it was basically a \"mob movie\" about a hit-man - a genre I'm not particularly interested in. Which, in once sense, it is. However, it is much more than that, as I discovered when I finally got around to seeing it.When I started watching this movie, at first I found my impressions confirmed, as it opens with an apparently unstoppable mob assassin 'hitting' a group of drug dealing mooks. This opening scene was interesting in that the viewer never sees the killer directly - only in hints. This adds to the sense he's like a shadow or a ghost, an unstoppable force.However, the viewer soon discovers he's very much a human - and a sad, lonely one at that, living a marginal life in a slum with only his plant for company. At the same time, the viewer is introduced to Mathilda, the young neighbor girl who lives next door - who also lives a sad, lonely and miserable life.Soon, the unstoppable assassin saves the young girl from the hit squad of drug-dealing cops- and that's when the movie changes ... from a more typical mob shooter into something very like a (very) dark romantic comedy/drama. This I was not expecting. I was sort of expecting that the hit man would protect the girl, who would be more of a non-entity - a \"MacGuffin\" if you will (a joke they employ in the movie itself - at one point, she registers them in a hotel under the name \"MacGuffin\").As a viewer, I watched the unfolding sexual tension between the girl and the killer with uneasiness and dismay. Which appears to have been exactly the point the film-maker was making. The viewer is kept uneasy, not knowing exactly where this relationship is going - just how transgressive it is going to be ... is Mathilda actually \"in love\" with Leon? Is this \"love\" returned? Or is Mathilda just manipulating Leon to convince him to help her carry out her revenge? The answer appears to be a bit of \"yes\" to all the above - though Leon displays no sexual interest in Mathilda, he clearly grows to \"love\" her (in the sense of wanting what is best for her, even above his own self-interest).Mathilda, on her part, is certainly not above lying and manipulation in order to get what she wants. While she expresses her love for him repeatedly, to the point of outright propositioning him for sex, it is pretty clear that this sexual aggressiveness is the result of her abusive upbringing and her desire for adulthood - to her, it would seem, \"love\" means \"sexual love\" only, as she has never seen any other kind (other than \"cuddling\" with her baby brother). She both needs Leon (to carry out her revenge) and \"loves\" Leon (the only adult who has ever been kind to her). In that context, her declarations are both an attempt to bind Leon to her, a sort of manipulation, and the only expression of an \"adult\" type love she can understand.The point is that this is a surprisingly deep and sensitive exploration of a relationship, and nothing like what one would expect from a typical action movie. For me at least, this raises the movie to the level of a classic.",

Of course the parallel with Nikita is because it is the same director, but the story in general is quite similar too! Add to this the little girl characterization of Pretty Baby by Malle. Anyway, I have to say that I did not watch the original version of The Professional, I have just seen this one by Besson.--- Spoilers ---The first thing I want to say is... do these people know they are dealing with children? How the hell they make this 11 y.o. girl smoke and put her in other scenes learning about weapons, etc? For heaven sake! This is why this movie has a lot of Pretty Baby. In Pretty Baby Brooke Shields learned about prostitution and wanted to be a whore, now in Leon Natalie Portman learned about weapons and wanted to be a \"cleaner\". I make the question again... Do these people realize that they are dealing with children, and that somehow this kind of things affect the little actor psyche??? Because of this... I found most time of this movie very disgusting! It was very hard to stay in front on the screen. I like to study English with movies and that is the only reason I kept watching this garbage. I rented this one and well... and had to watch it, at least to learn English.This movie was extremely violent without reason, had many plot holes and impossible things... I mean things no plausible at all.First... I understand the girl had a bad childhood but she wanting to be a killer is not convincing, even with her brother died, an 11 y.o. girl does not have that kind of feelings and wants to murder people.Second, I do not understand why so many people say in their comments that Jean Reno character is a good guy... Do you think a good person would say to a little girl that life is \"always like this\" when she ask if it is always so hard??? Even if the life is so hard, you would never paint it in black for a little girl, man! Do you think a good person would teach a little girl how to use a long-distance rifle to kill someone even if she insisted with the matter? And in fact, a good person would have not hesitated to open the door when she was crying for help.Third: DEA agents leader is a junky??? Hahahaha... This was really laughable. How could I guy like that be in the force? If we have that kind of policemen in US we are in GREAT TROUBLES, bro!Fourth: How can a baby girl go into that high security building without problems, and MORE... how can a single guy breaks into the same building some minutes later shooting everyone without any problems either?Fifth: Jean Reno character is a Terminator model T-101. Nothing beats him. They brought 500 SWATs and no-one can scratch him...Also I found very disturbing this relationship between Reno and Portman, she is in love just like Shields in Pretty Baby, I can understand that, girls that age fall in love easily, but that means you can make a movie and insinuate they sleep together or something? OK, do it, make the movie, but then do not make a scandal when something like that happens in the real world!I will not continue because this movie made me sick... but wait, somehow the final is good and the plant finale scene is really moving. After all, the girl will have a second chance in life... again, just like Pretty Baby finale.Hard childhood... and they want to show it cruelly. But I don't think it is good to use children for this, in this explicit way.",

            "content": "This is a modern fantasy complete with twisted lives, nobility, endangered innocence, self-sacrifice, death, true love, and monstrous evil.  If you look very closely, it all dissolves into an unholy mess as did the knight's tales it resembles.  But, if you can forget reality and focus on the emotional appeal of the story, Luc Besson's drama rivals the best mythology can offer.  It works because the values that help Mathilda and L\u00e9on to find redemption are as timeless as the fears that terrify them. Before the film ends, she has helped him care about life again, and he has given her a decent adult she can believe in.Jean Reno plays a masterful, but childlike hitman who avoids all contact with anyone but his employer.  His rules are simple, he will not kill women or kids, he does not get emotionally involved with others, he takes care of himself so that he can do his job, and he takes his responsibilities seriously.  His knightly persona is complete with a disregard for money, profound humility, clean living, and a gentle spirit.  Reno makes it all work well.  Despite his off-handed disregard for human life, L\u00e9on is an extremely sympathetic hero.Natalie Portman, however, steals the show with her portrayal of a willful preteen devastated by the loss of her brother and adrift in a sea of powerful emotions.  Incapable or unwilling to face the consequences of her actions, she wants a final end to the turmoil inside her.  Portman does an amazing job showing the vulnerable child wanting an adult end to her isolation.  Good or bad, her innocence and reckless intensity make the movie work.  That L\u00e9on sees what is at stake and in his incoherent way tries to keep her safe is the hallmark of his nobility and should speak to everyone who cares about the sanctity of trust.  The only downside to this picture was the stylized and unrealistic enemy. Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor, and the fact that his exaggerated rendition of a corrupt DEA agent comes across as believable is a testament to his skill.  In general, his crew comes across as cartoonish at best. Some of the more outrageous scenes include a bad guy preparing himself to stab a mattress, and the horde of skimask-wearing ninja/swat team/jack-booted-thugs who show up near the end.  The last time I saw such a ridiculous collection of enforcement personnel was in the \"Blues Brothers.\"The monstrous evil in this piece is the emotional purgatory that both Mathilda and L\u00e9on experience alone. Their journey to unexpected peace is unlike any story I have ever seen.  Besson makes you care about the internal lives of his wounded couple by presenting the horror and nobility of their relationship with full intensity.   Mathilda's wish to die or find love, L\u00e9on's near willingness to kill her or let her kill herself, and their mutual disregard for the killing of others is mind numbing but powerful. Given the context of an uncommunicative killer afraid of involvement, a reckless child, and a lifestyle based on violent confrontation, they have few chances to survive and prosper.  The only things they have going for them are L\u00e9on's decency and Mathilda's complete faith in him.  The fact that faith and decency are enough makes for a first-rate medieval story in modern dress.",

            "content": "Luc Besson directs \"Leon\", a stylish action movie. The plot? Jean Reno plays an emotionally stunted assassin who takes a young girl, played by Natalie Portman, under his wing. She's being hunted by a corrupt cop played by Gary Oldman. As the film portrays Portman as a world weary, sexualised pre-teen who frequently hits on an immature older man (and who wears a quasi-bondage fetish collar in several scenes), \"Leon's\" frequently criticised for being \"like child pornography\". Interestingly, the assassin genre has a long history of sexualising underage girls (everything from \"Kite\" to \"Kick Ass\", the former actually banned for paedophilia). \"Leon's\" tame by the genre's oft unexamined standards.Aesthetically, \"Leon's\" stronger than most of Luc Besson's films. He shoots New York city like Paris, hires famous fashion designers to do the film's wardrobe and his use of music, shot selection and set pieces are all both unconventional and excellent for the genre.It's interesting to watch how the assassin genre has evolved. Early on we had Kurosawa and Leone's \"contract killer\" films, which treated the hit-man as a sort of supernatural angel of death. Next came fare like \"Le Samouri\", \"The Day of the Jackal\" and \"The Professional\" (1980), in which the hit-man is presented as a cold, methodical, robotic killer. His job was routine but lonely.Then came fare like John Woo's \"The Killer\", which puts the hit-man in a crazy action movie in which he suddenly \"loves everyone\" and has strict morals about whom he kills. Films like \"Nikita\" and \"Leon\" followed, in which the hit-man becomes a kind of emotionally damaged woman (Nikita) or mentally damaged man-child (Leon). It's as though, over time, the hit-man evolves from something mythical, to a bureaucratic professional, to a cartoon hero, to some sort of damaged soul.\"Grosse Point Blank\" would then deconstruct the genre further, turning the hit-man into a Woody Allen styled neurotic who questions everything he does, psychoanalyses himself and seems stuck in an existential rut.Thoroughly postmodern, \"Ghost Dog\" would then autopsy and rip apart the genre completely, paving the way for fare like \"Ichi the Killer\", in which all nobility was removed. Contract killers were now disgusting, sadomasochistic and vile creatures. All nihilism and gore, the film ends with its hit-man hanging himself from a tree.Today, with everything thoroughly deconstructed, it seems as though the genre's been reset, resulting in simple assassin tales like \"Hitman\" and \"Shooter\". In contrast, \"Leon's\" a strange hybrid. It steals its action from Asian cinema, its emotions from French cinema (specifically Melville), its mythical aspects from Kurosawa and Leone, and wraps it all up in a strange (and yes, creepy) love story between an emotionally stunted middle aged man and a seasoned kid. Besson's \"Leon\" also loosely rips off another french film called \"The Professional\" (released in 1980), though his film is much better.Incidentally, Luc Besson initiated a relationship with the 14 year old Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco in the early 1990s. She gave birth to his child when 16. It's clear that \"Leon\" channels the director's life and lusts during this period.8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",

The cover featured a blurb that read (I'm paraphrasing from memory), \"It'll make 'Speed' feel like a slow ride to Grandma's house\", which always left with me with a particular thrill-ride impression. The truth couldn't be any further from that description, but there's something deeper here than just action junk food and that's why the movie comes on like a sucker punch.Everyone in this cast is extremely well chosen, but Oldman threatens to steal the show with his signature psychopathy. Geez, that guy. And on the subject of action, this has it, no question. When Reno dons his beanie, you know you're in for some bloody fun. But the movie's real asset is the pairing of hit-man and orphan (Reno and Portman, respectively). It's an unlikely relationship, but also earnest enough to really go for the heart at just the right point.It may look and feel like a Luc Besson action movie, but it's very well made and thoughtful in its sadistic approach. There's emotional resonance here, to be sure.8/10",

The central dynamic is a little odd, though it's nothing compared to what was in the original screenplay, but ultimately turns out sweetly serene and incidentally innocent. The scenery-chewing villain is a little pantomime but menacingly hunts down the duo like dogs, which allows for some great action set-pieces punctuated by pure emotional moments. 7/10",

A young girl from an abusive drug-dealing family approaches the smashed-in door of her apartment. Instinctively she realises that everyone has been murdered by the corrupt drug-squad officers standing at the door. Stifling her terror, she walks past to the door of another apartment and knocks on it as though it is her own home, praying that the strange neighbour will open the door and let her in\u0085 Luc Besson explores with great skill the unlikely relationship between Mathilde the 12-year old orphan and Leon: professional killer, immature loner and psychopath. Despite their apparent differences, the similarities are greater: Leon is childlike in many ways, whereas Mathilde (perhaps through necessity) demonstrates a ruthlessness that will give hardened criminals pause.There is action a-plenty. At times it defies reality, although no more so than the action scenes in Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, and the character juxtaposition is way beyond what such films usually achieve.Some of the negative reviews on this site are hard to believe: some don't like it because it depicts corrupt DEA agents (reality check people \u2013 every police agency has bad apples); others don't like it because it is said to push pedophilia (yet Besson goes out of his way to show that, despite having every opportunity, Leon firmly rejects any sexual relationship with Mathilde); others are disturbed by the thought that a 12-year old girl could contemplate revenge or seriously want to kill the men who murdered her little brother (again, sorry for the dose of reality but in some parts of the world children younger than this are soldiers, drug-dealers or worse); some reviewers are clearly disturbed by the \"European\" feel to the film (personal taste \u2013 I liked it).The movie ends on a surprisingly optimistic note: Mathilde's wild proposal to work as an assassin is rejected by a horrified mafioso. Despite his amorality (and the obvious uses that someone in his position could find for her) he produces the money for her school fees and sends her packing. At school, she plants Leon's pet plant so that it can \"put down roots\" \u2013 a symbol that she herself is now going to do that, instead of the rootless life she has been living since the slaughter of her family.Despite the violence and gore, the themes of the film are love (in the non-sexual sense), companionship and human need.",

I bought this film before I had even seen it. I did this because of the fantastic reviews it got, and having a real respect for Gary Oldman.

The chemistry between the two on screen is just fantastic, as Leon starts to come to terms with himself that he really is in love with Matilda. Pedhophila is an issue in this film (though is never shown) and is understandable why some people find it to be a hard pill to swallow (maybe not for Oldman)... but for me, this film is like taking a trip down a road of rocky revenge, heartbreaking tragedy, breathtaking style and substance to die for.

And yet Leon is also a great coming of age tale, with Natalie Portman putting in a great performance in a difficult role that would be above the ability of many young actresses.As much as i really like Jean Reno, he is not a nuanced actor. he is likable, charming in a dumb sort of way, but subtlety isn't his forte. good thing Leon is required to speak little, and basically maintain a gruff exterior and stoic facial expression the entirety of the movie...seriously, his beloved pot plant is more expressive (ok thats a tad harsh, i know). it seems besson tried to inject some quirkiness into the character (his best friend is a pot plant, he seems to exist purely on a diet of milk, he likes gene kelly etc) in order to make him more interesting an unique, but these traits seemed tacked on.Then we go to the other end of the spectrum with Gary oldman's performance....haha, i mean WOW....great actor and I'm a fan of his overall body of work, but he so completely overacts and chews up the scenery every time he's on screen, it severely dampens my enthusiasm for the movie. every bit of body language, every word that he screeches, just sets my teeth on edge. just taking a pill (supposedly to curb his psychotic tendencies? hmm, maybe up the dosage...) involves shaking the little capsule tin up to his ear (???) then swallowing the pill, and having a full body convulsion, neck twisting while he groans loudly...i mean, a simple bodily function turns into a grand opera in oldman's hands, its ridiculous.This ridiculousness in the acting also extends to the story, which in some moments just made me shake my head in disbelief. the climactic action scene, where it must be close to 100 swat team are trying to storm an apartment to kill one man, (oh, and using rocket launchers for gods sake) is so over the top it robs the scene of any true tension, as its all so unrealistic. there are a multitude of such stupid, unrealistic moments that i could list at least another 10 without thinking about it. anyway, the movie has some serious flaws, i think I've made that pretty clear by now.But the Pro's do outweigh the Con's. as mentioned before Portman made the world sit up and take notice with her performance here.Between Reno's stonefaced acting, and Oldman's histrionics, sits a balanced, mature depiction of a girl on the cusp of puberty. Portman is magnetic and you cant help but fall in love with her like Leon does. So where do i sit with the whole age gap thing? to be honest its never really bothered me, bloody oldmans acting and the stories ridiculousness have always been my gripes with the movie. Portman and Reno certainly have a chemistry that works on screen, their scenes together are among the best, as their relationship grows from a father/daughter relationship to something deeper.And as mentioned before, Besson is a brilliant visual artist, no denying that. for all the weakness of the story, the visual beauty carries the film for all its 2+ hr length. Its just a shame that the films acting and plot leave me almost laughing in disbelief at its ridiculousness. Nevertheless, id give it a 7 out of 10, as its entertaining and re-watchable.",

Furthermore, Oldman's character is more of a caricature than a character. It's hard to believe Stansfield, a man with clear psychotic behavior, would hold such an important position in the DEA. One also has to wonder if every cop in NYC is as corrupt as Stansfield when a slew of them help him burst into an apartment, kill everyone in sight, including a 4 year-old child, all without raising any red flags. But the hardest thing to believe was how Mathilda's father, knowing what was coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by noon.

LTP has influenced every fiber of my (aesthetical?) being since first being exposed to it at age nine when I tried to grow Leon's beard. I couldn't believe it when my mum told me that growing a beard would be impossible. With my dreams crushed, I swore LTP out of my life forever. I revisited it again at age thirteen, convinced that I was at the peak of mental maturity and beard-growing abilities. I believed I understood this film on a deep- artistic-philosophical level, I wrote personal essays on the films philosophical merit for high-school, I recommended it to all of my tween friends but then assured them that they \"probably wouldn't understand it's depth anyway\". In attempt to find people who just GOT the film y'know, I turned to the streets; making alleyway handshake deals of USB's containing a pirated LTP movie file to other like-minded intellectuals. \"Trust me Gustav, all it takes is just one taste,\" I said to Gustav, \"Please leave me alone weird short red-head girl, I don't know you. And my name is Jeremy!\" Jere-Gustav replied. That Gustav always had a sense of humour. Anyway, it didn't really work out, not even the streets were ready.At fifteen I watched LTP three more times within that year. With what little pocket money I had, I bought a replica of L\u00e9on's sunglasses, beanie and the little pot plant that Mathilda had. I even wore my dad's old black coat for dramatic effect, shoulder pads still intact. I also had decided to postpone my deep-philosophical- artistic tirade attempts; instead I focused solely on channeling my Inner L\u00e9on Look\u0099. Sixteen years old, I was dedicated to replicating L\u00e9on as a person. I tried taking stray children under my wing, knocking on apartment complex doors screaming for Mathilda or the male equivalent; Mathias. Neither was found. I suppressed my many crushed hopes and dreams by watching LTP four more times, within a week.It wasn't until I was seventeen that I realised I had forgotten my original wayward ways; I no longer thought about the philosophy of LTP, or the mind bending obstacles it creates for the viewer to ponder over, or even the foreshadowing that we will forever wish we thought of first as a stylistic device. Now at almost nineteen, I realise this is probably because L\u00e9on: The Professional doesn't truly quell any hidden meanings to decipher. It's simply put; a goddamn awesome action flick that focuses on a father/daughter like relationship and ends with sweet sweet avenged death. A film/movie/flick doesn't need to bend the laws of physics itself to be rated five out of five stars or ten out of ten stars or one hundred fresh tomatoes. My former years were wasted trying to justify why I loved it so much, when I just needed to accept the fact it was no 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that's okay. It explains why I have stuck with the L\u00e9on aesthetic. This isn't really a review, just a long-winded story about how I came to a conclusion about my feelings for this movie.TLDR: Renno and Portman r gr8, story is cool, not that deep, aesthetic is nice, Luc Besson is an everyday genius, boom bang, cry, fin.

I did well, I was surprised by the film.The plot is simple: Leon is a professional killer with European origins. It's good at what he does. However, his life changes when he saves the life of a girl, Mathilda, whose parents are his neighbors and are slaughtered by a drug dealer whom they had tried to deceive. From then on, they become a kind of distorted family: he protects and welcomes her, and she tries to be like him, determined to avenge the death of her four-year-old brother, the only person she loved.I loved the story told by this movie. Its full of feelings and humanity, in a universe that seems anything but human: the underworld of crime. The young Mathilda is a character full of contrasts: she appears to be very young but says she is grown up and she behaves like an adult: cursing, smoking, drinking - even though she is clearly not used to drinking - and even feeling attracted to her protector, who is a lonely man who wants to remain alone and does not feel for her any bond other than friendship and piety. A suffering man, clearly marked by life, who keeps a single strong connection with a plant, whom he cares lovingly. The characters are excellently played by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, far from the fame that would later enshrine her in films, such as \"Black Swan\" or \"V for Vendetta\". I confess that I found her performance incredible. Gary Oldman brought to life the main villain, the sadistic Stansfield, a man who has two faces and a secret life, but who does not know how to hide a deeply violent and cruel personality.This was Luc Besson's first film I saw, and I confess I was very impressed. The director seems to be thorough and made this film with great care and attention. Filming locations have been carefully selected and wisely used, cinematography is stylish and uses some original and creative camera angles. In the same way, light and color are used in a very appropriate way, and the film cannot be said to be dark or gloomy. The sets and costumes are good and there is some symbolism in the way they present themselves (for example, the empty house of Leon that, suddenly, Mathilda seems to fill with life). The soundtrack, something stylized, goes well with the theme of the movie and what we are watching on screen.In all respects, it's a highly commendable movie to watch several times.",

I think its main plot beat is strong enough to move the story itself but I do not know its just went to it and it felt like its just rush. I think it feels in the grand scope of things missing the magnitude that I think the film could went for. In hindsight, maybe its the sound mixing or the pacing of this cut but it just felt lacking. Even more so disappointing is how sexualized Matilda is. I think its just out of no more plot that never really went anywhere. Why even try to imply or add it in the story AND given the hindsight we have, it feels more so exploitative as day passes by.TLDR. The film has great parts but I do found its story rather rushed and somewhat uneventful.",

However, he becomes responsible for his next door neighbour, 12 year old Mathilda, when her family is killed. Despite her age she understands revenge and wants to take it against those who killed her family. Luckily, Leon is a professional and teachers her to \"clean\".Right from the get go you're hit with splashes of smooth camera angles and movements along with a cathartic score so that you are placed right into the action. Leon is a lot more though than a super slick action flick; it's the exploration of a relationship and how two people can connect despite all the odds. Leon and Mathilde's relationship is genuinely one of the best I think I've ever seen on cinema because the intentions are just never in question, you completely understand how they understand each other.Leon is another prime example of a film that possess both style and substance: it's a cultural phenomenon in how iconic the characters are, it possesses style in the way you expect with it being shot like a fast-paced action film yet the characters are rich and fully fleshed and there are genuine stakes, complex emotions and topics that really do make you think. It really was just a film that caught my attention and kept it for the entirety of the film; it ended and my first thought was I wanted to watch it again and I haven't had that reaction to a film in a long time. There's probably a lot I haven't said in terms of how this film made me feel or what it made me think but I'm still in a state of somewhat awe so I'm afraid I can't put those thoughts into words right now.

I don't have all the words right now but this film is a work of art.It felt very real to me, and it touched me on a deep level that I don't quite understand.

Now that I've seen it, it's easily one of my favorite films.It has more than what you see upfront, but it's not pretentious about it. It's deep without trying too hard to be deep.

Then, lo and behold, I found the European version of the film, which seemed to show everywhere but here in the US. Let's just say, I'm going to send a nasty letter to the MPAA someday soon.First of all, I could see the whole \"sexual tension\" between Mathilda and Leon as unusual, but that's what harnessed the energy of this film. Why wouldn't someone feel attached to a person who saved their life? Also, the Russian roulette (which, amazingly, is called American Roulette in Russia) scene was top notch, something that should never have been taken out of the film.Anyhow, enough with the pontification, and on with the review. Luc Besson could win Oscars and awards for the rest of his life, and this would still be his greatest work ever. Granted, Nikita was just as good, but this film had more clarity, a betterscript and Gary Oldman. Jean Reno is one of the most under appreciated actors in the world, forced to prostitute himself in films like Godzilla and Rollerball to keep food on the table. Thankfully, he will always have this movie to look upon. For any who haven't seen the 133-minute version of the film, go and find the European version.

One of the main reason this film is so great is because of Natalie Portmans amazing acting in it, she managed to capture angry, suicidal, vengeful side of Mathilda but also the loving more caring side of her, not many grown up actors/actresses can do that let alone a kid.

But what really surprised me was the little yet perfect amount of humor present in it (I watched the longer version so don't know if it exists in the theatrical version too). Instead of making it too dull with just dialogues, Luc Besson has relied on the characters more than the plot to keep the entertainment quotient going on. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman have really impressed big time and delivered possibly their career best performances till date.Of course, it's very violent and also somewhat dark in nature, but aren't most hitman action movies like this, then? Fully realizing the characters, Besson has given us enough time to understand them while also delivering plenty of killer action sequences involving mostly gunplay and explosions: and the result is just outstanding!Leon is a hitman's emotional saga, and it's backed by a thread of strong emotions between the characters. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda will really get you involved, Stansfield will turn out to be one of the most terrific action movie villains of all time, and the film itself would be called one of the greatest action movies ever made.Looks like that happened a very, very long time ago.",

Basically Leone 'L\u00e9on' Montana (Jean Reno) is the professional hit-man, or \"cleaner\", who only drinks milk, cares for a houseplant and loves Gene Kelly musicals, and he lives next to Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman) is the twelve year old New York girl living with her little Brother (Carl J. Matusovich) and her dysfunctional family. Mathilda's Father (Michael Badalucco) is being paid by corrupt DEA cops to store cocaine in his house, and when they find out he has been stealing some of it for himself, sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman 'Stan' Stansfield (Gary Oldman) leads his team of agents to kill him and his family. Mathilda managed to escape death going shopping, and L\u00e9on lets him into his apartment knowing she is all alone, and she eventually finds out his deadly profession, but she doesn't see this as a threat, but an opportunity. She is willing to pay him a fee he has mentioned to kill the people responsible for killing her family, well, specifically her brother, or teach her to use the weapons of his trade, so he does this. So L\u00e9on teaches her how to use many firearms, particularly a scoped rifle, and in return she does chores in the apartment and teaches him some skills he lacks, such as literacy, and in doing so she claims she is falling in love with him. One day, after learning what she thinks is enough to do the job herself, Mathilda takes a number of weapons in a bag to go and hunt Stansfield down, posing as an innocent delivery girl, but he ambushes her, until L\u00e9on arrives to take her away. After gaining the information of L\u00e9on's whereabouts from friend Tony (Danny Aiello), Stansfield gets a team of SWAT-like masked men to take Mathilda hostage and infiltrate the apartment, but L\u00e9on's skills get the better of them and he gets her back safely. She manages to escape going down an air shaft, and L\u00e9on looks like he is going to make his way out posing as one of the masked men with bad injuries, but Stansfield recognises him. The end sees L\u00e9on nearly getting away, but being shot by Stansfield, and blowing himself and the villain up with active grenades, and after being refused a hit-man existence, Mathilda tries to return to school, and she plants L\u00e9on's beloved plant in a field. Also starring Peter Appel as Malky, Ellen Greene as Mathilda's Mother and Elizabeth Regen as Mathilda's Sister. Reno gives a wonderful performance as the loner with all the skills, Oldman is great as a dark drug taking villain on the wrong side of the law, and young Portman almost steals the show as the girl wanting revenge, and obviously Reno and Portman together create sparks. It is an action filled film, with some funny moments, some dark, atmospheric and suspenseful moments, as well as touching moments with the title character and his female friend bonding, a must see thriller. Gary Oldman was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",

Well it's nothing like Man on Fire, so I'll judge this movie as it stands on its own. It stands as well as any peg legged person would. The bond between Creasy and Pita was very believable, the bond between Leon and Mathilda is contrived and awkward. From the outset, I didn't buy that this little Mathilda girl has this burning passion and dedicated devotion to become a hit-man just like Leon. What little girl even thinks like that? Also, what makes her sooo interested in him anyway? I'm talking about before he rescued her, what was it about him that she was so attracted to? It makes no sense.Obviously if Mathilda didn't want to be a hit-man, we would have no movie. Had they justified this motivation in a more believable manner, I would've bought it. And no, her family being murdered (including her brother who she was close with) doesn't count. I don't buy \"becoming a hit-man\" as a believable emotional response for a 12 year old girl. If they wanted to make it realistic, they should've had her desire to be a hit-man be more of a passing interest, as sort of a passionate raw response to having her family murdered. A lot of kids show interest in whatever it is that is current in their minds at the time, but unless it's something that they are naturally interested in, or are forced to do, they probably won't follow through with the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in some random craft thrown at them (and why should they, you think you can get a 12 year old girl to all of a sudden show daily dedication in say, becoming a car mechanic, without any persuasion to do so?) Here's what they should've done: After her family is killed, have her still want to exact revenge, but what should change is her character's desire to *continue* training to be a hit-man, because that single flaw is what throws this whole premise off the balcony. I would have her eventually try to give up on this idea after realizing what a dark world she's gotten herself into, only to have Leon not allow her back out of her commitment. The manner in which Leon reacts to this and the degree to which he goes to prevent her cop out would be determined by how you would want to portray his character. There could be many interesting possibilities with this sort of idea, by showing a realistic shades of grey character.One final thing, so many people said how Gary Oldman was so great in this, and squealing with delight about how his quirky performance was just so wonderful. The man's FACE bothered me the entire movie. The way he played that character was very annoying, not to mention unrealistic to the type of disposition a person that made it to his position would have.",

            "content": "As this is my 100th film of the year I decided I would watch one of my all-time favourites. I have not seen Leon in quite a few years and so it was nice to become reacquainted with this classic. It's not perfect, I know, but, to me, it will always be one of Luc Besson's best.Leon is a loner and a hit-man; he lives in an apartment in New York next door to the twelve year old Mathilda and her family. He gets his work from Italian mob boss, Tony. Mathilda's father is into some shady drug dealings that land him in trouble with the rather psychotic Stansfield and his gang. She is out getting groceries when Stansfield calls and shoots her entire family. On returning she takes refuge in Leon's apartment. Despite initial reservations, Leon takes her in and they move to a hotel. Mathilda swears revenge on the killers, mainly because one of the victims was her four-year-old brother. She asks Leon to teach her to do what he does for a living. Leon teaches her the basics and the pair grows closer as they learn to live with each other. Mathilda teaches him to read and he begins to not feel quite so lonely any more. On a visit to her former home Mathilda learns just who Stansfield is and what he does for a living. This is where things really get interesting, and this is where I will end my short synopsis.This is a really well made film with a great soundtrack, there are a couple of songs, but the original score is great. As with all the Luc Besson films I've seen there is always an element of humour in the main characters and this is no different. Tremendous performances from both Jean Reno as Leon and Natalie Portman as Mathilda. Gary Oldman is his usual 'over the top' self as the psychotic Stansfield and Danny Aiello is also very good as Tony.I really engaged with the characters of Leon and Mathilda. You really believe that what they feel for each other is true. There is always a certain sense of style about a Luc Besson film, something I have not seen in the films of any other director. As I said at the beginning, this film is not perfect, but it will always be one of my favourites. It still stands up fifteen years after its release. For me: always recommended.My score: 8.5/10",

            "content": "I'll try not to be too gratuitously abusive about this film, but considering the astounding amount of uncritical, even hysterical, raves it has received from viewers, I feel like I have to swat it down a peg or two.  Any fairly flashy film with a lot of guns, explosions, death and destruction is bound to excite a large number of moviegoers.  I used to think this is more of an American thing, but the comments from overseas seem to contradict that old cliche.  Bad taste is universal, it seems.  Still, the ardent praise of its plot and characterizations astonish me, as these elements of the film left me with a creepy, vaguely dirty impression of the film.  Enthusiasts for the film defend its morality, and suggest that any hint of sexual tension between Leon and young Mathilda is in the mind of the viewer.  However, the fact that Mathilda is always dressed in a sort of provocative, gothic punk/slut attire, and the fact that she openly hints to a hotel clerk that she and Leon are having sex (I know, they aren't) suggests that the filmmakers would like us to be thinking about the possibility of it, even if it is not portrayed.  in a way, a straightforward sex exploitation film is more honest that this kind of hypocrisy.  As for Leon -- are we supposed to love this guy?  Leon is a hit man.  What's a hit man but a specific variety of serial murderer?  We're supposed to like him because he is kind to children and houseplants?  Jame Gumb loves his little dog, but that doesn't make him any more cuddly (see \"Silence of the Lambs, a REALLY good film). so the emotionally damaged kid finds out that her new father figure is a paid killer, calmly says \"cool\" (yuck!), and Leon proceeds to instruct her in the noble profession of killing people for money.  but the killer has scruples after all!  \"No women or kids\" he says.  What a saint!  Are we to assume Leon knows for a fact that the world will be a better place without the men he's being paid to kill?  Sort of like the evil twin of Clarence, the angel in \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"  Aren't the men he kills without even knowing them somebody's children too?  Might there be women and children who will be hurt by their assassination?  Aren't women sometimes evil too?  And then we're supposed to feel Leon's basic human goodness because he asks Mathilda not to swear so much, even though he has taught her how to kill people without thinking too much about it.  Is this all some kind of subtle satire?  If so, I think it's a bit too subtle for most people, including myself.  If it's meant to be taken seriously -- well, I just can't think of it as anything but some sort of moral idiocy.  I take nothing away from this film cinematically.  It's a great-looking film, but to me it's just plain creepy and disturbing.  Besson's \"Fifth Element\" was a lot more enjoyable to me, both as eye candy and as entertainment.

She was sexualized at such a young age, and she's spoken publicly about how traumatic it was for her.

            "content": "And WOW! When I was a kid I've probably seen this movie at least 10 times, if not more. For the longest time I didn't feel like watching this movie because I felt like I've already seen it too many times. But God Damn! I loved it when I was 9, and since then I've read plenty of books, and experienced too much of what life can offer. All that made this movie beyond incredible for me to describe in the true richness of emotions I felt. First of all, I do think it's better than Nabokov's Lolita. And I am Russian, so trust me, it means a lot for me to say that. Lolita was incredible for the first half, but this movie kept at it the whole time. Have I mentioned it made me ball my eyes out too? Definitely a better love story than Lolita.Then, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her. Now, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though. To that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again.",

            "content": "I was in Wal-Mart yesterday looking through DVDs when I came across a movie I had seen several times on television, \"The Professional.\" It was on the night before and I had to get it. I love this movie. Every character in it is an individual. When I told my mother and sister what the movie was about they looked at me with a look on their face that said \"He's a hit-man. He's--a--hit-man.\" Who said hit men can't have a soul? This one does. The detail of character in this movie is stunning. It has no shame either, and proudly displays images and moments with the raw truth. This little girl does bleed, she does see violence and filth, she does smoke cigarettes and gets slapped by her father. She has no sorrow for her dead and useless family, only her innocent little brother. A hit-man is her idol because he showed her kindness, he did more for her than her family ever did.Leon himself is a great guy. I found myself wanting to be like him at some points. Even though he is a killer, the man has morals. He has more morals than anyone in any other action movie with explosions and such that I've ever seen. He's very swift on his feet and even though he seems like a very serious person, he can laugh and grin a large smile. The character is just so natural, so graceful in acting. Like I said, detail is shown very well in this movie. Ooh, my favorite though...OH, MY FAVORITE...!...Is Gary Oldman's character, Stansfield. I LOVE him! The moment he comes onto the screen my face lights up like cigarette :). I was actually attracted to him because of his character....Ooh, so deliciously evil! He delivers comedy and cruelty all in one, and he holds that gun so well! I loved how close he got to people. To tell you the truth, it made me a little uncomfortable, haha. But he got so close to Mathilda. Just him and her, and he's poking a gun right in her face. It just goes to show how merciless and serious he can be. I was happy to see the extra scene they cut out from TV right afterward when Willie comes in and interrupts and he's deciding what to do with her. Stansfield is so strange and shifty, he motions to her awkwardly with the gun to come with them, but then suddenly points it at her and takes aim, but then just thinks to himself \"forget it\" and puts his arm down. Great character. The storyline itself is good too. No one is afraid to talk about/do things that a lot of other movies won't do. They don't censor out what makes people seem real. They give a 12 year old knowledge she shouldn't know and ways of acting that most parents would shudder at. The hit-man is human and considers what he does a job and when he's not doing his job he's a very decent human being. The villain is a little wacky, but he pulls it off very nicely. He fits the part of a psycho perfectly. The lines in the movie can be catchy and touching, little moments make it all worthwhile. The scene where she walks past her dead family and up to Leon's door is so amazing. She's crying helplessly for him to open the door. I mean, you really can see it in her eyes that she's begging. Wonderful acting, especially for such a young actress. It amazes me how well she does with adults, right in her face too, and all the adult related topics too that she deals with. Anyway, I wish I could write more passionately and interestingly as do a lot of people who write comments, but I just don't think I have a large enough vocabulary. This movie is not easy to explain in words for me. I can only sum it up as \"Unique, inspiring (the whole hit-man thing...), amazing, conscious, dramatic, wonderfully acted, and talented.\" Well, those words poppped into my head. I could say more, but I don't know how.",

Both their lives change dramatically, as they have to be with a person whom they know little about, but they like each other. The plot is captivating, and very well-written. The acting is all top-notch, especially from the three main characters, played by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. Each of them portray their respective character to perfection. The pacing is good, there is rarely a moment in the film where you are bored. The action scenes are very well done, action-filled yet relatively realistic. Every time there is an action sequence involving Leon, the hitman, you only see him briefly, every time he kills someone. It's like being a silent spectator, seeing a professional hitman in action. Very cool. I think most people who enjoys dramas, especially dramas about love and change, will like this, though some action fans might wanna give it a shot too(no pun intended). I also recommend this to any fan of the aforementioned actors, as all of them perform very well in this movie. 10/10",

Come to think of it, there were many things that I wasn't expecting... like, I didn't expect young Natalie Portman would grow up to become Luke Skywalker's mom and Jackie Kennedy.'Leon The Professional' (1994) is the type of movie that you saw on HBO on a tiny television in the 1990's, and bought on DVD in the early 2000's, and then later you buy it on Blu-Ray and eventually you download it digitally - because it transcends media and time. As long as there are hitmen and aggressive young girls, then people will be watching this film. The themes of love and loneliness never get old or go out of style.The elements of a great film are all here - the pacing is perfect, acting is subtle and non-verbal at times when needed, cinematography is great, and there is a great antagonist (Gary Oldman). Among all of this perfection, there is also a truly unique love story. Finally, an action film that you can watch with your girlfriend or wife... if she's, like, super-cool and chill about weird and uncomfortable stuff.

Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",

Be sure to view the international cut of the film, as the interactions are given more depth in this version.The performances are uniformly excellent. Jean Reno plays the tough guy role to a tee, and gives Leon extra depth and sensitivity. In limited screen time Gary Oldman is also excellent as the insane villain.

There are entertaining one-liners, and all of the characters(especially Oldman's role) are well written.The film is more about character interaction than plot. The movie sets up its premise in the opening act, but for a time is plot less, focusing entirely on its characters. It returns to a plot driven narrative about 3/5 of the way through. I always prefer plot-based stories, but The Professional's plot is still well executed.The movie makes no attempt at realism, and despite being set in contemporary New York, feels like it is set in a completely new environment. Director Luc Benson establishes a unique atmosphere, and brings the characters to life nicely.The Professional has two major action sequences(one at the opening and another at the climax)and several small fights in between. Both the big battles are unique and exciting. They are also very emotionally intense due to the way the viewer cares for the characters.The Professional is a top-notch action movie. I would heavily recommend it to fans of the genre. Anyone who appreciates strong character development would also be advised to give this film a look.",

Her father steals drag which belongs to a drag gang and it is found by a narcotics agent. The agents kill the family all, even a youngest brother. Fortunately Mathilda is not home at that moment, but she loses her family, left alone. She doesn't have anyone that she counts on except for Leon. She begs Leon to teach how to use guns for taking avenge. Firstly he refuses it, but he cannot forsake her and starts to educate Mathilda to be a hit man. It's very beautiful that the fusion of Leon's loneliness and Mathilda's one. Their love is too complicated to tell clearly; its style is different from the love of couple, friend and family. However I'm sure that both of them found something treasure through the time they spent together. Gary Oldman acted one of the biggest villain in the movie history. I guess this film would not succeed in like now without him.",

The acting, directing and dramatics of the picture are almost there, but not quite. Everything that could be good about this film is limited by faulty writing.  Acting: Aiello is great in a minor part, but bad writing kills all the efforts of Reno and Oldman and the twelve year old.  Leon's character is very one dimensional, leaving Reno no room to stretch as an actor, unless you count his bad John Wayne bit or his plant stroking.  Oldman plays a comic book character, so he can't help being over the top.  As for the kid, she leaves an impression but her part is simply not believable. \nDirecting:  Besson was writer and director, so any positive points one might give him for directing are canceled out by the completely implausible story and unmemorable dialog.  Dramatics:  There were some very good action scenes, but the \"tender\" Lolita scenes I could do without.  I give the movie a 7 overall.",

She is so shocked to see what happens, and decides to be a killer like Leon for the revenge of her little brother Michael who is really loved by Matilda. Matilda asks Leon to teach her how to do the things, and she starts to teach how to write and read for Leon who doesn't have such abilities. By living together, they come to know each other.

            "content": "Leon is another film i haven't watched for years but when i originally saw it, i really loved the film. Of course i am reviewing the original cinematic/DVD release. For your information, Director Luc Beeson classes this as 'The Director's Cut', as it has many scenes deleted from the original test showing. I believe, two years later, Beeson re-edited all of those scenes back in. Apparently 25 minutes extra. That version, confusingly, is known as 'The Director's Cut', though Beeson, keeping in mind his view of the naming of his Director's Cut, calls this 'The Internatinal Cut'. Confused? This is a really enthralling film which keeps you emotionally involved throughout. Yes, it is a violent film in places but that is not what the story is about. It is about finding yourself and who you are. Taking root and allowing people in, when you weren't able to before. Natalie Portman absolutely shines in this. Havig been cast at 11, now 12, she is totally believable as Mathilda. It must have been tough to pull off some scenes at such a young age. Whilst Jean Reno is wonderful as Leon, it is Portman's portrayal of the character dealing with the loss of her abusive, uncaring family, while grieving for the loss of her 4 year old brother and her subsequent journey of revenge and finding herself just like Leon, that makes her performance so strong. Now, it must be said there are elements of an undercurrent of a possible sexual relationship between them both. Early on Mathilda shows signs of holding herself in certain way that shows a possible move into puberty. Take a look at the scenes of her hanging over the staircase for this. It is clear that as the film develops there is a growing love between them. Look out for Mathilda sleeping with the pig oven glove on the first night. A subtle moments, easily missed. However, the way Reno plays his character with a few learning difficulties, naivety and his reluctance to accept anything outside his comfort zone, the sexuality elements do not come across as dirty at all. There really does seem to be a developing true love between them and it is touching to watch at times. Apparently, The International Cut has more interactions between Mathilda and Leon, which i haven't seen yet. I must also add that the original script, which is available online, does have them making love. Again, reading the script does put it into context as to how she feels towards Leon and why she feels the need/want to make love.It is clear that anything outside of Leon's job and he is lost. That is the beauty of this film, with all its violence and profanity, and equally so the fate of Leon itself, it really shows the development of what one person can give to another. Gary Oldman's deserves much credit too. I won't go into detail about his character but i will say he is damn good. Watch out for the \"Ev-ery-one\" line, which i can imagine, if watched on the big screen in the cinema must have reverberated half way around town! A mention also to the character of Tony. We never really get any in depth explanations about him. He clearly is underhand, always keeping Leon's money and then only offering Mathilda $100 to last a whole month. The way he would say things and his mannerisms certainly suggest there is a lot more to him that meets they eye.There are so many stand out scenes in this film, all subtle, that it is hard to pick any individually. The film pretty much grabs you from start to end. It is a funny juxtaposition really, you find yourself caring so much for a killer!The soundtrack is equally as subtle and helps too by not being overpowering. The end titles have Sting's 'Shape of my Heart' which actually fits perfectly. The other piece of music within the film is the sublime, 'Venus as a Boy' by Bjork, which on first hearing/watching seems a strange choice. But on closer inspection he budding sexual overtones and growing feelings of the song match the way Mathilda was beginning to feel.All in all this is a good film. You care about both off the main characters. The final scene with Matilda finally telling the truth, albeit, so way out there and the planting of Leon's 'best friend' to take root, gives you a wonderful sense of knowing Mathilda will be fine and has found herself and where she wants to be. Equally, albeit dead, Leon's plant taking root, metaphorically gives you that same feeling. I will be searching out the 'International Version' just to add to the story but i would suggest the viewer seek out the original version as, having not seen the other one, the story seems to the point and well contained as it is.As a final point, as a David Lynch fan, i found one or two shots reminding me of Lynch. Maybe that is just me and believe me that is no criticism. It just struck me when watching.This is a film not for everyone due to the violent content but if you want to submerge yourself in Beeson's world and watch a film with some depth of emotion, then this is the film for you.",

The hopeful look in his face and the blank, yearning expression betrayed his feelings, but deprived him of his killer instinct -- a pistol followed him, and he did not even know it. Finally, the shot rang out, and the killer died at the end of the dark corridor, one step from the shining door. But I was vaguely inclined to think that the killer knew the pistol behind him, that he was looking for the dream he could not find anywhere, the dream that connected the corridor and the exit, the pain of this world and the dream of the afterlife -- it was death.",

The girl is lost, or a lost cause, both in her own eyes and those of her abusive family. Only her little brother 'loves her' and he is taken from her in the most brutal of fashions. The hitman can't help observing the whole nasty episode but is too knowing to involve himself, except, the girl has already tugged his heart-strings.\nScript and performances help to create a truly chilling tale perfectly (well nearly!) captured by Besson's direction.

Take just about any film in the Top 250, and I daresay that very, very few will have this massive a gap of opinion between that of the \"top 1000 voters\" (7.6 average) and the viewership at large (8.3 average).  And there's a very good reason for this; an experienced viewer can separate the virtues from the vices of this film, and this one is too long on the vices.  The set-up is great: merciless hitman is humanized, serves as protector and guide to young girl.  This *could* have been a great movie had it not fallen so flat in how it's executed.  Maybe it's something about kid actors, but the scenes where Mathilda (Portman, who shows promising signs of her deficiences as older actress) has anything to say draaaaaag on and on.  For any number of reasons you can imagine, the dialogue is cause for nervous fidgeting.  The attempts at humor make you wince.  The attempts at profundity will make you laugh.  The intriguing plot degenerates into artificial, sometimes preposterous, scenarios.  The highlight of the film?  Gary Oldman as the villain.  That should tell you something right there.  His flailing and jerking around in the police restroom was the most enjoyable moment of the movie.  Maybe Oldman himself realized that this movie wasn't to be taken all too seriously.  I wouldn't recommend the DVD version to anyone, as it makes the experience a grueling one.  A ridiculous restaurant sequence, among other things, is removed for the American release.  (Would have made for an interesting \"outtakes\" section on the DVD, at best.)  I gave this one a 5/10.  In the hands of a really skilled director and top-notch actors, this could have been great.",

Starting with the acting, Jean Reno aced his performance and really did portray the 'cleaner' profession, i really do wish all films based around hit-men could be like this, i really do. The writing, it sustained a brisk pace throughout the movie and plotted twists and turns in different places creating this fantastic film. But there is one character who i find unusually disturbing and this was Matilda played by Natalie Portman, Matilda was weird, disturbing and a little bit looney, but on the other hand she is still a innocent kid who loves to copycat and play games, yet she acts like an adult to lure Leon into her trap where who knows what would have happened. Matilda disturbed me yet showed me the innocence of childhood and that is exactly what a charterer like her should do, divide your opinion and question their every move. Then there is Gary Oldman, and he honestly was more disturbing, you could see the insanity in his eyes, yet he could be disturbingly calm or the complete opposite and we never actually get to know his character which i love to see, every film needs a character like this, i think it just keeps the audience on the edge of their seat just connecting the dots.

            "content": "Luc Besson's masterpiece Leon The Professional is a very excellent and unusual film that appeals to more than just action fans. This film is about the unusual apprenticeship of a hit man and a 12 year old girl who seeks revenge on a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman, who delivers a over the top, creepy performance here as main villain and scumbag). Jean Reno is a different kind of anti hero. Leon is a super efficient killer, but comes across as a little slow and socially awkward. Nonetheless, he is a professional hitman with ethics and gets his orders from mob boss Tony(Danny Alleio). Natalie Portman gives a good performance for someone so young and is convincing as an abused child from a completely dysfunctional family. This sort of story is atypical for an action flick, but was done really well with strong performances, tension and strong visuals and score. As a film this is very violent, but the world in which the characters inhabit is the same. The shootouts/ action sequences are top tier and Leon is a classic that holds up well. Leon The Professional is a original take on the hitman/professional killer genre and is one of the best movies of it's kind.",

It still captures my attention and I sit rapt, awaiting every familiar bit, and the inevitable new things I will see. Jean Reno is GRReat, as is Gary Oldman and and Tony Aiello. But it is Natalie Portman who shines so brightly as to make one feel almost guilty in becoming so attached, if only cinematically, to a 12-year old girl. She exudes vulnerability, toughness, and yes, sexuality in ample measures.It occurs to me after looking at the current bland and boring Hollywood fare of remakes and sequels, that now is the time to pick up Mathilda's life in a sequel (let's call it \"Mathilda\"). Now a young woman, out of school and perhaps in her own 'cleaning' business! I'd sure like to see her deal with Old Tony. Luc Besson must direct.Ah, but this makes too much sense. Hollywood would never go for it!!!",

Gary Oldman is the perfect bad guy, and acts well, and Jean Reno does a wonderful job of making the character's transition from not loving anymore, to falling in love with a girl who brought his feeling back. That girl is Natalie Portman, wow was she young. She also does well, although she contains the only fault in the movie, and it's not really her, it's the character. I know that Portman's character is supposed to be persistent, but it gets kind of annoying with her, but the acting done by Portman redeems the character anyway. The storyline by Besson is great considering other action movies, and the directing was so well done. BOTTOM LINE: A CLOSE TO PERFECT ACTION MOVIE THANKS TO THE ACTING, FANTASTIC DIRECTION, AND A SCRIPT THAT IS GREAT...IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER ACTION SCRIPTS....the \"You don't like Beethoven do you?\" is the best line of the movie said by Oldman, boy was he creepy.",

            "content": "It's rare to find a film that combines action with beautiful chemistry between characters. Yes, it is extremely rare...especially when your world is nothing but chock full of Hollywood over-dos and special effects that deliver nothing but wear-n-tear to film. That's why when you come across such a film with none of the outlandish buzz, and instead is filled with a larger-than-life plot and interaction, it becomes the \"it\" in your list. I have something to say about those who find this film perverse, pertaining to the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Yes, we're in a country dancing with skimpy excess, parading around our television sets and in our heads. This is a drama about finding a person who has become that personal attachment in your life and how it's become important enough to risk your life over, not a preteen exploitation on the psyche. This film deserves respect, and taking it for an exploit film is just utter disrespect. Anyways, for Portman's debut as an actress, she was brilliant. She's breezed through what I thought was an \"extremely\" difficult role to pull off; a distraught and abused 12-year-old girl to step into a hit-man's life and fall in love with him. Reno also gets equal credits in playing off a chemistry development between the 2; a lonely hit-man who's been brushed off without love, and slowly but surely, as a stiff, falling in love with her lively exuberance and her attachment to him. And Oldman portrayed a psycho very deeply, induced by drugs of the very same profession he's supposed to be up against. All in all, it was an amazingly rich film. It deserves so much more than just being a part of the Blockbuster back row, like an Oscar per-say. But sadly, it hasn't acclaimed anymore in America than just that. Seriously, watch this movie. Just don't expect it to be this big action movie, because it really isn't, though it has its few slick moments. I prefer to call it a relationship drama, which it really is. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll become attached to the protagonists yourself. It leaves an effect on you that you can't and don't want to get rid of; simply profound, sentimentally driven, and unusually realistic interactions. I have enjoyed and loved this film. I bought it and loved it. I saw the uncut version and loved it. Watch it, and maybe you too will love it.",

When someone tries to play an innocent character in a movie, I don't believe they can do it so well unless they are really a bit innocent. And hence my belief that the guy who plays Leon is somewhat of a Leon in reality as well and Mathilda does a carry a bit of Mathilda in her beyond the silver screen.It is an emotional journey of two characters. The plot, the story has absolutely nothing special to it. Its all about the characters and how they make you believe in the things they believe in. It is a performances centric movie and here are two performances in the history of cinema that are not to be missed.Leon just marginally hovers on looking like being retarded but does a fine job of staying away from that zone safely in the end. It is his personality, his love that sets him so far apart from the rest of us. A bit more could have been done to prove his \"professional\" credentials, but I guess that is all they could in the early 1990s. The movie has immense potential for action that should be fulfilled in a remake. Oh wait, a remake has been attempted in Hindi in a movie called Bichchoo, starring Bollywood's very own Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. Once you see Leon you will laugh your a** out watching Bichchoo. In fact, I think the guys would have been better off making Bichchoo as a true parody like Scary Movie or somethingThen there is Mathilda enacted by Natalie Portman in her debut movie. She is 12 and has the emotional leanings of an 18 year old. Her falling in \"love\" with a seemingly 40ish Leon is awkward, at least to eastern sensibilities. But no concession has been given to her age in showing her love and hatred and for that you have to hand it out to the makers.All in all, a great GREAT emotional drama. It is NOT an action flick or a thriller. So set your expectations right.",

            "content": "It has been literally years since I wanted to see The Professional and finally after waiting and waiting I picked it up for really cheap and gave it a watch. I didn't really know what to expect and I still don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. In a way I have to give it to the film makers because they took an age old dramatic twist and added complete obscurity to it. It's the Punky Brewster, A Simple Twist of Fate (Steve Martin), Raising Helen (Kate Hudson) I could go on and on and on. A little person (usually a precocious little girl) inadvertently enters a single man's life and changes him and that is precisely what The Professional is only add in brutal gritty violence, sexualize the little girl to an almost disturbing nature, and just make it this really loud and violent story about two very different people who find each other. None of this makes the film inherently bad, just very adult, and gives it a very ominous and disturbing nature. I think this is exactly what has made The Professional the cult classic that it is because it takes a very big stretch in a genre and makes it somehow almost comical and yet dark and gritty and really twisted. Most people label The Professional as an action film and it certainly has that but I think I would say dark drama with thriller aspects.I have always liked Jean Reno. He really is a versatile character actor although he has never really broken into main stream. He certainly doesn't long for work as he has almost 80 film credits to his name and has done action, comedy, drama, foreign and domestic pictures and even was featured in a video game. As The Professional Reno is perfect. He has this dead pan face that just fits the role perfectly. He looks like a loner and he is still believable as a ruthless killer with a history of his own. He commands a presence on screen and yet it isn't quite leading man quality. Ultimately the young and very precocious Natalie Portman truly steals the show as trash talking, street wise Mathilda. She really does make the film and she should have been heralded with acclaim for this performance although a girl of her age shouldn't be in a performance like this. It's probably up for debate but I think they do sexualize Mathilda and Reno's character looks at her as a daughter figure but also a wife figure in some ways as she does him vice versa. Gary Oldman is over the top and deliciously twisted and deranged as corrupt cop and bad guy Stansfield. He is a terrific villain and a worthy adversary to Reno's Leon. Even though Oldman goes completely bonkers with this performance, somehow it works for the film. He is stunning. Veteran actor Danny Aiello has a rather small and not very effective part as the mobster Kingpin who gives Leon his jobs and carries his money for him.Now the only other experience I've had with director and writer Luc Besson is The Transporter and The Fifth Element and I think Besson is a brilliant director. I think he definitely thinks outside of the box when it comes to tried and true genres like action. I mean The Fifth Element was sci-fi action and yet it has this strange obscurity to it that makes it a cult classic and The Transporter definitely has a certain style to it and The Professional is no exception. Besson goes for his own certain flare and he wrote and directed this film with exactly that in mind. I don't know who I would recommend The Professional to...action fans might find it a little slower than most and drama fans might find it a little way out there but if you're looking for something a little different with some decent to really good performances than The Professional is worth seeing or if you like Luc Besson because this one has his stamp all over it. 7.5/10",

Her neighbor happens to be a professional hitman. It started off excellent, but it went downhill. The girl had a crush on the hitman and professed her love. The man was uncomfortable at first (as he should be). What I don't like is that he didn't tell her off. When he \"told her off,\" he was only talking about his ex, not the age thing. I get that the girl was exposed to serious stuff that she wasn't supposed to see so she matured faster. And that she started this weird love thing. However, she was a CHILD! She most likely saw the hitman as her white knight so she fell in love. What I don't like is that he didn't tell her off.

In modern Hollywood everybody behaves just like nobody does behave. And here is a hero who is a professional killer - reminds me of a few other films! And he is supposed to have a heart. Yeah right. And a young girl who also wants to be a killer. I suppose it's nice to pass on your skills to an apprentice. I can't think of any other rational reason why he would go along with her twisted ideas. But of course there are no reasons in films like this. \"Who shall I kill\"? Whoever. He says. Then she becomes a sort of little wife even cleaning his guns for him. Ah nice. She was a good choice because she had one of those adult faces on a baby body and she hasn't really changed much apart from her body catching up. This really is one sick, messed up kid who any decent person would take to a child psychiatrist. And a decent person would protect a child not go along with her sick ideas. So thats what I mean about characters not doing anything like what even fictional characters would do. Stupid and unbelievable. OK the reluctant adult saddled with a kid has all been done before. This time it is not believable like the rest of the film. And why is he living in such rubbish conditions if he earns so much. No idea. Oldman as the villain does a good job as mr psycho but the idea he works in the Department of Justice is ridiculous unless it is a metaphor which it isn't.

It revolves around Leon ( Jean Reno ), a 'cleaner' who, when filling out contracts on others, is watching Gene Kelly films or watering plants. His private life is one of total innocence, as opposed to his grisly occupation. This life is rudely disturbed however when his next door neighbour, Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) comes under his guardianship after her family is slaughtered by one Norman Stansfield ( Gary Oldman ), a pill-popping, erratic, Beethoven connoisseur of a cop. He is the exact opposite of Leon; whereas Leon's a innocent in an evil profession, Stansfield has blood all over his hands in a legitimate one. Swearing revenge on Stansfield for the death of her little brother, Mathilda persuades Leon to help her obtain her goal, leading to a curious relationship between the two that sees them both embroiled on Stansfield's turf and sets up for an explosive finale.The Professional is a great movie because of the way it makes the audience think. It has all the action of a good Hollywood film, with all the quirks of a European film. It may not be ripping off a Fish Called Wanda, but it feels in a same vein of Hollywood shootouts and quirky characters. Reno is great as Leon, showing innocence at home and a sort of cold menace at work. Portman shows the acting talent that is still around today and their relationship, while hailed as controversial by many, could also be equated as two lonely people looking for comfort in someone. But it is Gary Oldman who truly makes this movie fantastic, playing a totally amoral character who seems to have no qualms in shooting at old ladies, while commenting on the finer points of classical music two minutes before. Even Johnny Depp would struggle finding this sort of menace out of a character while making him weirdly hilarious; it is truly his role and shows his versatility.The Professional is a near-flawless movie that never takes an easy road, nor paints things in black and white, and is all the better for it.",

Everything from the camera angles to the close to face camera focus scenes such as Mathilda's face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome!Also the Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Bj\u00f6rk is again very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie also contains one of my favorite movie scenes of all time... The bathroom scene with Gary Oldman... Gosh it's a treat to watch that guy act!The acting Trio in Reno, Portman, and Oldman absolutely smokes! 'Nuff said. Probably one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. You could read everything just from their facial expressions alone...In conclusion this movie is a timeless classic and is among a select handful of films I could watch indefinitely... (9.0/10)",

            "content": "Luc Besson has made a name for himself making films with offbeat story lines and characters; and this one is an addition to his list of memorable films. Wonderfully cast and beautifully shot, The Professional is a film that keeps the audience on it's toes from opening credits til \"The End\". Gary Oldman shines as the deliciously nutty dirty cop Stansfield, and there is good reason as to why this is one of his more famous roles. With over the top delivery in such lines as \"EVERYONE!\" it's impossible to take your eyes off of Oldman. Jean Reno is also someone you refuse not to watch. His character's ruthless ability to kill, colored by his childish innocence despite his career as a hired killer make him lovable and sympathetic. And the heartbreaking performance from the wonderful Natalie Portman as the confused and older than her years Mathilda, who is orphaned by the murderous Stansfield and is driven by a thirst for revenge; makes your heart stop, and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Though full of course language and lots of blood, the film is an enjoyable one; and a must see for Reno, Portman and Oldman fans everywhere.",

Cut off from society he goes about doing what he does best. His solitude life is thrust upside down with the introduction of Natalie Portman who puts in an Oscar worthy performance. The two embark on a journey which leads you to feel sympathy for the gun for hire such is his performance. Luc Besson gets it right with the balance of chaos and tranquility and its brilliantly filmed. Lets not forget Gary Oldman who pulls off another powerful performance as the mad bad cop on the warpath. The 3 characters are all fighting their own demons and twine together leading to an action packed blockbuster of a film. You've got to watch the international/directors version to truly appreciate the performances of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The film explores the bond and love between these two central characters. What you end up with is an action packed film which plays on your emotions. You'll be left emotionally drained by the end but well worth every minute.",

Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Luolu represents the weak, those who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon once could not protect.

But what drew me to The Professinal was the quick scene on T.V. when Stansfield (Gary Oldman) sends the SWAT team to capture Leon (Jean Reno). Unfortunatlely I only saw two minutes of it before the commercial came on and I was angry because I didn't know what the movie was.After I saw the film for the first time I was amazed how far and outlandish some of the characters were (more specifically Mathilda and Stansfield). Natalie Portman smoking, swearing like a truck driver, shooting guns, and drinking at eleven? Now that's a movie. The Professional is more proof that Gary Oldman is a perfect villain (aside from Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element). I always did wonder what that pill he took from his pocket briefcase was.I didn't know much about Jean Reno except from his supporting roles in Mission Impossible and Godzilla. This was the role he was born to play. Too bad I can't find any other films where he has the lead role. The chemistry between him and Natalie Portman is what holds the movie together. I found it funny that someone with the profession of killing people for money would be a fan of film musical actor Gene Kelly. I almost shed a tear when Mathilda changed the channel to \"Transformers\" (They need to bring the original back).This film makes my movie collection sparkle long with the other greats I have.

            "content": "My biggest take from this movie is that young Natalie Portman was a badass. I imagine a lot of people might find Mathilda's character as uncomforting but seeing as she came from a troubling family, most likely with no friends, her character arc makes a lot of sense for me. To some extent, she even reminded me of Wan-Chu, the disturbed girl from Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind (1980), both by looks and violent tendencies. Of course, she's not as destructive and might be viewed as a watered-down version of Wan-Chu, but she definitely wasn't boring and was badass enough for my taste. For me, these kinds of disturbing and troubled characters always seemed more entertaining than your average \"walk-in-the-park\" characters.Even though the plot is action-driven with a great premise - a young pre-teen girl teaming up with a hitman after an unfortunate demise of her whole family - this movie didn't really go too well with me. I don't know whether it's the lack of the X-factor that would push me over the hump of excitement or the fact that Gary Oldman's character was the only one that couldn't be viewed as just a redshirt character. The movie was exciting to some extent but the over-the-top plot was a bit of a turn-off for me. The ending was emotional but the shootout was a bit ridiculous. I know Leon is viewed as a professional and a threat but sending 200 guys just for him and the way it went down just didn't click with me.Besides what I mentioned already, I'd like to say that the violent scenes are top-notch and the romance, whether disturbing or not, was cute and kind of shows how easy it is to dream for girls of that age. I don't think there's anything wrong with the cast and their talent, it was just the key plot moment weren't as enjoyable as they could have been. If rating just the portion of the movie before Mathilda went off to the DEA building, I'd rate it way higher, or even if the finale of the movie took place by Leon saving Mathilda from Gary Oldman's character, I'd think the scenery would be greater to end things off.",

Natalie Portman is a young girl from an abusive household that comes home to find her family murdered and enters Reno's life seeking both sanctuary and revenge. Upon learning what Reno really does for a living, Portman encourages him to teach her the ways of being a professional assassin, and starts her studies under the hands-on teaching of Reno.Surprisingly enough, there is much, much more to this film than the simple misgivings and actions of a hitman who is forced to care for a young girl. Despite its obvious violent backdrop, the film not only chronicles her growth in his art, but also the bond and relationship that comes between them, not only as adult and child but also as father and daughter.Natalie Portman only seeks to be cared for while Jean Reno finds his love hard to give, finally culminating in the ultimate sacrifices being paid for each other - sacrifices which only love could bring about.The acting is done superbly, with Leon's childlike wonder amidst his very mature profession being played to a T by an incredibly under-rated actor Jean Reno. And Mathilda's child-like habits, yet her adult maturity being performed amazingly by an only 13 year old Natalie Portman, this film definitely is a must see, not only for the superb craftsmanship of Luc Besson, but also for the heart-felt story and its \"star-crossed\" love between the characters themselves.With support acting from Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman, this well-done film doesn't receive its due enough, in a time when films have lost what quality such films like these had.",

What really bothers me about 'Leon' is another form of child abuse: the 'grooming' of a minor as a would-be professional assassin. Hollywood revenge flicks are a dime-a-dozen of course, and they usually end up endorsing vigilante violence in one way or another. But what makes this film so awful is the application of this trope to the realm of childhood, and, further, its blank refusal to consider the moral implications of this stance. Sure, the little girl's family has been wiped out, and she wants payback, but is the most humane response to the situation really to help satisfy her desires, and get her even more entangled in the world of brutal criminality? The criminals are simply regulation scum who deserve what they get, and a little girl is deemed as suitable an agent of vengeance as an experienced hit-man. Leon is just as much a criminal and a murderer as the bad guys, but he is strong, taciturn and endowed with a sentimental streak, so he's 'noble'. No deeper reflection is required. Dress it all up in the odious trappings of fey Gallic whimsy (ye Gods, it's worse than 'Amelie'!), and the movie's nasty little heart beats on unnoticed. Seldom has a soundtrack got on my nerves quite as much as this one did. Yuck, yuck, yuck.",

I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I\u2019ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.The movie carefully drew the picture of the characters in the opening 25 min. In the art of killing, L\u00e9on is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, L\u00e9on.Then the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it\u2019s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like. There was this fascination and perfect chemistry between the two characters. It looked so freaking real and deep that you are taken away in the skin of the characters.The cast & acting was perfect: Luc Besson wrote the script with Jean Reno as L\u00e9on in mind and no one else. The role was crafted for him and he delivers the goods. He played on his facial expressions more than words actually throughout the movie. He portrayed the character as exactly Luc wished it to be. This is his breakthrough and famous movie.Nathalie Portman was so versatile in her role as Mathilda. She pulled up into a complex and difficult role. She was wonderful and prolific considering her age (12). She shifted between different moods seamlessly (An uncontrollable burst of laughter in the Restaurant scene and a burst of tears in the ending moments of the movie). She is lovable, cute, touching and has a lovely innocent voice. Still her best acting to date.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played. You will love to hate him. I won\u2019t hesitate to say that he was on par with the great Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker. His lines were a killer. He\u2019s acting was scary and funny at the same time. He's a freak. He is definitely amazing. Danny Aiello role as Tony was excellent in a minor role.Verdict: 10/10.Perfect. Memorable. Repeated viewings recommended & watch the uncut edition to enjoy the true potential of the movie. It still holds as my favorite movie after 14 years of existence. Never gets old. Glad to see it is gaining its due respect with time and still climbing the ladder in IMDb Top 250 ;)",

The movie has humor and a great soundtrack. This movies has no cgi which in my view is a good thing. The Hit-man who rescues a young girl at great risk which he understands better than anyone due to his profession, He goes against what he is and what he is all about because he cares deep down under the ruthless hit-man exterior is a caring human being and as the movies goes on we see more and more of this from him. Oldman is as phyco as it gets! Something he does very well and you know its only a matter of time before Reno and Oldman deal with each other.

It is one of the best movies I have seen.It is the story of a hit man Leon and an orphaned 12yr old girl Mathilda. Leon, despite being a professional killer, has nothing but a plant to love and a strangely innocent child-like look at the world. Mathilda, despite being 12 years old, is more like a street wise 20 year old. She wants Leon to teach her how to kill so she can get revenge on her family's murderers.\nTheir performances are absolutely the best. Normally I don't sympathize with characters in movies, but I felt for both these characters and the sad situations they were in. The evil cop was particularly nasty, so evil in fact, it's enough to make you look sideways at cops in future...\nOne thing that struck me while reading through the reviews was this 'sexual thing' between Leon and Mathilda. According to my interpretations, not once did I see any sexual chemistry between the two. What I saw was Leon doing his best to play the father-figure and Mathilda getting a childish crush on him simply because he cared about her welfare... and he was all she had left in her sad little world. So if you watch this movie, don't expect to see some incestuous or paedaphile-like relationship, because its simply NOT about that trash! (I watched the American version, by the way) Besides, I can't see Leon as a paedaphile...CONCLUSION: this is definitely not a movie for the easily offended or faint of heart. It is extremely violent, so be warned!!!!  However, it is an AWESOME movie with an excellent story. (Jean Reno is now my favorite actor!!!

There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable. He does that Heath Ledger's Joker type performance and is absolutely amazing as Stanfield, the one who murdered Mathilda's parents.The story itself is incredibly movie. By now, its a story that's being done to death with a bad guy falling in love with kids and growing a heart but no movie has ever nailed the idea like Leon. Seriously, the 2010 Despicable Me is the exact same story and is done horribly when compared to this. Leon is far more detailed. I mean, its not like Leon saw Mathilda and just loved her straight away. No! He tried to kill her during her sleep. He gets annoyed at her, he plays with her and he does everything.

He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets. Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a \"cleaner\" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother. Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style. After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial. (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.) After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment. He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some \"cute\" shots of his very pretty little star. One wants to ask, \"What's a nice Jewish girl (Portman was born in Israel) like you doing in a movie like this?\"What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot. Some highlights:The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, \"He's not my father. He's my lover.\" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills. In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, \"This is from Mathilda\" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand... (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review! Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "A strange film blending genres and emotions, made all the more strange because it is widely seen as one of the best films of the 90's. This is deserved as it brings together a talented cast and director with varied characters to a brilliant story about a hit-man who befriends a girl after her family is slaughtered by a local crooked cop. Jean Reno stars as Leon, in his best performance, the hit-man, 100%successful, professional, silent, but lonely. Gary Oldman is the crooked cop, stealing almost every scene he is in. Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, in easily one of the best child performances ever, conveying sadness and loneliness with hope and innocence, and anger and pain. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy.We are introduced to Leon, we see his mundane life, occasionally interspersed with acts of violence necessary for his career. His only friend is a pot plant, and his boss who fully respects him, exploits him to a certain degree because Leon is so quiet. He lives alone in a flat. A few doors down is Mathilda who lives with her abusive father, alcoholic mother, and innocent younger brother. They have seen each other occasionally in the corridor. Mathilda's father is in trouble with Oldman's character, and he is killed along with his wife and son when Mathilda is shopping. She arrives home to see what is still happening, knows she will be killed if she shows any emotion, so walks to Leon's door. Leon knows what has happened, and is torn between what to do. He cannot interfere, but eventually does the right thing. Soon the 2 become friends, and Mathilda wants to learn how to kill so she can get revenge. Oldman is looking for her though, and is not stupid.The film's direction is often beautiful, and it complements the story perfectly, meaning that the tear-jerking scenes, action scenes, and everything else are all the more potent. Although the action is brilliant, it is the scenes between Leon and Mathilda which make the film so good. We watch them grow together, learning off one an another, and they learn that life does not have to be spent on your own. There are many funny parts, most involving the fact that Leon has been outside of society most of his life. The training scenes are good, and it is more a story of love than anything else. Many critics mention a potential sexual relationship between the two, admittedly this may have happened in the future, but by the end the most important thing is that they have found a special person who can give them hope. The ambiguous and touching ending will pull at the heart, but we know that Mathilda can be strong now by herself. Although this is growing in fame it is still relatively unknown, but it is a startling film which everyone should see. 10 out of 10",

The popularity of the film got my attention, as does the opening 20 minutes. But it's the blossoming love story that keeps your interest. Besson will never be able to deliver a movie to be taken seriously due to his confusingly playful approach to film-making.

She wants to revenge but the killer is not only reluctant but against the idea being a perfectionist, a Professional.Considering this project was carried out to fill in the time due to delays with the Fifth Element it is debatably Luc Besson's finest moment as a director and writer.Jean Reno, plays the reserved and emotionally repressed hit man L\u00e9on who is unwittingly thrown into a relationship with a vulnerable young girl Mathilda (Portman). Both play their parts perfectly thanks to Besson's grounded script which gives weight and sentiment to the scenes. Occasionally the subject matter plays out like an opera or Greek tragedy, possibly one of Besson's most charming, emotional and at times tense films to date, not only did introduce the world to Natalie Portman, it showcases Garry at his best as Stansfield a disturbing psychotic. What's refreshing about Leon is the leads are shades of grey adding realism to the proceedings and avoiding formulaic characters. Supporting cast are first rate and give the film a backbone, (looking like a greasy spoon cook) Danny Aiello's mafioso boss Tony is notable.The outbursts of violence are we staged and hit man Leon is given some nice nuances avoiding clich\u00e9s and stereo-type killer trappings, the love of Gene Kelly, nurturing a houseplant and the rules of a hit to name a few \u2013 possibly paving the way for the slower paced and similar styled assassin in The American (2010) and many copy-cat films since 1994.Luc Besson's Leon is a crafted work of art which surprisingly at times tugs at the heart strings, there's also great action scenes, wonderful old city locations and a fantastic music score by \u00c9ric Serra.

            "content": "SPOILERSFor pushing 1,000 years, there was an almost constant bitter rivalry between the English and the French. Whilst this rivalry officially ended in 1904 with the signing of the Entente Cordialle, an unofficial line of continued rivalry has continued to modern day. In the build up to 2004's Football European Championships, television began to broadcast an advert for England versus France. This advert focused on a Frenchman and an Englishman contesting which country was best by listing possitive and negative aspects of their countries. This irritating, if slightly amusing, advert missed one aspect however. Simply put, it missed out one of the greatest things to come out of France in years, that is the work of Luc Besson. \"Leon\" is arguably Besson's best work, and it is by far and away his most well known piece of directing and writing on the other side of the British Channel.In this film, Besson has recruited Casablanca born Jean Reno to play the title character of Leon. Leon is a \"cleaner\" who is paid by his friend Tony to solve problems as it were and to kill enemies. One day Leon's neighbour is killed by corrupt Police Officials (lead by Gary Oldman's superb Norman Stansfield), and Leon saves the life of the neighbour's daughter Mathilda (Natalie Portman's film debut). As Mathilda faces up to the death of her family, and Leon faces up to this sudden introduction of company into his life, the two slowly bond as Leon shows Mathilda how to \"clean\".The beauty of this film, evident from the very start, is the way in which it is filmed. Given a rugged feel and a very dark look, \"Leon\" follows a lot of French film techniques in it's filming and makes us feel closer to the characters in this harsh reality. At the beginning of the film, Mathilda asks Leon if life is always so difficult, to which he states it is. By using the gritty camera direction and by using filthy, miserable sets, Besson shows life to be as challenging as it really can be.As well as the way the film is shot, the other joy of this film is the three main actors and their wonderful performances. Natalie Portman at the young age of 12 or 13, is superb in her big screen debut and proves yet again that children can be decent actors too. Alongside her, Jean Reno is simply glorious. With his little hat and his dark glasses, when \"cleaning\" Reno gives an air of professionalism (the American title for this film being \"The Professional\"), whilst without his glasses, his eyes show a sense of almost child like naivety. Reno manages to portray a character who is at times aware and at others completely dumb to the world around him. This mixture means that we find it impossible to not feel for the man as he is slowly brought out of his shell by his young friend.In comparison to the performances of the innocent Mathilda and Leon, Gary Oldman gives us an extreme, disturbing picture of a turbulant man with powerful tastes in music and an even more powerful sense of psychotic tendencies. Twice during the film, Oldman's detective, an apparent drug addict, takes a pill and shudders in delight as he receives a shock to the system. With the sweet bond between Mathilda and Leon, the evil Agent Stansfield is superb as a counterbalance between two sides as morality and what is right are merged between the evil cop and the good hitman.With Besson's majestic plot and directing, \"Leon\" was always going to be a good film. Add to this, some brilliant performances by Portman, Reno and Oldman, and it is no wonder that this film is sometimes referred to as a classic. \"Leon\" is by far and away the greatest hitman movie of alltime, and a reminder that sometimes the French can be the best at things.",

I enjoyed this movie, the concept was somewhat unique, there was bits of humor in it and overall it. I had never heard of this movie and how well it's done you'd think it was a more recent movie though I did look for the twin towers as they claim this was shot in New York City.The big issue I have with the movie is the little girl trying to get Leon to \"love\" her physically it seemed. It adds some humor and all but I feel if the actress was playing an 18 year old girl it wouldn't have worked as well and just been the cliche of 1000 action movies before it. It would have been interesting to have a sequel or parts cut out where the girl does grow up.Jean Reno who played Leon did a good job. I like how he's just an every day looking guy. Tom Cruise and all those wouldn't have had that right look for the movie. You really feel this guy would break into your house and shove a pistol into your mouth without any hesitation.Gary Oldman is the star of the show. I like the look of his character, his affinity towards classical music and when he takes his pills which I've got a few suspicions what they are he was just a blast to watch.

Or of course, one might just simply hate it because of the rather unpleasant characters which abound.\nI actually find the movie to be a very fine one, with an almost surreal sense to it, but with extremely human characters at the centre.  In fact, I'd suggest this movie needs to be seen after having seen \"La Femme Nikita\" to which it is a sort of sequel.  In that movie, a woman, barely an animal, is humanised and civilised by a covert agency, only to be forced to become an assassin.  In this one, a mafia hitman is really numbed to any humanity and has only the barest hint of morality (his only principle--he doesn't kill women or children).  He doesn't lust after money or women, has no family, and seems to simply kill because he's told to. Really a rather pitiful character--and we can partially avoid hating since he kills people who really seem to deserve it.  But having an assassin at the center of a film is a bit of a risk--why should we care about such a person? Fortunately, Jean Reno and Luc Besson really carry it off.\nLeon is almost catatonic at the beginning of the movie.  A perfect killing machine, with a numb fear of human attachment.  Perhaps the most telling scene in the movie is when Natalie Portman, in imminent peril, knocks on his apartment door.  Jean Reno is excellent at portraying his deep fear as he lets her in.  Afterward, his growing sense of something outside himself, of something to care about (other than his plant) is really the center of the movie.  And anyone who sees anything even remotely sexual about their relationship is simply wrong.  If anything, the connection is familial, or more specifically, filial.  Natalie Portman's character teaches Leon about humanity, almost like a parent.It seems as if Luc Besson revels in odd antihero style characters--ones we're really not supposed to like very much, but then again, liking them just the same.  Ones that are deeply ambivalent--with doubts, but strong emotion just the same.One thing must be said about Gary Oldman--he really is one of the better actors of the past decade; he makes every character he plays his own, and this is no exception.  His wacked out, druggy maniac cop, who unabashedly slaughters everything in his path, is inspired.  He's utterly contemptible in almost every way, and yet he's still effective.  Too often, villains are so evil they become laughable stereotypes.  Oldman avoids this where other actors I think would take the same character and make it formulaic.\nI'd strongly suggest this to anyone who likes both action movies and subtle character based dramas.",

But for all the guns and bangs, it's the human scenes that sets Leon apart. The tension as Mathilda waits for Leon to open his door having just walked past the bodies of her family will have you on the edge of your seat.Jean Reno as the aforementioned hit-man does fantastically at turning a cold killer into a lovable character. While we're introduced to him through a hit he soon discovers that there is more to life, without being at all sentimental. Natalie Portman does probably the best ever child performance I've ever seen, making her character both adult (she smokes, knows how to use a gun) yet still remains totally innocent. The chemistry between the two is just beautiful.On the villain side, Gary Oldman is just brilliant as the corrupt Stansfield, making you totally believe that he is a dangerous nut case.

Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film. With regards to other comments on the the 'sexual' nature of Leon and Mathilda's relationship, I'd like to think it was innocent, pure love and a lack of a decent father figure in her life, but I may change my mind when I see the uncut version!",

When I first saw the movie I thought Portman must have been a young looking 14 or 15-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old. I was wrong, she was a 12-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old, which made her character even more realistic. Reno (Leon) and Portman (Mathilda) have a powerful dynamic relationship throughout the movie as a hit-man and orphan who are thrown together in an unlikely circumstance. Their characters are so believable and fascinating, by the end of the film it felt as if Leon and Mathilda were members of my own family because Reno's and Portman's performances was so gripping, realistic and heart felt. Portman is a complete natural talent, she doesn't act, she plays it for real! The soundtrack in the film also hits the right notes. Try holding back the tears at the end of the film when Sting sings 'shape of my heart'. This is a movie not to be missed!",

            "content": "Leon is an immigrant hit-man who works for an Italian guy named Tony. He lives a lonely life only his plant accompanying him in his solace. His seemingly desolate life takes a screeching right turn when a neighboring family gets killed by crooked DEA agents. Only poor Mathilda survived the onslaught so Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing teaching her his skills as an assassin so Mathilda can exact revenge to the agents.Jean Reno plays hit-man Leon in this captivating tale of self discovery and finding that one person who gives you a taste of life. Director Luc Besson created a masterpiece. His style is unique, the flow of the story never gets in your nerves instead it gets in your heart. In the earlier parts of the film, the character Leon is established as a stone cold contract killer but as the film progresses, we realize that he is as gentle as a puppy dog. Mathilda gave him a reason to live and rediscover life again. She had given him and I quote \"A taste of life\".Superb acting from a then young Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman as the crooked DEA agent Stan was creepy as hell (as in every of his role). An interesting character sure and he's the yang of Leon's yin (or vice versa whatever). He likes his walkman (no iPod back then), he likes Beethoven...and Mozart. And he gets in a trance-like funk whenever he takes his green loopy pills. Leon on the other hand is excellently portrayed by Jean Reno. He too, is an interesting character and he will go down as one of the most memorable hit-man in cinema history. He likes his milk, he wears knitted bonnets because he can't afford to catch a cold and he has mastered the art of killing efficiently. A beast that was tamed by an 18 year old girl...13. Just like what Ann Darrow is to King Kong.Rest assured the ending will make you sad. \"Leon\" is a memorable film to be remembered from here to eternity.",

            "content": "How disappointing it is to watch a movie that promises so much but in the end, the product is eventually underwhelming, and your hope ruptures like a balloon when pricked. \"Leon : The Professional\" starts off rather well, builds it story through episodes of violence and cans of milk, but doesn't know what it wants when the action gets going. Leon (Jean Reno) is a quiet, reclusive hit-man living a discreet life in New York City. Methodical, smart and stern, he works assignments for an Italian mob boss, Tony (Danny Aiello). Leon has principles - he hardly ever watches television, always drinks only milk and takes good care of a potted plant which he labels his best friend. Leon's neighbor is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a brash and bratty girl of twelve, who has a junkie for a father and stepmother, an impertinent stepsister and a four year-old brother, whom she loves. Her father (Michael Badalucco) steals some drugs a corrupt DEA agent, Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) left with him for safekeeping, Stansfield instructs him to return the dope by noon the next day, a warning which the junkie coolly ignores.The next day, Stansfield and his team storm the household and kill everyone they can find, including Mathilda's young brother. Traumatized and angry, she seeks lodging with Leon, the only other person whom she considers a friend. Though reluctant at first, Leon gradually eases in her company. Mathilda wants to learn how to kill, a task Leon grudgingly accepts. In the process, she develops feelings for him, which remain one-sided. As time passes, Mathilda becomes increasingly restless to avenge her brother's murder.Director Luc Besson sets the events in motion with a terrifically tense action sequence early on, a taster of what to expect later on when the plot gets lurid. The prefatory sequence introduces the protagonist in a way that it needed to, with a barging camera that captures the detailed action with curious fervor. The characters are meticulously written and a great deal of attention is paid to level them out, allow us to get familiar with them. In parts, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, reveling in the little occasional doses of humor and heartbreak. Besson weaves the action with the drama skillfully, and though the film limps through many of the sequences, it's fantastically watchable. Boring, it is never. And the climax sequence, a great jolt of pure cinema, is masterfully directed. The biggest hitch with \"Leon : The Professional\" is that it is never the sum of its individual products. An oddly constructed assassin-actioner, there are long, yawning stretches of time when the plot hardly advances. It wants to be about its little protagonist but Besson resorts to not let Leon out of the sight. Which is why, I presume, the trivial romantic angle is introduced, a sub-plot which bears very little relevance to the actual story. And when it does get to its exceptional end, hobbles to it rather, it seems like a tediously-assembled downer. Shame.The entire cast is outstanding. Reno hands in a textured, peerless performance which is full of ferocity and feeling, a rarity. Oldman, whose character is dangerously stereotyped, steals the few scenes he has. The cocksure and amoral agent is a character we so often get to watch but Oldman puts a little spin on it and delivers an ace performance. The surprise package of the lot is young Portman, a brilliantly expressive, supremely confident Portman, who screams 'Oscar' all the way. I find it astonishing that a twelve year-old young actress is capable of pulling off something even forty year-old, experienced actors would sweat to clinch.\"Leon : The Professional\" could've been something more than it is, had it paid a little more attention to its fundamental storyline and not what would please the viewers. I find it galling that a movie of such potential is bogged down by its petty indulgences.",

Let it take you by surprise, which it can easily do because it is unlike any other.  I stumbled upon this film by accident the year after it was released.  I knew nothing about it.  I missed the first (attention grabbing) scene, and yet I was immediately captivated.  This was the movie experience that turned me into a cinephile.  I've seen Leon now many times.  I will see it many more.  I cannot tire of it.The time has come for Strat (me) to explain why this is the greatest film ever made.First reason: good story. This is not a gangster film.  This is not a romance.  This is an action film and it is a drama, in the best sense of both of those words.  It is a film that is both sweet and savory.  The adrenaline pumps, the tears flow, the laughter comes, sometimes all at once.  The story is fresh, new, interesting, even though it is composed of themes we have seen before.  The director, Luc Besson, has the ability to take a standard story and simultaneously give it a comic-book twist *and* a feel of realism that has impact.Second reason: Superb performances. It doesn't get any better than this folks.  Gary Oldman, Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello.  My favorite actor of all time is Harvey Keitel, but Gary Oldman is a close, close second.  Maltin has such a wonderful phrase to describe Gary's performance here: \"scenery chewing\".  Gary is an acting \"monster\".  He doesn't steal scenes, he devours them.  Some may criticize him for being \"over-the-top\", yet they seem to forget his full range.  He can be so gentle, so subtle, deliver his lines with such finesse.  And Ms. Portman.  What can be said of her that hasn't already been said?  Except perhaps that this was the best performance that she will ever give.  I expect her to have a long successful career, yet she might not surpass her work here.  You can only be 13 once.  Jean Reno and Danny Aiello?  Money in the bank, baby.  Absolutely perfect casting.Third reason: damn fine luck. Getting the right players together to make a gem of a movie is like getting all your [lucky] stars into alignment (no pun intended).  The right elements having the right chemistry came together at the right time.  We are all very fortunate to have this fabulous piece of modern art.Well, I haven't done justice to this, my number one film, but then, I knew I wasn't going to.",

I'm not typically a fan of action films because of their poor reputation for substance and originality, but this film had a coolness about it in the main characters that spoke to me easier than the other shoot-em-up movies.Natalie Portman plays a great role (for her younger days) as the girl whose life is on the list of the murderer of her family. She falls head over heels for L\u00e9on, who is a hired \"cleaner\" or hit-man, and starts to train herself to be like him. As she trains, she finds herself growing up in a different way, and L\u00e9on finds out what love and learning a different point of view can help in his life.I loved the moody music in the right places and the direction of the scenes was poignant and revealing. The story was grandiose, complete with backstory on why L\u00e9on started picking-off people and how his rules apply to the little girl's life, and it added the extra points onto this movie's reputation for being as great as it is. I gave it an 8/10 and suggest that everybody grasp the video behind Jean Reno's face on the box, no matter what video if might be (except for Rollerball... leave that on the shelf!)",

It could be called as a karate kid film...except with guns and assassins. I was left wondering to myself at the end why wasn't this film given even one nomination in direction or acting. Now it is considered as one of the best films ever made and is currently at the time of writing this review sitting at #25 in IMDb's top 250 list. At the very least it is one of the finest cinematic experience of the 1990's. Leon is a \"cleaner\" or a hit-man living in Little Italy. He has learned to suppress emotions and feelings and lives his life in a little apartment working for Tony, a mob boss. His life is turned around when 12 year old Mathilda who lives on the same floor and has been recently orphaned comes to him for help. Leon grudgingly helps her at first but soon discovers his own inner child. All the scenes are shot beautifully and the action sequences are well planned. The score works well with the film. The acting is superb especially from Natalie Portman who played young Mathilda in her debut film at just the age of 13. She displays her emotions well with her body behavior and immaculate expressions. She was born with the talent. Jean Reno (Pink Panther, The Da Vinci Code) does a good role as Leon, the mentally slow and emotionally dumb hit-man for whom you start to feel. Making someone feel for a hit-man is certainly not easy. Danny Aiello as Tony also gives a good performance and delivers as required.Gary Oldman does such an intense, quirky, interesting and terrifying role as the corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination. He gives an absolutely electrifying performance and the fact that he improvised one of the best scenes in the film proves his acting chops. The film is not for the fainthearted and the action never feels to be artificial or deliberate. The story, while basic, incorporates all the elements for an interesting 2 hours. It's a cinematic success about innocence destroyed and innocence reborn. The cast show that there is no substitute for good acting and you don't need special effects to make a good action film. While the accolades are missing, Leon-the professional is definitely a cult classic.",

            "content": "With the brilliant acting of Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman, and with the brilliant direction of Luc Besson, L\u00e9on: The Professional is sure to please any action fanatic or drama lover. From the opening scene of this movie, you can tell that every take was thought out and every take has a unique mood. L\u00e9on: the Professional isn't without its flaws, however, which I will outline later in the review. One aspect that Besson really put his back into was the characters, and it shows. A young Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a down on her luck kid who craves revenge and a parental figure to guide her through a tough part of her life. L\u00e9on, played by Jean Reno, truly is the star of this film. L\u00e9on is a notorious Italian assassin who travels on a path of self discovery throughout this whole film. With every word that L\u00e9on speaks you can sense a deep and daring combination of optimism, pessimism, and darkness. Though he is a rather quiet character, just the tone in L\u00e9on's voice shows that he is a true striking mafia man. Finally, the villain in this film, played by Gary Oldman, is a devious character. As the film progresses, your hate for him builds up inside. My one issue with Oldman's character, however, is that you cannot relate to him. All good villains should have a reason for what they are doing and something in common with the protagonist, in this case L\u00e9on. This was not present in Oldman's character. Aside from this one minor flaw, great, realistic but still awesome characters made this film what it is. As great as the characters are, when I think of this movie I will always first think of its incredible score, composed by John Altman. Every step of the way the score perfectly accompanies the mood of the scene. It is a perfect example of how symphony music doesn't just appeal to the wide arrange of 80 year old's throughout the world, but can also appeal to many more people if executed correctly, which it was. As my title would suggest, L\u00e9on can't be fit into one genre, but many. The action aspect of this film is incredible. With near complete use of practical effects and Besson's history in directing great action films, you really marvel at how certain scene's were created (particularly the end of act three, like holy crap!). The drama and emotional conflict in this film is also substantial. You can understand and relate to many of the characters in this movie, and really feel what they are feeling for a lot of the film (aside from the large number of people in this film that get shot, that would hurt like hell and as a result Besson didn't include that aspect for viewers). There is also a strange feeling of romance in this film, but that gets into spoiler territory so I should shut up! One slight issue that I have always had in this film is not what is present, but what is not, for the majority of the film. Unlike most other films, my favorite moment in L\u00e9on: the Professional is the first act. There is a deep feeling of darkness and actual fear throughout the whole first act. You get the horrendous feeling that something awful will happen, and it does. I would've liked to see that feeling of darkness a bit more throughout the film. Not the whole time, but I think that feeling could have added a lot to a few scenes. In conclusion, L\u00e9on the Professional is a gorgeous, musical, grim, witty, and brilliantly put together film. For this reason it deserves an A- (8.3/10).",

            "content": "Strange...that's the first word that comes to mind when discussing this film. It is reminiscent of the action thrillers of the 70s, I am particularly reminded of the original The Mechanic with Charles Bronson, both are about the strange relationships between a reluctant hitman and his eager protege. Though unlike The Mechanic, there is a strange sweetness to the core relationship of the film.Leon is often described as a child stuck in a man's body, and one wouldn't be wrong in describing him as such. Leon, despite being a skilled contract killer, has a rather naive and child like enjoyment for the little things in life. His love for Mathilda is not a perverse one, but rather a deep, emotional love that comes from something that is beyond sex or any type of physical intimacy. The chemistry between Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman is impeccable, there is a sensitivity in their relationship while simultaneously having an uncomfortable, one sided, sexual tension. Portman, despite only being 13 at the time of filming, gives a nuanced and complex performance. It's a performance that gives a taste of what Portman would later bring to her future career. She brings a maturity and even a sense of world weariness to her role, almost as if she is a full grown woman in a young girl's body, in stark contrast with the child like Leon.Another aspect of the film that steals the show is Gary Oldman as Norman Stansfield, which I still believe to be Oldman's finest role to date. Stansfield is almost comical in his approach, there's also a charisma and a glamour to his character that is reminiscent of Alex DeLarge, but also the mania of Tony Montana and Nicholson's Joker. Oldman certainly wears his influences on his sleeve, but allows himself to create a new character from them and not just doing a mere impression of those characters. Oldman has the difficult challenge of attempting to 'lose his cool' without becoming unintentionally funny. It's almost funny, but there is that creepiness to his character to where he becomes disturbing. It's simply one of the creepiest performances ever put to film.Despite the acting and writing being exceptionally strong, the film's other strongest aspect is the slick direction from Besson, as well as the action scenes, which I still find to be some of the best ever put to film. They are fast, electric, and full of energy, but never self-indulgent or silly. The violence has a point, as most good examples of violence being used in film tend to have.Unfortunately, Besson never again captured the passion and sensitivity that made this film so compelling. It makes me ask myself: what the hell happened to the man who directed Leon, and when will he direct another film?",

(*** mild spoilers herein ***)one of the main problems for me personally was the young age of the girl and her relationship with leon. leon does nothing to put he little girl romantic thoughts out of her mind. this made me very uncomfortable with the lead character. a case of personal values i guess.apart from that the movie had some very good action scenes, though the story on the whole was very unbelievable, the basic theme was neat. the action scenes were very stylish and had a lot of panache to them, although it looked like a low-budget artie movie.natalie portman's performance was very good but again although the character demanded it, her grown-up girl image was slightly overdone and the scenes where she has to revert to her childishness and naivette didnt quite come off. personally i felt that this was movie was a golden opportunity that with more sensitivity and without the cliches could have been done a lot better.a let-down 7",

The first scene exemplifies this:\nHow we don't see him until the end creates a sense of dread felt unlike any other movie. This is executed in the fear from dialogue and acting from the whole cast.\nThe use of lighting, or lack of, and compartmentalisation of information scared us as well as the antagonist.\nThis scene revolutionised fearmongering for a protagonist, from Batman to John Wick.\nThe way Besson creates the likeable nature is so simple. Merely by using the youthful connotations of milk and writing a completely unlikeable antagonist for the scene.\nThe opening and final acts are sublime but the second act let's it down just a bit. Not even that the second act is bad, but the opening and final act are so good comparatively not up to scratch.\nJean Reno is so good. He creates the caring parent idea with almost being friends with Mathilda.\nGary Oldman is so good. The nutter archetype is common but Standfield is layered and Oldman shows this perfectly.\nNatalie Portman, despite being 12-13, plays her role showing the child who had been forced to grow up to fast so wellThe nature of the foreign, indie-like director combined with American blockbuster for an overall brilliant, if not a little weird viewing experience.",

            "content": "\"The Professional\" was probably the first hit-man film I ever watched. I'm not sure how many, if any, hit-man films came out before \"The Professional\", but being that I haven't heard of any, they could not have been as good. Since \"The Professional\", other hit-man movies have been released, such as \"Assassins\", \"The Specialist\", \"Last Kiss Goodnight\", \"Bourne Identity\", \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\", and \"Collateral\". In these movies, and other similar movies, the hit-man (or hit-woman) was nicely dressed, clean cut, well spoken, and had seemingly unlimited resources. In contrast, Leon lived in an old apartment, he dressed shabbily, and had a heavy accent that he could not hide. Your affinity for Leon wasn't because he had and was everything you wanted, but because he was a regular guy just like you and me. You got a good feeling of the type of person Leon was even with the few words he spoke.You got an even better insight of Leon when he developed a relationship with Mathilda, who was played by a young yet bold and somewhat enticing Natalie Portman. The movie centered a lot around their relationship. Leon took in Mathilda after her family was killed by some crooked cops. She actually wanted Leon to teach her how to kill so that she could exact revenge. Mathilda was a multi-layered character as well, even though she was a child. As the bond between Leon and Mathilda developed and grew, and the movie funneled towards its apparent end, all that happened before with Leon and Mathilda steered Leon towards his ultimate act of self sacrifice.Leon's end game move did not diminish the movie one bit, on the contrary, it immortalized the movie. Everyone loves a hero, and more often than not the hero lives in the end after having saved the day, leaving everyone jubilant and happy. Very seldom is the hero killed, or more precisely, takes his own life just for the one he loves. Leon and Mathilda may not have been romantically involved, but they definitely forged a strong bond. Leon had some amazing moves in store for the team of police that came after him, but you can't help but feel that he could not and would not have been so determined if it weren't for his love for Mathilda",

This is not the case, and, it is a sad reflection on American culture that this is what viewers would see. In a similar vein, Disney refuses to release \"Only Yesterday\" as it contains a few references to the dreaded M word. Hello, aren't we over being Victorians?",

            "content": "Gary Oldman is a God. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's concentrate on some of the finer points of this film, in a stream-of-consciousness styled fashion. Great score by Eric Serra. Great direction by Luc Besson. Natalie Portman gives a standout performance here and she's going to get nominated for an Oscar before this decade (the '00s) is up. If I'm wrong, send a hitman out to get me. Jean Reno plays pretty much the same guy he did in La Femme Nikita but I'm not complaining! Oldman as DEA nutcase Norman Stansfield, gets serious consideration as being the greatest screen villain of all time. The uncut version makes him even more of a menace, for those who haven't seen it. The uncut version also makes Danny Aiello's character a little more respectable. I hated him in the theatrical version, I sympathized with him here. What the main difference is between the uncut and the theatrical versions is the relationship between Leon and Matilda. They cut the film down to avoid any kind of controversy because admittedly, some of the stuff might've upset a few ding-dongs here. I for one, think that the restored footage is handled delicately and with a sense of respect for the actors and the subject. Some might've found it creepy, I thought it was daring and original, without delving into the kiddie-porn stylings of a movie like Kids or Bully (which, incidentally, are both great movies if you view them from a certain perspective). It's not like there was any exploitative material here, it's just that Leon and Matilda's scenes are a little more intimate, I'd say. This is a movie to see, especially for film aficionados. Watch them both and you can learn a lot about filmmaking by observing the cuts made and what stayed intact. The movie might drag in some places but not often enough for you to freak out over it. It's a shame that this movie wasn't released in it's entirety. Maybe more people would've appreciated the intended vision of Luc Besson. Give this guy final cut if he doesn't already have it!

            "content": "Deciding to do a \"Auteurs in '94\" themed viewing week,I started looking for titles from well known film makers from the year. Despite having seen a number of his works,I've somehow always missed catching Luc Besson's most famous creation, which led to me at last meeting Leon.View on the film:Crossing the pond for the first time (to film exterior scenes)and the first of his titles to be in English, writer/directing auteur Luc Besson & his Thierry Arbogast thankfully keep their crisp Cin\u00e9ma du look stylisation intact, targeting the flats Leon and Mathilda live under being painted in over-saturated yellow (also the same colour as Stansfield's suit.) Locking on Leon teaching Mathilda his skills, Besson continues to build upon his glossy, low-angle take-downs,brilliantly tracking the duo round corridors taking out targets, which stain the yellow walls with bursts of red dots.\nHis first fictional film since Nikita, (1990-also reviewed) the screenplay by Besson takes the espionage assassin training of Nikita, and twists it into examining the relationship Leon has with Mathilda, after Leon finds his training to stay completely detached from others, (a recurring theme for Besson) to start snapping at the edges from his need to care about Mathilda's survival. Joining Leon after her family are killed, Mathilda continues Besson's major theme of strong female characters, with the loss of her innocence by being around so much death, leading to a confrontational maturity.Reuniting with Besson from Nikita,Jean Reno gives a gripping performance as \"the cleaner\" Leon, with Reno mixing a cool dead-pan Noir loner swagger to successfully performing another assassination, with a restrained gravitas to the concern of keeping Mathilda alive. The first time he worked with Besson, Gary Oldman gives a thrillingly maniacal turn as baddie Stansfield, whilst Natalie Portman makes a incredible debut as the mentally mature with a punk edge Mathilda, who learns Leon's profession.",

Maybe the gripping story or the wonderfully complex characters or the beautifully choreographed action sequences. Its a rare combination of action & drama and death & love that gives this movie a unique soul as it deals essentially with the good and evil of the human heart. The depth of the characters created by Besson is wonderful.First, there is the foreign Leon, the lead actor played expertly by Jean Reno. A deadly assassin, a loving protector, vicious cold-blooded killer, awkward quiet man. His paradoxes make him interesting and also makes the viewer realize that he is not good nor evil but human, which is always somewhere in the gray.The troubled Matilda from a broken home is played perfectly by a very young Natalie Portman. Her character struggles with her feelings of conflicting love & hatred for her slain family. She wants to be evil, she wants to kill but is still a child dealing with confusing ideas about love and death. Her strong desire for revenge is eventually undermined by her innocence.\nGary Oldman's over-the-top performance steals the show though as the crooked cop. Truly the only evil character in the movie, he is thoroughly menacing. Several great supporting roles (Danny Aiello and others) are also put in. The powerful action sequences are smooth, exciting, and interesting. Directing is top notch. High production values are obvious throughout.FINAL RATING: 10/10 One of my favorite movies and one of only five movies I have given imdb's highest rating. Its violent and deals with taboo issues and therefore not everyone's cup of tea. However, I recommend a viewing to anyone interested in film.  Noob Aalox",

            "content": "The nineties had its fair share of great action movies, such as 'The Rock, Speed' and 'Armageddon' and, although 1994's 'Leon' doesn't really contain half as much action, or nearly a quarter of the destruction and special effects of the others, it's as if it sits in some sort of 'Marvel-style' 'shared universe' of movies.Luc Besson directs Jean Reno as the titular 'Leon' - a loner-hitman, living in New York, happily earning his money by *ahem* 'removing' people from circulation. His life is straightforward (if a little violent) enough, until a gang murders the family in the next apartment and he's forced to look after the only survivor - a young girl called Mathilda (Natalie Portman). The two of them form an unlikely bond and he even feels protective enough towards her to confide in her as to the true nature of his profession and maybe 'teach her the tools' of his trade.The premise is sound enough to warrant a watch, but 'Leon' is one of those rare films where every performance is just so perfect that it can't be flawed. Although, as great as its two leads are, it's Gary Oldman as the villain who steals every scene with his delightfully manic performance.Like I say, there's not half as much action or high-octane energy in 'Leon' when you compare it to other 'action' films. It's more centred on tension and the drama of each character and their slow transformations from interacting with each other.Perhaps the only small 'criticism' (notice the quote marks?) is that certain scenes do somehow feel a little 'uncomfortable' to watch. These normally focus around the young girl's 'feelings' towards her adult mentor, but then I'm guessing the script is supposed to show the awkwardness that a relationship like this can cause.However, that doesn't detract from the fact that 'Leon' is still as watchable today as it was back then and it's become a well-deserved classic in its own right since its release all those years ago.",

A good amount style, mixed in with substance. But The Professional was a facade of such. There were elements used many times before;  I almost saw it as Besson wanting it to be a sequel to \"La Femme Nikita\" (Which I marginally liked) except \"Nikita\" was 100 times more superior to this. \"La Femme Nikita\" was riveting, even without the action, and \"The Professional/Leon\" wasn't.The relationship between Reno and Portman was laughable as it was pointless and contrived. Did Luc want to film a movie about an assassin or a pedophile hitman? Personally, even if this was supposed to be a \"work of art\" there was no message at the end and no character that you could stand up for.

French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It's in me, I'm a beast!\" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",

            "content": "Also known as 'The Professional', this Luc Besson thriller follows the bond that grows between a loner hit-man and a preteen girl who he gives shelter to after her family is massacred. The film features several well crafted action sequences, a memorable escape from a seemingly inescapable situation and an excellent pulsating music score. The best asset here though is the unusual bond between the pair, which Besson carefully works through; as an impressionable near-teenager, the girl goes from viewing L\u00e9on as a saviour, to a father figure, to a mentor, to a potential lover, to simply a caring friend, and a young Natalie Portman hits every note perfectly in her portrayal (consider the respect she shoes L\u00e9on when he asks her not to smoke compared to her real father). Jean Reno is also fine as the hit-man, resisting temptation to lead her on when in her 'lover' phase. Not everything about Reno/L\u00e9on quite rings true. His constant drinking of milk (in lieu of liquor) and his affection for potted plants are obvious devices to soften the character, however, his life philosophy feels real at every turn, having to make some very hard choices; he even considers putting a bullet through Portman's head in her sleep to end her misery. The film's best performance though arguably comes from Gary Oldman, more maniacal than ever, talking gibberish about classical music and setting everyone around him on edge. The surrogate father/daughter angle is, however, what really propels the film. It highlights the ability of two lonely souls to connect in the crazy, violent world out there. Thoughtful stuff.",

            "content": "When I first heard of this movie, I really thought I was gonna be blown away. An assassin taking care of a little girl after her family is killed? Awesome premise! Gary Oldman as the villain? Even better! Can't wait to watch it! And now that I've seen it... Yeah, it was good, but there are definitely some flaws.The films strength is the relationship between Leon and the girl Matilda. Jean Reno does a great job as the socially awkward assassin Leon, and its a shame he hasn't gone on to do anything big after this. Natalie Portman also does well as Matilda, and the both of them form a nice father-daughter relationship. I saw the theatrical cut, but I have seen the scenes from the international release, I prefer the theatrical as the international scenes ruin this relationship. But anyway, when the film focuses on this relationship and Leon's \"professional\" skills, it's great, but it isn't always focused on that. It sometimes focuses on the main villain, a DEA agent played by Gary OldmanGary Oldman apparently receives a lot of praise for this role, and I really can't see why. He is constantly yelling and making these weird faces, which contrasts strangely with Reno and Portmans more serious performances. Reno and Portman draw you into the film, and then all of a sudden Oldman bursts in and turns the whole thing into that remake of Bad Lieutenant (yes, the one with Nicolas Cage). That performance works only if the rest of the film is tailored in that style, and The Professional certainly isn't.But, like I said, it is still very good, and definitely worth the watch. Even some of the Gary Oldman parts can be laughed at over the ridiculousness of his performance. All in all, a very solid and enjoyable film. If you are considering watching it, consider this a recommendation.",

They all seem to mistake shock value for realism. Pulp Fiction pulls off the ultra-violence routine because it is about something other than the violence itself. Most other films of that genre, The Professional included, are almost comical in their melodrama.

It has great action scenes, but it is also an unusual love story!Therefore this is a very controversial movie. Between L\u00e9on and Mathilda, a forbidden love appears that L\u00e9on tries to deny. I don't only see it as a father-daughter love relation. Perhaps also some watchers denies that, but it stills remains in there. It shows the courage that Luc Besson possesses. Some would say that is a bad message, I think it is interesting and comprehensionly. In a situation like Mathilda was getting into, perhaps a girl would act like she did. Said about Natalie Portman: \"If you want an example of her divine acting talent look for the scene near the start. Ringing Leon's doorbell and the tearful expression on her face as she silently begs to be let in while a hitman looks on!\" commented by akira-51 at imdb.com \"Portman is masterful in expressing the anguish of a young woman will to use any means (including, reluctantly, her body) to get what she needs.\" commented by Bob-45 at imdb.com Said about 'L\u00e8on': \"I feel this would have to be Besson's best movie to date, with Nikita a close second. The acting in this movie is flawless, in fact Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman deliver what I believe are the best performances of their careers.\" commented by princy at imdb.com\n\"The acting in this film is superb. [...] In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief.\" commented by robbijean at imdb.com I agree with these comments accept that I liked Oldman in 'Dracula' (1992) ever better. The fact that Gary Oldman acts in booth of this movies tells a lot of his quality as an actor. Tragic that it would perhaps be Luc Besson\u00b4s last good movie. Rating: 10 of 10.",

The protagonists in the movie were at their best playing this movie.The build up to the story is impeccable as we can see a glimpse into the main man's life story. It does seem a bit waylay at first starting the movie but as the time goes by things are put in places in a very subtle and flawless way.Leon is more of a thriller which doesn't necessarily have the complexion to the story as one might expect but it has way more ingredients to the story than the genre of the movie itself. The slow-building relationship between Leon and Mathilda is very well portrayed. Leon has earned cynicism at the time of its release and it seems pretty justifiable since it shows a sexual tension between a middle-aged man and a thirteen-year-old girl. Although it shows predominantly one-sided attraction it plays a great deal in the story. However, judging the context, the tension makes the movie somewhat exceptional than an ordinary piece of drama.The thing which stands out about the Leon is the fact how the actors in the movie played a significant role to make this movie worth a watch. Natalie Portman was age-defying and magnificent in playing her character. No wonder she became a huge success in the industry. It's very hard to expect the kind of performance being put in by an actress of such a young age. Jean Reno kept the simplicity of the character with his talent. Lastly, the praise will remain unfinished if not a word is spoken about Gary Oldman's brilliant cameo. It was enthralling to see Gary Oldman at his best putting in such a flawless performance. This was surely one of Gary's best work in his whole acting career.Leon is the kind of movie that will keep the audience enticed and uptight the whole duration of the movie. After so many years since its release, I suppose it still remains worthwhile to watch.",

(like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious \"AHHHHHHHHHHHH\" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real \"cleaner\" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out",

Pot plant loving, milk drinking loner Reno is the antithesis of the usual testosterone-soaked, gung-ho action hero and with no glib one liners or macho posturing, he takes no pleasure in the mayhem he induces; he's just very, very good at it. His relationship with a young Natalie Portman is sincere, funny and touching, and although emotionally ambiguous (at least from her adolescent point of view), it never crosses the line into sexual creepiness. Complimented by an excellent supporting cast, especially pill popping psychopath Gary Oldman who is the perfect foil for Reno's solitary hit-man, and wonderfully scored Leon is easily Besson's best work and one of the best action thrillers around.",

It was Luc Besson's first American film and made Jean Reno into a star in America and started off Natalie Portman's career at 12 which lead her to do films such as Heat, Star War Prequel Trilogy and Mars Attack!.Leon is a simple story, an American remake of Nikata, and follows the story of Leon, a mafia assassin. It has an action packed start, showing how good an assassin Leon was. At the same time Mathilda is a rebellious child who smoke, swore, skipped school, but also abused by her parents and sister. However she loves her brother and both Leon and Mathilda had a soft spot for each other. When Mathilda was out of the apartment building a corrupt team of DEA agents led by Gary Oldman killed her family and she goes to Leon for safety and interrupt his very private live. Leon takes the girl under his wing, tries her up to be an assassin and she starts to fall in love with Leon. It is debatable whether it was just love between a father and daughter or something more extreme. Mathilda tries to kill the DEA agents who killed her family and the film leads to a dramatic climax.As I said the film works because it is simple and it focuses on the characters. It tries to be fairly realistic and is small scale, it could have been easy to make the film more epic but it wouldn't have worked. It also a fairly low budget and Luc Besson makes full use of it. Leon has been fairly influential, showing that these sorts of films can be made with an indie spirit and has influential ideas such as the Hit-man games. Luc Besson has directed the Fifth Element after Leon, which was his last good film and become a big producer, from Unleashed to the Transporter.Leon is a good film, especially for students the world over.",

Its not everyday that a wise female kid meets a French hitman living in the same building, and end up together, and for her to fall in love with him, right?This movie is utter fantasy, and has very few scenes rooted in realism. There are too many forced and/or comical scenes and timing for it to be taken 100% seriously - how could one take it seriously when the ruthless hitman wears his trousers and walks around like Charlie Chaplin? Many of the roles in this urban crime fantasy however are played well - Portman and Oldman are the stand outs.Jean Russo is a hitman. Not the James Bond type you would expect. He looks like a nobody. He is a loner. He has proper strength, not Hollywood/Advertisement strength. He is practical, yet comes across as simple, almost child like (he drinks milk, doesnt swear, doesnt smoke, doesnt have a sexual or social life, has his boss deal with his money and finances) - however he has ruthless efficiency when it comes to be a cleaner.Its hard to avoid the overt sexual tensions and situations with a 12 year old girl, especially when Natalie Portman speaks of losing her virginity to him, sleeping his bed, dancing around with little clothes on, and even performing Marilyn Monroes highly seductive \"Happy Birthday Mr President\" piece that she sang for JFK.Leon is the only man who doesnt cause her trouble or wants to harm her. So naturally an impressionable young girl who has recently went through a tragedy would feel this way inclined - still, many of the scenes will render this generation viewers a bit uneasy.I havent read it anywhere, but something tells me a bit of Oldmans character here had an influence on Heath Ledgers joker character - some of the nuances of expressions and timing of sentences are unmistakable.Most notable scenes or stand out parts are the bathroom scene with Portman and Stansfield, and the whole reverse revenge plot - the antagonist seeks revenge on the protagonists which leads to the finale.",

She finds refuge by her neighbor Leon (Jean Reno), who turns out to be a professional hitman. A strange relationship ensues, in which both try to take revenge on the corrupt police inspector Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who was responsible for the massacre.Together with Jean Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax, Luc Besson was a member of the \"Cinema du look\" movement in France. This movement was especially successful in the 90's. As the name indicates, form is more important than substance for members of this movement.\"Leon\" is also a film that is influenced by the \"nouvelle violence\" movement. Unlike the \"cinema du look\" movement and unlike the French name, the \"nouvelle violence\" movement is more international. It contains directors that use violence in their films in such an exaggerated way, that it is no longer scary and terrifying but rather laughable or artistic. Directors in this category are Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen and in Japan Takeshi Kitano. Also the Belgian movie \"C'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous\" (1992, R\u00e9my Belvaux, Andr\u00e9 Bonzel & Benoit Poelvoorde) illustrates the movement rather well.\"Leon\" contains much more violence than the other film I saw about a hitman (\"The day of the Jackal\", 1973, Fred Zinnemann). Let me illustrate the unusal way violence is used in this film based on two examples.Inspector Stansfield uses his violence in sync with classical music. Violence is used here in an artitsic way. It should however be noted that long before the \"nouvelle violence\" Stanley Kubrick used violence in s similar way in his famous \"A clockwork orange\" (1971).Leon gives shooting lessons to Mathilde by shooting from a rooftop on innocent passers by. They are shooting with buckshot, but it remains nevertheless very weird and even funny. Strange is also the way the spectators are manipulated in this scene. Most of them would feel sympathy for Leon because he is so nice for Mathilde, taking the fact that he is using innocent people as unsolicited test subjects for granted.The relationship between a 12 year old girl and a grown up man quickly arouses suspicion. This suspicion grows even more as Mathilde says to an outsider that Leon is not her father but her lover. Fortunately has Mathilde no idea what a lover really means and is Leon not so grown up as his age suggests. Mathilde even has to learn him reading and writing.",

Leon, a professional hit-man who finds peace on his apartment with his pet plant. On the other hand, we've got Mathilda, a young girl who lives trapped inside her own house, with her non-caring parents and sister, finding her only consolation in her younger brother.Trouble starts when Mathilda goes out to buy groceries. While she goes out, a group of drug-dealers make a visit to Mathilda's dad, also a dealer, to find out he has being stealing some of the merchandise. This results in the dealers killing everyone in the house. Mathilda returns, tries to ignore the mess and knocks on Leon's door. He lets her, adopts her, and they both become all they have in life, but Mathilda is seeking revenge for her brother's assassination.So is this a love story? I will say it's inappropriate to call it like that. Is it a family film? Ignoring all the violence, it might be a family film. Is it an action movie then? I think it goes way deeper than that, though the opening and final sequences are worthy of any Die Hard film.You would need to watch it yourself in order to draw your own conclusion on the movie genre.

            "content": "Set in New York, Luc Besson's film tells the story of a young girl who attached herself to a hit man after her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt D.E.A. officer. On forcing her way into his apartment and convincing him to let her stay, Mathilda attempts to persuade Leon to help her exact revenge on the killers.Jean Reno is perfect as the terse yet mysterious \"Leon\" of the title (also released as \"The Professional\"), a master of his craft who features in much of the deadly, stimulating action. Gary Oldman is way over the top as the evil Stansfield, the bent, drugged out, highly charged cop who'll stop at nothing. Young Natalie Portman is most enjoyable as the world weary yet naive and impressionable Mathilda, and Danny Aiello lends support as crime boss Tony (\"...nobody steals from old Tony\").Luc Besson directs with purpose and manages to create real suspense and tension, while supplying his viewers with enjoyable characters that are infinitely more likable than those in his flawed French thriller \"La Femme Nikita\". \"The Professional\" is never inspirational nor groundbreaking, but it is definitely entertaining.The movie's main and most obvious theme is revenge, yet while this remains the driving force of the narrative, Besson does not allow proceedings to become too one-directional as he offers up other topics of interest such as people's need to be needed and a child's need for a sturdy father figure.A surprising, not so predictable conclusion also helps this pic's cause immensely.Friday, March 10, 1995 - Quality Hotel Maingate, Anaheim",

It's almost as if, when he puts on his glasses and his beret he becomes a whole different person.When he's not working we notice how he struggles to talk to other people (like the hotel concierge) and express his feelings.Mathilda and L\u00e9on's bond is impossible to explain with words, but the way Jean Reno and Natalie Portman were able to portay it hits you deep in the heart.",

            "content": "Luc Besson follows up his explosive international success La Femme Nikita with another story about assassins and the resulting film is even better than his previous effort. From its super-stylish beginning\u0097a directorial trademark\u0097we know we are in for a full-on cinematic experience. From the word go we have stunning action set pieces combined with some genuinely touching and funny scenes as well as sharp dialogue but what makes this film so special is the on-screen chemistry of its two leads. Jean Reno as the soft-spoken\u0097and somewhat na\u00efve\u0097but deadly French hit-man and Natalie Portman as the ballsy pre-teen determined to seek revenge on the psychotic cop who killed her family. There are plenty of humorous moments in this incredible film and some memorable one-liners including: \"Somebody's coming up\u0085 somebody serious\". The underlying Lolita-style storyline is sometimes uncomfortable but strangely compelling and never gratuitous. Matilda sees Leon as a father-figure and he feels duty bound to protect her, however as the relationship becomes stronger Matilda confuses her feelings for something more sexual\u0097leaving Leon gob smacked and ultimately getting them evicted from their hotel.No can deny that this is an action film but whereas something like Die Hard relies on a basic premise and lots of explosions, Leon manages to fuse Hollywood's obsessions for all things pyrotechnic with a proper story and excellent script. Like all good action films there must be a bad guy and in Gary Oldman's Stansfield we have the epitome of bad. He is so downright nasty that he makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like the Fairy Godmother. It is never explained what pills he is constantly swallowing or why he must make such melodramatic actions in order to swallow them and this makes his character even more menacing. He is murderous, unpredictable and unhinged and not even his classical music obsession can calm him into any kind of rational thought. Gary Oldman, often typecast as the bad guy, shows us once again that he is an incredibly versatile and brilliant actor and it's a great travesty that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance.The complete lack of recognition this film received at the time of release is astounding with only the Japanese Academy, Czech Lions and C\u00e9sar Awards nominating it for prizes. Since then however its reputation has grown and Leon is now recognised as a true masterpiece of modern cinema and its director Luc Besson regarded as one of the most exiting talents to come out of Europe since the French New Wave. Not before or since has an action film had such a massive impact on its audience and with its reputation amongst film fans still growing one can only imagine in how much esteem it will be regarded by future generations.",

It amazes me how many movies there's still left for me to see.\nNatalie Portman was 13 years old when she made this movie.\nIt was her movie debut and what a debut it is. She plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is reluctantly taken in by L\u00e9on, a professional assassin, after her family is murdered.\nL\u00e9on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and learns the assassin's trade.Yes of course there's guns and violence but this movie has a heart and the intelligence and beauty of Natalie Portman's performance is possibly the best adolescent acting portrayal I've ever seen on film .No wonder she's had the career she has had and\nis the first person born in the 1980s to have won the Academy Award for Best Actress (for Black Swan (2010)).The 3 main male leafs in this movie are all excellent also , especially Jean Reno as Leon , his relationship with Mathilda is touching and sensitive and gives an award winning performance.\nHow can a professional assassin training a 12 year old girl in the same profession be touching I hear you ask ?, you'll have to see the Movie to find out.Garry Oldman such a fine Actor plays a mentally deranged menacing mob boss with demonic charm who hums Beethoven for thrills as he dispatches his enemies and competition and shows no pity be they man woman or child.Danny Aeillo as Tony , Leon's Italian friend and confidant is also excellent .Written and Directed by Luc Besson this is a movie not to be missed but be warned it is violent in parts but no more than any crime show or movie you'll see on television tonight.\nThe performances are all superb, especially Natalie Portman.",

Jean Reno's, Natalie Portman's, and Gary Oldman's acting was fantastic (It's a shame to see a talent like Natalie's wasted on horrible writing, like in Episode I/II. While I enjoyed both of those movies immensely, I hated the dialogue, especially between her and Anakin).I saw the uncut version, and from what I've read, the US cut (\"The Professional\") removes all of the tenderness between Leon and Matilda. Squeemish MPAA viewers who don't like the relationship between Leon and Matilda removed the film's most important parts (and for worried viewers out there- don't worry, nothing \"happens\", but their love is very well played, and quite believable).So anyway- see this movie, but the uncut version, not the US cut. It is one of my all-time favorites (on my top 10), and establishes Luc Besson as one of my favorite directors. If you haven't, also see The Fifth Element, and La Femme Nikita.10/10 - superb.",

Unlike so many movies in this genre, it has a storyline with depth and substance and well-developed, intriguing main characters who the audience can connect with and care about. That's always been rare to find in action movies but it is virtually non-existent in the latest releases.As the story in 'L\u00e9on' develops, the action becomes more prevalent, and the final half an hour or so is almost exclusively action sequences. It builds the drama and tension with great effect and holds your attention effortlessly. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are both outstanding as L\u00e9on and Mathilda respectively, but my personal favourite performance was Gary Oldman as Stansfield - one of the best portrayals of a villain I think I've probably ever seen.I watched the extended version of this movie, which contains a few 'romance' scenes cut from the original release for being considered inappropriate. While I would agree that a middle-aged man having a romantic relationship with a young girl is definitely inappropriate it was never taken too far, though admittedly these scenes are quite creepy and uncomfortable to watch.",

This is a good film and before I saw it I understood it to be an action-type shoot-em-up film that I probably would have passed on but when I viewed it on television I found it to Be quite well done and an offbeat and interesting and compelling story about the emotionless professional hit-man and his 12 year old neighbor girl who is street savvy and although she has a father and step family she is more like an orphan and a society dropout before becoming a teenager. The hit-man himself is like a big kid at times and delivers his role more through expression and body language than with dialog. The third central character is the dirty cop. French film heavy Jean Reno is L\u00e9on, Natalie Portman in her film debut is Mathilda and Gary Oldman is Stansfield star along with Danny Aiello and Peter Appel. Nikta director and writer Luc Besson has a mostly French crew of filmmakers with him here including cinematographer Thierry Arbogast who photographed the Besson films Nakita, The Messenger, Angela, The Fifth element and the soon to be released Arthur and the Minimoys. The great sound to this film is done by a sound team led by veteran Francois Groult. The production designer Dan Weil, worked with the prolific writer/director/producer Besson on several films.

            "content": "This is my favorite film of all time(I have seen many) and for that it deserves a 10/10. I love it so much. There are however flaws to this film as there is with anything and I will say what I feel those are. Most of them involve the Stansfield character.The Very Positives: 1. Matilda's Character is played so well that you think she's a real person. I find this awesome and it allows me to watch the movie multiple times because I really can't find any fault with her acting. Any other young actress I feel probably could have easily destroyed this role and/or movie.2. The Music. I usually HATE music in films. I find most of it to be blatantly recycled ideas or boring. I LOVE the music in Leon. Leon is a GREAT fresh air. Not only does the composer do things that aren't too typical, he has thematic themes for characters and easily rivals John Williams and Danny Elfman(though I can't say that about the rest of Eric Serra's film scores). The themes even bring Nobuo Uematsu to mind at times.3. Jean Reno's Leon character. On-screen this character looks so natural. And upon further viewings he still does. I have been watching this film critically lately as it's been out of my system from my initial \"wow\" and studying this character's face leaves me to find no flaws.4. The artistic camera angles. The director was VERY smart in his choices of shots at least in the first half of the film. This makes it very hard for me to even try to find a boring moment. And by the time the pace slows down you care for the characters so much you're ready for it.The Very Negatives: 1. Matilda's father doesn't take Stansfield serious enough in the beginning even though he should have been able to tell how crazy he actually was. I mean either, get the man what he wants or have your family out before 12 the next day, yeah. But It's believable. I could believe that Matilda's father could've thought that Stansfield wouldn't do anything especially in regard to his position in the law. But that being said, Matilda's father wasn't shown to be too bright either.2. The scene of charades starting with \"Like A Virgin\" from Madonna. I dunno how many times I have cringed watching her first charade. I don't feel it was necessary at all. The rest were cute and/or funny but the first one was kind of screaming exploitive.3. When Matilda goes to the DEA office of Norman Stansfield. He threatens to kill her in... the bathroom. Okay, maybe there's no security cameras there but that would be over the top and definitely lose him his badge. He could however arrest her for the possession of all those guns. He made the right choice in the end.The Great Ending: A man with nothing to lose gains something he can't lose. A girl that has lost everything finds something. This is one of the few movies that I feel actually portrays true love which is a word that is often misrepresented in our culture. Love doesn't mean kissing and/or a sex scene. It doesn't even have to and this movie shows that fact perfectly.",

The additional scenes in \"Leon\" masterfly flesh out the movie. This is now the most intimate and beautiful action/adventure film I've ever seen.This film opens simply, with \"contract negotiations\" between an Italian mobster and a hit-man. However, this scene plays right out of a Sergio Leone western. Complete with extreme closeups, clipped dialogue, and quick cuts, the movie grabs us from the opening frame. Following the \"contract,\" the hit-man dispatches roughly a half-dozen baddies in fast-paced and clever fashion. One the \"hit\" is accomplished, we meet the hit-man, the sad-eyed laconic Leon. Leon doesn't live; he exists. He's not cold, just \"dead\" of any feelings but melancholy. Into his life comes Matilda (Natalie Portman), a beautiful twelve year-old, far too worldly for her years. Matilda, like most girls her age isa child-woman whom has seen and experienced far too much, yet has maintained spiritual innocence, even if her body has been violated and abused. CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD. When Matilda family is murdered by the hopped-up, psychotic Stansfield, she turns to Leon for help. Leon discovers emotions he has forgotten. Leon remembers how to love unselfishly. The two most beautiful scenes in the film are between Matilda and Leon. In the first Matilda pleads with Leon to let her in after the murder of her family. In the second, Matilda, negotiates with Leon, offering to serve him in exchange for his protection and to help him avenge the death of her little brother. Portman is masterful in expressing the anguish of a young woman will to use any means (including, reluctantly, her body) to get what she needs. One can almost forgive Portman for her present blatant hypocrisy on the gun issue, given the amount of firepower she associates herself with here, as this is the finest performance by a young actress I've seen. \"Leon\" unspokenly asks you to reexamine your values. I loved Leon and Matilda despite Leon's trade and Matilda's bloodthirsty desire vengeance. The added footage in the international version solidifies the bond between Leon and Matilda, and, vicariously the audience. The ending, thus because as poignant as it is exciting.I've never seen another action film quite like \"Leon,\" and I know I've never loved a movie more. Think of \"Leaving Las Vegas\" meets \"Die Hard.\" I give \"Leon\" a \"10\".",

While there was a hint of infatuation for the French professional hitman by his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e in the first cut, it's way out in the open here.  Matilda's role as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is also expanded when she not only learns more about his business, but participates and assists in the hits as well.  The acting, which I found impressive originally, is obviously equally good \u0096 especially with Oldman \u0096 he chews the scenery so well you can't help but smile, even though he's terrifying.

I mean don't get me wrong, the film was pretty good, but I really do not think it is worthy enough to be in the top 250. Jean Reno seems rather goofy at times even though his character is supposed to be a \"professional killer\". However, the last 45 minutes of the film are very well done. I really began to feel for jean and natalie, even though their relationship was rather odd(a 40 year old man with a 12 year old girl). The ending is probably the best part of the movie, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Overall I give the film a 7/10.",

            "content": "My God this film is good.  Forget \"Speed\"--forget \"The Matrix\"--forget \"The Fast and the Furious.\"  \"Leon\" is the definitive action movie. \nWhat makes this film definitive?  It portrays the action realistically, while keeping you at the edge of your seat.  That's right, Luc Besson doesn't need to freeze the image and twirl around it to grip his audience.Not convinced?  Consider this: \"Leon\" manages to conjure genuine emotions between its characters and the audience.  You CARE when Mathilda desperately buzzes Leon's room to escape her family's murderers.  You CARE when Mathilda expresses her love for Leon.  You CARE when Leon sends Mathilda to safety, knowing that he'll never see her again.  How many action movies can bring you to tears?  There are some, but not many.What's that?  You're interested but need to know what else pushes it beyond others in its genre?  *SPOILER* Unlike Stallone, Arnold or Keanu Reeve's many incarnations, Leon is vulnerable.  He comes in tune with his emotions; he learns how to read and write.  Best of all, he obeys the laws of physics! Leon gets hurt and actually dies in the end!Aside from all these elements, the cinematic qualities are top notch.  One of the creepiest images comes when the targeting beams of sniper rifles penetrate Leon's apartment, searching for him like Death's sickle.The acting is also fantastic.  Jean Reno gives a subtle performance that says more in his simple mannerisms that all the melodrama of the Matrix. Natalie Portman gives a convincing performance as Mathilda.  (Sadly, her acting's gotten worse with age.)  Gary Oldman delivers as the corrupt cop. It's a typical role for him, so he couldn't have performed badly.If all this has caught your fancy, I suggest that you view the film titled \"Leon\" and NOT the film titled \"The Professional.\"  \"Leon\" is the European cut and changes the relationship between Leon and Mathilda significantly. Whereas \"The Professional\" portrays them as 'father and daughter,' \"Leon\" portrays them as 'lovers.'  It's clear why \"Leon\" recieved a cut for its U.S. release since there hasn't been a film with such a risque underage romance since Kubrick's \"Lolita.\"In short, if you enjoy action movies with lots of gore and violence, then saddle up for \"Leon.\"  Likewise, if you enjoy (in a word) \"cinema,\" then saddle that same horse.",

While it does a reasonable job providing context, it does so with too many holes.2. The switching from violence to playfulness works most of the time, but also fumbles enough to notice.3. Some of the sub-plots just don't hold up; they should have been radically edited or omitted.ACTING:\nThe acting IS this film. While Reno is fine, he's largely himself. The standouts ring clear and loud:1. Gary Oldman proves time and again that his acting talent is \"A\" grade and his range quite wide.2. Portman was the star of this film, without question. For a child actress, there were / are none better.Frankly, she's the principal reason this film holds up well. Without her, this would be dull tripe.ENTERTAINMENT:\nThis has moderate -> good entertainment value, but it's bloody, so be forewarned.TEMPO:\nPretty goodCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nIt's NYC, so don't expect more than buildings, people, and cars.DIRECTING / WRITING:\nDirector: When directors also write and co-produce their work it's usually a fat failure. Besides, the French\njust make poor or uninteresting film. But Besson did a good job here, though the mix with US staff may have\nhelped.Writers: Besson's writing skills are \"iffy\" for me, with films like: \"The Fifth Element\" (1997) and \"The Transporter\" (2002)\nbeing what I'd call \"B\" grade, stupid male flicks. His film \"Taken\" (2008) was a decent gut-flick, but probably having Neeson\nkept it from being a complete waste.Is it a good film? Yes.Should you watch this once? Maybe, but only if you don't mind a lot of blood, violence and vulgarity.Rating: 7.8.",

            "content": "I just saw \"Leon\" on DVD. Missed it in the theaters. I read some reviews (now, in late 2001), and noticed that some respected reviewers were properly concerned about the young age of the heroine, the then 12 year-old Natalie Portman. Funnily, those 1994 concerns were washed away by events since 1994. Natalie grew up: Now she's un-twisted, wholesome, and gorgeous (and adult). Luc Besson, the director, made \"The Fifth Element,\" among others. With \"Element\" we see a definite trend emerging in Besson's work. Some of the scenes in \"Leon\" were EXACTLY like some of the scenes in \"Element\"-- same Moroccan music, same words, similar casting, same vibe.Not that it's a bad thing. Just notice that with \"Leon\" in 1994, critics were trying to get a \"fix\" on Besson, talking about \"Leon\" in terms of \"La Femme Nakita.\" That put an entirely different spin of \"Leon.\" But with subsequent movies, we can now re-position Besson's stuff, and understand his movies, including \"Leon,\" better.So, think of this: \"La Femme Nakita\" was Besson's whole thing applied to politics and spies. \"Leon\" is is Besson upon crime, love (especially the wholesome filial). \"Fifth Element\" is Besson on Sci-Fi, and \"The Messenger\" is Besson on culture, and native French pride (and not a very good movie, either).\"Leon\" was good, especially with Reno and Portman. The New York City, and NYPD aspect was SO impossible and foreign to any conceivable reality, that it seemed to be taking place in Morocco, or Frankfurt, or Paris, or ANYWHERE but in the U.S. (for my foreign friends-- trust me, the police behavior is not even remotely akin to reality, thus was peculiar and odd, rather than exciting. Couldn't happen!) Note-- bad things CAN happen-- just the fantasies of Paris-born Besson were so far removed as to be silly. His far-reaching and ungrounded imaginations worked best in \"The Fifth Element,\" because as a sci-fi world, there IS no standard of expectation or other reality-tempering structure.Besson's all right. OK. Just know that all of his cinematic expressions sure seem to emerge from the same distinct, and fantasy-based, vision. That can be refreshing!",

This is a love story about a 40 year old hit man Leon (Jean Reno) who gets involved by giving refuge to a 12 year old young girl Mathilda (Natalie Portman) whose family is killed by crazy drug cop Norman (Gary Oldman). Leon teaches Mathilda the job of an assassin, and takes revenge on the people who killed Mathilda's family.Even though the plot is simple the narrative is brilliant. It shows a tender relationship of 40 year old man with 12 year old girl. It sounds very corny! Is not it? But the execution of those tender scenes is handled with good apt. Some scenes and parts do go over the top and are less convincing but the growing up young girl's angle on love and the infatuation towards a fatherly figure is shown well.The story also unfolds not in the usual line of revenge drama, nor does it take you in the showing many characters and blood and gore of routine mafia films. There are calm and dramatic moments in the film. The camera work, music and direction are top class.Luc Besson as the director of this movie has done a fantastic job. The casting of Jean Reno \u0096 though looks a bit odd \u0096 I think is perfect. Jean delivers the role with that isolation psyche syndrome who finds it difficult to relate to a young girl, but still has feelings and emotions in him.The actions sequences are well drafted and shot. Some of them are brilliant \u0096 just for the big screen viewing.Towards the end of the movie, you want to see Leon and Mathilda meet again for the last time. Does it happen? For that you need to see the movie and decide.I will go for 7.75 stars out of 10 for this movie. Good one! (Stars 7.75 out of 10)",

Thankfully there is Leon.Leon (Jean Reno) is a professional hit-man in New York City. He is the best in town and in such a big city, there is a lot of work for him. The opening job is phenomenal and really sets the tone for the movie. Reno is very intimidating as the skilled assassin. But how a man who never thinks twice about killing a man could show some tenderness? Well all he needed was little Matilda played by a teenage munchkin named Natalie Portman After her family is murdered due to drug reasons, she must take refuge in Leon's apartment or else she will be found and killed as well. Although she hated her family and thought that she would one day do the same to them, she is distraught over the death over her four year old brother who was young and innocent like herself. Now she wants to know how to get redemption and \"justice\" for the slaying of her family.Her number one target is a man by the name of Stansfield (Gary Oldman), a man more vicious than Leon. He doesn't care who the barrel of his gun is pointed at just as long as it hits. With Matilda clinging to Leon day and night, he decides to give into her requests of becoming a \"cleaner\" like him. Along with Leon's favorite plant that he calls his best friend, the two learn much from each other. Now we have a Karate Kid interaction with Leon teaching her what seems to be useless things, but in the end they all pay off.Leon is a phenomenal film that takes us on a joy ride through New York City with the best hit-man and his young apprentice. Portman's film debut is a foreshadowing of her career to follow. Her stellar performance is very appropriate for the movie. Her character has had to be tough and smart her whole life and she really opens up to the audience. Reno's character is a complex one and he plays it very well. His foreign dialect and lack thereof charisma create a person that is both likable and mysterious. Oldman's menacing ways make him a despicable character and very powerful. Although he is a lot like Leon there is one difference: heart.Leon is an incredible experience and a great movie to watch anytime. It has action, drama, and comedy. It's not a big blockbuster action film or a depressing drama or a laugh out loud riot. Leon is a key piece to any movie lover's collection. This movie isn't for everyone.

Leon the professional is an intense action/violence film that involves two souls that differ in age and view of life. It delivers an exciting screenplay, wonderful performance by both leads and the eventual climatic ending. Even though it seem mostly likely the movie will end the way it did, the way Luc Besson pulled it off was eventful enough for you to respect Leon (the hit man) as truly a professional.Luc Besson is the man behind the movies Taken (2008) and Taken 2 (2012), and this movie is an extension of a movie that he did in 1990 titled Nikita which also starred Jean Reno.Leon the professional was done in 1994 and directed by Luc Besson and it was met with favorable reviews, although disturbing as it may seeing a young child like Portman in such a situation as her character found herself.The movie plot is about a hit man named Leon (Jean Reno), who didn't know how to read or write but what he knew he knew well he was a killer and the best at it.Leon's path crossed with one little girl who lived in an apartment some rooms from his, he took a caring into her and tried to help her when he can. Her name is Matilda (Natalie Portman) who living with her father, brother, step mom and step sister.Matilda is always getting a regular biting from her father which made Leon take pity on her, she saw this pity as love and the little 12 year old decided to run an errand for Leon, when she gets back her whole family has been murdered and the killers were still about.Here is my favorite scene in the movie, when Matilda sees her family dead she walks past the men with the guns, didn't start screaming goes to Leon's door, her back turned to the gun men and pressed the bell, praying hard that Leon will just let her in, the moment Leon opened the door, his life changed forever.Another thing to look out for is Gary Oldman, his performance in this movie is worth talking about as it was one worth his pay.This tragic thriller, revolves around a love between two people not meant for each other, their involvement with each other brought death to the life of many.Leon is a nice film, something that you will enjoy, no pedophilia is in this movie mind you, so fear not and go see it.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Luc Bessons greatest Hollywood film and perhaps the best action film ever. This is an action film with a heart. It has an engaging plot, interesting characters and relationships that develop and also where a lot of action films fall short, it has brilliant acting. The film is so thrilling. It is desperately tragic and also funny, its exciting and chilling. How a film can be so diverse and work well is beyond me. At times you'll be nearing tears in moments of tragedy and they will be seemlessly followed by moments of heart warming humour. The cast are all very good. Jean Reno is brilliant as the rather simple minded foreigner who at the start of the film cannot read but can kill as effectively as an A-bomb. Natalie Portman puts in one of the greatest child performances ever, the greatest in my opinion would be Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense the film which should have earned him an oscar, and only his age perhaps denied him of that. Portman has rightfully been launched as a top actress since this film, including parts in the Star Wars saga which is the dream job of many an actor/actress and wannabe film star. Also in a scene stealing show is the versatile actor Gary Oldman, he is scary as the corrupt police officer with a drug problem, Oldman is so beleivable I'd almost be too scared to meet him if the chance were to arrise. This film is a definite classic. The action scenes are very good and the music is also great. You'll laugh, cry and be on the edge of your seat in this movie. The developent of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is engrossing, it never drifts into the realms of Lolita, it seems more like they see each other as family despite the fact Matilda is enfatuated with Leon. This film is a must see! 10/10",

            "content": "I had seen this movie a few years ago on t.v and thought it was certainly a good movie, but you know how t.v treats movies with editing. I had the feeling I was missing out. I picked a copy of this up at a store nearby and put it in my DVD player. It's still in there. First of all Jean Reno as the character Leon is extremely subtle, nervous, and somewhat unsure in anything other than his job as a \"cleaner\" (In a good way). He hardly ever knows how to portray his emotions. In the scene where he asks Tony if he could give some of his money to someone to \"Help out\" is the perfect example.Although Leon is unsure about his emotions, he comes out of his emotional shell at times with the help of Natalie Portman's character Mathilda. Mathilda is a 12 year old girl who's family has been killed, and looks to Leon as comfort. All of the scenes between these two are one of the main reasons to see this movie. The Water fight scene is a good one. And of course there is Gary Oldman who plays the crooked, murdering, classical loving DEA officer that kills Mathilda's family. He kicks so much ass it's sickening. When he blasts open the door to Mathilda's home with the shotgun is just awesome. As evil and crooked as he is, he also seems to be broken and be battling his own demons(refer to his little pill things). Also he gives an Oscar worthy talk with Natalie Portman in a men's room. The supporting cast is also good, but the three leads are the major driving force of this movie. It's just so great i'm going to tell you to buy it and love it. So....go buy Leon and love it.",

            "content": "Besson seems fascinated by the \"Pygmalion\" story, by the notion of a feral street person who is transformed by education. He crosses that with what seems to be an obsession with women who kill as a profession. These are interesting themes, and if \"The Professional\" doesn't work with anything like the power of \"La Femme Nikita,\" it is because his heroine is 12 years old, and we cannot persuade ourselves to ignore that fact. It colors every scene, making some unlikely and others troubling. The film opens with one of those virtuoso shots which zips down the streets of New York and in through a door, coming to a sudden halt at a plate of Italian food and then looking up at its owner. Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated \"cleaner,\" or professional hit-man. We see him at work, in opening scenes of startling violence and grim efficiency. In the course of the movie, Leon will, in effect, adopt his neighbor Matilda (Natalie Portman), a tough, streetwise, 12-year old girl. She escapes to Leon's nearby apartment after her family has been wiped out by a crooked top DEA enforcer named Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who wants to kill her too. Matilda wants to hire Leon to avenge the death of her little brother; in payment, she offers to do his laundry. Leon wants nothing to do with the girl, but she insists, and attaches herself like a leech. Eventually she develops an ambition to become a cleaner herself. And their fate plays out like those of many another couple on the lam, although with that 30-year age difference. Matilda is played with great resourcefulness by Portman, who is required by the role to be, in a way, stronger than Leon. She has seen so many sad and violent things in her short life, and in her dysfunctional family, that little in his life can surprise her. She's something like the Jodie Foster character in \"Taxi Driver,\" old for her years. Yet her references are mostly to movies: \"Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone,\" she tells him. \"Thelma and Louise didn't work alone. And they were the best.\" (To find a 12-year old in 1994 who knows \"Bonnie and Clyde\" is so extraordinary that it almost makes everything else she does plausible.) So Leon finds himself saddled with a little sidekick, just when the manic Stansfield is waging a personal vendetta against him. Although \"The Professional\" bathes in grit and was shot in the scuzziest locations New York has to offer, it's a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture. Besson's visual approach gives it a European look; he finds Paris in Manhattan. That air of slight displacement helps it get away with various improbabilities, as when Matilda teaches Leon to read (in a few days, apparently), or when Leon is able to foresee the movements of his enemies with almost psychic accuracy. This gift is useful during several action sequences in \"The Professional,\" when Leon, alone and surrounded by dozens if not hundreds of law officers, is able to conceal himself in just such a way that when the cops enter an apartment in just such a manner, he can swing down from the ceiling, say, and blast them. Or he can set a trap for them. Or he can apparently teleport himself from one part of an apartment to another; they think they have him cornered, but he's behind them. So many of the movie's shoot-outs unfold so conveniently for him that they seem choreographed. The Oldman character sometimes seems to set himself up to be outsmarted, while trying to sneak up on Leon in any way not actually involving chewing through the scenery. The premise \"La Femme Nikita\" was that its heroine began as a thoroughly uncivilized character without a decent bone in her body, and then, after society exploited her savagery, she was slowly civilized through the love of a good, simple man. \"The Professional\" uses similar elements, rearranged. It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted. But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. In a more serious movie, or even in a human comedy like Cassavetes' \"Gloria,\" the child might not have been out of place. But in what is essentially an exercise - a slick urban thriller - it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.",

So when Portman adds herself to his bizarre and spartan household (milk and that little flower is all he ever cares for), his world is naturally turned upside-down.Portman is one of those actors who will become really big, because very early she showed signs of talent that some adult actors still lack (read Christian Slater and Keanu Reeves).

We know it well and viewed it again tonight, and so there were no surprises for us, but this one literally plays like a symphony (and we don't like classical music) with the anticipation growing powerfully with each scene. It is an extremely powerful - and extremely satisfying - cinematic experience, Busson showing clearly here that if he really wants to, and if he's on a winning streak, he has a lot to teach the fat cats in Hollywood.It's extremely violent - extremely - but it's not a 'Sly Stallone throw it in your face look how cool I am' violence. No, the violence here is 'dramatic' - 'tragic'. Besson builds on the contrasts between tender emotions, innocence, and the bile and vile of the earth.Everyone's praised Portman for her work here. Everyone is over the top great. The story itself is magical. But it wasn't until tonight we saw how much detailed meticulous crafting went into this one, how each and every scene was perfectly planned and perfectly filmed, how the story line coordinated with the music - this is undoubtedly one very professional, one very successful attempt at movie-making.You can almost see Besson standing there with an easel and a paintbrush, going over the entire canvas, brushing up every detail until the overall impression is 'perfection'. Not all of Besson's efforts have been as good. After Nikita he probably wanted to make sure he'd never get ripped off again - and so made this one.We don't normally go gaga over Eric Serra's music but in this one he's spot on.Those who have recognised the quality of the art in this movie, despite its overboard violence, have most likely seen the same things we have.One of the best made movies you'll likely ever see.PS.

            "content": "The lives of a professional killer and a little girl become entwined after a soft spot in the assassin's stony heart is exposed. The film has its reputation as an action movie (well it's about a contract killer), but the ninja-esque killing sequences are there to serve the plot, which they actually do, and well. Most of the movie is about building the relationship between the protagonists L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman).L\u00e9on has a realistic, but classy approach: there's no blood showers, slowed time, nor any other special effects involved in the action, or in anything else in the movie. I think this is to highlight the significance of death, both to the protagonist characters and to the audience. It's no show in real life, and there's no reversal to it. Once someone dies, there are not any flashing lights or magic, the world goes on with the dead one being a corpse in it. L\u00e9on, and later on, Mathilda don't fear that, and the shooting supports this view.This movie's forte is its casting that happens to be just perfect. Jean Reno seems to be in his element portraying expressionlessly the cynical hit-man, L\u00e9on. The way he acts, moves, and speaks truly depict an almost depressed man with nothing to lose until the very end. Gary Oldman, for his part, doesn't keep things as simple as Reno as Stansfield the antagonist. He plays the part of a drama queenish crooked-cop and complete maniac, being fit for the role. One could really believe the character has some serious issues. The young Natalie Portman completes the trinity of leading actors, and despite her then-age (only 12 y.o.), she succeeds in outshining them all! It's just fascinating to follow how everything she does is so natural and effortless. She doesn't just appear to be the unloved orphan girl turning into a ruthless predator seeking for her revenge, she IS her. Going through a scale of emotions in a faultless display, this movie really was a stepping stone to her to-be-stardom which she rightfully attained.On a deeper level, it's all about loss and beginning anew. The theme repeats itself in both L\u00e9on and Mathilda's fates. Without spoiling anything, keep an eye on the symbolic plant. Then there's the love and death that Mathilda constantly talks about in the movie. The love part was really confusing: in the beginning I thought L\u00e9on had a fatherly affection towards Mathilda - he protected her when no-one else didn't, yet turned down her advances. Later it turned out to be out of protection towards himself, but could have been more clearly explained, in my opinion. In addition, Mathilda saying: \" I'm not growing up anymore, I just get older\" seemed an odd piece of script regarding the movie wanted to show her to grow into a woman (or at least I think it wanted), she being a typical teenager in how she conducts herself. On the other hand, that's what a teen girl really would say.So, even though the acting in L\u00e9on is superb without overrating it a bit, there's plenty of good action, the tempo doesn't go particularly slow anywhere, and with there being these deep meanings behind the killing, why does it feel that the movie is somehow wanting? In a way, the plot starts before the movie and goes on after it ends, but that's not it. While writing this review I found out about the original script of the movie. It can be found here: http://the-professional.uw.hu/Version_1_Script.html Shortly said, after some research on the script, it turned out that The Professional was supposed to be more violent, the relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda more developed, and the movie in every way more complete, but Natalie Portman's parents wouldn't let her act in the movie if it wasn't rewritten, which is completely understandable, considering her age. It just leaves you wonder what would've been had the original idea come true.Anyhow, the big picture is entertaining and thought-provoking in itself. Even after seeing the flick, L\u00e9on had me thinking about what had happened in it, which cannot be said about many of its kind. Oh! A special mention for the milk drinking throughout the movie!

            "content": "I had never seen this film before two days ago when I got my hands on it. I was very interested of it, so I was pretty much expecting a great movie experience. The movie tells about an Italian professional hit-man L\u00e9on who lives in peace and quiet with his plant. He doesn't have any friends besides Tony who hires him for hit-man jobs and that's pretty much what his life is; Nothing special, boring to be exact, besides the jobs he does. His neighbour is a drug dealer who's working with crooked DEA officers. This neighbour has a wife and three kids, and one of those kids is a 12 year old girl named Mathilda who L\u00e9on occasionally speaks to in the hall way. Mathilda's life is pretty much miserable, his father being a drug dealer who sometimes hits her and the rest of his family being just mean and ignorant besides his four year old little brother who is the only friend of her's. One day Mathilda leaves to the grocery store and in the meantime her whole family is killed by the DEA officers. When she comes back and walks along the hall way she sees her family's dead bodies and keeps on walking towards L\u00e9on's door. L\u00e9on lets her into his apartment and at the same time into his life as well.There's honestly so much more in the story, but I just don't want to give away any spoilers, as the movie's whole storyline is so brilliant. The story is very well written by Luc Besson who has also directed the movie. It's really more than just an action movie, there's so much drama in it as well. An odd relationship forms between L\u00e9on and Mathilda in a way that's just so beautiful. The whole build up of it, the progression and forming of this odd friendship is so compelling with its mixtures of great humour and beautiful drama. The movie reminds a lot of \"The Fifth Element\", which is also a great film but still nothing near this movie. Both movies are from the same director and writer after all, and the music is also almost identical in both of the movies as well. Composed by Eric Serra it gives more of that Luc Besson -edge for the movies he does. It's dark and it's there for building up the tension. The cinematography is also almost identical in both of the movies, quick and swift camera movements and humorous close-ups of characters on the screen. I guess that is Luc Besson's vision and it also works really well, especially when it comes to movies like these. All in all, \"L\u00e9on\" and \"The Fifth Element\" could be described as brothers, only that the stories are completely different. \"L\u00e9on\" just tends to go a bit deeper, having so much more depth in the story.To me the cast was brilliant and the acting was superb. L\u00e9on is played by the always enjoyable Jean Reno, who I've never really seen in a better role than in the role L\u00e9on and to be honest it's his best role performance yet to date as well. Although really being french, playing an Italian hit-man really suits him and he really is the whole character with his essence. Mathilda is played by the brilliant Natalie Portman and I was so surprised and amazed of the fact that she was a superb actress even back when she was only 12 years old! The acting she does is once again so pure and the work between her and Reno is really admirable, they really have this connection together and the dialogue between the characters just shines with its wit and the even better acting. Gary Oldman as the head DEA officer Stansfield is one of the most perfect villains I've ever seen on screen, giving that mad look and having a madness inside him. He just can look so intimidating that it almost scares me. And then there's last but not the least Danny Aiello as Tony, who's performance isn't particularly phenomenal, but he sure is perfect for the role.All in all \"L\u00e9on\" offers you a fantastic movie experience. It has action, it has drama and it also has a bit romance in it too, in an odd but a beautiful way. Even when L\u00e9on is a hit-man, the viewer does feel sympathy for him, which is caused by the genius character writing. This is an excellent movie and it is not praised for nothing. When the magnificent action scenes take part you realize saying two words to yourself; \"Yeah..\" continued by \".. Awesome\" I guess the movie is aimed more for the male audience, but I think the female ones will be satisfied as well. The movie has that famous man power at its best and despite the fact that Jean Reno's character is a bit stereotypical as a hit-man, the character itself has more than that in it, it has depth and it has originality, a simple man who's just really seeking for approval and a true friend. \"L\u00e9on\" is a movie to watch without a doubt, a definite recommendation for everyone, especially for the male audience who are looking for action and thrill in a very successful package.",

I have watched movies like Godfather, Lost in Translation a number of times. Each time I appreciate the thought process that went into making such movies. But Leon is completely out of my list of movies. Don't regret the money spend on buying the DVD, but the time wasted...",

            "content": "Loneliness is often the life state of one person, love is the fireworks that two people collide. When loneliness meets love, then his future is destined to be extraordinary. The film tells us the wonderful love story between the lonely killing anion and the little girl Matida, to write a wonderful drama for us to break the lonely ice with love.The power of love is extremely powerful. Long-term loneliness makes people alert, wraps themselves in a sleeve, does not dare to communicate with people, holds a high degree of vigilance for anything, and leads a lonely life for a long time, which is also important for Lyon to become a cruel killer The reason, when Lyon met Matida, for a long time, she had a guard against her to protect himself. He used cold appearance to reject Matida 's good intentions, and the director also used multiple faces. Close-up to show Lyon's inner fluctuations. Deep inside Lyon is actually full of love. Matida, who also lost her younger brother, could feel this love. She used her bold expression to break the high wall in Lyon's heart. When Lyon decided to take Matida, a long-range lens in the film was presented to the audience with far-reaching significance. The film did not directly express it in lines, but used this lens to illustrate that Lyon accepted her, a tall and strong man and a weak can not help but wind The little girl walked out of the street, this picture looks very uncoordinated, but it actually shows the beginning of the lonely killer encountering love.The film tells a story on the surface: a killer helps the little girl at the next door to get revenge. In fact, it tells the story of two people redeeming each other.Why do you say that? Lyon is a killer, and his life is calm but full of danger: \"Cleaning up\" will be fatal if he is careless. He has never slept with a peace of mind. There is no family member but Tony who is the boss to communicate with him. But the name of the film tells us that the killer is not too cold. Although the protagonist is cold-blooded and monotonous in life, he has a pure land deep in his heart. He also yearns for and loves beautiful things. From the potted flowers he raised, the infatuated expression when watching movies in the cinema, it can be seen that he is cold-blooded, tired of the world and immersed in some good, sincere and pure, these actions do not require him to communicate with other people, so with His killer character is not against. But in any case, he could not go further and pursue those good things, and he himself has become accustomed to it. At the beginning, I thought that the relationship with the little girl was just to show his friendliness, not really want to establish a relationship with the girl or others.Needless to say, the little girl's problem is that she smokes, skips class, lacks parental care, and is a problem teenager. The little girl also needs to change, but the change happened passively at the beginning, and caused her to lose her favorite brother. The girl is eager for revenge, but how does revenge and her life go? There is no answer.What is appealing about the film?Created a combination that is unexpected and continues to promote the development of the plot. The killer and the girl seem to come together at the two extremes. This is not a rigid combination, nor is it necessary to take each one, but they all need to heal each other's inner scars. In the evolution and enhancement of this demand, we even expect this unusual emotional relationship to be at a loss.The purpose of the little girl is very clear, that is revenge, and she can only achieve it by establishing a relationship with Lyon. Getting along for a long time quickly brought the relationship between them closer, and the girl even realized the warmth and happy time that she never had in her home. The uncle originally wanted to save the girl, didn't want to live with her, and didn't want to avenge her, but the girl's strength forced him to make concessions. She couldn't lose her anymore.The behavior of most girls has always pushed their relationship closer. As the plot further developed, the two began to gradually approach the original purpose of the combination, which made them tighter and gradually threatened them. Your own safety. At the last moment of the crisis, between life and death, Lyon saved the girl, and he embarked on a better road to salvation. After cutting out the passage of life, Lyon let the girl go down alone, the girl did not listen to life and death, Lyon must convince her to go down willingly, thought that the unspoken uncle would only say \"believe me\", \"I will go out alive and there will be nothing wrong\" With such guarantees, at this juncture of life and death, if you don't speak your heart, you may have no chance. So Lyon finally spoke the warm monologue. The little girl asked Lyon to regain her longing for life and longing for a good relationship. Even if this kind of beauty was not finally obtained, I think Lyon must be at ease when he finally died with the bad guys.After losing Lyon, the little girl can only go to Tony, and the latter allows the girl to return to school. In the end, the girl should return to normal campus life. This is the best ending for the little girl. Compared with the spiritual salvation of Lyon, the salvation of the little girl is the salvation of life. During the revenge stage, the relationship between the two people has matured her a lot, and she has achieved revenge and found the root, and it is equally important that I start her real life. She no longer broke the jars of life like before, she chose to plant Lyon pots to commemorate Lyon, but also regarded it as the beginning of serious life. Holding him. The same is planted with hope and goodness, let them grow up with the girl.",

Regarding the film, The first impression for me about the film is that the characters are so powerful that each one grabs you till the scene changes, even those who appear not more than some minutes or even seconds.. there is a surprising low-tempo in the middle of the film which - i think- prepares us to the final shot, the music and effects are used in almost every scene, it may absurd to say but this film is like a mixture of a clockwork orange and taxi driver, the characters are very crazy and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) reminded me of Iris (Jodie Foster), The first 30 minutes is a complete master piece, tension is so high that you feel you are in the film witnessing the slaughter in the apartment walking in the corridor, i hardly remember any other film which takes me to the deepest level so powerful and effective (old boy, sympathy for lady vengeance), but i must say that i disliked the music plays before the final shot when Mathilda and Leon seen together for the last time, i don't like too much repetition in Music, and that scene disturbed me because of this, anyway, from the start to the end its one of the craziest yet one of the most sentimental one, get a glass of milk, water your plants and start to watch.",

Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world. Stansfield is also excellent as the villain and shows the other side of the coin, that is how easy it is to fall into immorality and how much power that can give you in the system we live today.

Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description L\u00e9on: The Professional (French: L\u00e9on; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man; Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments.",

            "content": "The original Leon was truly excellent - typical of most Besson films, full of style, drama, dry wit & European subtlties.The main story is quite ordinary really. Three principle characters - Leon (Reno) is the cleaner, or hitman. Very good, very professional, very deadly. And yet he has become more and more detached from the real world - all he knows is a world of killing, exercise and shady deals.Matilda (Portman) lives with her brutish stepfather and his family. She has no true family except for her 4 year old brother. Other than that she goes through her daily 12 year old existence by being bullied & slapped around.Stansfield (Oldman), a police detective who now believes the grass is very much greener on the other side, and has become a drug dealer while still holding down his cop side.One day Matilda returns from a shopping trip to find her horrid step family gunned down my Oldman and his crew. She's shocked but remains indifferent to the killings, until she finds out they've also shot her true brother.She has no where to go and Stansfield still hasn't finished with his killing spree realising from a family photo that only Matilda remains alive.All this is watched through the spyhole of Leon's front door. He too is startled but like Matilda remains indifferent.She walks down the corridor and rings his doorbell, anguish desperately written all over her face for him to let her in. The question is, will he?And this is where the story really gets interesting. Yes we can see its going to be a movie about revenge & justice, but the two characters are like Romeo & Juliet, star crossed lovers, although very much in a missing father-daughter sense.The story moves on at a steady pace, Matilda & Leon teaching each other their respective skills. He shows her how to kill with a rifle; she shows him how to read & write.The ending is quite explosive, literally, but also very sad & moving. Just when you think the two have truly found each other it goes horribly wrong.The original film is, as I say, very good, but is also naggingly incomplete. There are too many loose ends in the mid section and we're never really sure how the relationship between Leon & Matilda develops so quickly.However, its only now, some 6 years on do we find the answer to our mystery. Besson has released a Director's Cut, which adds about 30 minutes of character development missing from the middle of the first. Only trouble is, the DC version is only currently available in France & Japan.But such was my desire I went over to Paris and saw it at a full moviehouse. And what a difference. The mid section offers true evidence of Matilda's revenge tutored by the fatherly Leon, but there's also a slightly darker area, which may explain why it wasn't kept in the original version.Even in the original there are subtle hints of something more than just a father/daughter relationship going on between the two, but this is investigated much further in the DC when you have this worrying thought as to how far Besson is willing to push Portman.Happily nothing comes of it, but the extra minutes do add a few more answers to an otherwise excellent movie. Reno is, as always a joy to watch, and seems to have reprised his role from the earlier Besson Movie Le Femme Nikita.Oldman is perhaps a slight weak link, playing his role far too over the top to be taken seriously, which is a great shame, because he was quite excellent in Besson's later film, The 5th Element.But the true honours have to go to Portman, her first leading role for a girl of only 12, I'm still amazed how she wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Even more so with how she hasn't really been allowed to develope her considerable talent in latter films, including Star Wars 1, and Heat.If you want an example of her divine acting talent look for the scene near the start. Ringing Leon's doorbell and the tearful expression on her face as she silently begs to be let in while a hitman looks on!I sincerely hope Leon DC becomes more widely available. For me its Besson's best film and well worth owning.*****/*****",

            "content": "What the hell has happened here? Am I seeing things correctly or is this just a dream because this appears to be an action movie with a conscience. What amazes me is that this film seems to owe more to Shakespearian tragedy then it does to Die Hard or Lethal Weapon and has as many equal parts emotion as it does suspense. The one dimensional Jean Reno gives what could be his most effective performance as a hit man who, after witnessing the brutal murder of a young, abused girl's family takes her in. The two form an instant bond because neither of them likes the life they are living and both seem to be living it in the darkness away from society. So instead of caring for the girl he teaches her to fend for herself so that she can take revenge on the men who killed her family (it's not as inhuman as it sounds). A young Natalie Portman handles her role very maturely for her age and Gary Oldman is the highlight of the entire film in on of his most enjoyable and let's not forget watchable roles as the sadistic drug pusher who kills the girls family. Oldman is so dead on accurate that you almost have to feel a slight tingle in your spine every time he steps on screen. Director Luc Besson is no stranger to action, having directed The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita, to name a few, the man knows how to excite the senses. But what sets this apart from your typical everyday action films is that it seems just as driven to empower as it is to exhilarate. The script lets your get inside the characters and really feel where they are coming from instead of just having a bunch of things blow up. For this maybe action fans aren't ready to delve into such mature subject matter while only wanting to entertain the thought of seeing some mindless violence (don't worry there is still plenty of violence here) that they may be turned off by the dramatic intensity that bubbles at the seams of every corner the film has to offer. Some may hate it, some may love it, some may not know what to make of it and some may be confused by it But I would love to see more action films like this, films that aren't afraid to develop there characters and tell a story with meaning and compassion while still delivering one adrenaline rush after another. So love it or hate it you've got to hand it to Besson and his cast for having the balls to make something with this much integrity.",

There's just a delightful balance here. You will be blown away by Nathalie Portman's performance. It's hard to believe that she was just a 13 years old girl back then. Prepare yourself to get attached and even fell in love with the main character played by Jean Reno; the heartless hit-man who's a lone wolf will open up along the movie in a very subtle way when he takes that little girl under his protection. Let's not forget about the bad guy of the movie (because every decent movie has one) and what a bad guy! Even if Gary Oldman's really pulls out an amazing performance, it's impossible to hate him. I've never loved a bad guy as much as this one. Luc Besson's old movies (Nikita, the fifth element) are stunner's and this one definitely belongs to that category. I hope this made you wanted to watch the movie, I promise you won't be disappointed and I hope you'll have as much pleasure as i have when watching it for the first time.",

I thought the original was good but it was no near as good as the Extended edition was.  \nNatalie Portman plays Matilda who is trapped in a family of violence and neglect but loves them anyway especially her little brother.  Next door is a man called Leon who is a quiet keep's himself to himself kind of man and has a dark look about him.  Leon's profession is an assassin and prays on people like a comic book hero when he is told to by his boss brilliantly by Danny Aiello.Matilda's father is involved in some bad business and mixes with the wrong kind of people hence Gary Oldman and his henchmen.   They bombard Matilda's house with a wray of bullets whilst she is out wiping out the entire family including her younger brother and older sister.   She returns to find the men still there and realises what has happened but doesn't stop to think and moves on with a straight face to Leon's house who is watching close by.   He takes her in and the friendship between them begins which is why the extended edition is so good as it brings their friendship more to life and see why they are so close at the end.  We know why they are in the original but we see a lot more and it is more believable.  I believe that if this edition was released when the movie came out in the mid nineties then Jean Reno would have had an Oscar nomination without doubt.   Gary Oldman overplays his character just a bit and reminds me more of a pantomime baddie.   Natalie Portman is a star in the making.  Well she was when this came out but since then she hasn't impressed me much apart from the new Star Wars which I like anyway because its Star Wars not because she's in it but this is her crowning momentI haven't yet seen Nikita but I read Leon and Nikita were linked but that's because Luc Besson directed both films and because they are about normal people who are assassins, but Leon is an all action packed movie with enough time to have lots of Drama in it which is always nice.4 out of 5",

It kind of showed how the room is not holy anymore and how G-D is not on his side anymore. It can also show that Leon can't even have G-D on his side. this is just a small example of how artistic this movie can get.The Porfessional is a movie that has a sort of fitness to it. it has everything just in its place at the right time. scenes that are obvious have more meaning to them than the usual. Bullet shots and normal pan shots of the streets with the Italian music in the background give more insight and depth to the characteristics of the film in general. This is not your usual action movie, which Jean Reno is known for. This movie is definetly worth checking out. A movie about a man finding a new route to life because he was not living the way he wanted to live originally. Leon was living a life with no roots, just living. Many people don't realize but this movie has a lot of revilance to our daily lives. Where are your roots?",

It is, however, underrated, and people don't see it for what it is. Leon has many levels to it, and each becomes apparent the more you watch it. It is fundamentally an action/thriller about a lonely hit man who seems to be getting swindled by his boss over his money, and who unwittingly gets caught up in the troubles of his next door neighbours drug problems with the DEA, through a little girl Matilda (Natalie Portman, who he helps).As well as this, he eventually ends up with crazed DEA officer Gary Oldman on his back, as well as nearly the entire NYPD. On the surface, this film is an action shoot em up, but it is really much more. It seems to be a tale of a desperate young girl who has no where to go after her entire family are gunned down by Oldman, and who sparks up a kind of father daughter relationship with Leon. Gary Oldman is excellent in this, and plays the part with the usual intensity that he has. Natalie Portman is also great, and its probably this film that has led her onto her more recent successes in films. As for the lead Jean Reno, this was the first film I saw him in, and I can't say I've ever seen him beat this performance in any other.",

It's very original and very unusual, the love that grows between two incredibly unusual characters is surprisingly well done and very brave. If you try to explain the film to someone it's very bizarre 'how could an Italian hit-man befriend and fall in love with a 12 year old child'. This really is the genius of Luc Besson. He's able to make a very strange idea and insert some beautifully crafted scenes of violence, but still come out with a very credible film, that's overriding memory is the love between the two characters and not the revenge or the violence that takes place.Overall this film has a wonderful charm, the love that develops, although improbable, is wonderfully realised and believable. The acting is superb and there's some great 'dirty harry' style lines thrown in which make a light relief now and again.Since watching Nikita and this movie, I began to believe I'd found a new hero in Besson, after Cronenberg, Carpenter and Cameron had all lost their way (in my opinion), but of course besson went on to make 'The Fifth Element ' which disappointed me.Please Luc, watch Nikita, and Leon and remind yourself how good you can be.10/10By the way \u0096 For anyone who hasn't seen the full version, which I was lucky enough to see, it's well worth it.",

He brings Leon to life and adeptly shows his transformation from soulless killer to a man who realizes that life involves living and loving and not killing. Natalie Portman does a fine job of being the object of Leon's affections. Although some people see this movie as having barely veiled pedophile overtones, all of the scenes with Reno and Portman are innocent and nothing is implied I think. Gary Oldman pulls off an incredible performance as the evil, corrupt DEA agent Stansfield. His performance is over the top but it's great fun to watch.The gunfights in this film are some of the best ever captured and make this movie a great action film. Leon truly is a professional.

The Professional (US version) Leon, The Professional extended version and most recently the Deluxe Edition, which by far is the best. Not only does it have the best quality film and sound there is, it's also has special features including interview with Jean Reno and Natalie Portman.

This movie is so hauntingly beautiful I just had to write this.Leon: The Professional is about a hit-man and a 12-year-old girl that he saves and shelters (though reluctantly at first). The relationship between these two evolve as the movie progresses and touches a wide spectrum of emotions including father-daughter, mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and you can't help but notice the slight sexual tension. But to say that the movie has pedophilic tendencies would be plain wrong. Mathilda is a an abused child who has no mother, and the father who is always abusing her, her elder half-sister is no good either. When she is loved and cared for the first time by Leon she thinks she is in love with him, her body-changes at age of 12 doesn't help matters either. I am not judging what she or she doesn't feel, I'm just trying to put things into perspective. Leon on the other hand has a loveless life and has been alone for several years and his feelings towards Mathilda is more like a father.The movie is great in so many levels it's hard to describe in words exactly what makes it what it is. Talking about the technical aspects - the acting is absolutely great, as is direction and cinematography. All in all I'd not want to have anything added or taken away from the movie, it just is so brilliant and perfect the way its is. I was especially surprised by Portman who played the character so brilliantly I don't see anyone else playing it. Reno and Oldman were brilliant too, I liked Oldman's portrayal of a corrupt and psychopath DEA officer. His weird rituals before taking his pills, the way he twitched and tilted his head while supposedly chewing it. And who can forget his famous line \"Bring me everyone...EVERYONE\". I don't know about anyone else but I couldn't help myself laughing out loud hearing this and the way he said it. And last but not the least Reno portrayed the haunted loner so well you can't help but feel so deeply for him.Being the movie buff I am I had a strong feeling how the movie would end (and I was right) but as the movie progresses and the characters took a place in my heart I wanted myself to be wrong. You just can't help but feel so strongly for the two leads. The ending scene was absolutely beautiful and poetic as the camera gives us the aerial shot of Mathilda, the plant and New York as the song \"Shape of My Heart\" plays. To me it was THE most hauntingly beautiful endings I've ever scene in a movie especially because of the song.I advise everyone to watch the uncut version which is like 2hr 12min long to fully understand and appreciate the movie.",

In the opening scene, Leon peeks through a bullet hole in a door into a dark room with light behind him, and in doing so shows the gunman on the other side exactly where he is. Another time, when a hit goes bad in an apartment building, Leon only steps over from the door a foot or two as the man inside seeks to spray the entire wall with machine gun fire. Leon's character is completely unbelievable, he is never shown to have any degree of intelligence, not by the storyline or the acting, yet the other characters strongly push this notion. When I think of a character who is intelligent and good at killing, I think of Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Leon is abysmal in comparison. Not only does the linear plot have no shred of plausibility, it is also made up of predictable scenes and dialog, which only infuriate the viewer as they drone on. Every scene feels forced, so unrealistic you can almost feel the presence of the film crew in the room, complete with the director frantically trying to think what should happen next. The unwarranted dramatic music is clearly a futile attempt to cover the bad acting. Nobody reacts to anything properly. The villains are cartoon-like at best. The only thing shocking is the amount of cursing in a story which was so clearly written for a children's TV show. The first few pages of comments almost had me convinced I was crazy, until I found the realistic ones buried at the bottom.",

(*** mild spoilers herein ***)one of the main problems for me personally was the young age of the girl and her relationship with leon. leon does nothing to put he little girl romantic thoughts out of her mind. this made me very uncomfortable with the lead character. a case of personal values i guess.apart from that the movie had some very good action scenes, though the story on the whole was very unbelievable, the basic theme was neat. the action scenes were very stylish and had a lot of panache to them, although it looked like a low-budget artie movie.natalie portman's performance was very good but again although the character demanded it, her grown-up girl image was slightly overdone and the scenes where she has to revert to her childishness and naivette didnt quite come off. personally i felt that this was movie was a golden opportunity that with more sensitivity and without the cliches could have been done a lot better.a let-down 7",

            "content": "I am angry with the film Leon for showing some promise, but being so bad. While the opening action sequence is intriguing and quite stylishly impressive, the overall story is poorly conceived and rather absurd. Its value is greatly diminished by the acting and the stupid things the characters actually do in the script.Different events happen in this film that are completely inconceivable in what looks like a setting in the recent past, the present, or the near future. They are living in a familiar place, but the characters act like their brains are in an alternate universe. Leon, the professional, seems to be an intelligent and rational man, but it is ridiculous that he helps instigate Natalie Portman's character to cause many nonsensical events. The director then contrasts these stupid almost unfathomable actions by trying to make us identify with certain character's natural human emotions. I can't feel any emotions with the characters because apart with speaking the same language and living on Earth, they do many things that I feel are completely illogical.The writers seem to have wanted some comic relief in many parts of the film, but they are mostly unfunny and unnecessary. They make you appreciate the writing of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie even more. What makes this film somewhat interesting are the action scenes which are definitely well done and cool, but they are unfortunately few and far between.",

            "content": "*Possible spoilers* Cancel all arrangements, put the cat out and settle back for one of the greatest movies ever made.Okay, I'm usually wary of any review that starts with those words. It's usually a recipe for disaster as your expectations are raised to the point where you are bound to be let down by the finished product.\nIn this case, believe the hype.The story is simple enough though unlikely to ever get cleared by a Hollywood studio on the grounds of its Lolita-like subplot. Mathilda (Star Wars' Natalie Portman in her big screen debut) is a 12-year-old New York girl who befriends Italian hitman Leon (Jean Reno in arguably his greatest performance).When her family are wiped out by DEA officers, led by a career-best Gary Oldman, she hires the eponymous assassin to avenge her brother's death.Written and directed by Gallic genius Luc Besson, the man behind classics such as Nikita and Subway, this was his first English language film and hooks the viewer from the word go.With an atmospheric score by Eric Serra and some great support from Danny Aiello, New York has never looked more Continental.Although it will lose everything on the small screen, there is a moment when Leon takes Mathilda out onto a rooftop to train her the art of assassination.The close-up of the pair against the dismal walls of their apartment block is followed by a breathtaking panorama of the Big Apple.As with any good movie, Leon is made up of such memorable scenes but what carries the film forward is the father-daughter relationship between a woman trapped in a child's body and a child trapped in a man's.Tearing the two apart is Stansfield (Oldman), a Beethoven-loving, pill popping sleazy officer who brings a degree of ferocity to the film rarely seen before or since.Oldman has always been good value for money, but his unforgettable speeches such as, \"I love these quiet moments before the storm,\" are the equivalent of sending 40,000 volts from the TV set into the viewer.Luc Besson was so impressed with the actor he signed him on the spot for his big budget fantasy adventure, The Fifth Element and decided to co-produce his stunning directorial debut, Nil By Mouth.Okay, enough gushing - what's bad about it?Well, Mathilda's guardians come across like cartoon characters, but then again, so do many villains in real life so you can forgive their lack of depth. As with Goldeneye and The Fifth Element, the closing track by Eric Serra is also hideous but at least you can turn off by that point. There is also one major drawback with this version: It's not the director's cut which has just been released in this US to critical acclaim.\nI was lucky enough to see the Japanese import earlier in the year and although it fleshes out the relationship between Leon and Mathilda to a very dubious degree, there's no doubt that the 'version integrale', as the art house fans like to call it, is far superior.All the characters are fleshed out more and there is one hilarious scene in which Portman and Reno get drunk in a restaurant which is little short of hilarious.Whichever version you see, be it this TV offering, a big screen print or the DVD version, there's no doubt that Besson has created a masterpiece that took a simple thriller and gave it a heart, then proceeds to break yours by the time the closing credits roll.",

There's a scene where Natalie Portman giggles uncontrollably in a restaurant that is a sheer delight and begs the question that if Anna Paquin can win an Oscar for The Piano, how come NP wasn't even nominated?At the risk of sounding like an over-excited teenager who has just seen the latest piece of movie candy and has rated it best film of all time, Leon IS one of the greatest thrillers ever made but the director's cut elevates it above the butchered version that was released in the US and UK a few years ago.",

            "content": "I think the people who accuse this movie of promoting pedophilia are totally missing the point here. But i don\u00b4t agree with the ones who defend it as being nothing more than a big friendship story either.This is a Love story all right.Once again LUC BESSON has managed to create and film another truly original and impossible adult love story in wich love is presented first of all as an emotion.Like in \" BIG BLUE/LE GRAND BLEU \", BESSON is much more interested in presenting Love as a pure human feeling than as something that is conditioned by the actual modern society.In other movies love is always depending on external factors and almost controls the story and the characters. When LUC BESSON films it, love is always present but in a pure and subtle way, that apparently doesn\u00b4t interfere directly in the main story, but ends up being the cause of it.He films it only as an emotion that isn\u00b4t depending in gender, race,sex, or in this case age. That\u00b4s why he never uses this emotion to create the usual subplots for his movies. Because it\u00b4s too pure and simple and it would be very dificult to invent some conflicts for the story and at the same time keep it like that.Maybe i\u00b4m sounding too intellectual, but i can\u00b4t find another way to explain what i think. That\u00b4s what i like about Luc Besson. He first makes us feel, then he makes us think.So this is why i think there is nothing dirty about this movie. Pedophilia here is on the minds of the people who wish to see it. There is a love story between Leon and Mathilda, but it\u00b4s just that. Love.True love, if you like. Everybody can imagine they have sex if they want to, but don\u00b4t go blame the movie for it.The only dirty shamefull scenes in LEON are in the minds of the people who wished they were there in the first place. Of course everyone thinks about the possibility of sex between Leon and Mathilda, but that\u00b4s not because of what\u00b4s in the movie. It\u00b4s because we are conditioned to think this way.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It\u00b4s original, it has a fabulous story, very human characters, excellent action scenes and amazing actors. And it has style ! JEAN RENO is an amazing actor as he had already proved in \" THE BIG BLUE \", and it\u00b4s great to see him in a role where he can show is worth for a change. Unfortunately in Hollywood no one seems to have noticed this because his later characters in american productions have all been nothing more than cardboard clich\u00e9s. But that\u00b4s Hollywood.The rest of the cast couldn\u00b4t have been better. The girl Natalie Portman, is already a magnificent actress and G.Oldman and Danny Aielo are perfect for their characters.This is a fantastic movie. See it without any pre-conceived ideas and you\u00b4ll love it. A true love story.",

Oldman plays Norman Stansfield, a maniac cop who slaughters the family of Portman, and immediately becomes the enemy of Leon. All the cast give brilliant performances but Oldman is the best. He executes the lines with acute accuracy. The story is also good. Reno and Portman are both superb in starring roles and support comes from Danny Aiello. Rating=5/5",

She gets a taste of vengeance while he gets a taste of life...Or dialogue written like: LEON sees MATHILDA crying.  He hands her a tissue.MATHILDA: Is life always this tough, or only when you're a kid?(Pause)LEON: Always like this.Oh, the schmaltz of the written word, but yet THE PROFESSIONAL is one of the tightest, most breathless action pictures I have ever seen.  I would also call it a tragic romance, but that would be improper...I'm going to assume that if you're reading the review, you've seen the movie and are interested in what others thought about it.  The anonymous who wrote in thinking that it a badly acted piece of tripe with no characters to root for has something right: I admit that there are awkward pauses in the film and dialogue that is over-sentimental and stupid.  However, I don't see how you can't root for these two to survive.Leon is revived by Matilda as much as he is disturbed.  As soon as he decides not to pull the trigger that night, he puts his life at risk.  The issue of pedophilia here is a concern, but dangerously so because Portman does such a DAMN good job of portraying sophistication, grace, sadness, beauty, and rage in her kid character.  I'm surprised she didn't get a single nomination for this, while Anna Paquin got a Best Sup'ting Actress for a much simpler role...\nLeon kills without mercy or heart and has only the one rule \"no women, no kids.\"  He teaches his code to Mathilde, pushing her to clean up her act while also teaching her a bit of his own cleaning at her command.  The rooftop sequence is striking. Gary Oldman, as the DEA cop, is wacky, strange, off-key.  Yet for me, he comes to represent the spirit of New York in Besson's vision: it is energy, chaos, mystery, corruption, sleaze, and violence.  If Stansfield is the official voice of law and order, then we need to retreat to the outlaws, those who operate outside the city's law but in their own select codes. Oldman is unsettling in the film and is the polar opposite to Leon, whom we grow comfortable with despite his pathology because we can predict his behavior and routine: we can respect it.The music and cinematography lend an urgency to the film's plot, and really there isn't that much time for character development.  Characters develop through the plot, through learning to get revenge, through the lessons of Leon to Mathilde, the strange acts of Mathilde under Leon's care.There are some really strange similarities between this film and the Fifth Element: both involve a reluctant recluse with a bare-looking home deciding to take a chance on a girl running away from police.  Both involve similar opening credit sequences, and both have similar admissions of love at pivotal moments.Fifth Element: The four elements are gathered together in the Egyptian temple but the evil is coming to destroy the world.  Korben Dallas has to convince the cynical, weakened Leelu that he loves her and that love is worth saving so that she will accept the unity of herself with the elements and conquer the evil.  A breathless embrace between the two yields the winning result.  Korben screams as divine light hits Leelu's body.The Professional:  A SWAT team is gathering together a projectile bomb to fire into Leon's apartment.  Leon must convince the desperate, scared Mathilde that separating is the only way for them to survive, that she must escape the apartment on her own.  He confesses his love for her and she returns it. The Professional is not a film for everyone: the violence can be extreme, and the ending is a bit of a retreat.  However, despite the violence, the acting, atmosphere, and pace of the film make it a winner. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are an awkward-looking but somehow perfect pair.  I would love to see a sequel where Mathilda renounces becoming a good girl in N.J. and declares herself a freelance cleaner.  This film may be melodramatic pseudo-art tripe to some, and from the outside or on paper, I can agree.  However, in the theater, on the screen, The Professional is one of the best, most seductive, and gritty action films I've seen in the 90s.",

But does that idea still work in a film you are supposed to take seriously?Plot In a Nutshell: A young girl left orphaned by a drug hit on her family is taken in and mentored by her next door neighbor, who happens to be a lethal assassin.Why I rated it a '6': Because the plot is as silly as it sounds. It actually DOES sound like a comedy, doesn't it? Sadly, it's not. And it's all the worse for it. Who really thinks a loner hitman would do this? How about bringing the girl to an orphanage? Or Child Services in the city? Hello? Well, no, because then you wouldn't have a movie. But does anyone really think an actual contract killer would take in a little girl, and not only that, but begin to train her in the ways of an assassin? Count me out. This isn't compelling theater. It's fantasy all the way, and not very riveting at that. Not for a second did I find myself invested in this plotline. I kept thinking \"if I was a hitman, would I do this?\" and the answer kept coming back \"Uh, no you would not.\" So the film's story lost me very early on, and it could not get me back. The fact that this unrealistic fantasy (yet set in the real world) is currently #31 on the IMDb Top 250 is pretty hilarious. For all the wrong reasons of course.Roger and me: In his 1994 review Roger Ebert gave this film 2.5/4 stars, calling it \"a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture,\" and he was right on the money.

It touches the audience's emotions like no other movie could.  Well, here I go...Happy Premise Number 1:  The characters.  This is my favourite part of the film.  Leon is a simple man.  He doesn't ask for much.  He drinks milk in place of beer or liquir, he doesn't smoke, he loves children, and he goes to see old musicals like Singing in the Rain in old theatres.  Oh, and he's a hitman.  His personality is the exact opposite of what you would expect a hit man to be.  He is a sweet and gentle man who goes to work everyday. That's how he sees it.  It's work, business.  Someone has to do it, and he has a gift for what he does.  Okay, so what he does isn't legal, but he is the best in the field, so he has to do it.  The other characters are good, but Leon is terrific.Happy Premise Number 2: Great acting.  I don't think the word \"great\" really portrays what I mean.  I know a lot of people say Natalie Portman to be great, but I found her performance to be average.  Gary Oldman gives one of the best villian performances I've ever seen.  His rage and insanity is brilliant.  Jean Reno, one of my favourite actors, stars as Leon.  He pulls off the gentleness perfect.Happy Premise Number 3: the action.  This is an ACTION movies.  Don't let anyone else tell you different.  The action, while not the centre of the movie, is great.  every action scene is choreographed perfectly.  The explosions are the best.  There is an explosion near the end that made me jump.  It looked so real!  People were only a few feet from this gigantic blast.  To this day, it still amazes me.Happy Premise Number 4: Luc Besson.  This is his best film to date.  The Fifth Elemnt was fun, but a little over board.  Everytime I see that movie I see a large TILT sign hoveing over my TV.  I never saw The Messenger, but it was trashed by just about everyone and tanked at the boxoffice.  This film truly shows him at the top of his game.  The cinematography ,the direction, the writing, it's all good my frined, it's all good.Okay, lets seep into some negative things.Depressing Premise Number 1:  The film's American release.  When the movie was brought to America, they cut the movie drastically.  They even changed the named from Leon to The Professional.  If you are going to see this film, please rent the DVD called Leon: The Professional.  It features the original movie.  The box says that the new scenes were considered too violent for American auidences, but that's an advertising ploy.  There's nothing violent added to Leon.  They are mainly character build up scenes and a great scene were Leon takes Matilda to \"work\".  It is sad that most of us Americans have never seen the true film.   But the cut version is good anyway, so if you can only find the cut version, it's still good.Depressing Premis Number 2: Ummmmmm, can't think of anything.  This film is perfect.  There is nothing wrong with it whatsoever.  Like I said, it's not an epic masterpiece like Gladiator or Hamlet, but it is an extremly good movie none-the-less.Conclusion: SEE THIS MOVIE.  It should please everyone.  There's action for guys, a touching story for gals, and a great combination of both for we film people.  It is worth the money for a rent.  PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE.  You will like it.  You may not think it was that special, but you WILL like it. Like I said, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it is flawless, fun, and will touch your heart.8/10(note: I rarly ever give a movie above an 8)",

His intelligence, skill and fitness makes him one of the best hit men in New York, but lives in a misery and is never truly happy. He harms no one but the people he is paid to assassinate and lives by rules to keep his profile low from people who may want to kill him.Director Luc Besson puts everything in perfection to make this movie great. The actors are great, especially Gary Oldman, which I think is his best Bad guy role ever. The use of music is superb and camera angles and the story is fantastic which makes this movie on of the most emotionally intense movies I have ever seen.***** A Fantastic Movie *****",

Natalie Portman, like Rachel McAdams in The Notebook, was perfectly cast as Mathilda. I believe any other young actress could not have conveyed the extraordinary performance which was required of such a young leading role. I hate to say, but most films can't even come close to Stanislavsky truth like Jean Reno and Portman beautifully delivered in Leon The Professional. The Music is also wonderfully placed as well as it is playful. Gary Oldman portrays the perfect antagonist-pretty much you hate him and want him for dead making his acting right on target, so no complaints there. So all in all I absolutely love Leon The Professional. It is definitely not for those who despise films that have some valid emotional complexities in it. For those with drone-like minds go watch Battlefield Earth or Cyborg or something-",

It shows a cold-blooded killer finding his heart, finding it more desirable than the killing and hiding. Now that I think of it, even the 5th Element follows this to some extent. I'm a huge Luc Besson fan in large part due to this recurring theme. You hope your favorite band never changes genres and keep going back to their music because they stuck with their style.

The performances are overall good, especially Jean Reno, as the ruthless assassin fatherly loving figure, and Natalie Portman, the character that we sometimes forget is a child. Gary Oldman gives all his heart, but his performance can only be as good as the one-dimensional villain he is portraying.\nThe story is, on one hand, well designed and different, specially the constant efforts of L\u00e9on to adapt to his new role of caretaker. Mathilda's constant uncomfortable approaches make it even better and are the clear result of a way too brief and dysfunctional childhood.

            "content": "Leon is a hard movie to write a review for, as it's not your typical action film, nor is it your normal romance...and I don't think it's truly either one, but the basic elements are there.Natalie Portman displays her natural acting abilities, that will no doubt be honed into perfection as she gets older, and is perfect for her role as Matilda. In fact, it's one of the most memorable child roles that I have seen. Her attitude and confidence can sometimes be very surprising. Jean Reno does a decent job, but his simple role doesn't seem too difficult a one to pull off. However, it also works. He's sometimes downright goofy and almost retarded, but is meant to show the simplicity of his character. Which brings us to the unparalleled and wickedly talented Gary Oldman, who portrays a particularly nasty and evil character. His Norman Stansfield seems to be spawned from Hell itself. Oldman is not new to playing villains, and he gets to showoff his amazingly intense acting abilities even further in this character. Born to be the bad guy, and probably my favorite actor. His performance alone is reason enough to watch this movie.The story is simple, but very unique, particularly the \"romantic\" aspect. We've got a 40 year old man and a 12 year old girl basically falling in love with each other, which can probably make a few people uneasy. I raised and eyebrow or two myself, with it's sexual undertones and hinted at implications. I don't think the director went too far though, and feel that he showed just enough without going overboard. Even with that, some people may still find it a bit unnerving given the \"romance\". Personally, I don't think Besson had anything dirty that he was trying to imply and that all of what you see is all of what happened between the two in the director's mind. I will admit, that sometimes I think the cute moments in the film were trying to hard and could have been cut down just a teeny bit. The dress up game and the infamous cow mit scenes are perfect examples.On the other hand, we have the intense and sometimes seemingly over the top actions scenes. A few parts in the movie seem so insane because the city seems to be devoid of police, or the ability for people to dial 911. However, many times life does imitate art, so who's to say what's realistic and what is not? Some of it seems almost cartoonish sometimes, but I'm willing to forgive a little of that here and there and it doesn't take away too much from the film, if at all.Leon contains some beautiful camera work, and the score seems to compliment the almost opera like feel it's pace and story also suggest. It all adds up to a stunning visual treat, combined with a touching story.\nOverall a good movie worth checking out. Every time I watch this movie, I change my opinion on how much I like it. But overall, I'd give it a score of somewhere between an 8 and a 9. \"You don't like Beethoven...\"",

A 12 year old befriends and falls in love with a professional assassin who trains her to kill the rogue DEA agent Norman Stansfield. Yet despite this, the film works well. It combines together two starkly different narratives: the revenge story and the love story. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in her debut film role were great together. They provided a lot of the humour in the film, as did Gary Oldman who was brilliant as Stansfield.SPOILER ALERTThe main gripe I do have with the film though is that Natalie Portman's character never kills anyone. Sure, I understand that it is a romantic gesture that it is Leon who is the one who kills Stanfield, but I feel that Portman's character should have been the one to do it. After seeing her mature into a wannabe assassin, I was disappointed that she was never able to take her revenge.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/8ihukO",

Her father is involved in drug dealing for some bent cops led by the terrifying Agent Stansfeld ( Gary Oldman). When Stansfeld discovers that he is being cheated by Mathilda's father, he takes revenge by executing the entire family apart from Mathilda who escapes and seeks refuge in a neighbors flat. L\u00e9on ( Jean Reno), the neighbor, is more than he seems however, as Mathilda discovers he is actually a contract killer, and begs him to teach her how to settle her own scores.Luc Besson, the writer and director of the film, put together quite the stylish and riveting thriller here. The pace is fast moving and the action sequences are quite enjoyable.Reno gives a quite credible performance in the title role and manages to balance the conflicting elements of his character as well. Portman, as Mathilda, without a doubt gives the performance of her career here, ( to this day, still her best on film, not sure what that says about her as a performer though) with a combination of lost wolf meets driven avenger. Placing such a youngster so firmly at the center of such a violent themed film also adds to much of the tension that the film delivers.It is, however, Oldman as the psychopathic cop who steals the show. If he overplays the part just a little, who cares, it can be easily forgiven as he is indeed quite the pleasure to watch. For instance, just watch the scene where he confronts Portman's Mathilda in the bathroom, such an incredible and intense scene. I also love the scene where the old lady buts in saying something like \" Why don't you leave that family alone?\" Oldman responds by shooting out the glass or whatever it was behind her and yells \" He said go back inside.\" Also his line \" I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t\" is so awesome.",

She was a character you could laugh, cry and sympathise with. Jean Reno played L\u00e9on, the caring father/hit-man who takes in Mathilda after her family is brutally murdered, and you can feel the bond of the two dysfunctional characters as Mathilda learns the trade of \"cleaner\" and L\u00e9on learns to love again.

Gary Oldman portrays arguably the best villain of his career. He is great as a villain, but this one sticks out more than the rest. The script is excellent and it allows you to get invested in the characters and empathize with their situations. This movie will definitely challenge you on a moral level as well. I can't really tell you too much that the synopsis doesn't already tell you about the plot, but I will say this has one of the best action sequences I have ever seen at the end of the movie.

Leon and Mathilda's roles could have been reversed so that Mathilda was the one taking down the bad guys and Leon was held hostage. I kept waiting for the moment when Mathilda would go full assassin mode - it was her ambition after all. But it never came, and instead she stays an innocent girl, fleeing the scene and eventually being scolded by Leon's friend for wanting \"work\" for him.No one took Mathilda seriously except for Leon, and yet Mathilda comes off as more mature than the adults in this film.Overall, there is a lot to like here, but also wasted potential.

Combining equal parts dirty-cop/mob drama with the emotional tale of a man taking in an orphaned youngster, \"Leon\" is both thrilling and heart-wrenching to watch.Leon (played by the ever stoic Jean Reno) is the hit-man of choice for the Italian mob of New York city. When a dirty DEA agent named Stansfield (Gary Oldman) kills the family of his young neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), he takes her under his wing teaching her the ways of the assassin as she teaches him of the love for life that he has been missing. But Mathilda's desire for vengeance puts herself, Leon and Stansfield on a collision course for a violent confrontation.Luc Besson certainly brings to vibrant life New York City with beautiful cinematography while crafting a tasteful crescendo of a script. Watching such an excellently composed script play out on the screen with such tasteful imagery is a real treat. As well, the score by longtime Besson collaborator Eric Serra is hypnotic and beautiful in its own right. I have often found myself coming back to the score on its own as it is at times both emotive and pulse driving.Combined with the production aspects are a collection of precision performances. Portman's screen debut certainly demonstrates why her career took off, as she grabs the viewer's eye and heart from her first appearance and holds her own with her fellow actors. Reno turns in as strong a performance as he has ever given, demonstrating why he is one of the few French leads to have made an equal impact in North America. Add to this an electrifying and intoxicating performance by the master of scene chewing, Gary Oldman, and a subtle and captivating turn by Danny Aiello as an Italian mobster, and this film is certainly worth the price of admission for the performances alone.\"Leon\" is a picture perfect example of a film that expanded far beyond the confines of its genre. While being a wonderfully entertaining action film, it draws a strong dramatic narrative that is compelling and unforgettable, and certainly demands repeated viewing.

The rest is one wonderful roller-coaster rush to its fantastic (albeit inevitable) conclusion.    High marks to Reno, Aiello, Oldman, and especially Portman.  If there were a sequel, why not get Portman to play Matilda?",

Not everyone will share this thought, but I believe that this is a masterpiece.  Jean Reno is absolutely incredible as Leon, and Natalie Portman plays her role well also.I have seen several Luc Besson films, none were uninteresting, but this is by far the best of the bunch.  The directing of the movie is superb.  The cinematography also is incredible.  This is all complemented by a somewhat simplistic score, that enhances the tense feeling of the movie.  The score becomes more dramatic, as it should, in the intense parts of the movie, but also lays low in the suspenseful moments to enhance this feeling.As I said earlier, Jean Reno and Natalie Portman do a terrific job of acting in this movie.  They do a tremendous job of showing the awkwardness of the situation that they are in, and Jean Reno is a truly genious hitman.The entire movie is incredible, and I think one of the most incredible moments is when Reno is leaving his apartment after the police shootout, and Gary Oldman, who also acts well, comes up behind him and shoots him.  The camera angle from Reno's perspective while falling down is brilliant.A truly magnificent film.Rating: 5 out of 5.",

The two impressive scenes were that when Leon opened the door, the light hit Mathilda's face, and her entire world lit up. And when Leon finally tried to walk towards the door, it was the same light. The light from the world with Mathilda shone into his world, but at the last moment it tilted down and fell, forming a permanent regret. The beauty of this drama lies in a kind and soft heart under Leon's cold appearance, in that two people can be brave and pure but not at all for the sake of each other, and that the hope of happiness falls suddenly when it is about to be realized.",

The scene in the city is a bit like being in a cage. Irregular, distorted and distorted urban composition can be seen everywhere, with the overall tone biased towards dark colors. Cities, tall buildings, these are the result of human development, but with them, in addition to advanced science and technology, but also breeding, spreading crime. The irony is that the police department, traditionally a symbol of justice and order, has become a source of evil and violence. The police station is also one of the tall buildings, the authority of the whole society, but has become one of the main positions of the evil world. The film expresses the director's indictment and distrust of the world and society. The seemingly inconsequential narrative is the ultimate discussion of the coexistence of human beings.",

Jean Reno plays the hit-man Leon, the best in town. One day he takes in a girl whose family has just been killed by a crazed DEA agent. Mathilda is played by Natalie Portman in her debut performance, and she plays the part flawlessly. She combines the innocence and high-spirits of youth with the somber world-weariness of someone who has seen far more than they should. The DEA agent is played by Gary Oldman, who brings his incredible skill with villains to the film.After Leon takes her in, Mathilda presses him to teach her to kill so she can exact revenge. As he trains her, the two develop a chemistry that is more convincing than 99 percent of the on-screen relationships I've seen. Mathilda develops a crush on Leon, which flusters the hit-man. Although some critics find this disturbing, the relationship is very much father/child as opposed to Lolita. Still, Portman's performance is so incredible that if you're not careful you'll find yourself actually wanting the relationship to grow. She plays the part with such maturity that you forget her age.The action sequences are very well done and don't get bloated to the point that it's over the top. In fact, the only over the top thing in the movie is Gary Oldman, but he does it in his own special way that makes the part interesting as opposed to unintentionally funny.The extended version of the film is the superior cut, though it suggests that Leon actually could love Mathilda in a sexual way if he had not been heartbroken in his youth. I prefer the notion that Leon's love for her is purely fatherly despite the convincing nature of Mathilda's crush. Still, the film never comes close to the pedophilia that some accuse the film of depicting.",

He makes his living carrying out assassinations for numerous clients and is the best in his trade. His only contact besides from TOny, his mentor and \"manager\" is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), the disillusioned 12 year old daughter of his neighbors. His ascetic lifestyle is shattered forever when Mathildas family gets slaughtered by corrupt cops lead by psychotic Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) while she is shopping. SHe finds refuge in his apartment and once she finds out his job, convinces/forces him to train her so she can get revenge for her family. As she progresses both Leon and Mathilda warm up to each other and develop a caring, loving relation ship. Finally she tracks down the killers and Leon and Mathilda have to confront them in a final deadly showdown.What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said a thousand times? Theoretically nothing, but after having seen the Directors Cut just a few hours ago, I just have to talk (or rather write) about it. IF anyone else had done this movie, it would have probably degraded into a normal Hollywood action flick. But great acting by the entire cast, a great direction by Luc Besson make this movie a real benchmark for both action films an dramas! Jean Reno plays lonely and sad Leon with such a vigor that you almost believe that he IS Leon! Nathalie Portman goes even further and actually becomes Mathilda. She turns out such a heart wrenching performance as the confused scared and angry little girl that you can't help but shed tears at several places during the movie. As for Gary Oldman, well he was way over the top with Norman Stansfield but in a good way. I wanted to strangle that guy from the first time I saw him on screen! But it is the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Jean Reno that really makes this movie work. They LIVE their relationship without it ever turning into anything even remotely pedophile!! Camera-work is excellent, and gives this movie the feel of a classical painting! The action sequences are first rate. Just check out how the camera follows that Rifle Grenade in the final showdown, and remember that this was done well before the advent of the CGI flood!

Jean Reno's Leon and Natalie Portman's Mathilda are absolutely flawless together.  The best scene between them IMHO (without giving it away) is the guessing game they play together.  We are really able to see Leon's heart melting as he and this girl become closer and closer, and he doesn't allow the relationship with her to change or alter hardly any of the lifestyle he is accustomed to.Gary Oldman (has this man gotten an Oscar?  If not, WHY????) is his usual wonderful, psychotic, static self.  Every scene he's in is a wonder to watch.  Check out his scene in the men's room with Mathilda.  Both Natalie Portman and he give their all in a most gripping scene.Natalie Portman is a gem.  Danny Aiello and the rest of the cast are top-notch also.  What more could you expect from Besson?

I love to appreciate the movie that people have thought great and classic. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is the themeof this film. The director Luc Besson, as always, both makes the film look beautiful and builds plenty of atmospheres into it. He is clever at directing the figures and the psychology. Nobody can make more success than him, that's why I appreciate him.\nThis is a wonderful film. The story, which at first glance is unrealistic and silly, actually becomes gripping and emotional in the hands of the skilled Jean Reno and that little girl. The characters are sympathetic and cute, and one is touched by the depthof the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. The character of their enemy, Norman Stansfield, is scary and insane.\nThe story tells us that Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl. She has a misery life. Her father is involved in handling drugs for a crooked cop called Norman Stansfield One day, Mathilda encounters Leon (acted by Jean Reno), professional hitman, the little girl is out shopping for Leon when Stansfield kills the rest of her family, and fortunately she takes shelter in Leon's house, .It is that Matilda went straight to Leon's when she saw her family was killed.It is thatLeon saw in the keyhole that Matilda",

            "content": "A common theme throughout the films of Luc Besson is that his characters are like Charles Bronson in Once Upon a Time in the West, \"They've got something inside, something to do with death,\" this theme had certainly been explored before in The Big Blue and La Femme Nikita, but I think it reaches it's peak with this film.The three leads (Reno, Portman, and Oldman) are just perfect in their roles, I have a hard time imagining anyone else playing them.  A lot of child actors aren't very good (which is understandable), but Portman gives a great performance in this film.  I really wish Jean Reno starred in more films, it seems like he only has supporting roles in all the other ones I've seen him in.  Gary Oldman turns in one of the great villian performances of recent history.As much as I enjoy Hong Kong action films by directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam, it's nice to see an action film done in a different style like this one is.    I haven't seen much French action other than Besson's films, most of the European action I've seen are Italian films from the 70s and 80s like with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, and Maurizio Merli.  Some are good, a lot are pretty forgettable.  Leon kind of puts me in mind of a modern-set spaghetti western, like a lot of Italian actioners (a lot of which were made by people who got their start making westerns, like Enzo G. Castellari).  I think Leon really stands out from other European-made actioners, and I also think it's a really unique film in the action-crime genre.  Granted, the basic concept of the story may not be unique, but it's what Besson does with it that makes it unique.As I've said in other commentaries of Besson films, I think he has a really great visual style.  When you talk about the look of the film, production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast definately deserve credit, both of them also worked on La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. The music by Eric Serra is very good too.*****Possible Minor Spoilers in next paragraph********If you're really interested in this film, do yourself a favor and seek out the extended version.  With a lot of directors' cuts, the additional scenes are interesting, but not essential to the plot, and you can see why they were cut to streamline the film; but this one is different.  I think the American version of the film (under the really lame re-title The Professional) is damaged by the absence of the 20 minutes of footage that was cut from it.  With the possible exception of one or two scenes, I think everything that was cut is essential to the story.  What's possibly my favorite sequence in the movie (when Leon takes Matilda on a series of assignments, and she puts gum over the peepholes of the apartments they go to) was cut from the American version, I think it's interesting that part of this sequence foreshadows the ending (I won't say how for those of you who haven't seen it yet).  There's also an explanation of what Tony meant when he said that Leon had gotten in trouble over a woman before, which also explains why Leon doesn't return Matilda's sexual advances (I really dislike how the American version leaves the issue of their relationship unresolved by the absence of this scene, and I think having them wake up in bed together without this scene is just sloppy.)  Still, this is far from the worst American tampering with a Besson film.The climax of the film is just an incredible piece of filmmaking, comparable to the Peckinpah-style church shootout at the end of John Woo's The Killer. Even though Besson's other films are very good too, I think this is his masterpiece to date, and just a great film any way you slice it.  It's one of my top ten favorite movies.  Go rent it right now if you haven't already, If you have a DVD player, go rent the DVD, Leon, like all Besson films, simply must be seen letterboxed, much like Sergio Leone's films.  Besson's brilliant shot composition is just ruined by pan and scanning.",

He was not equipped to deal with or handle that type of involvement. I hate that I had to give it a 7 rating, because like I said, it was a great movie.",

I loved the opening scene, not the shoot out, but the scene where he accepts the job. And I did love the action scene too. It was different ands creative. It wasn't all a bunch of bullets flying around. There was some cool s--t he can do without using a gun. I was under the impression this was an action film, so I expected a lot more violence. But really there is only two action scenes. I really enjoyed that factor because it showed that the movie didn't rely on action to keep it good. The film was more about the relationship of Leon and Matilda(I hate that name). The best scene between them was the dress-up scene, it showed how close the two were getting. And the action scene at the end was pretty cool. It shows that Luc Besson really has an eye for action. Overall 9/10",

Hopefully with the release of Big Blue, Subway and the uncut version of Leon it will be possible to see it soon).Professional- It takes multiple viewings to really appreciate it's subtleties, which most people would deny it has. But once you get past the explosive action, which apon multiple viewings you realize there really isn't much action you'll see that it is mostly about the relationship between Leon and Matilda.And this is where the subtleties come into play. So I suggest watching it a few more times to appreciate just how well-crafted and well-played these characters are.Jean Reno is perfect in this film and Natalie Portman is so good it's scary. (Considering she's so young)Gary Oldman is of course Gary Oldman. He's ferociously great as the over the top crooked cop.Danny Aiello is good as Leon's sort of slimey boss.Just a great original story, great acting, and great action.And it doesn't have the cheesey happy ending that pollutes most movies now.It's not the best movie in the world but for the reasons above and some other unknown reasons it has become one of my favorites. I'm waiting in great anticipation and slight frustration for the un-cut DVD out in August. Great anticipation: the extra 24 minutes. Frustration: I already own the US version on DVD and I don't like having to buy another. They do this on purpose and I think it's really shady of them to not tell you that another version is coming out when they release the original. Although this did come out on DVD a while ago and they probably didn't know they would release another version.But judging by how the uncut version is a best-seller already and isn't coming out till August 15th. I would say I'm not the only one who felt the bite on this one.",

She was so terrific in this! I was astounded by her ability - especially the scene where she walks down the hall past her apartment door to discover her family was murdered with the Perpetrators still inside. She keeps walking, trying not to show any emotion to give away the fact that she lives there as there's a man standing outside sort of 'guarding' the place. She goes to her neighbor's door and starts knocking. Tears are streaming down her cheeks and she has a look of horror and desperation on her face as she whispers, \"Open the door, please. Please open the door!\" over and over. I almost started crying for her. She is truly a fantastic actress. And to think she did this at the age of 12-13! The whole movie was just packed full of incredible scenes such as this. Another scene that made my heart melt was the scene where she tries to explain to L\u00e9on  how she knows that she's in love with him: \"I have this warm feeling in my stomach. There was a knot there before but now it's gone.\" And the scene where she dresses up as Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Gene Kelly. She was so adorable singing and acting. \"a mustache.\" she says trying to look serious and melancholy like Chaplin.Reno was very good as well. I never really thought too much of him before (neither liked him nor disliked him). This movie shows that he really has a great talent.What probably amazed me the most about this was that Luc Besson both wrote it and directed it. Very well done. I hope he makes more like this one! While I liked Jean de Arc and the 5th Element I wouldn't put them in the same class as this one.I give it 10 out of 10. On a bad day I might go down to 9\u00bd. ;o)",

            "content": "*WARNING, a few minor SPOILERS* I have heard this film categorised in many ways. Some call it a romance, some call it an action movie, some call it a drama.However, you can slice it into each genre, and this film still deserves equal recognition for all three. As a romance, this is heartwrenching and slightly bizarre. As an action movie, this has all the correct elements; stunning stunts, a solid hero, a determined prodege and an evil villain. And as a drama, this film shows artistic flair, offers interesting, developed characters and uses music and lighting to heighten emotion.It is my conclusion then, that this movie need not be categorised. It should simply be realised as one of the finest films ever made.\nI have always considered Luc Besson to be one of the most flamboyant directors of the nineties. He is a blessing upon European cinema, and here is allowed to use lighting, sound, camera work and the cast itself to astonishing effect.The lighting in this movie is so important. From the first action sequence, where Leon emerges from the shadows to threaten a cowardly drug runner, to the final sequence in which Nathalie Portman plants his tree under a yellowy orange hue. Each scene is filled with colour (or darkness) that accentuates or deafens the action.The sound is stunning also. From Leon's subtle mumbles, to the chaotic explosion and gunfight sequences. again the sounds serve as a real emphasis on the emotion or action in the film. Just watch the sequence where Stansfield storms the house with his men. It transforms from silence to deafening gunshot fire in seconds.Camera work and editing are something that Besson is magically skilled with. Somehow he knows when to cut a scene, when to let the action unfold and when to use a little editing technique just to keep you guessing what's gonna happen next. There are a number of revealing close-ups in the movie (where Leon backs out of killing Mathilda), yet there are sequences that will blow you away when considering editing. The final action sequence; the laser sighting on SWAT teams rifles, Leon fighting off Agent after Agent and the climactic rally down the stairs posed as a SWAT leader himself. I'm giving away that final battle, I don't mean to. But you will feel like you are part of that gunfight yourself. You will either want to get in there and help Leon out, or you will cower in a corner in the same way as Mathilda.And the cast, oh the cast. Besson can obviously get the best out of Jean Reno, he already has in 'The Big Blue'. And Reno is at his mumbling Euro/American best here! It's no coincidence that Reno hasn't stood out since he moved on to Hollywood. He probably needs a director of Bessons artistic class to get such a good performance from him.\nGary Oldman relishes his villainous Norman Stansfield. His accent is flawless as ever, and he gets exactly the right amount of screen time. Oldman also has some barnstorming sequences of dialogue. \"You don't like Beethoven. You don't know what you're missing.....\" But best of all, Oldman is EVIL. He has no standards. He is not discriminative about who lives and who dies, and he is completely motivated by self-gain.To summarise, this movie is sheer artistic class. In every nook and cranny you find elements that make a film a classic. Wether this film has gained enough recognition to stand the test of time I don't know, ask me in twenty years and I hope I answer......yes.",

The odd relationship between the loner hit-man and the 12 year old girl he harbours is the most intriguing aspect of the film; although riddled with the suggestion of a strange, oddly adult relationship between the pair the viewer never feels in any way repulsed by what turns out to be a touching coupling. Perhaps that is because of the character of Mathila, a strong commanding young role played fantastically by a young Natalie Portman. The balance in her strength and Leon's vulnerability despite his profession gives this film an emotional depth it could easily have lacked.The second thing which makes this movie brilliant is the amazing Gary Oldman; his performance in 'Leon' will be remembered as one of his best, and is certainly his best to date in my opinion. Chilling as the cold, corrupted city cop, gun-happy and utterly irredeemable, Oldman presents a true psychopath.And it is all, of course, shot with seemingly effortless style and a great tense atmosphere by the wonderful Luc Besson (Nikita, Angel A, The Fifth Element, Joan of Arc and The Big Blue).'Leon' is something truly unique; an action film that has intensity, a genuinely thrilling villain, a touching hero and earnest emotional depth. This movie is not just for action fans, but ANYONE who enjoys a good movie. It will have you captured from the first vast city encompassing frame.",

            "content": "The movie Leon is truly one of the best things I have ever watched. A legendary Luc Besson's picture. Even thought it was released in 1994 it is still as topical and urgent as at the first screening in cinema. An incredible criminal thriller about a mastership of the murder, unexpected accidental meeting and an amazing pure love between two opposites.How can a professional killer fall in love with a little girl, whose family was killed? Well, Leon, an expert killer, whose life is nothing more but completing one 'order' after another one, played by an unsurpassed Jean Reno, didn't expect this to happen as well. His routine was monotonous when Natalie Portman in a role of a 12 years old Mathilda appeared in his doorway. And this acquaintance changed his priorities and life.The best part of the movie is its atmosphere and aesthetic of The Little Italy in New York, mafia and dirty cops, muted colors and Sting's song during the titles, which is still inimitable to these days. Moreover, the French charm and criminal cruel scenes are looking surprisingly good together. There are many details in this movie that made people who didn't even watch the scene like it. One of the main one of them is Mathilda's outfit with red beanie, khaki jacket, black round glasses, which became an inspiration for many members of teenage subcultures.What has to be also mentioned, people love to watch films based on easy basic concepts. The whole movie is a game of contrasts and incompatibilities. A grown man and a little girl, a killer and a blameless child, guns and kids, murders and a friendship, immortal love and death. This whole movie is a confrontation of black and white. That is also its secret of an unfading success.Summing up, I can't think of anything bad about this movie or things I don't like, so I am just going to say that this movie is amazing and everybody who hasn't watched it yet should do this and those who has already seen it can rewatch it again because it is worth it.",

The performances are great all around: Besson regular Jean Reno and Natalie Portman shine as L\u00e9on and Mathilda; their scenes together are always a joy to watch. Gary Oldman is creepy as hell as manic, pill-popping DEA agent Stansfield; with everything he does, he exudes nastiness. The film's action climax is masterfully done; Besson has a flair for filming action scenes that almost mirrors that of John Woo.With this amount of talent, Besson made a movie that works on many levels. It's also refreshing to have a movie not include an ending that panders to Hollywood's tastes. Do yourself a favor and rent this; it blows most stateside productions outta the water.",

Jean Reno's acting displayed his key to success by being dramatic yet maintaining a sense of masculinity expected by society for a narratives masculine characters.  Gary Oldman is psychotic, a great antagonist who shows that he thinks before he acts. Natalie Portman is wonderful, showing off the talent, potential, and intelligence that she embodies.  Leon's greatest element is the reversal used in the narrative making the hitman an hero and the cops the enemies. the only real problem I have doesn't come from the film, but from what happens to the actors afterward.  Jeno Reno ending up in parts like Rollerball and Natalie Portman acting in star wars.  Not that I have a problem with star wars, yet her acting abilities are seriously restrained for that part.  Leon does have major potential for a sequel which I hear may be in the works but at the same time I can see where it could ruin the narrative if not handled correctly.  Personally, the roots metaphor should be carried over and Mathilda should kill with a knife at the end due to that was proclaimed as the last lesson she would learn to be a real professional. See this film and watch the international version also if you get a chance. Both create a different feel toward the ending.",

After the first time I saw it, I saw it over and over, maybe 10 times, until I had to return it to the video store. Now it has become my all time favourite movie. This movie has everything that a great movie should have; a good script, a good directing, a good cinematography, good actors, good soundtrack and good edit.  Actors were so mature that every character existed.  Especially I couldn't believe that it was Natalie Portman's debut film. The cinematography was somewhat similar to the European art movies, which I love, and Eric Serra's melancholic music made this movie even more emotional.  The best thing, however, about this movie is the story.  The innocent love between Leon and Mathilda was very fairy tale like but still very beliavable and moving. Luc Besson had created the most expert killer in film history, after this movie came out killers in other movies are always compared with Leon, with humanity, which is very original. Luc Besson is not the greatest movie director alive.  \"The Last Battle\", \"The Big Blue\" and \"La Femme Nikita\" were good but \"Subway\", \"The Fifth Element\", \"Taxi\" and \"Joan of Arc\" were disappointing.  But still, Luc Besson is a wonderful writer/ director because of Leon.  Leon the director's cut has come out recently.  However I strongly recommend movie lovers to see the regular one first",

Leon (Jean Reno), a skilled but illiterate \"cleaner\" or professional hitman, had just sped through the streets.\"La Femme Nikita\" was based on the idea that its heroine was initially a fully barbaric character without a decent bone in her body, and that after society took advantage of her barbarism, she gradually became civilised through the love of a nice, straightforward guy.

But this movie is after all all about character development, just like most of the movies are.Even the bad guy of the movie, the DEA boss is a deep character. Same guy that was in 5th Element - brilliant actor. It's much to his skill that makes this movie work so well. Then again actor such as Jean Reno needs a counterpart almost as strong as him.Music was good enough but didn't really leave me touched.

I mean it shouldn't be in the top 40 (or so) films of all time list.After watching Leon I felt rather hard done by, yes the review I've given is good and it's deserved but it can hardly be considered a masterpiece. To satisfy curiosity I suggest it's worth the watch, if only for another spellbinding turn by undoubtedly the greatest English actor of his generation. Not only has Gary Oldman set the benchmark for sociopathic villains, but his touch is so feather light that the eccentricities of each individual movement are as delightfully entrancing as they are wickedly sickening. Yes, admittedly my admiration for the man led me to write this review but only because I feel it important to tell others that this is one of his best performances to date and that it prevents this movie from being forgotten. I watched the film after seeing a 'Top Ten Gary Oldman Performances' video on the old youtube thingymajigg ('watchmojo' is a very interesting channel, go on... check it out.) and this has led me to scouring the internet for different films involving this guy, and honestly, and fairly upsettingly, I can't think of a better way I could've spent my time. In my, not too sought after opinion, he is the greatest actor I've ever seen and I repeatedly tell my friends ( and I know I don't sound like a guy who has any, but I'm fairly certain that they can be counted as friends ( don't ask them in case I'm wrong )) to study the man in great detail. I mean, they hadn't even heard of him. Anyway, in all honesty, this review was supposed to be serious but I fear I'm losing my way. So on we go... The performance of Reno is sturdy as is the support of the majority of the cast; obviously the use of a child acting doesn't fail to annoy, even though the girl in question went on to reach stardom (didn't see that coming). I'm not an expert in direction so I'm not in a place to comment on Besson's job, but he's created an enjoyable film that certainly breaches the norm, so top marks there. I don't know what to make of the French, this film points in their favour though. I think this conclusion gives me an excuse to compliment G.O. so I will. All I'll say is that if you have the intention/hope/dream of going into acting, or simply just admire this strand of entertainment: this guy's the man to watch. Sorry for going on, anyway I liked it... I suggest giving it a go.",

The intensity and mix of a professional hitman returning home after a working day taking care of his plant peaked my interest but best was yet to come.The hallway scene that moved into the apartment of Mathilda and his family is still after all this time a thing of movie wonder to me and Gary Oldman who became my instant favourite actor still holds this spot after almost 30 years.New York and the realism is depicted in the movie is something truly awesome. Also the play of colors in different scenes sets the mood almost before you know something is about to happen and the saturation makes the films style unique in some way.The actors including Oldman, Reno, Portman, Aiello and Badalucco carry the movie with ease and you are left in astonishment what you just witnessed when at the end Oldman and Reno meet for the first and the last time.To make the movie even more emotional at the end is the perfect cut of Sting's Shape of my Heart starting straight after the last line and concluding in the end credits.

It was written and directed by Luc Besson. This movie earned about $46 million, whereas the budget of the movie is $16 million. Jean Reno played L\u00e9on. Mathilda was played by the talented young Natalie Portman.L\u00e9on is a professional assassin. He lives in New York and has a lonely life without friends and family. One day he saves Mathilda Lando, a 12-year-old girl. This changes his life completely.The dynamics of emotions has a big effect in this movie. It is a real tearjerker but I can't think of any scenes from this movie that should have been cut. The movie gives an atmosphere of suspense. \"L\u00e9on: The Professional\" received a positive response from many critics. It won several Awards and received many nominations.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",

Not only does it contain thrilling action sequences, brilliantly directed, it also has great dramatical power and the three main performances of Leon, Mathilda and Stansfield are all superbly delivered, each one very special on its own. I also must praise the great cinematography and photography of this movie, which is a trademark of Besson's. Jean Reno certainly gives one of his best performances (excellent actor overall) as the deadly yet childish Leon, a character with a sensitivity so appealing it's impossible to dislike him, in spite of his office. Natalie Portman is just mind-blowing in her character Mathilda, a tortured child with incredible strength and hopefulness. Some have said that Gary Oldman is over the top in this, but I just find his character exhilarating, so unpredictable and creepy, you actually become afraid of him, which is very, very uncommon in most villains, specially recent ones,totally predictable and boring. I only wish action movies were made along these lines, with a simple, yet powerful story, and characters you actually care about and feel related to. Great Movie.",

            "content": "I don't know what everybody is gushing about. It's a nice action movie, but has improbable to impossible scenes just to move along the movie. The dress-up game to help the memory is a good one. They live in squalor. They have nothing. Yet the kid has no trouble going into the bedroom and putting on expensive clothes so she can pretend to be a celebrity. The guy is supposed to be a hitman, yet he allows the girl to \"practice\" on the rooftop of their apartment building which, of course, would draw a ton of attention. He kills for a living, but he allows his boss to keep the money? Really? He hangs straight down from above the apartment doorway to fire on the cops and then bends backwards and upwards to escape. His legs would have to be in the hallway to do that move. He escapes by pretending to be one of the cops. Sure, this same ploy has worked in many many other movies, but only because directors seem to think that cops don't know the people they work with.There are easy ways to overcome all of these faults. Basically, I think they took the first idea to come to mind. The kid could have acted like the star/actress without magically having these outfits available in her bedroom. They could have practiced firing in the country, at a range, at a paint ball park, etc. Instead they chose to draw attention to themselves by doing it on the roof. They shot at cops, and somehow the cops didn't come to investigate. They could have had some sort of apparatus at the door so he could do his upside down shooting, but nothing helpful was on or near the door. He could have escaped in any number of ways, but pretending to be a cop in the middle of a bunch of cops is plain stupid.There were more glaring deficiencies. The ones I wrote about were just the ones that popped to mind as I typed. Nice action, but really flawed. I give it 8 stars for the action and nothing for the Lolita angle. It wasn't deep. It wasn't insightful. And it sure as heck wasn't necessary to the movie.",

            "content": "I'm not too surprised someone could not like this movie, since it is very violent and features characters with questionable morals. I'd like to respond to them. Leon: Yes he's an assassin. Is he a \"good\" man? The thing with Leon seems to be that he really a child. He does his job with such detached efficiency that the viewer has to doubt whether he really understand what he is doing. His paternal affection for a plant and his love of old cinema hint at an innocence that is somehow protected from his violent acts, and could in some strange way be the cause of his unnatural skill in his job. While Gary Oldman snarls and dances as he kills, Reno is just pulling a trigger. Are we supposed to like him? Is he a hero? Leon is what we call an Antihero. That is, a main character of the story with flaws or questionable morals. The movie challenges us to accept the enigma that is Leon, not necessary like him. Matilda: Contrasting Leon in almost every way, there is Matilda. A young girl who is wise to the ways of the world, she wants to kill. Leon is the real child, an innocent, and the one with the power to kill. Matilda is also just coming into puberty. Don't tell me that when young boys hit puberty they don't want to look at dirty little pictures of adult women. Why would girl's infatuation be different? Her infatuation is more than a crush, she lusts his power to kill as well. Her blase reaction to Leon's preffsion \"Cool\" is not a battlecry for young middle-schoolers to start taking sharp-shooting classes in anticipation of a future career in contract killing, it is a jarring reminder that Matilda's life has been tainted with violence, that she now craves it and wants to be able to inflict it.Leon's tutalege isn't moral. Leon is trying to be a parental figure, but killing is the only thing he knows. Its a twisted father-daughter relationship, founded on the promise of violence and complicated by sexual tension. Anyone who claims there is no sexual tension between the two is lying or blind. Is this crush glorified as cool and hip? Heck no. The clerk reacts in surprise and disgust, and Leon clearly sees himself as a father figure. Despite all of this baggage, a bond developes between the two, perhaps because they are two halves of a whole person. Together they are one. Well anyway, this is all just my reaction to the movie. If you look a little closer, I'm sure you'll realize that this movie is not trumpeting \"Have sex with older men with big sniper rifles!\"",

Be sure to check out the film True Romance, another great movie, which Oldman's character has a short run, but displays his great ability for taking on any role and giving it his all.

They give what each doesn't have and They find out what they should've gotten. And finally, to keep Mathilda's pure, Leon vengaced himself instead of she to kill the police who killed Mathilda's brother.It was my first to see Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. Their love was perfect as people impressed and actions of the killer, Leon, fascinated my mind. When I saw Leon laughed as a child with see the old movie 'singing in the rain', it was comedy, actually; I laughed it as if Leon, too.

Included are about 25 some-odd minutes of material that was deemed too explicit to fit the \"R\" rating (R= restricted material, appropriate for ages 17 and older) and therefore was cut.For the most part, there were 2 major sequences that were evidently not in the original US \"R\" version that I had viewed.  The first one concerns Mathilda's \"first hit\".  The second, in chronological order, concerns Leon's \"first love\".I can see from the editor's point of view that there were indeed some scenes that were a bit out of place, and perhaps lagged a bit, but I have to argue that there was definitely some incredible pieces of film being blatantly chopped off of Besson's masterpiece.  Not since a certain New York DJ was sued by the FCC have I seen such a horrible stifling of genius by censorship.Violence and sex have been major themes in movies for a long time, but mixing children with violence and sex is taboo, at least thats what the censors had in mind.  As a previous IMDb reviewer stated, these scenes are in fact disturbing, but that is exactly what Besson has in mind.  By cleaning up the film to present it in its \"R\" version, much of the emotional connection Besson crafted was lost, and just a little bit of the meaning behind some major plot tools (I'll be as vague as possible to protect those who have not seen the uncut version) such as the \"ring trick\", the \"pink dress\", the \"skull cap\" (or whatever its called), and the \"bed share\".If you love this film, buy the DVD: unrated version, and enjoy.

First of all how are Gary Oldman and all of his henchman cops?? Why does Oldman have the power to call 500 cops in full body armor and fire rocket launchers in the middle of NYC?! Why does Leon seem mentally handicapped? Where is Mathilda's mother? Why is Leon always drinking milk? Why does Natalie Portman barely have any reaction to her entire family being gunned down.

Natalie Portman at 12 is already excellent, and given a chance so few have: while there are many younger actors a mere handful can win these starring roles, and in serious films they're too young to see. Comparable to Kick-Ass, though this original suspense flies past the modern indie-wannabe in daylight. Nothing was stilted nor pushed too far and the story, yet unmentioned, is simply insightful. The only reason I give an 8, not 9 or even 10, is because 8 is my favourite number, and so only given to those which are worthy. The actors own their roles, and should play these characters more often. (This is) A favourite that will (unexpectedly?) last a long time.",

            "content": "I just watched this awesome piece of cinematography, starring 11 year old Natalie Portman (in her debut role), Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. Directed and written by Luc Gasson, also known for The 5th Element, Taken 2, among others. I must say I am a little late to the parade but like a fine wine I was able to digest this wonderful display of art, which with the passing of age has acquired a more profound and exquisite experience than any other movie I have seen in recent times. It all starts with us meeting Leon (Jean Reno), the stealthy and magnificent hit-man which never fails to deliver. He's not your typical 007 agent, you know the type, the one with the cool factor, driving the latest sports car, all the super spy gadgetry stuff at his mercy and with a Victoria's Secret model dangling from his arm. He represents the complete opposite; very reserved, low-key guy and without the slightest need or interest in human relationships (at least that's what we glean from the surface, but our leading man is much more interesting than we could imagine). Then we meet Mathilda (Natalie Portman), which I give an standing ovation, it's incredible the amount of maturity and complexity she accomplished to portray being only 11 years old at the time and this being her first movie, some actresses have years in the business and have never reached that level, talk about natural talent. 12 year old Mathilda has endured a lot of misfortunes which forced her to mature at such a young age, and robbed her of the innocent child phase. The worst of it all is when she losses the only thing that she held dear to her heart, her little brother, along with the rest of her family but the latter she sees is it as more of a relieve than anything else. When these two souls encounter each other, Leon and Mathilda, both with nothing to lose and at the same time with a convoluted sense of self and life, they flourish and find something worth fighting for, each other. It's too simplistic to label it as a revenge story, it goes much deeper than that. It portrays what human beings are able to endure and sacrifice if they find something worth living or for that matter dying for. Nietzsche said it best \"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\"*Excuse any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.",

            "content": "In \"L\u00e9on\", the title character (who is a professional \"cleaner\", or hitman) wears his trademark beanie hat and small circular sunglasses whenever on the job to hide his immediate identity:  he goes to necessary lengths not to be recognized.  In a way, the adornment of this combo is the dividing point between himself and his work.  L\u00e9on needs that.  A clear barrier to seperate the two sides of his life.  And when he's working, no one is better.  In the first action sequence, director Luc Besson shows us the full set piece of how our hero behaves during office hours: methodical, precise, deadly.  He moves like Batman, somehow navigating through the building unseen and well enough to off all the bad guys without even breaking a sweat.  It's Besson's exclamation point saying, \"This is how good he can be!\".In the aftermath, when the hat and the glasses are taken off, L\u00e9on becomes the average Joe.  Walking along the streets of modern New York with a Chaplin waddle, he leads a lonely but simple existence:  water his plant, do his situps, and drink his milk.  He doesn't need anything else.  The plant is his companion, the situps his release, the milk his indulgence.  This Order Of Things shows a childlike contentment.  As long as he does things right, he's not a bad person.Meanwhile, down three doors lives Mathilda (young young young Natalie Portman), the waifish daughter of a drug middleman.  With a bully sister, a prostitute step-mother, an abusive father, and a cheery little brother whom she looks after, she, save for her brother, has little to look forward to. When a crooked D.E.A. officer (Gary Oldman - more electric in this movie than he's ever been) slaughters her family over a drug dispute while she's at the store, she has no choice but to intrude on the life of the Man At The End Of The Hall, L\u00e9on.  It means her life.Extremely relunctant, he eventually agrees to take Mathilda under his wing and train her to \"clean\".  Their relationship quickly blossoms like a giant magnolia, with him providing shelter, and her providing a little life in his life.Mixing his French influences with New York sensibility, Luc Besson OUTDOES himself.  The entire film foreshadows something else, and the incredibly well-scripted emotional growth shown by the two main characters is all the greater foreshadow to how much the wonderfully unwired Gary Oldman character needs to be punished for his madness.  This movie flawlessly blends the best of both worlds:  it is at once both a movie guys would love and a movie girls would love.  It's the unisex action film.Among the ten best films of the 1990s, definitely Luc Besson's best movie, and dare I say, one of the best love stories ever made.Five stars.",

            "content": "This Movie is GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!!!!Luc Besson(the director and screenwriter of Leon,as long as other successful movies)did a miracle by creating this movie...Movies like this are Rare and maybe it doesn't exist yet one movie that can be matched to Leon. Every kind of movie fan will like it,I can guarantee that(maybe only small kids wouldn't like it as they wouldn't like the violence and they wouldn't understand the emotional part of the movie).-Action film fans will love it for for Jean Reno's great stunts in the beginning,but especially in the end.Just for you to understand the quality of the stunts,they were so well executed that at the same time they seemed like they were taken from a modern action film,without Leon doing something impossible.I had never seen a movie where a single man goes against an army of armed guys portrayed in such a believable way,I mean...even the holes in the story have been covered:Jean Reno didn't learn to fight an army of men in the last half hour of the movie,but he plays one of the best assassins that ever existed,so it's normal what he did.Plus the movie shows us that Leon(Jean Reno) even though was very well trained and without emotions,was also vulnerable to bullets and human,something that we see in the wounds he takes in some scenes(I won't continue,I don't want to spoil the movie to you).-As for emotional types this movie is again great:The story of Love(and when I say love I mean Father to Daughter Love,even though Matilda/Natalie Portman was a bit further than this point-don't misunderstand me)that is slowly formed between Leon and Matilda is great,as it doesn't happen immediately(in a scene from the beginning Leon tries to shoot Matilda in her sleep,but in the end he can't make it...oooops sorry I won't speak anymore of the movie),but slowly and in the way it would happen if this story was real.It will show them how two different strangers will learn to love and feel compassion for each other...some of them may even cry a bit.-And in the end,fans of comedies/adventure movies will also like it because it also shows some funny jokes once in a while(but don't expect Jim Carrey/Ben Stiler jokes). This movie will surely keep everyone seated in front of the screen without even going once to take a glass of water or peeing... The characters were also great: -Gary Oldman perfectly plays the role of a corrupted psycho cop who loves Beethoven,-Natalie Portman makes us really believe that she is a just a small and weak girl,but that wants to learn from Leon how to kill in order to avenge the murder of her little Brother,but also generally to give justice to all bad people,-But the star of the show was....JEAN RENO!!!In this movie he is brilliant,I don't know if they gave him an Oscar or another award,but he surely deserved it.The way he shows us his two sides:the side of the ruthless assassin and the side of the lonely man who enjoys some company,is awesome.It is clearly showed that every man has a heart and that in the most particular moment he can change,take away from his face his cold mask and start showing his emotions. To conclude,I suggest every movie fan to watch this movie,they will love it.I hope that my comment also helped those who didn't understand it's power(no offense). I give it a 9.5/10 ;-D",

            "content": "I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clich\u00e9s, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",

            "content": "Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hit- man. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbor. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbor. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterizations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself. This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history",

Special care was taken to show that Mathilda (Natalie Portman) connects with, and trusts maybe the only person in her life so far. She then falls in love with him, which is easy to dismiss as puppy love, but for a girl as mature, and who has seen so much ill in her life I don't think so. The same goes for Leon who because of his profession, has not let anything emotional in his life besides his plant. But Mathilda changes all of that. He finally finds I think another purpose to his life besides *cleaning* and you begin to see the affect it has on him, especially when he immediately goes to save her in the DEA headquarters without a care to his own welfare. Now that is love. I've heard some audiences didn't like the sexual overtone between leon, and mathilda, but it didn't bother me. It exists and it does so to reflect the possibilities of life, and love. I think that this film is more of a character study than an action film. I like action but character study even more.

He is one of my all time favorite actor for the work he does but something about Stansfield is just so delicious. If I had to recommend this film to someone I would say, \"you have to see it especially for the character Stansfield.\" It's one of those performances that keeps me inspired in my own career as an actor. Aside from my own personal admiration for Gary Oldman, the film is full of moments any film lover can appreciate. Subtle humor, great action, cleaver writing and the relationship between Leon and Mathilda is fabulous.Damn good movie.",

Very similar to Nikita in a way but i guess that's Luc's way of doing a sequel, just like Fifth Element and Valerian but all still magic nevertheless.

The story of a lone assassin taking in a orphaned girl and finding his redemption sounds cliched and awful, but some great acting and intelligent direction makes this a movie that's a pleasure to watch. The real standouts here are Natalie Portman and Jean Reno in the lead roles. Portman proves herself to be an amazing actress, playing an emotionally deep character and some powerful scenes with absolute perfection. Reno is no less impressive; making the obsessive and reclusive but immensely skillful Leon an hugely likeable character despite his less-than-savoury occupation. The contrast of the independent adult and scared child with the fact that Leon is rather bumbling and awkward in everyday life, whereas Mathilde is outgoing and sharp makes for a fascinating character-based movie. Of course it isn't all good. Particularly, Gary Oldman is dreadful. His neck-twisting, face-pulling pantomime performance is embarrasing to watch, especially in comparison to the reserved performance by Jean Reno. That's the only real flaw with this movie though. It is \"comic book\" enough to be entertaining but has enough emotional interplay to be engaging. Top marks!",

She tells him that she loves him. In one scene she insisted he kiss her. In another scene she forced him to have sex with her and in act of love she forced him to share a bed with her (not sex sadly).\nThe movie was very inspirational for me and there were many lofty scenes in the movie.\nPersonally I loved like the movie.",

(But then what did you expect of yet another hitman movie in 1994?)\nBesson borrows heavily from his own \"Nikita\", Melville's \"Le Samourai\" and Cassavetes' \"Gloria\", especially in the first 30 minutes. But after that it quickly takes a shape all its own.\nAnd yes, there are some huge holes in logic but \"Leon\" must be seen more as a modernist fairy-tale than a gritty thriller in order to makes sense.\"Leon\" is foremost anchored by the four (yes, that's right!) lead performances by Reno, Portman, Aiello and Oldman, all brilliantly framed by Besson's stylized direction.\nAll four actors give highly emotional performances unlike anything you have ever seen before. And despite their characters having opposing agendas or being downright antagonist they all seem to be part of the same family. All of their (re-)actions make sense, if judged purely from an emotional POV.This setup is actually strongly reminiscent of Sergio Leone's spagehtti westerns and it is obvious throughout the film that he was a big influence on Besson - from the close-up mughshots to the theme-heavy Morricone-esque score.\nBut Besson injects a modern style that is partly influenced by John McTiernan, James Cameron, John Woo and french \"cinema du look\", creating a hybrid that is totally original.",

Then I arched another eyebrow when Mathilda appeared with a \"Marilyn\" white halter dress, that just happened to be the perfect size for a 12-year-old girl?One might speculate that she retrieved clothes from her old apartment, but that seems implausible. Consider this: Shortly after Mathilda moved in with Leon, the pair moved to another apartment. The charades scene precedes the scene where Mathilda visits her old apartment. Are we to believe that Mathilda was able to access a guarded apartment twice after they moved?Just thought I'd pose the question- I'm no continuity expert, and I've been willing to suspend belief the other 200 times I've watched this excellent film.",

It is conceivable why this movie may not be liked by all; its European style is not for all tastes. But there is more emphasis on development of situations, granted they are average run-of-the-mill at that, than there is on the action, which is refreshing. Gary Oldman is over-the-top, but that's to be expected. And the Lolita-esque subplot between the two protagonists is intriguing. Besson should be more proud of this film than The Fifth Element.

Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",

Mathilda on the other hand is a young girl who is in many ways more adult and mature than Leon, as her childhood has been taken away. The way children are being taken for granted and not listened to is portrait excellently in this movie. As well as the way a adults and children can cooperate and learn traits from each other such as Leon and Mathilda in this movie.This movie features some truly astonishing action scenes and it uses tension excellently. There isn't a lot of movies that feature such memorable scenes as in this movie, and it is truly a pleasure to watch from time to time. It also features a truly amazing performance by the young Natalie Portman, and this performance is one of the best child performances I have ever witnessed.The movie is shot in a unique almost film noir French style, which makes it the tad bit better and unique from other cult films. The music collaboration with sting is the icing on the cake.My rating: 89/100.",

And looking through my video collection at those we have turned to most often a disturbing pattern arising.  okay, so I'm an adult and the collection inevitably contains a larger ratio of 15/18 certificate films than for those households with children.  But why is Leon up there with the best of them? Well, despite the fact that I cannot believe how many times I have watched this movie, we still find it utterly enthralling.  Oldman might be turning in one of those famous PRIME HAM moments of acting but it's done with such relish (as is often the case with him) that you're seduced anyway.  If you analyse it too much, sure, the sub-plot \"romance\" of Matilda and Leon may stir concerns from some citizens; but hey, have you never been a child with a desire to 'love'?  the all-consuming power of a lonely child to need affection is beautifully portrayed here - whether in the character of Matilda or in the formerly functioning but exploited Leon. Its bloody and brutal and in my heart I can never quite believe the ending the characters reach (sometimes I dream for a different ending, hope above hope); but it's actually a much more charming film than its certification allows.",

In 1994 the world was blessed with great movies such as Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and The Lion King. After seeing Leon, I have no doubt that it belongs among these memorable pictures, because of the story telling and acting. The character of Leon, our hero, is well played by Jean Reno almost superhuman. Focused on the getting the job done with a control of feelings. But only on the job...You might have seen him in other Besson movies where he plays other \"professionals\", but only in Leon, Reno shows us that even cool hearted professionals has a soft spot, and he does it well.Natalie is amazing in this movie as the \"Lady in distress\" Matilda. You actually wonder where that acting talent went, when she was in Star Wars(but enough of that). You can't help to fall a little bit in love with Matilda and the way she tries to soften up this rough character that Leon is. Have heard the discussion that Gary over plays his character. I couldn't disagree more. He is diabolical to perfection and it makes him easy to hate. Furthermore his almost sick fascination of Mozart, makes me think of \"A Clockwork Orange\" like he says to Matildas father \"I used to like him(Beethoven) too\". Feeling like you want a bit of the old ultra-violence perhaps?I can only recommend this movie to every one who loves, gangster movies, quirky love stories and the movies of Luc Besson. You are in for threat with Jean and Natalies amazing synergy and the wonderful acting of Gary Oldman. A lot action movies you sort of forget over time because they don't have anything to give, but Leon you will remember for the rest of your life.",

Example: Mathilda (Portman), after getting smacked around by her father asks Leon (Reno), \"Is life always this hard, or just when you're a kid?\" Leon replies, \"Always this hard.\" Gary Oldman's outstanding performance is reason enough to see this movie.

There, she tries to persuade Leon to teach her the tools of the trade so she can get her revenge.What made this film for me was the main characters. The tension between them is gradually built up, without ever going over the top. Reno and Portman are perfectly cast and their acting is flawless. Stansfield, played by Gary Oldman is a rather demented police chief and although good, is a little too far fetched for my liking.I was lucky enough to watch the international version. It appears that they cut nearly half an hour of character development out of the American version (presumably because the Americans couldn't cope with it, bless 'em) and this leaves the whole film rather confusing and pointless.

It is without doubt one of my top 5 movies of all time. High praise indeed! Setting aside all the 'arty-fartyness' of the quality of the cinematography, the lighting, acting and directing etc, the fact is it's just a brilliant story. Luc Besson and his cast couldn't possibly have put it across any better hence the 10/10 from me. Yes it is quite a violent movie in parts, and 'shoot em up movies' with lots of blood and gore aren't my preferred genre on the whole. But the balance struck in this movie is perfect. Let's face it, you couldn't make a movie about a wet boy without showing some violence. But so many directors could have gone overboard with that side of things. Instead of which Monsieur Besson and his merry band of players stops well short of unnecessary violence. It's a love story without sex, a comedy without banana skins, a drama without over-dramatisation, and above all else it's a heart warming story of a shy and in many ways insecure man taking care of a young girl living in an abusive family environment. Thankfully not once does the viewer read anything into the relationship between the man and the young girl other than what is there, i.e. mutual respect and friendship. The outro music (\"Shape Of My Heart\" by Sting) was not written for the movie specifically, but never fails to brings a lump to my throat each time I see Leon. Enrich your life, watch Leon!",

            "content": "Leon is a 1994 thriller directed by French director Luc Besson. Also known as 'The Professional', the film narrates a story about how a hit-man Leon (Reno) gives shelter to a girl Mathilda (Portman) who lives in his neighbourhood after her family is killed by a corrupt DEA officer (Oldman) and his men on the suspicion of stealing his drugs.Mathilda discovers that Leon is a hit-man and works for an Italian mafioso Tony (Aiello). Mathilda begs Leon to teach her his art so that she can take a revenge on the officer who killed her younger brother. In return, she offers to do the household chores apart from teaching him how to read and write. He starts taking her on his assignments where she works as his cleaner and teachers her how to handle guns. One day, when Leon is out on an assignment on his own, Mathilda loads her bag with Leon's guns and bluffs her way into the DEA office after locating it earlier. There she encounters Stansfield who finds about her plans. What happens next?Leon packs some of the most powerful performances in recent times. The role of Mathilda played by a 13 year old Natalie Portman, though much more bolder than to my liking, was superbly portrayed. You'll literally forget that the character is being performed by a 13 year old girl in the movie. It is a very mature character. The character not only loses her family & sees the dead body of her beloved brother, but also carries revenge at such a young age. Mathilda also smokes and is very daring as is shown in the scene where she plans to take on a psychopath drug addict murderer who also happens to be a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) officer. The role of Stansfield is the best part of the movie for me. A lot has been written about the character on the internet. People have loved it but also have commented on how the character has been 'overly' stated. I really enjoyed the performance of Gary Oldman. The on-screen presence of the character always gave a very sinister feeling. The way he took his drug, his dialogues (\"Death is whimsical today\", \"I like these calm little moments before a storm. It reminds me of Beethoven!\"), his unusual calmness and then a sudden burst of rage made his character look very creepy & unpredictable. Stansfield goes down in my book of the best villains of all time! Reno as a hit-man was good. His fight scenes were probably one of the best of his times especially at the end. His character was strong & professional yet emotionally vulnerable. The background score composed by Eric Serra was both haunting and thrilling in equal measures. It brought in a chilly atmosphere in the movie and kept your heart pumping in the close quarter scenes.I happened to watch a Hindi movie called \"Bichchoo\" in 2000 starring Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. After watching Leon I found that Bichchoo was a Hindi remake of the movie. Many scenes especially the ending were almost the same.Overall, Leon is one of the best thriller movies of all time. Although I watched it in 2012, it was released 18 years back in 1994. Many of the scenes especially the ending must have been really thrilling for the audience back then. Elements of the movie have been used by many action movies in the late 90s as well as in the 21st century. A must watch for any cinema enthusiast who haven't checked it out yet!",

However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hit-man who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for.

When the credits roll you better believe that your mind will be racing with thoughts.  That is just the kind of movie it is, it makes you think.  **Spoiler Alert**I have read a lot of the comments on here about people being uncomfortable or squeamish that any attraction between Mathilda and Leon was more than innocent.  Honestly I don't think it implied anything.  Sure Mathilda had a crush on him but that's what 12 year old girls do, they crush on older guys! And plus the guy saved her life, she was bound to develop a hero-complex towards him.  I am not sure if Leon did feel something more for Mathilda but if he did it's not like he acted on it!  He was no Humbert Humbert, if any sort of romantic feelings were had on his part he knew they were wrong and did not act on them and if you watch you see how uncomfortable he is moments after Mathilda tells him she thinks she is falling in love with him.  I see nothing wrong with how the relationship was played out and what may or may have not been had the ending been different and more happily ever after. I do know about all the parts that were cut from the film and saw the lines from them so I do know how the relationship was played through both versions.**End Spoiler Alert**This is a very touching tale of a hitman and the tragic girl who comes into and changes his life.

But outside of that it feels as though the back drop of murder and violence serves as simple action fodder. Nor does it excel in this regard, and since it's less commentary on violence and more violence as a tool for engaging the audience it lacks the depth or excitement you crave from the genre. It is also a film that did not completely know how to end. While I sympathize with writers everywhere on the difficulty of endings, it does not excuse what seems to be a complete lack of effort to tie the story up (or not tie it up, either way it should embrace a certain tone rather then... we'll nothing at all). This is by no means a bad movie, but I find myself enjoying the idea of the film over the film itself.",

Yes she was very young, and while I can see how that can be a little unsettling I think it was perfectly innocent.**WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS**I mean, 12 yr old girls very often develop crushes, and as far as Leon \"not doing anything to divert her interest\" I mean the character  Leon is a very shy person, you can see he is unsettled by Mathilda's declarations of love for him, he had no real experience of either women or children and for gods sake her whole family had recently been butchered, what do you expect the guy to do? I thought it was beautifully and tastefully handled, yes it still leaves for risque viewing, but anyone who reads it as anything more than the childhood innocence within both of them coming out and showing a side to them that either rarely displayed to anyone, then im sorry, but I think the problem lies with you, and your perceptions, rather than the storyline or the film-maker Now I've had my little complaint..... Leon is a wonderful film, yes, i agree with everyone else, you MUST see the integral version to fully appreciate it, it develops the story more, it gives more insight, and it might make the very late scenes where Leon talks Mathilda as if she was a lover rather than a young girl (\"you have given me a thirst for life..\") easier to stomach when you see how they have bonded and developed together.**END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Both stars do a fabulous job, and Gary Oldman hams it up superbly... yes, very over the top, but isnt that the point? he is portraying a madman after all, they arent all silent calculating crazies like hannibal lecter. The action scenes aren't John Woo, they are still however excellent, a little far fetched.... maybe, but not as unbelievable as some would have you believe, in the circumstances, it was fairly believable the way Leon dealt with the SWAT team, and far more realistic than Rambo blasting his way out and killing them all would be.  You have to remember also that he wasn't a highly paid contract killer for no reason, he must have been good at his job. All in all a beautiful film, I urge you to see it and make your own judgements, but don't be put off by some peoples interpretation of the story, it isnt sleazy or dirty in anyway, its very innocent, and very well handled, and its refreshing to see an action movie with a brain for once, that addresses adult issues in a serious and gentle way. There may never be an action film quite as good as this one... (unless you could call the boondock saints an action movie, i prefer to class it as a comedy/thriller) 10/10",

            "content": "Ok, it seems like I'm going against the grain here, but after watching Leon: The Professional (Widescreen DVD: International ver) I was very discontented.  For starters, I was introduced to the movie with the understanding that it was an action flick, it wasn't.  I was told that I would really care about the characters, I didn't.  Here's the deal:Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors.  I like him to play villains and in this movie he does a very well job.  He's evil, clever and extremely threatening.  Unfortunately, his character is given little screen time.Natalie Portman shows that she is a great actress.  After seeing what I believe is her first film I can understand why she could have a successful film career in front of her.Jean Reno.  Um....He seems to do as much as he can with the role.  I like him in other films but there's not a lot you can do with a character who seems extremely smart at times but mentally retarded at others.The movie starts out great but comes to a screeching halt about 1/4 of the way through then climbs back up to about 3/4 speed towards the end. Matilda's relationship with Leon is strained and borders pedophilia. Matilda continually advances on Leon sexually.  Could this film not have accomplished the feeling of comradely without the thought of a sexually active 12 year old attempting to seduce a 35ish year old man?Other than that major plot dampener, we are continually bombarded with silly things that do little if nothing to the story. (Such as Matilda dressing up like Madonna, Marilyn & Charlie Chaplin.) Her continual use of the F-bomb is annoying and after the first 10 times she says it you start to ask yourself if you like this little girl of if she's just annoying.  Luc Besson does add some clever camera movements into the film as well as some interesting and funny characteristics into Leon.All in all I found myself glancing away from the screen and checking just how long the movie had been running on the LCD read out.  The painfully predictable ending was just that, painful.  If you have nothing to do on a Monday night when it's raining outside and there's nothing on, then watch Leon: The Professional.  But keep the remote handy with your finger on Fast Forward.  You'll probably need it.",

IMDb's 8.5 / 10 is a bit high for what, in my honest opinion, this movie truly deserves. Personally, I would give it a wholesome 7.5 / 10.

The first version didn't sear as much as I thought it could have. It was missing something. It was as if the movie was beating around the bush instead of diving in. After seeing the Uncut International Version, I can see how deep the film goes. Before, I wasn't sure whether the relationship between Leon and Mathilda was close friendship or love. Now I know it was love. After seeing this version, I understand the emotion and power of The Professional more. Gary Oldman did not have any additional scenes, which kind of left me disappointed as he was a fun loving psychopath that unfortunately shares the same mentality as Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Both enjoy to harm other people for fun, invade peoples' homes with their mindless thugs and the music of Beethoven. How convenient.I loved The Professional before, and I still love it. I just love it more now. I had the movie on VHS before I bought it on DVD. About a dollar per additional minute. I'd pay it again. Never has a dollar gone so far.

            "content": "\"Leon the professional\" is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing. The plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film)",

Woo and Besson both have great cinematography in their films, a compelling plot lines, and of course intense action scenes.  Reno and Chow have that onscreen presence and charisma.The movie is about a Italian hitman Leon (Jean Reno) takes a 12 year old girl Mathilda (my favorite actress Natalie Portman) under his wing after her family is killed by a corrupt DEA cops lead by Stansfield (Gary Oldman).What was so compelling is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Besson shows Leon's search for light in his life while Mathilda is like Leon's anchor.  Also Leon helping Mathilda cope with her loss and eventually he teaches Mathilda how to be a himan (\"cleaner\").Besides the outstanding leads making the movie so rememorable is Gary Oldman's Stansfield. If you thought Oldman was psycho in Besson's \"Fifth Element\" you gonna look him in this movie.  He's just being the favorite onscreen psychopath like Christopher Walken.Okay I think I said enough.  It's a great film.  If you want something that is close to this movie I recommend another favorite of mine, John Woo's \"The Killer\" with just about the same similarities like this film.",

Reno's portrayal of Leon is superb, and is neatly balanced by Gary Oldman's (a bad guy in good guy's shoes).  What really makes the movie special is the relationship between Leon and Matilda (Natalie Portman). Slightly reminiscent, and certainly more effective, than that between De Niro and Foster in Taxi Driver, we see a somewhat disfunctional family unit form.  It is not often that a film can be said to be exciting and deeply touching.The film shows that when European and American cinema collide something extra special is created.",

What I actually left the theater seeing was a masterpiece that has yet to be rivaled among films of its genre.  This film pulls on the emotions like no other action film I have seen.  It is intelligent and the characters are real, so real that you can feel their every emotion. Natalie Portman is stellar in her acting debut as the young Matilda and Jean Reno is unbelievably complex and pathetic as Leon, the cleaner.  And of course, I can't leave out the out of your mind performance by Count Dracula himself, Gary Oldman. The relationships that develop between these characters will totally consume you and make you not even miss the corny action sequences and stupid stunts of many other films like this. Don't get me wrong though, there is some violence but is seems like it's just part of the plot, not the whole plot.If you want to see a mindless action film go rent something like Speed (which some critic had the audacity to compare this great film to) which will entertain but will not grip your senses.

Their relationship makes this movie for me.Furthermore, if I would distance myself from the romantic aspect, I liked their teamwork as hitmen. I like how Mathilda was not freaked out by the fact that she is hanging with a professional murderer. The scene where Mathilda shoots a man with red paint is priceless, because the way both of them were disconnected from the fact that they are committing murder and just ignore the panicking victim is nicely written.However, I think the writing in general was not very good. Some dialogs felt stupid as well as Stansfield's character - I found him to be a cliche lunatic. Also, what the hell was that dread guy doing with the police officer? That was such an unnecessary character that did not serve nor as a comedic relief, nor as anything else. The Leon's backstory is weak as well. I could go on, but I feel like a lot of characters lacked logic behind them.So in general it was a fun movie to watch: it looks nice, explores interesting theme, the action is satisfying. However, the weak writing of dialogs and characters have really brought it down for me and I find it weird that this is such a highly rated movie, as it was mostly OKAY.",

Now, it is one of my favourite movies because of it's many virtues.The actors were all very good at their job. Especially Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and of course, Gary Oldman. I agree with one of the prior comments made on this movie saying that it exploited Natalie Portman through the trashy clothes that she wore and her slutty behaviour. To an extent that is true, but this film would not have had the same effects had Mathilda been a clean living, Christian, God-fearing girl. The psychotic Gary Oldman is extremely good but may have taken his character a little too far, although it's interesting to think that he could hold a government job in his condition.The transformation on Leon from almost killing Mathilda to dying for her is one of the things I love about this film. The fact that a cold, relentless, untouchable hitman could care so much about a little girl is heart-warming despite the ease both of them show on ending other people's and their own lives.This film is not about pedophilia or a spin off on Lolita, it is about sometime so much more delicate and will be forever remembered by me and a lot of people as one of the 90's cinematic greats.A largely underrated film which didn't pull in the numbers at the box office but the ones fortunate enough to see it will always remember it, no matter what stance is taken on the brilliance of this film.",

But after watching the opening scene of \"The Professional\", I gained a new respect for Besson. The movie's central character is Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a hit-man who runs his professional and personal life with little - if any - emotion. He lives a paranoid existence - he shuffles desperately through crowds in an attempt to remain unnoticed and has his gun nearby when he sleeps, which he does while sitting down.Leon's world changes when he decides to help Mathilda, the 12-year-old girl (Natalie Portman, in her film debut) who lives in the apartment next to him. While out picking up groceries, Mathilda's family is murdered by corrupt DEA agents paying retribution to her drug-dealing father. When she returns, a lookout man is watching the door to her family's apartment but she still manages to see the dead bodies inside.  Pretending to be the neighbour, she walks by the carnage and proceeds to knock on Leon's door and, in one of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie, he decides to let her in.   \nInitially, Leon provides little support to the orphan Mathilda but she informs him that since he saved her, she is now his responsibility.  When she discovers that he is a \"cleaner\", she takes this as a sign that she must become his student and will use her newly taught skills to kill Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), the man behind her family's murder. It turns out to be a mutual apprenticeship - he teaches her how to kill and how to be a lady and she teaches him how to read and how to have fun - and they develop a father-daughter-like bond. \"The Professional\" combines a fantastic story-line with incredible action scenes, no mean feat for this particular genre.  Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are so natural together they make the premise of a hit-man training a twelve year-old believable.  My one problem with the movie is Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery so much with his villain role that he almost turns it into a cartoon character.  However, the film is strong enough to overcome Oldman's antics. It's apparent that Besson somewhere other than Hollywood because he doesn't sell out with a perfect ending.  It's gutsy, yet touching. Rent it and you'll see.",

            "content": "I've been on a bit of a depressing binge recently, picking many movies I like and reading the most negative reviews I could find on them. I have to admit, I couldn't really accept why I liked this film so much, seeing as I enjoy great acting more than anything and the most lines in the film (give or take) were given to a twelve-year-old, who, like so many others her age, has trouble acting her age.However, I finally saw what I enjoyed so much about this film and had to give myself a pat on the back. Portman's acting was due to her lines, not her demeanor. She had to act as an adult in this film, albeit it took the realistic credibility away from the character and somewhat from the film. Looking past that, I realized that the relationship between Leon and Mathilda, which so many of the negative reviews I read trashed, was based on the very real emotions of a man dedicating his life to death and loneliness and a girl with nothing and no one left to confide in except her savior--Leon himself.I don't particularly believe in much of Freud's work, but the \"every son is in love with his mother\" argument seems to come into play here, especially considering this \"mother\" is so easy to idolize--cool identity, cool job, great ability (the U.S. version wasn't called \"The Professional\" for nothing)--not to mention her adult-like attitude towards life clashes so easily with her childish one-track mind...kill the killers, then become an assassin. What is unrealistic about that to a child; moreover, a child taken in by a hit-man? Unfortunately, the argument that this love between Leon and Mathilda is the downfall of the movie must end, seeing as Leon is killed and Mathilda returned to her normal life before anything can become of it.I salute all of you who commented negatively on this...you gave me the ability to see what I love about this film and the content for a much more open-minded review.",

It has so many highlights - the sensitive, imaginative direction, three powerful and moving performances from it's main cast, and a story rich in character, emotion and twists.It took me a moment to get over Mathilda's immediate presence of mind when she returned home - an emotional control and quick thinking well beyond her years. But from then on it didn't look back.I'd seen 'Fifth Element' prior to this, and was blown away by the rich imagery, innovative storylines, and imaginative direction. I thought it a grossly underrated film. But here, Besson really shows his skill. I was hooked from start to finish.Jean Reno, is - as always - a commanding screen presence. His Leon is complex: at times bumbling, intelligent, naive and worldly, yet all the time played with such subtlety. He is so totally believable at all times. A sympathetic character despite his profession, we feel so totally for him that the final moments of the film are strong and lasting.Natalie Portman is a gem. What a find. A maturity of performance well beyond her years, able to evoke whatever emotion is required with conviction and utter believability. So totally sensual at such a young age, one can hardly imagine what we can look forward to in the years to come. This is a tour-de-force performance from a talented actress. I'll be watching out for her ...Gary Oldman once again delivers a stunning performance. No one goes mad like Gary Oldman. The insanity is hypnotic, and yet another faultless performance from this incredibly underrated and under-used actor. hen Jack Nicholson goes mad you can hear it clear across the country. When Gary Oldman goes mad it's a fire that burns from within and consumes you quietly and willingly.I wish there were more films like this.",

But it's not.  The relationship between Leon and Matilda is not done in a corny way, but instead treated with maturity.  Natalie Portman, who was only thirteen, I believe, when this film was made, is absolutely astonishing in this role. The one scene where Matilda is stretched out on the red bedspread, telling Leon she loves him, reminded me a lot of American Beauty, and the similar lust that Kevin Spacey's character had for Mena Suvari.All in all, a very well-done film.",

With a fantastic storyline and a stellar cast, this movie is unmissable!The plot centres around a young girl called Matilda (Natalie Portman) who comes home to find her family have all been murdered by corrupt government agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and is forced to seek help from Leon (Jean Reno)who happens to be a professional hitman.  A strong bond develops between Matilda and Leon, and continues to build right up to the film's stunning climax.Jean Reno gives the best performance of his career as Leon, showing how, while on the job, he is an emotionless killer, but has a gentle side.  This is characterised by how he watches \"Singin' In The Rain\" with childlike wonder, how he constantly spits his milk all over the place like a buffoon and, most of all, his love for Matilda.Forget Star Wars, Portman's career-best role is right here as Matilda. While at times you can really empathise with her, there's also times when you want to strangle her.  The story is mainly seen through her eyes, so we learn a lot about her complex character.Gary Oldman is my favourite actor, and I have to say that this is, you guessed it, his best performance.  In my opinion, Norman Stansfield is right up there with the likes of Hans Gruber from \"Die Hard\" as one of cinema's greatest bad guys.  From impulsive pill-popping to emptying barrel-loads of bullets into a guy when three will do (\"But he ruined my suit!\") Oldman manages to steal the show.***SPOILERS*** So what if the movie isn't exactly totally realistic?  Who cares if one man couldn't REALLY take out an entire police force?  Haven't any of you critics heard of suspension of disbelief?  Oh, and by the way, no, Matilda having a crush on Leon is not \"sick\" so, in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, SHADDAP! ***END SPOILERS***It may not be the best movie I've ever seen, but its certainly the most enjoyable - 10/10, and that doesn't do it justice!",

I guess I can understand why the movie was edited the way it was for the US based on the ridiculous comments I've read stating the uncut version portrays them as lovers. I don't know, maybe there's another cut out there that includes a scene where Leon doesn't push her away and instead, makes hot, passionate, \"Woody Allen style\" love to her but I doubt it. Truthfully, only 2 scenes not in the US version were really worth seeing, the very first one, about an hour and 10 minutes in and the last \"extra\" scene, which takes place right after Leon saves her from the D.E.A. building. The US version is not as bad as people make it out to be, it's far from \"just an action movie\" the first time I saw it, I was drawn in by the characters and I actually cared what happened to them, which rarely happens to me.

Jean Reno is solid as always, and Gary Oldman is downright terrifying as the antagonist.Most things in this movie just work, and it hits you on an emotional level.Now be aware though, there is a weird pseudo-love relationship between the 2 protagonists, where the underaged Natalie Portman latches onto a much older man in an emotional manner which is unsuitable considering the large difference in age between the two. To be clear the movie does not condone pedophilia in any way, but it does contain elements which, by simply existing, will alienate parts of a modern audience in 2022.

            "content": "From the opening musical score, which is phenomenal throughout the entire Film, Luc Besson gives us one of the most stylish Character introductions seen to date.  The Cinematography is outstanding as the camera focuses on Leon (Jean Reno) and his Italian Mob friend (Danny Aiello), with subtle shots, that pan onto his dark sunglasses or the glass of milk he's drinking (which actually becomes a running theme).Almost as soon as we are introduced to the seemingly cold, calculating Leon, the heat is on and we discover that he is an unstoppable, untouchable and lethal as a professional hitman.  The way in which he displays his expertise, is visually spectacular as he kills people one by one, appealing to all fans of Action, Gore and Suspense.  It is also gripping to see Leon hunt down the last remaining 'client', making the vulnerable man sweat with fear and me be riveted to my seat in anticipation.\nAs the gloriously original plot continues, Leon rescues a 12 year old girl called Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from iminant death, which begins an awe inspiring relationship between the two.  It's very rare to see such impressive characterisation in a Film and Besson manages to reveal the warmer, caring side to Leon, without clouding the presence of a ruthless and fearless killer.  Without sounding too 'soppy' it has to be said that their relationship and love for each other is beautiful and is always accompanied by the captivating score.Apart from the skilled and apparant capability of Reno....Portman's portrayal of Mathilda really is atonishingly authentic.  Albeit the stars of this Film are obvious but without Gary Oldman's performance, the film would have lacked the depth and tension that is so essential to the plotline. Oldman plays a crooked, psychopathic Drug Enforcement Agent, who is significantly agitated by Leon's diligent trail of death and destruction. The scenes in which his anxiety is at it's most extreme, commands your attention and is a pleasure to watch.It is a meritorious accomplishment for a Film of this genre to have such a rich plot and character development.  The transition of Leon, devoid of any feelings, to him embracing Mathilda's affections is a paramount example. There is a strong universal appeal to all movie-lovers for this extraordinary Film and it is totally justified.I personally found it a delight to watch and am sure that Leon is one of the only Films I can watch repeatedly, without the danger of becoming dissatisfied.If the rumours about a sequel to Leon are true, then expect another superb, stylish, Action-Thriller...that will be damn near close to being perfect.",

Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hit men.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually triggered by his 'benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids.

Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.",

While it's not a bad movie, it's not as great as people make it out to be. The movie features Jean Reno playing the role of a highly skilled and efficient assassin. But the plot takes a strange turn when he forms a bond with a young girl and becomes her foster father. It's hard to believe that a ruthless killer would suddenly take on a nurturing role, and even more difficult to believe that he would train her to become a killer as well.In addition to the issues with the plot, I also found some of the character portrayals in the movie to be problematic. Natalie Portman's character, in particular, was a bit too much for me. The way she was dressed and act throughout the film made her look like something else, which was unnecessary and inappropriate for a child actor. Moreover, the relationship between her character and Leon was uncomfortable for me to watch. At times, it seemed like the filmmakers were trying to portray a romantic connection between them, which was inappropriate considering the age difference and power dynamic between the characters.",

Her life begins to take a chaotic turns as she accepts the protection of Leon, an emotionless killer who performs his tasks like a robot but is determined to protect the child from harm.

            "content": "Luc Besson was the perfect architect for a film of this nature. Be sure that if this film was made by another director then the emotional barrier would not have been in sight. Instead of this film being a shoot- em- up we actually find a story of love and pain. Besson has a certain way of directing if you have seen his previous 'Nikita' and picturesque 'The Big Blue', he has the ability to bring more depth into an average film. Leon is played by the entertaining Jean Reno (Godzilla, Ronin) and he perfects the role of a lone Italian hit-man lost on the streets of New York. Gary Oldman is quite superb as the psychotic cop and is pivotal in raising the tempo of the film. Oldman is truly brilliant and would steal the honours if it wasn't for a young Natalie Portman. Just as Jodie Foster made her breakthrough in Taxi Driver Portman conducts herself wonderfully as a youthful daughter of a drug seller seemingly unloved by her family. The only love was for her unfortunate younger brother whom is unintentionally shot dead by Oldman's henchmen. This I must say was prominent in showing the way love is torn away and then found again; Mathilda (Portman) finds a father figure in Leon whom at first is reluctant to accept her-a hindras to his identity. From her though they both gradually form a strong bond that is not stepping over the line, it is simply a love almost unconditional as referring to Leon taking the place of her father. The film itself is shot to perfection, violence is kept relatively low though still keeping the tempo and pace flowing. This action film soon succumbs the viewer into actually admiring and appreciating leons work; \"no women no children\" is a philosophy that Leons boss must keep to. And not only this Leon is always assigned to deal with criminals, which in return isn't too bad. The reason this film is so good is for the fact that you really feel sorry for Leon and the finale just enhances that sorrow.In all this film is a must see not only for it's slick storyline and entertaining acting.

She has done a brilliant job as a 12 year old kid and Stansfield (Gary Oldman) is a drug-addict corrupt DEA cop who as killed Mathilda's family.From there starts the chase. Mathilda is rescued by Leon who starts developing a liking for her and teaches her his trade......... the \"cleaning business\" and also protects her. It is the first time that someone started being nice to Mathilda and at such an adolescent stage she started developing love for Leon. At this point she is been depicted somewhat like Lolita and she played her part well.While on the other hand when Stansfield get to know that there is someone out there trying to kill him he trace down Leon and plans on destroying him with the girl. The climax of the movie is really amazing and makes you hold your breath. The director has done a perfect job and the movie had a good hold on the viewers from the very beginning.

There are basically two things that it is trying to give us: (1) great one-elite-versus-many-soldiers-shoot-em-up sequences; and, what would make this movie special, if it worked, (2) a view into a very unusual and interesting relationship, with tinges of father/daughter, of master/apprentice, criminal/partner, and of lover/lover.It delivers decent shoot-em-up, but fairly little that stands out much from the vast quantities of decent material of that kind in 90s (and 00s) Hollywood film. If you *love* that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.On the other hand, the relationship idea suffers from weak execution. Some of the specific plot and script ideas are to blame, but N. Portman is basically unbelievable, for the most part, and in a boring way. J. Reno is excellent, and there is some \"chemistry\" there, but there were just too many times when the cinematic illusion was broken and I just wanted to roll my eyes---the fascinating premise disappeared and I found myself thinking things like \"man, what a dumb line\". (Nothing as bad as the intimate scenes of Portman/Christensen in the Star Wars movies, which feel like a caricatured rendering of the interior imaginations of an inexperienced fifteen-year-old reading a mediocre discount store romance novel. But that's not saying much.)So, I suggest that \"Leon\" does not deserve to be in the company of nearby-ranked action-oriented films (\"Das Boot\", \"Se7en\", \"Alien\", \"Fight Club\") or noir (\"Maltese Falcon\", \"Chinatown\", \"LA Confidential\").I should add that I believe I saw the \"U.

I hadn't (and still haven't) been this impressed by a child's performance since, well, ever. I'm very glad to see that she has further delivered on her acting promise in movies such as Beautiful Girls and found a deserved measure of commercial success in Phantom Menace (Portman was one of the few redeeming features of that particular movie, but that's another review).The only slight flaw I perceived at the time was Gary Oldman's performance which, while effective, was - I thought - somewhat over-acted.

This movie is one of my favorites, and the acting is one such a high level that it\u00b4s almost scary. Gary Oldman, and Jean Reno delivers their best performances to this day. And the hugely talented Natalie Portman acts with the vulnerability and sensitivity of an actress filled with routine, although she was but 13 years old at the time she acted in this masterpiece. This movie is well written, it has a beautifully painful cinematography, it\u00b4s amazingly good directed, it\u00b4s extremely well acted, and the music is so beautiful.

For each time I watch this movie, I seem to aquire a deeper attatchment to the story, and become more involed in the personal stuggle's of the two main characters; Jean Reno as the \"professional hitman\", and Natalie Portman as \"the little girl\".As one reviewer so accuratly put it, \"A man with nothing to lose, and a girl who has lost everything.\"  From there, comes a true masterpiece of a film. Natalie Portman gave a brilliant performance as the little girl, and IMO, was cheated out of an Oscar nomination.  For she really \"shined\" in such a demanding role, and at even such a young age.From the surface, the movie might seem like it would be a typical \"hitman, violent movie\".  But it is FAR from it.  From the beginning, to it's thought-provoking end, it will leave you wanting more.  And after you see it, you will understand why it made the \"Top 250 movie list\" of all time,(currently #64), being voted-in by the ones who REALLY count, \"ordinary people\".This movie has been be added to my small, and very selective, DVD collection...as I believe it is a worthy addition to any DVD collection.",

Leon looks a bit lost, innocent almost, unable in some way to live a normal life, and not trying to because it would only interfere with his work. Matilda practically forces him to feel love and responsibility, which makes him sacrifice himself. The styling is magnificent: the movie combines baroque (Oldman) with touching minimalism (Reno).

Jean Ruso's character and performance were the best I have seen in a VERY long time.  Gary Oldman is possibly the most terrifying character I have ever seen.  It scared me just looking at him...The storyline is amazing... With more thrills and actions sequences than Speed and True Lies combined.  It's an amazing film with an absolutely amazing cast.  If definitely worth seeing at least twice.",

            "content": "I first saw Leon a long time ago and decided to check it out again recently, which I saw the Director's Cut which is about the only director's cut of any movie which is better than the original. Leon takes place in a backward, corrupt version of New York city sometime in the modern day which is in fact the early to mid 1990s. The decade itself, coloured by Nirvana's angry Smells Like Teen Spirit and cries of protest against what had just been destroyed by the greed and gluttony of the previous era, Leon is a movie which deserves the trophy for most accurate in terms of how we approach modern urban living.Street children are often glamorised and sold back to themselves through corporate advertising campaigns, exploiting their youthful rage and earning millions from all of their troubled experiences. Rap music was coming up through the 1990s, and became popular, with a focus on the violent feud between Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious BIG.Kids were turning against the kinds of \"safe\" trends and towards something more dangerous towards the end of the decade, with hip hop music and grunge being the most powerful world changing genres of that decade in music. Leon is a very musical film, and as a musician, I deeply admire how it erupts and glides and moves like a piece of excellent sound.Despite the film's misunderstood perceived controversy, that of a young girl being adopted by a man whom she develops a crush on, this film is in fact a struggle between innocence and corruption.I'm not going to review this film in the way that other people will already have reviewed it, instead I am going to do what Roger Ebert did, which is to talk about how the movie made me feel, what the main themes are and my perspective on this movie culturally.The setting up of the music in the previous paragraphs gives you a suggestion that a film about a hit-man teaching a little girl how to shoot guns and take down human beings in a series of illegal murders paid for by the mob, is the kind of background upon which a rap artist might make his debut album.Grunge music may have been angry and aggressive, but it was also happy and joyous, it raged on and children raged with it, celebrated it, but were also plagued by the troubled side of the new artists. Kurt Cobain murdered himself, with a gun no less. He was arguably the most important force in rock music during the 1990s, perhaps since then.Matilda as a character is just normal, except we don't see characters like this (or didn't back then) depicted on the screen so honestly.If nothing else, this film is truthful. But rap music and grunge music, is both teenage fair, songs about killing people, about doing away with life or material possessions, about rape, murder, suicide, depression, were happening at the time of the film's release.The film came out in 1994, the year Cobain decided to shoot himself. Teenagers, particularly troubled teenagers, now had no one to follow. Matilda is one such troubled teen. She is caught between her inner knowledge of what she has felt and feels, her awakening into womanhood, and her childhood being ruined by oncoming adolescence, a bad family life and smoking.She is a typical child. So is Leon. Leon is innocent and only his job makes him have to be a bad person. He is essentially, like the other 3 main characters in the film, a contradiction; We have the obvious Gary Oldman as police officer being corrupt as a symbol of a man pretending to be a defender of justice, while being a criminal. He is bad but his job makes him seem legitimate.Leon is a good man doing very dirty work. His \"guilt\" is in what he does for money. He is kind and good natured in every other way. Again, this is millions of people in the corporate world who kill and have people killed, yet are wonderful family people, lovers, friends.Matilda's corruption is in what she has seen and heard, that she smokes, that she misses school on purpose, and that she wants to be a \"cleaner\" as well. She wants to run from what she is: a child.Leon meanwhile seems like he is trying to become innocent again. The two are in a dance between their bad selves and their good selves, we are never shown a black or white picture, just grey.The final character is Tony, a nice, kind, mobster. Again, we have a classic case of character vs role in society. Whereas Oldman's despicable police officer is cruel and evil towards other human beings, we see a hit-man and a mobster as being \"good\".Matilda is our own shaken sense of what we are today and what we have become emotionally. Torn between our innocent past and present day adulthood, we wish all children to be impossibly innocent yet they wish to grow up, and we wish to return to an innocence ourselves which, as the film has shown, was only ever one shade of a guilty grey.",

Never did I expect to see such a heavy-mooded emotional display of the relation growing between the old Leon, performed in all his simplicity and greatness by Jean Reno, and the 12-year-old Mathilde, performed by the superb Natalie Portman who really proves that children can act, she even outweighs Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. The plot is pretty well known I think so I won't elaborate too much but it's a plot that might not surprise you, but is sure is not the 200 million blockbuster happy ending plot you might expect. It's well laid down in the movie. (Spoiler) The dying scene of Leon is the fist actual scene in a movie where I almost couldn't hold back my tears. The relationship between Leon and Mathilde was done so well, you could almost feel his pain and her sorrow, and you felt miserably, also the way it was shot was absolutely brilliant. This scene is an instant classic. (spoiler end)all and all definitely one of the best movies ever and indeed a true addition to the top 250",

This is a compelling story of a 12-year-old girl, Mathilda and how she befriends and hires a Hit man, Leon for revenge after her family are murdered.This film from the trailers and how it is described to you might make you think this is an all out action film, you would be wrong in assuming this as most of the plot is the friendship between the girl and the Hit Man.(Spoiler Alert) The bond between Mathilda and Leon is sexual to Mathilda, however Leon sees it as a friendship between the two of them, as the story progress the Bond transforms into a Father - Daughter relationship where he has to protect and provide for her. (End spoiler).The action scene in the film are good and will satisfy the audience that have come for action, Although expect a lot of emotional scenes in between these as this is what the main narrative is focussing on. This is the best Luc Beeson film to date as he gets the characters just right. There are three excellent performances from Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, who steals the show and proves that there is some good child actors.This film has something for almost ever audience, although some parts are very taboo such as a 12-year-old girl asking for sex and training to be a Hit man. However this is not done in a distasteful manner that puts the audience off. This film truly deserves a 9/10",

He is followed by an Aiello whose presence on the screen is always pleasant, and a cast that exceeds.If we talk about \"Leon\", we could also talk about its flaws that, like any film, has them, but the truth is that I do not feel like doing it, as they are more than evident, and I prefer to stay with those beautiful walks from Leon, Mathilda and the plant in NY, or with those imitations in the hotel room that take us to the most magical side of the protagonists, or with that sad, desolate ending, that sticks in you like a dagger, and leaves you totally engrossed with the theme of Sting ringing in your ears, which gives the last frames a unique strength.\nAnd I am also aware that \"Leon\" is not a film of 10, and although I always try to be objective, I think in this case it is inevitable, I cannot say anything other than, EXCELLENT. For me, the greatest movie of all time.\"L\u00e9on, I think I'm kinda falling in love with you...\"",

From it's opening that takes grabs you and never lets go, to it's final scene...It's a challenge to look away from the screen even to blink.Perhaps the greatest thing about Leon is that you don't see the actors. You look on screen and you don't see Natalie Portman, Jean Reno or Gary Oldman. Instead you really feel as if you are a fly on the wall, watching Mathilda, Leon, and Stansfield as their lives unfold around you.Not only does Reno bring alive the role of Leon, he also manages to humanize him. He takes this hit-man character, and makes you realize that there is more to him. That behind the skill, there lie the heart of a simple man who hasn't lived any other way.Portman masterfully captures the essence of the tortured soul that is Mathilda, that you really have to admire Portman for her acting chops. This could not have been an easy role for any young starlet, and yet Portman captures it perfectly. The subtle nuances, the child like innocence, and even the dark side of Mathilda's soul are portrayed excellently.But perhaps the greatest pleasure, or at least the one I enjoyed the most, was the performance of Gary Oldman. The ticks, the glazed over appearance, the dazed and confused responses, as well as the \"over-the-top\" craziness of Stansfield is captured beautiful through Oldman's acting. Oldman makes Stansfield so interesting, that even when he's not on screen or the focal point of a scene, you can't help but wonder what he's doing.The entire movie runs together smoothly, showing that despite his hardened ways, Leon is still an innocent soul who is just doing what he does best. And we slowly see how the innocence of Mathilda slow reaches the heart of Leon, which hasn't been reached in a very long time.Overall, an excellent movie and a recommendation for both action and drama enthusiasts.",

If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to go rent it immediately.The cast is superb.  This was Natalie Portman's first movie, but you'll never guess it from her performance; she is stellar.  There's no description that will do her acting debut justice; you just have to see it.  Jean Reno oozes controlled danger (as he's done in so many films), but also a brilliant naivete that makes every scene enjoyable.  And Gary Oldman is one of the most disturbing bad guys you'll ever see; you start off wondering what's so scary about him, and then you see him in action and you're glad you're on the safe side of the screen.If you're wondering about the \"Leon\" vs. \"The Professional\" thing, here's the scoop as nearly as I understand it:  test screenings of the original film \"Leon\" were shown in the U.S., and our typically puritanical reviewers decided it contained \"inappropriate content\" that would put off American viewers.  So, Luc Besson and Co. had to cut out about 20 minutes of footage to satisfy our hypocritcal \"powers-that-be.\"  The edited film was retitled \"The Professional\" and released stateside, while the uncut film was left \"Leon\" and released in the rest of the world.As a result, all you will easily find for rental/sale in the U.S. is The Professional.  Now, that's the version I saw first, and believe me, the editing job was pure artistry.  You will never miss the 20 minutes of footage if you haven't seen the full version; it's that well cut.  Go see it now, if that's all that's available to you (and it probably is).  BUT, if you can find a way to see \"Leon\" instead (or even afterwards), definitely do it.  For those of you who might be worried what you'd be exposed to:  there is NO nudity in either version of the film.  There is no sexual conduct or even IMPLIED sexual conduct between Leon and Mathilda.  Two kinds of things were cut out of the movie:  1.  the idea that a 12-year old girl might THINK about sex, and 2.  the idea that a 12-year old girl could learn about being a hitman.  That's it.  If the character had been 15 they would never have made them cut the movie, but hey, that's American reviewers.See it right now.  That is all.",

It just never got boring. This is exactly how this movie plays. A must see. 10/10",

            "content": "So what to say about this movie, that I personally consider to be the best movie ever made...  ;)First, it is nice to see everytime, how great it comes out, when writer, director and cameraman are ONE person (even if Besson did not the camera in \"Leon\") - It shows up in so many sequences, that the writer had already in mind how a scene should be filmed as he directs the actors..Jean Reno is really brilliant, acting between a professional killer and an innocent child.But the absolute highlight of \"Leon\" is the first appearance of Natalie Portman. Playing 12 year old Mathilda, she gives such a wonderful performance, that I\u00b4ve seen the film now for over a dozen times - and I start to giggle immediately when Mathilda gets her \"laugh-attack\" in the restaurant.Of course a brilliant beast: Gary Oldman!Important note: Be sure to see the Director\u00b4s Cut (aka \"Integral version\") It contains more than 25 minutes that were cut out the first release. It is not just a few scenes, that might contain brutality or sex - it is just a complete part of the story.Actually, Mathilda thinks to love Leon, and wants to get closer to him, as he would let her. She is even asking him to sleep with her, which he refuses. But it seemes to be to hard for the original release of the film - (thought the marketing guys).So, anything in there: love, comedy, action, beautiful pictures and wonderful actorsStrongly recommended!",

            "content": "\"That's not the shape of my heart...\" sings Sting along the credits. But what is the shape of Leon's heart? Is he really the hard and pitiless man that he is as a hit man? The shape of his heart is the face of Matilda, a twelve year-old girl. He is primitive violence, and she, delicate innocence. He is the strength, the masculinity, the blood, and the flesh. She is the virginal uncontaminated purity. He is the child inside the man; she is the woman inside the child.Besson's masterpiece is a love story between this woman and this man, between these two children that go around NY killing people and holding each other's hands. The FBI kills Matilda's family and she decides to hire the best hit man in town to get revenge. The killer is Italian and his name is Leon. Their aim is to kill the FBI officer Gary Oldman, who assassinated Matilda's family and destroyed her life.The film is permeated with tension, a tension which is generated not only by the effective action scenes, but also by the complex relationship between Leon and Matilda. The film is about hatred, anger, revenge, violence, but also about love, humanity and justice.The performance of the actors is excellent. The director is very good at exploring the emotional intricacies of the unusual relationship between a man and a little girl. There are some sexual innuendoes, but they do not interfere with spectator's taste. Tears guaranteed.",

And even roof-neck killer can to find kindness and love in his slippy soul.And I think, Mathilda is a best role of Portman ever she played.

            "content": "\"See, Nothing can stop love, Leon.\"A friend of mine asked me a very serious question the other day. It was \"We already have the Professional out on DVD, Why do we need a longer version of it?\" I just smiled and said \"Because the world is full of precious treasures left on the cutting room floor.\" Ah, who am I kidding. I actually just slapped him upside the head for being such a moron. The film isn't only twenty-three minutes longer, it is twenty-three minutes better! \"Leon the Professional\" takes \"The Professional\" in a whole different direction. You still have the basic film which is one of the best action/adventure movies on the Earth and you add a doomed relationship which makes it one of the best action/dramas on the Earth.The story behind the missing twenty-three minutes is a short one. The studio which recut the film felt that the scenes involving the burgeoning relationship between Mathilda and Leon might be a tad racy for these shores. I think most people agree that they sold this audience short.True, it does discuss a taboo relationship which breaks laws, both legally and morally. But this relationship is key to the story. There never is any sight of a sexual relationship between the two, but there is the fact that Mathilda loves Leon and she wants to go the distance to prove it to him. You also have to take into account, that these are two outcasts from society. Leon is a manchild, skilled in the ways of war but not in the ways of life. Mathilda is a womanchild skilled in the ways of life, but not in war. Their situation demands that they both teach each other the tricks neccesary to survive.The missing footage also reveals some things about Leon which were unfortunate enough to be surrounded by the inappropriate scenes. This version tells more of his history. We also get to see more of his relationship with Tony (Danny Aiello.) They also reveal some of the innocence required in the dichotomy that is Leon.I know that I'm getting too deep here, but that happens with a film like this. You see it the first time and marvel at it's poignant characters and involving story. You think about it the second time and realize that you have some of the details wrong. The third time you watch it, you see that the characters are not what you felt them to be originally, and you fall in love with the movie all over again.Leon is a \"cleaner\" who fled to America in his younger years. He has honed his craft into being the best at his business. He runs odd jobs from time to time for Tony, who is the local head of the Italian branch of the hitmen. Tony has a good deal in Leon. He gets a skilled killer with no necessities in life. Tony doles out the money and Leon lives his simple life as he was raised. Mathilda is a young girl, spirited and headstrong. She gets thrown out of her school early in the film and Leon finds her smoking a cigarette on the steps. They share the briefest of conversations and Leon goes back to his apartment. Her father is a drug runner who has been cutting cocaine for the local hoods. His habit of cutting it too thin and making some money on the back-end ticks off those same mob men, Led by Stansfield (Gary Oldman) who coincidentally is a D.E.A. agent for the New York City police.\nStansfield comes and wipes out Mathildas family as she is running an errand for Leon. She comes home and sees the carnage and knocks on his door, praying for him to let her in. He does and she vows revenge. She also has nowhere to go and ends up staying with this quiet, gentle man. Upon learning what he does for a living, she asks him to train her. Leon agrees and the two become a team to take out the scum of the city.Mathilda however is confused about her relationship with Leon. She feels that she is falling in love with him, and he resists. Not because he knows it is wrong for a man to fall in love with such a young girl, but rather because he feels he can never love again. The two travel from apartment to apartment as they outrun the police and a rival gang. They grow closer as Mathilda finally becomes the aggressor in the relationship, and we watch as she changes from a gangly girl in love to a mature girl who knows her place in life. The relationship however, is doomed from the start as both have caused situations to grow until the point where it can only end in tragedy.The cast is superb. Jean Reno, with his droopy eyes and gangly physique becomes a man to be respected through his deeds and not his looks. His code of \"No Women, No Children\" is a strong motto which shows his character is although confused, still strong. Natalie Portman is well cast as Mathilda. Her innocence fades quickly and she becomes a central character in the film through her own decision skills. It was a strong part for a little girl at the time and she played it well. Gary Oldman plays Stansfield. His zoned out drug induced rages show what he is capable of. It's also interesting to see that his small part was extended into a larger one based on his skills.The disc is superbly done. Digitally remastered audio and video combined with an anamorphic presentation give this film the visual respect it deserves. Luc Besson, the director is a master at odd camera angles which enlarge the suspense. This version makes them even more enjoyable!The disc also includes: Widescreen presentation Production notes 5.1 English and 2.0 Dolby surround soundtrack Isolated music score in Dolby 2.0 channel surround International ad campaign Theatrical trailers Talent files Interactive menus English, French, Spanish and Portugese trailers 28 Chapter stopsBottom Line: A fantastic film made even better! I was going to replace my old version with this one, but instead I will add both to my collection. The reason is simple:I'll need a back-up when I wear this one out!",

He is at the same time ruthless, kills coldly and accurately, but also shows us his daily life, makes it clear that on the one hand this guy is a killer, and on the other - an ordinary, albeit a little strange and child-like, person. Therefore, the appearance of Matilda performed by Natalie Portman makes changes in his quiet and a little, even too modest life. In fact, Leon is the right hero - a character with a routine life that changes with the appearance of some other character driving the plot. Natalie Portman so plausibly played a girl with a criminal environment - Matilda, it's even a little strange that she didn't play in Star Wars...So that very much. I try to restrain myself in expressions, unlike the United States, they like a \"Hidden threat\" here, perhaps because the Jedi there are not averse to discussing something political over a cup of hot drinks.",

            "content": "*DO NOT READ BEFORE WATCHING THE FILM!*This is a really great movie!  When I looked at the box, I thought it was just going to be another boring action movie.  Although there is a lot of action, blowing up, killing, and guns, the real story is about love.  Off the top of my head, I can't think of a better love story in a movie.First of all, the pacing is really great.  Things are developed quickly, but not rushed.  For example, we feel pity for Matilda because we see her terrible family condition.  To me, this is a really good example of showing us, not telling us.  It is using movie-making to its full advantage.The relationship between Matilda and Leon goes at  a good pace too. Naturally, he is hesitant to accept her at first.  But because we've seen what he's seen, we can understand why he can't but not open the door to her. Their relationship is really deep.  You would think he'd be in complete control,  because he's older, he's a man, he's on his turf, but it's not that way.  Matilda is so powerful, basically because of two things.  One is sex.. well, not literally having sex, but that sexual power which controls men.  You see this when she does the impressions of Madonna and Marilyn Monroe, and also in the clothes she wears.  She always shows a lot of her body, and even though she's only 12, it's very sexy.The other power comes from vulnerability.  It sounds strange, but weakness is strength.  She knows how to appeal to Leon's instinct to protect.  Even very artificially, by putting herself in danger, by putting a gun to her own head, she can test and control Leon.In the scene where she talks to the boy on the street, you really wonder who is more powerful.  She could walk off and start a new life with someone else to take care of her, and Leon would be left feeling like crap and missing her.  But she's back with him the next scene and the relationship is actually strengthened.  Maybe she needed that, even though she didn't like the scolding at the time.The ending becomes sadder the more you think about it.  That shows great storybuilding from the beginning.  To balance out this great love story, Stan, the guy who killed Matilda's family, is really funny.  He provides comic relief, and his manner is very identifiable.  I love his lines and gestures!   I love Mozart!",

The dialogue and screenplay was certainly engrossing. Still can watch this film for the trillionth time. Truly it has stood the test of time , many have tried to imitate it but can never be duplicated. To bad was hoping for a sequel with \"Mathilda\" grown up. Plenty of action without gore.

It was laughable when Leon was teaching the girl how to become a 'cleaner'.Things just do not happen like that in real life. things need to be plausible to be believed, and I didn't believe much of it.where the film does pick up points for me is in the action scene towards the end.

Excellent cinematography, the violence is presented in a way that is not meant to shock.  Jean Reno, although his is French, speaks excellent English and his accent is toted as being Italian.  He portrays his character very well.   He is not an uncompassionate hired killer, but instead takes special care of his best friend, a house plant, and watches old movies at the theatre.We next meet Mathilda, a 12 year-old in an abusive home where the mother is a whore and the father is mixed up in drugs.  It is easy to understand why she is not upset when her family is gunned down by druglords, except for the loss of her 4 year-old brother.  Leon grudgingly takes her in and, after an internal struggle, decides to take care of her.This is a non-conventional love story of the emotions that grow between Mathilda and Leon and the way their love leads to what will eventually end up being the best for Mathilda.

Gary Oldman plays a role we are familiar seeing him in: a psychotic killer (actually an undercover cop)- hey he does it well!  Jean Reno (Leon) is both lovable and lethal; most of all convincing as the Assassin with honour and standards. Natalie Portman as the 12 year old Mathilda is cute, loveable and delightfully naughty:  I think we'll be seeing more of her in the future- very talented.  The rest of the cast are mostly type-cast but it all melds well to make this a well rounded albeit hard to box motion picture.

I'd describe it as an action drama, because apart from the setpiece finale, there's very little action. When Mathilda's (a stunningly good Natalie Portman) family are wiped out by corrupt DEA agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman is undoubtedly the nastiest of all his screen villains) she is taken in by hitman loner Leon (Jean Reno), and taught how to \"clean\" (kill people), while she gives him a taste for life. Most of this film is about Leon and his growing love for Mathilda, and so there is not that much action. However, Director Luc Besson pulls out all the stops for the blistering twenty minute siege on Leon's apartment, when an army of cops and SWAT teams go up against the hitman. The scene leaves you literally breathless, and you really want Leon to win, and blow Stansfield away. That would happen if this were a standard Hollywood actioner, but it's not, it's directed by Luc Besson, for God's sake and the ending, however miserable, is a breath of fresh air.",

All of the elements of this film mesh together so exquisitely: directing, writing, cinematography, and acting.\"The Professional\" is a slick pseudo-action film about Matilda (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl whose family is gunned down by double-crossed DEA agent (Gary Oldman), over a drug dispute.  Matilda happened to be out buying groceries at the moment, and comes home before the thugs leave. She sees that her family is dead, but walks past, pretending not to notice. Instead, she knocks on a neighbor's door in search of sanctuary.  The neighbor, Leon, (Jean Reno) reluctantly lets her in.  She soon finds out that Leon is in fact a hitman.  She convinces him that he is now responsible for her life since he saved it, and she asks him to teach her to be a \"cleaner\" like him so she can avenge her brother's death.  Leon eventually agrees, and Matilda ends up teaching the reclusive Leon a few things about living.All of the acting was superlative, especially Portman in the role of the streetwise Matilda.  One thing I really liked about the movie that I think most people misunderstand is the relationship between Leon and Matilda. The way I saw it, they both loved each other, but Leon's love was a father's love for his daughter.One last note: I have heard about the director's cut, but in my opinion it is not as good as the edited version.  The director's cut (according to what I heard) extremely overplays Matilda's seduction of Leon, a subject that wasn't even covered in the edited version.  This results in a loss of the ambiguity of their relationship, which is what I really liked about it.In short, that was why the movie worked so well: it was just ambiguous enough that it kept you guessing, even after you have finished watching it.

Is. For example, the film's opening action, in which Leon must frighten the fat criminal, is dedicated to paying Leon as a professional and ruthless assassin. This sequence includes all the familiar features of a movie killer. In these moments, the main character of the film is not Leon, but his goal. We feel the fear of being attacked by a murderer like Leon instead of him. We realize that Leon is doing so well that he is acting more than a human being, like a wicked spirit with no walls blocking his way. Smoky glasses prevent us from seeing his eyes and entering him. So we see him in the form of what his victims see: a mortal angel who is not a joker, as if he was born from his mother's womb to kill.",

Leon, the savior, is a strong figure in her life. Despite a vengeful undertone he sets her on the straight and narrow otherwise. He teaches her to defend herself, care for plants, to be independent. She was robbed of her childhood and becomes quite precocious. I am relieved the film did not portray leon as anything more than a plutonic protector.

It made the watching experience more relaxed, as the topic might be hard to take.I must underline that the acting seemed legit and was nice to follow, especially Natalie Portman played her role realistically, although I found her character a little... weird at times.What I liked a lot was the soundtracks (tension building) and camera angles (especially during one scene at the end); I tend to analyze those often, and they did a great job here!Concluding, it can be said that the movie continues to be a must-watch, although it is not excellent (imo), but rather average.

If you haven't seen it, forget anything else until you have.  And try to make sure you see the directors cut with the extra 24 minutes of footage.In the UK, you will need to get the film imported to get hold of this but it is so worth the effort.I have never seen such a complete film. Acting, plot, action.  This film has it all.  Subtle and explosive at once.Nathalie Portman shines with the promise that would seem to have since been fulfilled.  Gary Oldman is chilling.  Jean Reno is outstanding.  Just as you start to believe the character is actually quite 'slow' he goes off on a job and works with such ruthless efficiency it becomes a lesson in the value of never underestimating any individual you ever meet.The plot is engrossing and yet manages to set off one or two uncomfortable alarm bells within you as you watch Leon trying to come to terms with exactly how he feels for Mathilda.  It always manages to stay very firmly on the correct side of the line though due to some superb scripting and subtle direction.The cut version is still a great movie but try to hold out for the full version.

            "content": "Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It's in me, I'm a beast!\" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",

Gary's wired, drugged-out, sociopath DEA agent is a spectacle. the top down shots of him cracking the pills, not to mention the infamous \"EVERYONE!!!\" are forever etched on my memory.then there's Mathilda. for Portman to convey the sheer weight of that role, at her age, is nothing short of a minor miracle. she's... words don't so it justice. you just have to see it.so you may be wondering, \"if you liked the movie THAT much, why didn't you give it a ten instead of a nine?\" and it would be a fair question, which i will now answer.because i am now completely incapable of finding Natalie Portman attractive.every time i see her in an attractive outfit, i see innocent little 12-year-old Mathilda, dressed a little too provocatively for comfort, and my mind grinds to a halt. i know it's petty, but this movie has ruined the beauty that is Portman for me forever.",

            "content": "Superb opening sequence. Leon really does come across as a professional, yet possesses a somewhat childish demeanour with other aspects of his life, and follows a strict regular regimen.The beginning of his acquaintance with Mathilda is emotionally up lifting: seeing him trying to help the bereaved Mathilda get back up on her feet was great.Natalie Portman's acting is superb.I also liked the cinematography, especially during the opening sequence.The cons:\nThe sexual tension between the 2 of them (or at least from Mathilda alone) is uncomfortable to say the least. Others may claim that Leon never did reciprocate, but there are 2 points to this: her actions alone are provocative enough; for instance claiming to the receptionist that they are \"lovers\". Leon also tells her he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her in the end. Not to mention the constant showcasing of her bottom, scantily dressed clothing, etc. This may be \"normal\" to some people, but it shouldn't be.The thesis of the movie is supposedly centered around training Mathilda into a \"cleaner\" who is as good as Leon. Sure Leon does attempt to train Mathilda, and I can appreciate the time/scenes spent on depicting said training. But what was the training ever used for? Nothing! We never get to see Mathilda using her skills. The only thing she ever did was fire fake bullets and stick some gum on the peekholes of their targets. Massive letdown.What was the point of showing Leon being siphoned out of his earnings (or perhaps I was mistaken and his boss was honestly safeguarding it for him), Leon wanting to pass it on to Mathilda if he were to die, and then seeing Mathilda ending up in the restaurant with his boss offering to give her a hundred bucks a month? It does not add any sentimental, emotional, or purpose to the movie, apart from giving us the scene where Leon tells Mathilda that he has a bunch of money stored before letting her slide down the shaft.Underwhelming movie overall. Loved the first ~50 minutes though.",

But those qualities are part of what makes it great. Movies that do not take violence seriously are worse than shallow-they are dishonest. And a movie that does not take human nature seriously is worse than shallow-it is meaningless.Leon: The Professional does not have an overt message about human nature, but its characters and situations speak volumes.

I am buying a DVD player next month so I can see the version integrale with the deleted scenes and without world's worst pan-n-scan.The movie's treatment of the Mathilda character is difficult for some.

            "content": "Jean Reno plays Leon, a hitman. Coldly efficient, cunning and extremely deadly. The movie begins with Leon performing a hit, killing without remorse and then going home. Leon leads a simple life, although he gets $5000/head, he leaves this money in the trust of his friend and employer Tony(Danny Aiello). He seems to live on two quarts of milk a day, sleeps sitting up, stays in a small flat, and exercises rigorously. His only companion is his plant, which he cares for meticulously. He has fallen into a comfortable routine and is at peace with himself.That all changes one day, when crooked DEA agents led by the supremely evil Stansfield(Gary Oldman in a waaay over the top performance) storm his next door neighbor's apartment in search of drugs. They slaughter everyone who lives there, save the tiny, 12 year old Mathilda(Natalie Portman in a heart rending performance). She slips by the DEA agents and goes to Leon for help. Against his better judgement, Leon takes her in  and this is where the real movie begins. The relationship between the cold, remorseless killer and the little girl who has aged beyond her years. Leon teaches her the \"Cleaning\" business and Mathilda shows Leon how to live again. Early in the film Mathilda asks Leon \"Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?\" and Leon coldly replies, \"Always like this.\" We get the sense that Leon knows what he is talking about, that his life has taken so many wrong turns, that now he cares for nothing.Jean Reno is a revelation. I had previously only seen him in Ronin, and while I thought he was acceptable in that movie, his performance here goes leagues beyond what he did in that film. His Leon is portrayed as a calm, ruthless but also nervous and emotionally insecure assassin. In Natalie Portman, I am reminded of a very young Milla Jovovich, but perhaps that is because of foreknowledge of director Luc Bessons fondness for Ms. Jovovich. Natalie Portman gives an assured performance that is remarkable for one so young. Everything else I've seen her in, it appears her talents are wasted. (It is actually making me look forward to the next Star Wars movie). Gary Oldman's characterisation of Stansfield is so out of this world that it seems very out of place in this picture. Danny Aiello gives strong, stable support(as always).This is Luc Besson's strongest work out of the ones that I have seen (Fifth Element and the Messenger). I think his use of color, his compositions and stylization are great, but that sometimes he does not take the time or takes to get the elements and the performance just right. Hopefully he will continue to mature as a director.But these are minor quibbles and do not affect the overall impact of the film. I highly recommend this movie.****/*****",

People, some of us are taking things too seriously, and at the same time we are taking things for what they are not. Just because little Mathilda had a crush on Leon doesn't mean that this is a pre-teen porn flick. Just because some people got killed, doesn't mean that you are watching evening news, with real guns.What we got here is a great story by Mr. Luc Besson. Story that he showed us Using such great actors as Natalie Portman, Jean Reno, Garry Oldman and Danny Aiello. And what is frustrating me is the fact that people, who value movies for what they are: Entertainment; are striped of the chance to see the whole story, as intended by storyteller - the director; just because somebody who was lucky enough to see the full version decided that this movie is something it is not. And for sure the one thing this movie is not is a disturbing picture.So now I am going to leave you here, for all of you got some thinking to do.And me?

The movie is helped largely by some great acting performances by all the characters in particular Gary Oldman (who seems to have no end to the roles he can play)as a slightly crazy crooked cop, Natalie Portman and Jean Reno work together brilliantly some of the scenes were Portman says very awkward things are pretty hard to watch as they are so realistic you can imagine yourself in Reno's position, he doesn't really know how to reply but the acting he does with his facial expressions alone are brilliant and tell the story.I honestly think this gem stands proudly alongside such films as scarface and pulp fiction (your probably laughing right now) this film would have been fairly ordinary had it not been for the dark humour present.I have heard that the longer version of this film builds the characters a lot more and is better.

It is a film that is not slow, but takes time for it to develop its characters so in the end your heart is wrenched when Leon dies. Truly one of the most impactful character deaths in film I have ever seen. Then to see Mathilda, completely alone with no one in her life, go and plant his favorite plant into the ground to give it roots breaks my heart every time. This performances are phenomenal--Gary Oldman destroys this rule and is truly terrifying and off-putting. Jean Reno brings this amazing child-like and equally serious feel to the character of Leon that should be more widely recognized.

He charges $5,000 dollars a head, no women and no children, those are the rules. However he lives alone with little possessions, his only friend is a plant and he sleeps in a chair, next to his bed. However his life changes suddenly when his neighbour's ( a 12 year old Natalie Portman) whole family are killed by a bent cop and his team. She survives however, and runs to leon for help. He takes her in and teachers her how to become a hit-man to get revenge on the murderers. Yet a strange relationship of friendship and love unfolds between them and leon ends up having to rescue her once again as the bent cops find out her whereabouts.The film has little flaws and is a jolly good watch! The acting is superb, portman gives a fine performance of a child who's family has just been killed. Reno has little to say but is perfectly cast in the role has leon. However, the fine talents of Gary Oldman steal the show as a superb bent cop. With lines such as 'I like these clam little moments before th storm', where can you go wrong. This is easily his best performance ever and really terrifies the ordinance. The only flaw is the whole concept of leon teaching a 12 year old girl how to become a hit-man? Bit stupid really as she never kills anyone. BUt overall it is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "The interplay of the main characters is the thrust of this film - Leon, an 'innocent'adult, and Mathilda, a street-wise child, and Norman, virtually the embodiment of evil. I think this is possibly Gary Oldman's best role. His ability to give the audience a summary of his character's approach to life, purely by the look on his face in his opening scene is the talent of a great film actor. Some critics have accused Oldman of over-acting, but I think he portrays his character as 'larger than life' because his character really believes he is invincible, and can do precisely as he pleases. When he shoots at the old lady to reinforce the instruction to return to her apartment, he hits the window. It wasn't a warning shot, it was simply a luck coincidence for her that he was too stoned to aim straight! Leon's initial dismissal of Marthilda's plight is entirely in keeping with his character, and his gradual 'adoption' of her shows the emotional side previously restricted to the tender care of his pot plant - a metaphor throughout the film for the two of them, who want only someone, or even something, to love. The final optimism that Mathilda will survive is encapsulated in her planting of Leon's plant, and with it his memory. Maybe Shakespere got it wrong, perhaps the good that men do lives after them, and the evil is interred with their bones, at least that's true for Leon.",

At the same time, the inability to live an ordinary life needs, most likely, sympathy. Life is strikingly different from existence. In the first case, even a dishonest person can proudly say that in this world someone else needs and is sincerely attached to something. In the second case, the subject has only the notorious \"groundhog day\", no goal and motivation, but only a continuous swim without a rudder and sails. You can only be happy for self-sufficient individuals who are as comfortable as possible alone with themselves. All other people necessarily need the affectionate eyes of a person who has become a native and words that do not need to be deciphered: \"you will never be alone.\"Even to himself he could hardly admit his unhappiness. He was used to suppressing even the sprouts of feelings. A professional whose services will always be in demand. A performer who is used to not asking unnecessary questions. A killer whose unwritten code of honor will be executed even on the verge of death. He lost one house, never finding another in return. His name is Leon. He has been growing a beard for a long time, but at heart he is a boy who has not learned to dream. Instead of the hot drinks so familiar to people of his circle, he prefers milk, whose white color seems to purify the soul from the methodically violated commandments of God. What is life in Leonov's understanding? A potted plant that will reach for the sun all its short life. The killer himself hides his eyes from the luminary behind dark glasses. Because Leon didn't have a person to whom he could entrust his kind, sad look. Not yet...Unlike the laconic \"cleaner\", the neighbor's girl can tell anyone who is not indifferent about the vicissitudes of fate. A family that doesn't really exist. Childhood, where there is no joy of growing up. There is only one source of light in a life woven of impenetrable darkness - a little brother. Millstones alien to children's understanding of adult realities grind this tiny spring. The girl's name is Matilda. She's still very young, and they just can't take her seriously. She desperately wants to grow up as soon as possible to bring justice to her brother's murderers. But at the same time, she still does not cease to be a child, violently clutching a stuffed rabbit in her hands. Physically unable to put her thoughts and aspirations in order, she can meanwhile see kindness in the huge eyes of a shy killer. Because Matilda did not have a person who could believe her and recognize her as \"his\". Now he has appeared...",

Someone has a cat, someone has a dog, and Leona ficus is an object of universal love. It's a pleasure to watch it. Soon Matilda appears in his life - a little girl, Leon's neighbor, whose family was brutally murdered. Matilda, played beautifully by Natalie Portman, asks Leon to teach her craft in order to avenge this death. Natalie has become so accustomed to the role of Matilda that it seems that we are not looking at a young actress who has played only one role before, but an experienced actress who has played quite a lot of roles. I am also surprised by the role of Gary Oldman, who played a corrupt policeman. It was he who killed Matilda's family in cold blood. He is a great actor, and in Leon Gary was on top. I've watched this movie a lot of times, and with each new time it looks like the first time. And this is thanks to Luc Besson.",

I am sure that most young girls get a crush on an older man at some point, whether it be a teacher or whoever, and the fact that Leon takes Mathilda in and looks after her in his own simple way, gives her a sense that she is wanted in a way she never got from her family.Leon is a visual treat, Besson almost at his best. The story is told without rush, and has many hidden depths. Most of these are looked at further in the director's cut. All the roles are well played, although Oldman has a bad habit of over-acting, but still gets away with it.This film marks an end to Besson's golden era and the start of his Americanization and selling out in films like The Fifth Element, though still a good film.Leon is a must see film... 9.5/10",

I am not a member of the film-making community, and I don't have the \"professional\" verbiage to communicate my impression of this film, but if you LIVE for the unbearable (what I prefer to call) \"stretch-to-snap\", this is your film. The violence of wanton, mindless, remorseless murder contrasted with unbearable tenderness, compassion and empathy, all rolled into one roller-coaster ride of a film.

Everything about this film was done to perfection, the direction, the acting, it was all done with such passion! Jean Reno is as always phenomenal, yet again he slips seamlessly into character so well you can't attach any other role to him, and the emotion he conveys is so real it really plays on the heart strings. Nathalie Portman is superb, better than a lot of actors twice her age and the chemistry between the two makes it feel more like a real life than a film. This film has faced a lot of opposition in the past for its supposed paedophillic undertones, and to that i say b*ll***s, watch the film, you will understand in ways that i fail to find the words to convey how beautiful the relationship between Leon and Mathilda really is. Luc Besson has a way of bringing me to tears, it happened in Big Blue and it happened in this.I cannot help but give this 10/10, it has jumped straight to the top of my favourite films list, and will be a hard one to shift, if you are thinking of passing this by i urge you to reconsider, you will regret it! stay tuned for my next trip into the world of Besson Le Dernier Combat",

            "content": "I simply cannot express in words how amazing this movie is. Besides, hundreds of other people have already chronicled its nearly unparalleled appeal. Instead I have the following observations: I must say that when I first saw the U.S. release, \"The Professional\", on the big screen in 1994 I was not as adamant about its allure. I felt it was an intelligent action movie (which is generally an oxymoron, especially for Hollywood) with an excellent cast and a good story, but lacked the character development necessary to make it truly great. However, the more recent DVD release of the international version, \"Leon\", has glued together the holes and turned a great action film into a veritable masterpiece. The humanistic elements of this story, especially the interaction between the two protagonists (Portman and Reno) leaves the viewer no choice but to feel sympathy and compassion for their plight. This is quite uncommon in film.I cannot believe it got no Academy attention whatsoever (actually it's not so hard to believe with all the politics that go into the choices). I will say that 1994 was an excellent year for film...a year in which the Academy Award winner \"Forrest Gump\" was probably the fourth best film behind this one, \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and \"Pulp Fiction\".Anyway, take my word for it. You must see this movie. It is violent but the violence is simply the hard shell around the fruit that's inside. Crack it open and have a look. You won't be disappointed!",

First of all, I didn't expect such a common story to be cinematographed in such an extraordinary way...The whole idea of a professional assassin who like another caged lion tries to get away is old in cinematography. However, it is composed with passion for freedom.I give credits for that to Luc Besson(writer and director) and Thierry Arbogast (director of photography).Every scene could be a short movie by itself and that is another characteristic of the movie's power. Acting is exceptional: Gary Oldman of course steals the show from everyone(as he does in every movie he has played). Natalie Portman is the definition of the term actress. As for Jean Reno I believe that no other actor could give better the picture of an \"assassin under obligation\". The movie is dressed with the most emotional and breathtaking music i've ever heard for an action film. Probably this is why \"Leon\" is a movie that cannot be categorized in only one film category...It's like a Love Story wrapped in Action inside a Drama. I cannot put it next to any other movie because it combines various ways of film-making. Luc Besson used close portraits for intriguing, took advantage of the light in such a degree that in the end it became one more excellent actor of the film and kept the colors restrained in order for the atmosphere to be \"killing\".",

            "content": "Luc Besson is a super talented producer: he succeeded in engaging his audience either with a VERY positive or a SUPER negative responses. He could make us see compassion in a merciless hit-man (Leon) and at the same time, he could engage rage on account of a roaming free ruthless criminal and a no-age boundary romance. He led his viewers see that a deviant behavior CAN be a product of society's injustice. Loss of response to death and killing other people can be a survival mode of a deeply hidden broken heart. Aileen, the woman serial killer, didn't she also experience serious injustice? Both Mathilda and Leon experienced mistreatment and emotional destruction that led both of them in some way behave the way they do. The beating that Mathilda suffered and her very unloving family background made her heart even bitter and become emotionless to death at her early age. She became too mature for her age. Luc Besson combined reality with myth. Part of the romance in the story is possible, but in some way, the super rapidity of the hit-man can be doubted. The sexual awakening behavior of a pre-adolescent girl is very much a reality. Her attraction to an older man that can portray her missed normal relationship with her own abusive father is a reality. As for Leon, he has an emotional level of a 19 year old who was badly struck by his first love morbid experience despite the fact that he is much much older. He lost the capacity to love and respond to love as if his own heart is dead some twenty years ago. Leon portrays a dead heart person that could not feel any pity any longer to taking other's lives as a result of his incapability to face lost love. He chose death and killing as his sole purpose for life. Both Leon and Mathilda's love awake in this movie. The movie looks at the emotional dynamism rather than the morals of the hypocritical society. Luc Besson denounces the societal structure that often is at the root of society's illnesses. Gary Oldman, Mathilda's parents and Leon's former girlfriend's dad were the ones to blame. Leon and Mathilda are the victims. This is a great movie because it made its point whatever where you stand. The meaning is deeper and commends reflection and serious analysis. The fatal end is sad but triumphant since Leon \"lived\" again. He could love and forget his gloomy past, and especially, he made the unloved little girl, Mathilda emotionally happy and economically secure. At least, Mathilda is ready for life, she has been loved. How pitiful for those who have never been loved. Yes, Leon, what a \"Killer\"!Luc Besson, congratulations!",

Leon, the professional, becomes the epitome of 'cool' by his use of guns and fighting techniques, all realistically portrayed in some frantic shootots. However, Leon is not simply some dumb action flick, but rather an exploration of character relationships, police corruption and, ultimately, doomed love.Jean Reno plays Leon, a withdrawn and silent hit-man, drawn into the depths of police corruption, brutality and evil by the helpless Matilda, played by a young Natalie Portman. Gary Oldman plays the ruthless and corrupted cop Norman Stansfield, who slaughters Matilda's family, and becomes narcotically obsessed with finding Leon. All three main characters excel in their roles, especially Gary Oldman, who portrays the evil and corrupt lawman as well as anyone ever has in cinema history. Jean Reno massively improves over his great cameo appearance in 'Nikita', and Natalie Portman sets her own stage for a future career. Overall, Leon is a beautifully crafted and excellent film, and i would give it a fantastic 9 out of 10.",

The story line and writing are great, but the acting and multi-layered dialog between Reno and Portman are what elevate the movie. The hit-man missions and big explosions are executed with excellence, but only serve as a backdrop for this movie, which at its core is a character/ relationship development piece. Mathilda, the oh-so mature and hardened 12 year old needs Leon as a role model, just as Leon needs Mathilda to essentially learn how to live life. The relationship there is truly complex, fascinating, and believable thanks to superb acting and dialog that does a exceptional job of facilitating the relationship. The ending left a little to be wondered about, but this could possibly be intentional, and The Professional is still one of my favorites.",

Not even an Oscar Nomination makes you wonder what kind of other films get praises overs a masterpiece like this. Luc Besson is a great director and if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it right away, because it will blow you away.

How this can stand at such a high point, it remains a mystery to me. Overall, more emotional people may like this better, but I'm not so stupid as to take emotional pounds with assassins. All that's good about it is that it started Natalie Portman's career, but she has better films like Black swan, Star Wars, Thor. Jean Reno also has much better films like The visitors 1-2 (french films which aren't very known in the US) or Shut up (also a french comedy).

L\u00e9on, the title character, is a 'cleaner' who lives modestly in his apartment on the same floor as Mathilda (a young and endearing Natalie Portman), a pre-teen with a bad family life. When the slightly-unhinged, corrupt law enforcer Norman Stansfield (perfectly played by Gary Oldman) shows up and murders Mathilda's family, she has no choice but to seek help with her neighbor.And from there the story takes off; a bond slowly grows between Mathilda and L\u00e9on, and it all winds down to a heart-wrenching final scene. I just love this movie. Bravo, Luc Besson.(note: I suggest you watch \"L\u00e9on\" rather than the edited \"The Professional.\" The former goes into much more detail in the relationship of the two main characters, and reveals more about their time together.)",

I have been getting very weary of American patriotism and hyped up action-oozing drivel from across the Atlantic.  Enter Luc Besson with a truly engaging portrait of a killer (Jean Reno) for hire.  A killer whose only friend is a plant which he looks after with more than a little care. Natalie Portman in her first film is extraordinary.  Gary Oldman is outstanding as a drug crazed cop. Some have said that it is yet another action film.  I say, scratch beneath the surface to reveal an utterly outstanding piece of cinema.  I've found nothing to match it.",

Non seem to be how they appear anitially. The cold and calculating assassin turns out to have a heart. The cocky self assured little girl finds out she needs love to survive.\nThis movie is one of the heart and the human condition. Beson shows how people in any extra-ordinary circumstance still need love, company and meaning.Beson is excellent in the way he makes things seem not as they look.

The thing is that I have a soft spot for Gary Oldman who, though his movies aren\u00b4t always good, never comes of badly.  In this movie he is particularly convincing as a crooked, drug-dealing cop who faces Leon who is a hitman and is acted by Jean Reno.  In my opinion Oldman steals the scene several times making Reno not very memorable.  Plus, Portman shows great Talent as the little b**** who Reno takes under his wing.The strength of the movie lies in good actors.  It\u00b4s weakness lies in a bumpy screenplay.  It has good moments and bad.  The highlights are the action scenes and the intense scenes with Oldman but it gets quite tedious and sentimental in the mid-section with the silly bounding between Leon and Matilda. All in all this movie is a fair fun.  Luc Besson is a real pro and it\u00b4s well demonstrated here.",

The performances by the lead cast are wonderful. Jean Reno is very believable as a lonely hitman giving a very emotional performance. Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman are also brilliant in career best performances. Gary Oldmans psycho cop is extremely entertaining to watch. Luc Bessons direction must be mentioned, simply because it is excellent. The emotional scenes are handled well and the action scenes rival anything in a big budget Hollywood production (especially the Leon vs the swat team scene). Overall this is an exciting piece of European cinema (though it is filmed in America, the style remains French).9 out of 10",

The perfect match of music and acting makes Leon as a perfect movie to show the truth using different languages. Erric Sera composed a magical eastern style music, depicting the emotions by melodies. Natalie Portman and Jean Reno play a perfect couple. In one scene Matilda tells to Leon that: \"I'm in Love with you\" . It is the sweetest definition of love between the two, or the scene that Leone asks Matilda to not smoke and don't curse.This movie is definitely a masterpiece.

It\u00b4s not only the action, who rules. There is romantic, sense of humour and a sweet love between a cleaner Jean Reno and this little girl Nathalie Portman. They\u00b4re a great duo and I loved to watch it. Everytime when she was saying that she loves him I had to laugh. Not because it was so funny and without a sense. Only because I knew that it was the truth and it was very sweet. Jean Reno is a great actor, but Gary Oldman too. Second was only great in this role. I like to see him playing the BIG BAD. He\u00b4s a dark character and he trusted Luc Besson because he said yes to the script before read it. And besides...he\u00b4s my favourite actor. Not only because of what he plays. It\u00b4s about HOW he plays his role. It was a great movie and I can only rate it 10/10.",

Jean Reno (Leon) is the man for the film his innocence portrays well on the screen and is acting ability is boosted by Gary Oldman (Stansfield) , Danny Aiello (Tony) & Peter Appel (Malky) A great plot and story line to the film giving a different insight to organised crime only which has been emphasised in recent years The word \"Cleaner\" has a whole new meaning not just picking up a mop!!! The Young Natalie Portman (Mathilda) brilliant shows her acting ability at a very young age. I have watched the film over and over again and each time I never get bored This is a Luc Besson masterpiece I have put this film in my top 5 of all time it just shows that when you get the correct combination of actors, script and director you do not need a massive budget to make a very memorable film. I think this is Jean Reno's best performance in all the films he has been in that I have watched. If you have not watched it yet you really do not know what you are missing.",

The summaries that I have seen state that he teaches her to be a contract killer. While he does give her lessons, this is not the real meaning or reason for the movie.

The relationship is a surprise, a homeless 12-year-old with a disillusioned hit-man? improbable but obviously not impossible when within the scope of the creators of 'Leon'.Overall, i would strongly recommend this to anyone, regardless of taste as it's appeal stretches over many genres from action to crime, and from romance to drama.

So much charm, femininity, challenge, mystery, attraction! Perfect in this role. Jean Renaud is incomparable, there are no words.. He is so sedate, cold-blooded, reserved, and then so many feelings appear in his soul when she literally bursts into his measured life, so fragile, charming, petite, but so strong and conscious, and opens up a life for him that he did not even suspect... The strongest scene in the film, in my opinion, is when Leon lowers Matilda into the ventilation and they both know that they won't see each other, so many feelings, these touches, these tears, the whole world in their eyes, an irresistible desire to be together...

The uncle lived for himself, shot his orders, almost did not grieve. The plant, by the way, for some reason impressed me almost more than anything else. And then his life collided with a little girl Matilda, whose family was killed. Two solitudes met. It is very touching to watch how these two people are looking for ways to each other, getting closer ... and now there is no one closer than these two. Two kindred spirits - shoot / kill, water the flowerpot. Bright shots, the acting is amazing, even the still very small Natalie Portman, the finale is such that goosebumps. But. I do not like these stories about the love of an adult uncle and a little girl of 13-14 years old.

This is the age when you are no longer a child, but not yet a girl, and you are only getting to know yourself as a representative of a particular gender. This age is pleasantly called puberty. The period of puberty. Matilda does not have a good father figure, so if you turn to basic psychology, then her restless teenage mind creates such a connection with Leon that is difficult to characterize in any way - she is on the verge. He is both her mentor, and a kind of paternal figure, and the first man in her life with whom, due to her age, she still does not understand well how to interact, so it seems to her that she is in love. This is a sweet, first and tender teenage crush. Quite normal. We often choose not peers, but adult men as the object of our first sympathy.

Before Hit Girl, there was Matilda. Gary Oldman is an excellent weird villain. Luc Besson has a certain French flair for his actions. He has a really unique take on the action thriller genre.

It's basically a love story spiced with action and drama, where the twelve year old girl Mathilda and the middle-aged hitman Leon are the main characters. I think the acting here is remarkable.The cast is perfectly put together and I think Luc Besson made a genious move by letting Natalie Portman play Mathilda(it makes up for casting Anne Parillaud in La Femme Nikita..and more).Noone can ever top Natalie and Jean Reno's performances in this movie. The chemistry between them is awesome. To top it off the film has the greatest music score I've ever heard, thanks to Eric Serra....and the two songs from Bj\u00f8rk and Sting are amazing. It's all beautiful. If you still don't know if you want to see it, I can tell you my taste in movies so you can compare.

Mathilda immediately catches the attention of Leon after she thinks it's \"cool\" to be a hitman or \"cleaner.\" She ask him to teach her the art of \"cleaning\" so she can have her revenge on the killer of her family.\nThe performance of Natalie Portman is the best in the movie considering she plays a 12 year-old girl in a strange situation. Jean Reno is also quite good as the quiet hitman but Gary Oldman was amazing! Always a bad guy, Oldman's twisted and scary performance blew me away.Some are bothered by the strange relationship between Leon and Mathilda but that is what you need to focus on to understand the film fully.

The story is not just about about Mathilda's sexual awakening.  She awakens into a loving relationship that is more than sexual.  Her previous father figure was abusive.  Leon rescues her from that existence and they both show each other what unconditional love realy means.It is also about Leon's emotional awaking through Mathilda.  Scarred from his first love relationship he has created a monochrome world where nothing exists but death.  Mathilda is his first taste of real life.  Mathilda awakens in him a longing for somehting more than his current existence.Ultimately this film is about hope.  Early in the movie Mathilda asks Leon \"is it always this bad . . .\"  In a somewhat cynical response he says yes. If you were to ask his character the same question at the  end of the movie he would probably say \"No, even if only for a fleeting moment.\"Give this movie a look if nothing more than for the fine measured performances of several fine actors and an early look at an amazing your actress.",

I have a couple of friend that barely speak a lick of English and they loved it.  You don't have to even hear the word of the movie to get the gist of the drama that happens with this movie.  Gary Oldman is the parallelism of every corrupt evil genius bad guy and plays the bad guy role so well that I bet he gets hate mail in real life, when He played Dr Smith in Lost in Space, there was nobody that could have done it better.  Jean Reno was great as the Italian Hit man (assassins have a political (even if paid) agenda behind their killings and have no morals about killing woman and children, which Leon does, so I don't think that is the proper euphuisms to describe his profession. In the cut version you never hear of the crippling by lost love in the past and the reason he finds new life in the commitment to care for the orphan and to live again but must compete with his past and present dilemmas.  As for Natalie Portman she is pure genius and has the credentials to prove it.  (at the time of the filming, she spoke 3 or more languages fluently, I don't remember exactly) as well as many other things I find amazing to her credit.  Natalie plays the part with zeal and awe as any teen might but still showing an unbelievable amount of professionalisms considering her age.  Her recent movies are even more of a testament of her excellence in acting.",

This is by far my favorite film and I'm not afraid to say so. Directed by Luc Besson, LEON has touched on so many thematic elements that are subtly concealed under the fascinating hollywood-like fighting sequence. From LEON, the viewer sees Luc's terrifying portrait of Devil incarnated in human flesh, of elegant mastermanship embodied in a contract killer with the mind of a child, of desperate innocence endowed in an \"overgrown\" child, of Love, of Family, of Care, and above all, of Sexuality. Can't say too much about the film or I'll spoil it, but I have a few words of advice. While watching it, please pay attention to every little detail that Luc Besson has enstaged for your satisfaction, as every little scene performs a specific, no matter how small, task. Secondly, please do not, and I beg with the greatest sincerity, limit your imagination. Let it run free and wild! And leave room for debates, for discussions, for back talks, as this film in no way ends with every question answered. The point is proven, but its shadow hovers on, encircling everyone who has watched and received an impact from it. I got mine, and even now, every moment I think about LEON, I feel a violent rumble running through my nerves, a painful revelation, a blissful remembrance. Hail to Luc Besson, this is no doubt one of his best films, and one of the precious gems out there that did not get tampered with even with all the actions that Luc has projected.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead-- please watch the movie first before you read this review.I dimly remember watching the US version years ago, and that the effect it had on me surprised me, although I don't think I saw the whole movie. I watched the Uncut International version again in the past few days all the way through and the effect on me is even more astonishing.First of all, to put it into perspective, I'm a wife and mother of three under 11 with fairly conservative movie preferences. That's why it surprised me that this movie touched me. Would I have been offended if the character Leon had made sexual advances to the character Mathilda from the very beginning? Yes. Would I have been offended if the movie had depicted graphic sexual scenes? Definitely. But I think the director Luc Besson had not crossed that fine line, and the message he got to me was that this wasn't about pedophilia at all. For me, the most powerful impression I got from this movie was that it was about people who long for love and belonging and are unlikely to ever find them. Sure, Mathilda dresses seductively for her age, but if you consider her role models, her abusive family life, and her obsession with TV, and the fact that you will find teenagers her age in any American high school who speaks profanities and dresses just as skimpily, if not more so, than she is, then her character is understandable and recognizable. I feel compassion for her, for she is one of the thousands of girls in the world who may never find love or kindness if it doesn't find them. I realize that she may never have had a normal childhood, and went from twelve to twenty in mind if not in body. To me she symbolizes the little girl in every woman, the little girl who longs for love and protection-- but because of the harsh realities of life, gets only abuse and contempt. She's also the woman in every prepubescent girl who grows up too fast because of her circumstances. Natalie Portman's heartrending performance touched my heart as a mother and as a woman.Sure, the action sequences were nail bitingly taut. I like a good action movie myself. You sit wide-eyed and amazed at this hit-man who has never missed a kill, and who seems to move through the scene like an avenging ghost, swift and invisible. You also feel a sense of pity for a man whose choices in the past has doomed him to a life of death and isolation-- a man who has given up on love a long time ago and never expects it to come to him. He has a child-like character, with a grimly simple life-- all hard work and no play, all death and little laughter. He chooses not to have any women because of what happened to his girlfriend when he was young. And because he started his career as a hit-man at 19, his emotional growth has been stunted so that he remains the lost little boy that he had been at 19, perhaps feeling he has to pay for the rest of his life for the crime he had committed. And yet, despite being a hit man, to me he gave the impression that he was as honorable as a man in his circumstances could be-- more honorable than the abusive father, more than Tony, who eventually betrayed him, more than the corrupt federal officials who should have been otherwise. In the end, after he gave his life for Mathilda, I concluded that if my husband and I had been murdered, and my daughter faced a choice between a violent death, a life of fear and abuse, and being protected by this man-- well, is there really a choice? Jean Reno's performance is amazing.Many mentions have been made about Gary Oldman's performance and I have to agree that he makes a marvelously wacky bad guy. And this movie did make me laugh.",

Collecting contracts never looked this cool but, there is much more to the story in Luc Besson's masterpiece.Leon (Jean Reno) is the best in the business. Cold, ruthless, with the ability to take out a 'client' before they even know they are in danger. In and out without a trace. With an unassuming look and somewhat gawky presentation to the outside world, no one would ever know that the person walking passed them on the sidewalk is carrying enough firepower to take out a small army in his briefcase. His life is simple, his surroundings are simple, his expectations are simple. The only items in his life he cannot leave behind are his love for milk and his plant.Matilda (Natalie Portman) is a 12 year old girl. Troubled by her family situation and wondering if life ever gets easier. Her father beats her, her mother could care less, and her sister takes closely after her mother. The only person that means anything to her is her brother, a 5 year old little boy who turns to Matilda when things get a little rough at home. This is the way things are, the way they have been all along. Things are about to change.When Matilda's entire family gets murdered by a ruthless FBI agent (Gary Oldman), Matilda turns to Leon for help. Unwillingly, Leon takes the girl in and soon the girl is exposed to what this quiet man down the hall does for a living, collecting contracts. Matilda immediately wants to learn the business and take revenge for her murdered brother. (Taking a .38 and firing out the window of Leon's apartment to make her point.) Leon, again unwillingly, begins to teach the girl how the business works and the rules that professionals must follow. No women, no kids.This is a truly amazing story that takes you on a journey of mixed emotions. There are scenes that will make you uncomfortable, scenes that will make you cheer, and scenes that will make you think.",

            "review_title": "Not your average action movie.",
            "content": "\"You've given me a taste for life\". This movie is about an empty man who becomes filled with passion. The awkward conversations and sleek action scenes provide a humorous and violent movie, teeming with character development. From the outset we realise that Leon is an excellent assassin, methodical and controlled. This seems like a recipe for an average action film, like so many before this one. Leon's skill is shown in the violent scenes of the film. He kills with such ease and sleek class that it makes one squirm with gratuitous pleasure, similar to the effect felt watching the likes of a good James Bond. Films of this nature, typically bursting with sex and glamorised violence, seldom touch as deeply on the isolation that fills these contract killers' time as 'Leon: The Professional\".The reason behind his proficiency for killing, and the ability to deal with the additional psychological weight, is due to his lack of humanity. In this sense, the film goes against the stream of conventional action movies about hit men. Leon sleeps sitting up, drinks only milk and his apartment lacks furniture. Even the bare apartment has more character than Leon, a man of few words with a seemingly emotionless and unsophisticated personality. Leon's zest for creativity and love for living is deficient. Even his language is sparse. These qualities are what we like to think makes us human, our creativity and language. This is made more evident when contrasting him to Gary Oldman's spectacular character. Leon has no personal gain or purpose for his killing, he has no need for the money he makes from it, but Oldman is driven by greed and desperation. Oldman provides a great performance as the 'bad guy'. His psychotic unpredictability and restless facial contortions are absolutely terrifying. His brief composure when listening to classical music provides a great juxtaposition to his unstable, violent and torturous persona. This eccentric performance probably influenced Dafoe's character of an unstable cop in 'The Boondock Saints'. Matilda brings light and excitement into Leon's life. She has an inspiring ability to surprise the audience with her maturity. Throughout the film I found myself questioning her real age due to her direct language and confidence, something that is a stark contrast to Leon's unassuming and frankly wooden persona. This is where the movie shines. Allowing yourself to temporarily forget her age and the limitations that boundary entails brings forth a powerful relationship between the two protagonists in which they both learn from each other. For Matilda she wants to be accepted and treated as an adult and for Leon, he wishes to feel alive again, even if he does not know it. Matilda's love cannot be taken lightly, as despite her age, she is more emotionally aware than Leon. Because they never kiss, their relationship is shrouded in uncertainty. Matilda's language is passionate and I look upon as genuine love. Whether it is romantic or not is up to you, however the knot in her stomach that disappears makes me personally lean towards the former. There are times when Leon is both a father figure and lover to Matilda, and the film works well by leaving the audience forever hanging in suspicion. Their relationship is no doubt powerful and the way both characters grow beside each other is blindingly obvious but romantic.The effect Matilda and Leon have on each other is astounding and powerful. Leon, the ultimate professional, begins making mistakes. He now has things worth living for and spending money on, and the humanity we have never seen in Leon increases. Matilda's confidence grows around Leon. Perhaps she feeds off his social ineptitude and quiet demeanour and uses his silence to fuel her words. Nevertheless, at the end we realise that the limitation of age is stronger than the lie she has been living. The whole fantasy brutally spirals back to reality. Without Leon she is still a young girl. Leon's quest for passion arcs in a full circle at the end of the film with him returning to his childhood. His first kill at 19 was for love, as was his last. Whether it romantic or paternal love, you decide.The film brings forth the poignant question: who decides who should fall in love? 'Leon: The Professional' echoes with themes similar to 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Lolita', should society define who can fall in love? Whether it age or social class, love is not a force to place boundaries on.",

The movie deserves a ten in that format and people in this country need to lighten up. I'm missing out on some good quality entertainment on account of some uptight individuals. The scenes with Mathilda selling girl scout cookies to the future marks were actually quite hilarious. I also found the dinner scene well conceived. I do have a friend that has watched this version of the movie with me and well he didn't like it. The sexual undertones and all else that was involved. I guess i can see where that might bother people. But the point of the matter is that it is a great movie that is good in both versions. If Lolita style stories make you uncomfortable for any reason then don't watch this. By the way before i confuse anyone that has not seen the movie. The Professional is a much more innocent movie than Lolita.",

To me a film has a deep storyline and many details that one must gather to put the story together. It is not very commonplace for action movies to be able to do that and The Professional, or L\u00e9on, has done this in a such a marvelous way. Many people will say that The Usual Suspects does the same. However The Usual Suspects is by no means an action genre. It is a thriller. The Professional is far more gruesome in its violence and also has more action. Gary Oldman gives probably his best performance next to his portrayal of Dracula. In this film he convinced me he is hands down the greatest portrayer of villains. I would not put Christopher Walken in his class. Though Walken is a great villain in his own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because it was smart, action packed, and it was not overdone.",

            "content": "Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit- contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original",

            "content": "1\nKiller, take people's money, and eliminate people's disasters; there is no right or wrong, only interests. They are cold at emotions but have the strong desire to break something down. That is essential for killers.Some people say that this is a story about uncle and loli. Uncle saves the loli, and loli warms uncle. Master, benefactor, father or daughter or lover? The love and hate between the two is also the topic of most film reviews. But here, I want to talk about the bad policeman who pushed the two to the desperate situation, the Stansfield that makes the audience hate.In most of the dramas, the villains exist to promote the plot or to highlight the heroic image of the hero. But if there is no evil, there is also no justice, the shaping of a good villain image can greatly lift up the realm of the film, and if a villain makes you look at the hatred, it just shows that the actor's acting is in full swing.2\nStansfield is bad and cruel.He is a black policeman. He is both black and white. In the face of drug dealers, Stansfield is playing black against black. The father of Mathilda in the film was killed because he hided a pack of drugs.Stansfield loves music, especially Beethoven's impassioned prelude.When Stansfield opened the killing ring at Mathilda's house, the soundtrack of the film switched to a symphony. This is exactly the murderous rhythm in Stansfield's heart. When the first hit didn't hit the sister, he wanted to continue to pursue a step, but it seemed to be a mess. He stopped, he returned, opened the bathroom door and shot the wife in the bathtub. The drums stepped on, the rhythm was up, the shell was changed, and the bomb continued to move forward. It was also a strong beat. The crazy-escape sister was hit from behind. He strode to the living room and threw the gun on one side. Putting the hands together, like a dragon-snake-separated bead curtain, came to the front of the frightened father of Mathilda. At this point, 1 minute just has passed, the time is exactly 12:01.This cruelty and bloody, I was very impressed in my heart when I was 7th grade, and my heart was full of fear for this well-dressed villain, especially when he looked at the camera with the most stunned face. As Hitchcock said, the explosion is not terrible, and it is terrible to wait for the explosion.The next paragraph is a godsend. In the face of the treacherous Mathilda father, Stansfield began to talk endlessly about Beethoven and Mozart's music. He suspected that Mozart's music was too light, and the latter part of Beethoven's music was boring. It's because the music in the second half doesn't have the passion at the beginning. He hasn't killed Father Mathilda yet. Finally, he said to Father of Mathilda, a man who is about to die, \"you should listen to Brahms again, he's also very good.\"Killing seems to be a rhythmic art for Stansfield, even if it is killing, it is also about the inner tempo. This performance, the literary, neurotic and mad side of Stansfield, is reflected in the killing of the Mathilda family, even the 4-year-old boy, but because Mathilda's father broke his new suit, he became very angry.3\nStansfield is very bad, and he also has a \"belt.\"Stansfield felt panicked and worried when his men were killed by L\u00e9on on their own site. But he decided to start with a strong in advance, as a policeman with a \"belt\", he has power, he can instruct his Everyone to besieged L\u00e9on and Mathilda, and he only needs to be commanded downstairs without risking any risk. .If it is about individual combat capability, Stansfield is definitely not to L\u00e9on, but in the end Stansfield alone killed L\u00e9on, Stansfield's insidious blackmail is reflected here. When he saw L\u00e9on's identity, he did not arrest him directly. Instead, he deliberately removed the police on the first floor and left L\u00e9on with a chance. When L\u00e9on went to the light with hope, he did not expect the guns of the black hole behind him...\nWhy is Stansfield doing this? I think there are three reasons:First, L\u00e9on is a professional killer. If you arrest directly on the spot, you will encounter L\u00e9on's strong resistance and even more casualties. If you arrest it, you will hand it over to the court for a long trial process. In the process, the variables are too many, their own illegal things may also be revealed, which is unfavorable;Second, surrounded by three sides, leaving only one way out can force L\u00e9on to get into his own trap, and in the emotional condition of L\u00e9on's escape from being extremely excited, his sensitivity as a professional killer will drop. The success rate of shooting behind is higher;Third, he can avenge his enemies, revenge for his dead men, and also pass his own murder.Not afraid of bad guys, afraid that the bad guys have both power and mind. From the results, L\u00e9on escaped the encirclement of two hundred special policemen with guns and live ammunition, but fell under the gun of the villain.4\nIt is much harder to play a villain role than to play a decent character, because in most cases, whether an actor can grasp the spiritual core of a character is closely related to his life experience, and most of the actors' personal experiences are not bad people, so they It's hard to play well.This is also the result of the actor's profiling in most literary and artistic works, either bad or too bad on the surface, or intimidating the audience to give people a deep impression. Stansfield's role in Leon is successful. It is not like the complexity of some literary works, blurring the boundaries between good and bad, Stansfield is always bad from beginning to end, But the bad is deeply rooted in the hearts of the audience.",

The psychological realism of the script is in continual tension with the recurring wide-angle and long-perspective camera. Faces are examined in extreme close-up or from below, and the camera is often aimed down the long, narrow corridors of interior architecture (the scene in Mathilda's apartment when she's gone to buy milk, for example, or in the mens' room of a government building when she is confronting a villain). This is New York--and American movie culture--as seen through the eyes of a European artist, and Besson's vision performs the interesting task of familiarizing the good old North American version of a crime thriller. Jean Reno is suitably semi-opaque as L\u00e9on, and Natalie Portman is utterly mesmerizing as Mathilda in her film debut. Gary Oldman is Gary Oldman: not an inch of scenery goes unchewed.

            "content": "L\u00e9on is a very fun movie, with an outstanding performance from the young Nathalie Portman. The balance of its strange sence of humour, the abnormal romance, the young girl committing crimes and of course the presence of all the action makes the movie great to watch not only at fridaynight.However my experience with watching this film was that it made mee feel a little uncomfortable with its structure. The 'first part', as what I am referring to as the part from the very beginning untill Mathilda knocks on L\u00e9ons door, the movie seemed like an ironic actionmovie with strange but great scenes. This was unexpected because people would expect a serious relationship coming up between L\u00e9on and Mathilda.That's why there is the 2nd part. The part the movie get's more serious in any way. You see Mathilda and L\u00e9on growing an relationship, there's only a little doubt whether it's a father and doughter relationship or it's just love between those two. In the 3rd part, where we actually see them really loving each other, wich was kind of expected, the movie feels like just another romantic movie with a guy who cannot love anymore...At the grand finale the movie made clear it came straight from hollywood. The overuse of explosions, and just action in general. The unrealistic (almost) surviving of L\u00e9on and the killing of the villain at the end is a real anticlimax for the film. At first, everything seemed funny and ironic. Then it became serious because there was an interesting relationship going on, but the unrealistic end destroys the rest of the movie.One thing you can't discuss is the stunning acting from Portman troughout the film. There are loads of ways to the describe it but there is no way to do that negatively. On the other hand I think Reno played a little boring role. He needed to be a cold killer because of his merciless past. I get it he had to play a feelingless man and he did it well. I just don't think he was the right man to play it. Here's why: People like him, people with a traumatic and unforgivable past, should indeed be acting like that and should indeed have a face like that but, you should read their former pain in their eyes, and I don't think I have really seen it in the eyes of Jean Reno. He did feel emotionless, but it felt like that for almost the whole movie wich is a little boring. The mysterious eyes from someone else would have made the character have a little more depth.\nL\u00e9on is a mix between a comedy, a romantic drama and an artificial action movie. But none of it really dominates the movie so it is in that way a unique movie. Just with a little anticlimax.",
