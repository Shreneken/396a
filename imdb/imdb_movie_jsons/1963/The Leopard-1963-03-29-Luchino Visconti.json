            "content": "\"The Leopard\" is based upon the celebrated novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, which was a massive success in Italy and also brought its author to international attention. A film adaptation was inevitable, but its scale and detailed recreation of 19th century Italy required a bigger budget than the Italian cinema could easily afford. The decision was therefore taken to attract international audiences by casting a big-name Hollywood star, Burt Lancaster, in the leading role, with the well-known French actor Alain Delon in a secondary one. I was interested to learn that not only were Lancaster and Delon's lines dubbed into Italian, but the same was also done with the film's leading lady, Claudia Cardinale. Although Cardinale is normally thought of as an Italian actress, she was actually born to ethnic Italian parents in Tunisia, at the time a French colony, and grew up speaking French and her parents' Sicilian dialect. Her heavily accented Italian was felt to be inappropriate to her character, Angelica, who although of peasant stock has been brought up as a cultured young lady by her social-climbing father.The action takes place in the Sicily of the early 1860s. The \"leopard\" of the title is Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, the head of an ancient and illustrious aristocratic family. This is, however, a time of change, because the \"Risorgimento\", the struggle to unite the network of petty states which made up Italy into a single kingdom, has begun. Early in the story the armies of Francis II of the Two Sicilies are defeated by the pro-unification \"redshirts\" of Giuseppe Garibaldi, leading the way to the incorporation of the island into the new state.Lampedusa, himself a Sicilian aristocrat, took a somewhat cynical view of the Risorgimento, even though these events are one of the defining episodes of Italian patriotism. Fabrizio sees the events of 1860/61 as marking the decline of traditional aristocratic values and the rise of a corrupt, materialistic bourgeoisie. The new Italy claims to be a democracy, but this claim is shown to be a hollow one when the new rulers organise a rigged plebiscite to approve the incorporation of Sicily into the new unified Italy. (In Fabrizio's home town 512 citizens out of 515 supposedly vote in favour, with three abstentions and no votes against, a landslide of North Korean proportions). Fabrizio is offered the position of a Senator in the new state, but contemptuously rejects it.The main representative of the rising bourgeoisie is Don Calogero Sedara, a wealthy, self-made businessman. Like many \"new money\" men throughout the ages, Sedara longs for social acceptance by the \"old money\" nobility, and is desperate to engineer the marriage of his beautiful daughter Angelica to Fabrizio's nephew Tancredi. Although Fabrizio was hoping that Tancredi would marry his own daughter, Concetta, he reluctantly gives his consent, knowing that Tancredi (whose own family are aristocratic but not particularly wealthy is not only smitten with Angelica's good looks but also in need of her father's money.The novel has always been known in English as \"The Leopard\" (and in French as \"Le Gu\u00e9pard\"), even though its Italian title \"Il Gattopardo\" refers not to the leopard (that would be \"Il Leopardo\") but to two smaller members of the cat family, either the serval (gattopardo africano) or the ocelot (gattopardo americano). Although I can see why the change was made- \"The Serval\" would mean little to English-speaking audiences unless they were expert in zoology- Lampedusa's title strikes me as somehow more appropriate. By the end of the film Fabrizio seems a diminished figure, no longer the biggest cat in the jungle.When first released in 1963, the film was a success in Italy and France but not in America, where it was released in an English-dubbed version, cut down to 161 minutes, considerably shorter than Luchino Visconti's 185-minute \"director's cut\". I have never seen the English-language version, so my comments below are of necessity based upon Visconti's cut. Even if Lancaster did not speak the words we hear in the Italian version, he nevertheless dominates the picture by his very presence. At first he seems a towering figure, a pillar of tradition and aristocratic values, but it eventually becomes clear that the forces of historic change are too strong for him, and if he still remains standing at the end he does so like a pillar which remains upright when the structure it once supported has fallen into ruins around it.\"The Leopard\" is an early example of what has become known as \"heritage cinema\" and, although that genre is mostly associated with Britain it predates what I normally think of as the first modern British example, Schlesinger's \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", by several years. It is not only a grand epic, very visually striking and making good use of the landscapes and architecture of Sicily and of the costumes of its period, but also a moving meditation upon the forces of history and the process of change. A fine drama. 8/10",

            "content": "This known novel is magnificently brought to the screen with colorful images , impressive soundtrack , visually absorbing cinematography and sensitive as well as thoughtful events . An epic story dealing with Fabrizio Cordero , the Prince of Salina , the Leopard (Burt Lancaster , though 20th Century Fox asked Visconti to choose from among Anthony Quinn, Spencer Tracy and Lancaster ; Luchino wanted Laurence Olivier for the title role and he wanted to cast Nikolai Cherkasov , too). Salina is an upright aristocrat who attempts coming to terms with the new rulers of Sicily as well as overcome his family and class amid the troublesome social upheavals . Fabrizio observes the waning of his noble home and attempts to help build a new Sicily but his nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon , though Horst Buchholz turned down the role) , Prince of Falconeri (Alain Delon) assures his status by marrying Don Calogero Sedara's (Paolo Stoppa) gorgeous daughter Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) .Luchino Visconti's enduring romantic adventure deals with the tumultuous social upheavals of 1860's Sicily , and it is paced in slow and deliberate rhythm . The film traces the rising and falling of Fabrizio Corbero , Prince of Salina and the corresponding rise to eminence of the hugely wealthy ex-peasant Don Calogero . However , the film results to be overlong , it seems longer than its 187 minutes running time . Based on the classic novel written by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa , being scripted by Suso Cecchi D'Amico , Pasquale Festa Campanile and considered to be the best screen adaptation ever . Such was Luchino Visconti's attention to detail that it was shot in actual historical palaces , including authentic pictures , objects and tools . Concluding the climatic scene in the sumptuous forty-minute ball and long banquet where Tancredi introduces Angelica to society , it is deemed to be one of the greatest set pieces in film history . Originally released in USA in a badly dubbed 165 minutes version , picture was restored in 1983 to proper form .Masterful interpretation by the great Burt Lancaster , The Prince of Salina , a noble aristocrat of impeccable integrity who tries to preserve his family against their dark destination and nice acting by Alain Delon as his ambitious nephew who swims with the tide and assures his own position . Support cast is pretty well , they give top-notch performances such as Paolo Stoppa , Romolo Valli , Terence Hill , Pierre Cl\u00e9menti , Giuliano Gemma and Ida Galli . Colorful and evocative cinematography in Technirama wide screen system, by Giuseppe Rotunno . Classical and emotive score by Nino Rota . The motion picture was masterfully directed by Luchino Visconti and was shot over 11 of the hottest weeks of the year , being Martin Scorsese's favorite movie .This celebrated story was well based on historical deeds , these were the followings : Sicily was invaded by \"A corps of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi landed in Sicily in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the Bourbons\" . The Expedition of the Thousand was an event of the Italian Risorgimento that took place in 1860. A corps of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi landed in Sicily in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the Bourbons. The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the \"four fathers of the nation\" Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II, and Camillo Cavour, pursuing divergent goals. It is difficult to determine the true instigator: Mazzini desired to release the Mezzogiorno and Rome, whereas Garibaldi wanted to conquer in the name of Victor Emmanuel II, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and continue to Rome to complete the unity of Italy, and Cavour wanted to avoid at all costs conflict with his French ally, Napoleon III, who protected Rome.The expedition also brings new large collective ambiguity and misunderstanding: for Garibaldi, it is to achieve a united Italy; to the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for the mass farmers, the end of oppression and land distribution",

            "content": "Burt Lancaster plays a true aristocrat in an aristocracy that is not an aristocracy. The degeneracy as well as the sophistication of the rival political factions in warring Sicily is shown, and the human insight of the central character that embodies true nobility, even though he is largely powerless to make his ideals reality. Garibaldi is invading Sicily with an army of a thousand, landing in Marsala and advancing through Palermo. Prince Salina (Lancaster) is a noble of a disappearing age. He refuses a place in the new senate and is unable to convince the new wave that the unification will not be good for Sicily. He is caught between different loyalties. A love story between his nephew (played by Alain Delon) and a rich merchant's daughter (played by Claudia Cardinale) interweaves the action and heightens the moral dilemmas that Prince Salina has to face. A brave film, opposing, exposing and opposed by government and church. The full length restored edition is a cinematic gem and the opulent costumes and scenery are a treasure to behold.",

            "content": "I had longed to see this film for years, having only seen b/w stills and brief clips. Finally, Glasgow Film Theatre got a new print in their Visconti retrospective in 2003, and it was certainly worth the wait!'Il Gattopardo' is a marvellous film, a magnificently realised slice of 19C history presented through the lives of engaging but humanly fallible characters. Don Fabrizio, Prince of Salina, is a shrewd, benevolent man of 45, trying to navigate a passage for his family through the social and political turmoil of the Risorgimento in Sicily. (I was stunned that some reviewers thought there was too much discussion of politics in the film - it is essential to the story and its context!) Burt Lancaster gives surely his greatest performance as Don Fabrizio, coming to terms with the fact that he is among the last of a dying breed: born too late to dwell in an unchanging aristocratic world, but too early to adapt fully to the modern world, unlike his nephew Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon). As he tells the royal envoy from the mainland: \"We are the leopards, the lions; after us will come the jackals and hyenas\".Tancredi embodies the best and worst of the rising generation: he is dashing and full of vitality, but he breaks the heart of his shy, sensitive cousin Concetta (Lucilla Morlacchi), and is just as fickle in his political loyalties - although this ensures he will survive in the new Italy. His engagement to Angelica Sedara (Claudia Cardinale), daughter of the nouveau-riche mayor, secures the family's future. Angelica is a fine example of how well the characters are drawn: no idealised romantic heroine, but a vital, beautiful girl with a vulgar streak. She laughs interminably and loudly at Tancredi's coarse jokes at the table - not how a 19C young lady was expected to behave: you sense the cringes this induces in the rest of the family, despite the fact she is 'a good catch' in material terms, and is basically good.The other supporting characters are worth attention, delineated with affectionate humour: Angelica's social-climbing father; Princess Maria Stella (Rina Morelli), with her glum piety and fits of the vapours (one can easily believe her husband's quip, \"We have seven children, but I've never even seen her navel!\"); the family chaplain, Father Pirrone (Romolo Valli), with whom Don Fabrizio has amusing bouts of verbal sparring.But it is as much the look of this film, besides the intelligent script and excellent characterisations, which makes it so special. The costumes are among the best I have ever seen in a 19C-set film. The landscape and architecture of Sicily are shown to tremendous effect: you can feel the heat, the dust. Dust? Yes - and that is one of the best things about the film: its physical realism. When the characters go on long carriage journeys, they get visibly dusty; their palaces have shabby, disused rooms and semi-derelict wings, as well as majolica floors; the all-night ball - a tour-de-force of colour and spectacle - results in a retiring-room full of used chamber-pots; the rural villages are as dilapidated as picturesque. Too many costume dramas present perpetually well-groomed characters in immaculate environments, no dirt or untidiness: 'Il Gattopardo' does not.The film ends with Don Fabrizio walking home after the ball, having come to terms with his mortality and seen the younger generation preparing to take centre stage. If you want to meet him again in his final years, and see what becomes of Concetta and Angelica as the 20C dawns, then read Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's original novel, of which this exquisite film is a faithful and sensitive adaptation.And to see the characters now? About the same time I first saw this film, I got a picture-book of the mummies of Palermo: fragile parchment-skin and bone in fraying 18-19C finery. The same sense of the transience of beauty, of change and mortality, pervades the mummies and the film alike: one auburn-haired youth even resembles Francesco Paolo, the Salinas' young son. \"Dust and ashes!\" writes Browning; \"Mais o\u00f9 sont les neiges d'antan?\" says Villon. But thanks to Visconti's masterpiece, we can still see 'the snows of last year' at the point of their dissolution.",

            "review_title": "it's one of Visconti's most ambitious and gorgeous films",
            "content": "What I found most fascinating, though this would exclude the character of Fabrizio Salina (played dead-on by Burt Lancaster) and the images captured time and time again, is that The Leopard is practically a 180 from Visconti's breakthroughs. Think of Ossessione and La Terra Trema and any film buff will think of neo-realism, the plight of the under-valued, the emerging form of power in the simplest stories, the most heartbreaking images. By the time it came around to the Leopard, Visconti was still making personal movies, but here with the Leopard instead of it being a grainy black and white, full screen film set in the present and detailing the lower classes in their communities, it's a sumptuous widescreen technicolor feat telling the story of aristocracy in 1860 Italy. But, luckily, Visconti doesn't disappoint- this is a rich film, one that I may not have been able to penetrate on the first viewing, and I don't know how many viewings it will take me to do so.The lead character, a Count (Lancaster), has to face up with the changing times- not only is an end coming to a ruling class that has been more or less on rules for about 2500 years, his nephew Tancredi (played in a wonderful early performance by Alain Deleon) is in love with a fellow Don, Calogero's (Stoppa, genuinely slimy and interesting aristocrat) daughter Angelica (Claudia Cardinale, who makes Catherine Zeta Jones seem like an every-girl in the looks and persona department). A revolution seems on the way, but it is ceased, and meanwhile the Prince sees that things are changing, but as one quotes, \"things will stay the same\".The Leopard is many things- philosophical treatise on the nature of the ruling class with all that is to offer when looking down on the 'little people'; classic, novel-type love story with characters not going into the realm of soap; it's a feast for the eyes and the ears- Giusseppe Rotuno and Nino Rota turn in five of their greatest pieces of work respectively (even when a character may be talking and it may not be terribly interesting, looking at the shots that unfold is not deterring in the least). Although the drama that unfolds at times isn't as compelling as in Visconti's neo-realist efforts, and the fact that this is in another country going back nearly a hundred and fifty years (the distance as opposed to recognizability of the family in the fishing village of La Terra Trema), it is a treat to see. And, indeed, after seeing it on a big screen (a rare occasion, thanks to the Film Forum theater in New York), it perhaps one of the finest widescreen films to come out of Italy in the past fifty years. A masterful sequence is to behold as well- the ballroom sequence, where the tones are instinctively precise. Bottom line, this is (one of) the ultimate aristocrat-turned-Marxist take(s) on 19th century Italy and Sicily.",

            "review_title": "On the inevitability of change",
            "content": "Let me just start by saying this film is gorgeous, starting with its cast, led by Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, and Claudia Cardinale. With his whiskers and regal gravitas, Lancaster even looks like the majestic leopard from his family's coat of arms, or perhaps a lion. The production quality is very high, with lavish sets, beautiful costumes, and incredible attention to detail. Shot in widescreen format, director Luchino Visconti also gives us sweeping landscapes in rugged Sicily.Set in 1860, the Bourbon state of Naples and Sicily (the Kingdom of Two Sicilies) was about to end, as King Ferdinand II had recently died. The movement for Italian unification was led out of Piedmont-Sardinia, ruled by Victor Emmanuel and with Cavour as his Prime Minister. Sometimes at odds with these leaders, in May, 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi and his \"Redshirts\" invaded Sicily to successfully take the island from the Bourbons. This was a part of creating the new Kingdom of Italy, unified for the first time since the Roman period.For wealthy aristocrats on Sicily, the coming change was viewed warily, for reasons of wanting to hold on to their riches, as well as a fair degree of Sicilian cynicism. We see this in the older Prince (Lancaster), who looks on impassively, looking to ride out the regime change and retain his position, and who later turns down an opportunity to represent Sicily in the newly formed nation's senate. We also see it in his nephew (Delon), who doesn't really have a guiding political principle, but is canny about sensing change, and fights for the side which benefits him the most. It's not a particularly flattering portrait, though I think Visconti's portrayal of these characters is far less pessimistic than Lampedusa's. Lancaster is stately and dignified, a positive character here, particularly when contrasted to the character of Calogero, a landowner who has risen from humble circumstances.The genius of the film and the work it's based on is how it has all of these layers to the inevitability of change, with one political regime giving way to another, the old aristocracy giving way to those with \"new money,\" and older people recognizing their age and giving way to youth. The grand palaces and beautiful ballroom dances are of an age now lost, and the film has a poignancy in fondly looking back at it - kind of like how the American south before the Civil War is romanticized (and in this case, minus the horrifying slavery and subsequent distortion of truth).Amidst this grand historical backdrop the old Prince sees all aspects of his life changing, even if he's been convinced by his nephew that \"for everything to remain the same, everything must change.\" He ponders it wistfully, and the viewer comes along for the ride emotionally. That quiet look in the mirror that Lancaster has towards the end, a tear in his eye, says it all. Lampedusa did not live to see his only book published or the triumph of this movie, which is sad but somehow in keeping with his themes. Even in triumph, the march of time is relentless, and we all will be the victim of our own transience.Visconti's work is fantastic and faithful to the book, with one glaring exception: he omits the final two chapters, set in 1888 and then 1910, choosing to spend a very long time (45 minutes!) on the final ballroom scene instead. As exquisite as that set piece was, I think it was a mistake, because those final chapters which flash forward in time cement the theme of dissolution, give us the realities behind the grand moments of life and love, and contain indelible images. It's a bittersweet film regardless, but Visconti chose to put things in a more optimistic and happy light. Perhaps without cutting the ballroom scene down at all, we could have been treated to another hour of this delicious work. I would have been down for that.A couple of quotes, this first one on getting older:\n\"You see, Father a man can think of himself as still young, even at 45. But when he realizes his kids are grown enough to fall in love, old age becomes all of a sudden overwhelming.\"And this one, on Sicilians. Lampedusa's observations reminded me of Kazantzakis commenting on Cretans, and I loved how we get little insights into the culture at about the two hour point of the movie:\"We're old, we're very old. For 25 centuries we've been carrying on our shoulders the weight of wonderful civilizations. But they all came from the outside, we didn't create them. For 2500 years we've only been a colony. I know it's our own fault. But we are tired, void, and lack vitality. ... I know you all mean well, but you're late. Sleep. That's what Sicilians want, a long sleep. They will hate those who want to wake them up. Were it even to give them beautiful gifts. But I doubt that the new Kingdom has any gift for us. Here, any action, even the most violent, represents a longing for oblivion. Our sensuality is a longing for oblivion. We shoot and stab because we long for death. Our laziness, the penetrating sweetness of our ice cream are a longing for voluptuous immobility. That is, again, for death.\"",

The story of the decadence of the Italian aristocracy with the unification of Italy, \"Il Risorgimento\", in 1860, is presented in Sicily through the eyes of the noble and clever Prince Don Fabrizio Salina, magnificently played by Burt Lancaster.

            "review_title": "A leopard never changes its spots",
            "content": "Luchino Visconti directs \"The Leopard.\" The plot? Burt Lancaster plays Prince Fabrizio of Salina, an aristocratic Sicilian whose wealth, influence and way of life comes crumbling down during il Risorgimento, the social and political movement which led to the unification of Italy's states.Whilst the once powerful Fabrizio watches as monarchical feudalism dies a slow death, his dashing young nephew, Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon), grows from an enlistee in Giuseppe Garibaldi's people's army to a master of modern realpolitik, switching to the cause of Camillio di Cavour, the scheming aristocrat (and eventual prime minister) who succeeded at unification where Garibaldi failed.Like author Giseuppe Tomasi de Lampedusa, who wrote the book upon which \"The Leopard\" was based, Visconti was deeply committed to social and economic justice. Both artists were also the sons of aristocrats, and so were privy to the wheelings and dealings of power.Visconti's unique vantage point thus imbues \"The Leopard\" with a certain sensitivity. Whilst his previous film, \"Rocco and His Brothers\", traces a peasant family's disintegration after their move to industrial Milan, \"The Leopard\" does virtually the same thing, coolly observing as the aristocracy crumbles under modernity. What's interesting is that whilst both films are elegiac tragedies, they don't only mourn the loss of a time and the fading of their respective social classes, but the fact that change is traumatic precisely because people refuse to let themselves change, whilst are paradoxically always willing to ruthlessly do anything to guarantee their future or place within what Visconti calls \"the new consensus\".So an interesting tension emerges when watching Visconti's films in sequence. Whether it be the \"The Damned\", \"Senso\", \"Ludwig\", \"Death In Venice\", \"The Leopard\", \"Conversation Piece\", \"Rocco and his Brothers\" etc, we constantly see Visconti questioning progress, modernity, the rise of the bourgeois classes and nationalism. His characters are always trapped between times, between eras, between worlds, and his stance is always one of uncertainty. The nationalism of \"Senso\", for example, is portrayed as grand pageant of liberation and unification, whilst in \"The Damned\" such nationalism leads directly to Naziism. These polarities are found in all of his films, Visconti caught in a kind of tug-of-war between being a Marxist progressive, and his nostalgia for the aristocracy of his youth. His films aren't apologias for the aristocracy, but rather, seem highly sceptical of whether or not what came next has been \"good enough\", or indeed, any different.Stylistically the film is gorgeous, Visconti immersing us in the rituals of the aristocracy and treating us to lush visuals, ornate costumes and sets. Like most of Visconti's later films, however, \"The Leopard's\" narrative is too bound to the format and style of the Victorian novel. Likewise, Visconti's aesthetic is too reliant on the conventions of stage plays, which is no surprise, as the director cut his teeth directing Italian operas and theatre productions.8/10 \u2013 \"The Leopard\" can't be fully digested in a single viewing. Its rather distant style masks numerous subtleties and its power-plays can initially be very confusing, especially to those unfamiliar with this period of history. The film was a huge influence on the works of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Multiple viewings required.",

            "content": "No doubt about it, The Leopard with its DeMille like opulence is a thing of sheer beauty. As subject matter for an American audience I think that unless one has a knowledge of Italian history this film might just be a bit arcane for an American audience.Burt Lancaster who was hired for American and worldwide box office clout is the lead here. He plays the head of an honored noble house in Sicily which is seeing the end of power with the end of the Kingdom of the two Sicilies which is roughly the island of Sicily with the lower half of the Italian peninsula up to around Naples. Giuseppe Garibaldi is leading a revolt against the ruling Bourbon house there. Lancaster's nephew Alain Delon has joined with Garibaldi's army purely for reasons of self preservation for himself and the family. Delon is quite the opportunist. As for Lancaster he looks over the ruins of the society he was a leader in with a dour pessimism just like Ashley Wilkes at the end of the Civil War. In fact The Leopard bears more than a passing resemblance to Gone With The Wind. For one thing it was the epic novel only published work of two authors talking about long gone societies which they were told tales about as kids.Things take a conservative twist in Italy. The House Of Savoy which ruled the island of Sardinia and Piedmont area of Northern Italy kept itself in business and now was uniting Italy under a constitutional monarchy. One of the locals who's amassed a fortune Paolo Stoppa is in tight with these folks. Alain Delon is courting Stoppa's daughter Claudia Cardinale. A marriage between the two houses will insure financial security for Lancaster and relations and Stoppa gets the prestige of an old and honored name. Lancaster isn't crazy about Delon marrying beneath him, but he sure likes what he sees in Cardinale.I saw an abbreviated version of The Leopard with battle footage and the some of the climactic ballroom scene cut out. Lucchino Visconti certainly had the skill to bring off a portrayal of Italy's past. His characters are interesting and certainly Burt Lancaster is most impressive as a man some 300 years behind the time and he knows it. Lancaster has some sad predictions for Italy's future and again a knowledge of how Fascism came to Italy is helpful.The Leopard is an impressive film, but arcane for American audiences.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful and thoughtful film about the changes occurring in Sicily after 1860, with the unification of Italy and the disappearance of the old Kingdom of Sicily. It explores these changes and and changing role of the old aristocracy through the experiences of the Prince of Salina. Overall it is an excellent film with many beautiful scenes, much contemplation, and a great exploration of the prince's character, views, a realisations.It has some absolutely incredible moments, particularly the grand ball at the end, which is handled wonderfully. The film perfectly captures the prince's feelings, sadness, and sense of separation or isolation from the rest of the seemingly happy people at the ball and I don't think that I have ever seen this phenomenon handled so powerfully. The whole atmosphere of the ball, with the prince sweating and feeling in a daze while others laugh, giggle, dance and gossip, is wonderful, as is the horrible din while people go to get food and chat away whilst eating. It is unusual in that it perfectly captures such negative aspects of big, \"festive\" parties so rarely even addressed, much less demonstrated so flawlessly. The fact that such feelings of isolation and the like are a fundamental reality of big parties, especially when one has a lot on one's mind, makes this all the more forceful and compelling.However, the film has some weaknesses. It does not bring everything together quite perfectly and fails to completely hit the nail on the head. I understand the transformations in the film and the prince's emotions, yet there is too little information underlying all of this too really see the bases for these thoughts, etc. I needed to extrapolate and rely on my own knowledge of the historical circumstances, none of which really should be necessary. The result is that I can easily see how audiences may be confused or uncertain what it's all really about. Moreover, it introduces scenes or issues that seem to have no point, lack an explanation, and go nowhere. Some seem at first to have significance, but then go nowhere and this tends to distract from the central plot and themes of the film while leading to potential confusion about the point of the scenes, as well as expectations that the issues will arise again. However, while these points to me prevent this from being the absolute masterpiece that it could have been, they do not seriously detract from the film and are only minor dents in the film's incredible strengths.",

            "content": "Luchino Visconti's film \"The Leopard\" from 1963 tells the story of forming a new Sicily.Burt Lancaster, in a beautiful performance, is Fabrizio Corbero, the Prince of Salina (the Leopard) and watches as a former peasant, Don Calogero Sedara, comes to social prominence. The prince's nephew, Tancredi (Alain Delon, better looking than the scenery) is a modern thinker and wants to go with the new Sicily. Fabrizio is behind him and knows he is going to be a political force. Tancredi, Prince of Falconeri, solidifies his position in the new regime by marrying Don Calogero's beautiful daughter Angelica (Claudia Cardinale). The big scene is the huge ball which lasts for 40 minutes at the end of the film.Gorgeous cinematography, lush locations, sumptuous costumes - no expense was spared for this film. Burt Lancaster is magnificent, delivering humorous lines (\"Angelica is not a slut. She might become one, but right now...\"/ on marriage: \"Ah, yes, one year of flame and 30 years of ashes,\" and my favorite, \"I've had 7 children with her and I've never seen her naval.\" Toward the end of the film, he gives a wonderful speech about leopards and lions and hyenas. This is followed by a scene of peasants, with the sounds of the party in the distance. The classes are going to mingle. Lancaster also says a prayer that is poignant and magnificently delivered. A very successful performance despite being dubbed in Italian.This is the kind of films most Americans find difficult. It has three characteristics that many European films have: It's long, it's slow, and it's multilayered. And for me, it was over the top without giving us a sense of the actual revolution. Even the battle scenes for some reason did not convey it -- everyone seemed outside of it, like a quiet overthrow. Visconti was trying to show the aimlessness of the rich by having them twirl and dance, but it was too much.Not enough happens to show us the political fight and a contrast between the new and old worlds.But it does capture the theme that this particular leopard, Fabrizio, cannot change his spots or refuses to, feeling too old, out of touch, and seeing himself become a relic. People past a certain age can connect with this. When my sister turned 65, she said, \"It's not my world anymore.\" I said, \"It hasn't been your world since you were 49.\" And it's tough to take.Tancredi, on the other hand, changes his spots more than once - he likes to be where the power is. But he's young, and he can go with the tide or be a relic starting at the age of 28. Some classic themes couched in a beautiful-looking film, the type of movie some people look at and, when it's over, say \"what was that about?\"",

It just seemed to go on and on and on. The final segment of the movie was set at a dinner party and it lasted about an hour when it easily could have been done better in about 10 minutes! Now there are some films that are three or more hours long and they are captivating throughout (such as \"Ben Hur\" or \"Gone With The Wind\"), but this film merited, at best, about two hours worth of film. Normal scenes that could have been done in seconds or just a few minutes seemed to take an eternity. I STRONGLY disagree about the notion of restoring the lost footage, as despite this the characters generally seemed very wooden and the action and intrigue were minimal. Perhaps the original American version WAS edited poorly BUT adding all this additional footage just didn't help.Do NOT assume I dislike Italian films. I have really enjoyed many--just not this one.",

Only a Marxist duke like Visconti could have had the split sensibility, and the anecdotal knowhow, to render Sicily just before its entry to modernity with the splendor and the caginess that radiates through every frame of this masterpiece. As the prince making final compromises before leaving the faded world he has inherited, Burt Lancaster gives one of the greatest performances in movies. Possessed of both an elegiac melancholy and a shrewd, dry-eyed appraisal of the failures and the glorious extroversion of its aristocratic world, THE LEOPARD is like a dream you can't bear to let go of. Contemporary viewers will see echoes of THE DEER HUNTER, 1900 and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE--and will see those films shrivel to the size of cocktail franks.",

            "review_title": "Less Ephemeral than Modern Top Notch Prod-actions; the Essence of Great Cinema",
            "content": "Having seen most of maestro Visconti's movies, THE LEOPARD, unlike the majority of cinema works, constitutes one of the films I find really hard to review. Its undeniable magnificence as well as its great significance in cinema make me, a simple viewer, sort of speechless. So many eminent movie critics have already said much. What more can I say? Yet, since everyone perceives art in the individual manner, I hope that I won't make anyone angry by sharing with you my personal thoughts about this wonderful film, the film I have come back to many times with true delight.When viewing the movie for the first time, I was motivated by three major reasons: its content, its director and its locations.First, being based on the novel by Giuseppe Lampedusa the story is set in the critical period of Italian history, the Risorgimento when, as Geoffrey Nowell-Smith nicely put it, \"the bourgeoisie marry into the aristocracy and the Byronic aristocrat sinks gently into Bien-Pensant mediocrity as the revolutionary storm subsides.\" What other period of this country's history can better highlight the generation gap? That is bound to result in excellent, thought provoking production.Second, Luchino Visconti as a director and an aristocrat resembled all spirit of magnificence. As a result, there was hardly anyone in Italy in the 1960s who could portray aristocracy as well as Visconti was able to. And in THE LEOPARD we find more Visconti's features than elsewhere. Pure greatness of every single detail! Third, the locations of Sicily, the pearl of the Meditterraenean with its overwhelming history, beautiful architecture and glorious nature surely constitutes a crucial merit of the film. Among other places, we encounter the marvelous church of Ciminna near Palermo, the lovely gardens of the palaces and the splendid nature in the coastal Mondello. Here, I would like to quote the words of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe who, having traveled to Sicily, said: \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for in Sicily lies the key to everything.\" But, when I saw the film again and again, I was mesmerized by THE LEOPARD to the extend I now consider it a masterpiece at multiple levels. Why? The international cast give brilliant almost wondrous performances by feeling their roles and letting true character developments become reality. The first mention, of course, must be made of the actor who, as a matter of fact, replaced great Laurence Olivier similarly to 1933 MGM production when John Gilbert once replaced Mr Olivier in Garbo classic. That actor is Burt Lancaster in the lead as the noble Prince Salina. The prince, on the one hand, appears to be quite open to changes 'so that all remains the same'' yet, on the other hand, rejects all possible participation in the Risorgimento and becomes more and more acquainted with the end yearning upward to the morning star. His character occurs to resemble the director himself, similarly to the protagonist portrayed by Mr Lancaster in CONVERSATION PIECE (1974). In order to represent the youth comes Alain Delon as energetic, passionate, vital Tancredi. Delon, in an excellent manner, highlights this youthful enthusiasm and desire for changes. Claudia Cardinale at his side as sensitive, delicious Angelica is unforgettable with her spontaneous, wild manners found so odd within the aristocratic splendor. Chemistry between Cardinale and Delon makes the pair particularly convincing. The performances from the supporting cast are also worth high attention, which, unfortunately, cannot be discussed in a single review. Just to mention Rina Morelli as Princess Salina and Paolo Stoppa as Don Calogero.The artistry of the entire film is worth highest praise. That refers to the picture in general as well as to its concrete aspects, in particular music and sets. The music by great Nino Rota, a mainstay at eminent Italian masters of film art, is sublime. The tunes that combine passion with melancholy, spring of vitality with fall of nostalgia are a true masterwork. The sets together with breathtaking wardrobe and camera-work are feast for the eyes. A mention must be made of the climactic scene of the ball with the tunes of great waltz by Giuseppe Verdi. Another moment that particularly caught my attention was 'Te Deum Laudamus' at the Ciminna church and the close-ups of the faces that elbow with incense. Terrific! Psychological depth, visual splendor, great character development, clever script, historical accuracy and subtle artistry...something you hardly find in many top notch productions filled with sex and action...that all makes THE LEOPARD an exceptional movie. Nevertheless, there also seems to be something mysterious, something that some viewers will capture, something more permanent that delicate heart longs for and may experience at a certain moment in life in order to be able to say with the prince his memorable line: \"O faithful star! When will you give me an appointment less ephemeral than this?\"",

At the beginning of the film he is very much aware that his class, the old nobility, must, in order to survive, form a coalition with the \"noveau riche\". During the film he becomes more and more aware not only of the mortality of his class but also of his own personal mortality.To form the above mentioned coalition he match makes his nephew Tancredi (Alan Delon) to Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), daughter of the \"nouveau riche\" mayor of the town. Don Fabrizio thinks that the opportunism of his nephew will bring him success in the new age, also he does not really like the boy. The money of Angelica will give Tancredi the means to fulfill his ambitions.Angelica thus plays a role in saving the old nobility but she also plays a role in the storyline of Don Fabrizio becoming aware of his personal mortality. In secret Don Fabtrizio has fallen in love with Angelica. If he had been 20 years younger he never would have introduced Tancredi to Angelica, he would have courted her himself! The two storylines come together in the final ballroom sequence of no less than 45 minutes.Claudia Cardinale has never been more beautiful than in this film.

            "content": "I watched this masterpiece when it was first released, then some years later and now on DVD in my own home and was again entranced by its scenic beauty, its acting and by Lampedusa's novel and the extraordinary script that flowed from that novel. I read this book after watching the movie for the second time and was pleased to see that it was part of the Tertiary Entrance Exams for final year Western Australian high school students. I do not read fiction but Lampedusa's masterpiece (sorry for the twice used word--the entire artistic event cannot be referred to by any other term) was so engaging that even a non-literary person such as myself was immediately captured by the beauty of his prose as he described the death of a passing era, seemingly, as quickly as the ball that is the metaphor for the entire movie.The movie's politics were not predominate; rather, I remember it for the sensitive and therefore caring way in which, first Lampedusa and then Visconti, paint the life of a man who stands on the steps of social oblivion. The book and movie have this tremendous background of profound change and yet the substance of the story treads softly on these momentous movements. We are left watching a man's life transform against this huge background but I saw the movie and the book as a soft study of a singular man's emotions as all this historical transformation whirled around him and eventually engulfed him.Ending a movie with a hour long ball sounds preposterous and by contemporary standards probably is; seen, however, in the context of virtually two previous hours of careful preparation, all elements of this beautiful, sensitive story fall into place. The new bourgois usurping the old landed aristocracy; the loss of accepted social values from the old to the new; marital bonds formed outside these old values; new power centres being formed as a result of the transformation--all these and more are quietly pinpointed in the wonderful grand finale to a stupendous movie.Truly, a movie's movie",

            "content": "\"The Leopard\" is not only one of the most accomplished films of the twentieth century, but one of the most successful adaptations of a novel to the screen. Rarely has a scenarist so effectively translated the essence of a novel without compromising the source material.This is not to say that anyone should approach the film before the Lambedusa novel. Indeed, this film might well be considered as a companion to the book--the two being almost interdependent.Still, the depth, richness, and complexity that Mr. Visconti achieves here justifies a lengthy treatise in and of itself. Equally important is a familiarity with the social background of the story, a piece of history destined to be lost on not a few Americans. Nonetheless, the viewer is encouraged to familiarize himself with the life, writings and allocutions of Pope Pius IX, (particularly his \"Syllabus of Errors\"), the campaigns of Garibaldi and Mazzini, and the criminal theft of the temporal dominion of the Papacy, effected by a variety of Socialist and Masonic cabals.But back to Mr. Visconti's film: enough good things cannot be said of it. Often, great visual films are compared to paintings and certainly the comparison is most apt here. Each frame seems to breathe a life of its own.One is simply staggered by the beauty of the compositions--each scenic tableaux not only intelligently employs the width of the Cinemascope screen to artistic advantage, but even manages, (as in the case, again, of a great painting) to visually probe the novel's subtext.The casting could not be improved upon. If on paper, Burt Lancaster, seems an odd choice, (what with his Curriculum Vitae brimming with gangsters, cowboys, athletes, and acrobats) he, nonetheless fully realizes both Lambedusa and Visconti's vision, creating a man with the intelligence to see not only his own life ebbing away, but recognizing that the order he embodies, and represents is also simultaneously collapsing.In short, Mr. Lancaster's character personifies nothing short of a tragic loss--the collapse of the noble/aristocratic and chivalric European world order, and, with it, the complex value system, and interdependent mode of decorous deportment that the value system supported, (welcome to the Welfare State, \"progressivist\" social engineering, and the enshrinement of the declasse.) Though her character is tainted with arriviste origins, Claudia Cardinale enchants in her interpretation of Angelica. Note the way Mr. Visconti stages her entrance in one of the film's most memorable sequences. As the family gathers in the salon prior to a small dinner party, an anticipatory rustle signals Angelica's arrival. Framed over and through an oil lamp and spray of daisies, and underscored by a recapitulation of Nino Rota's main theme, she glides through the salon, a vision in cream taffeta, elaborate chignon, and a rose at her bosom, plainly enrapturing and even intimidating the entire party. The pitch and sincerity of her voice and diction as she greets the Prince is a marvel of growing self possession.Miss Cardinale's beauty is of a rare order, and Alain Delon is nearly her match, with a gallantry and swagger that perfectly encapsulate Tancredi. Supporting roles from the Jesuit to Angelica's father are flawless both in type and execution.The ball sequence defies comment. It is truly one of those things, for which the phrase, \"must be seen to be believed\" may be applied. The viewer can almost touch the watered silk swagged drapes, feel the swish of embroidered gowns, taste the flavored ices and blanc manges, and smell the liquored air, a waft with the heady mixture of verbena and attar of roses.When, at the scene's near close, we behold an depleted elderly woman in green silk fanning herself in the far right side of the frame whilst some brave young things continue their exhausted dance, we seem to be viewing a Tissot come to life.And Nino Rota must be complimented on his majestic score, the main theme of which is of heart breaking beauty and tenderness.Ironically, \"The Leopard\" will scarcely find populist appeal in a country for whom MacDonalds, Wallmart, and Oprah appear to provide all that is needed or wished for. No, it is not intended to be accessible to every Tom, Dick or Harry. This would surprise neither Prince Lambedusa or Mr. Visconti.But for those who know better--savor it! \"The Leopard\" seeps into one's pores like a drug, after which it demands to be seen again and again.",

            "content": "For around an hour-and-a-half, you might struggle to see what all the fuss is about, as Visconti's huge, meticulously-devised adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa's novel unfolds at a snail's pace - albeit in sumptuous style. It's not just the slowness, either: there's the convoluted Sicilian politics, and the unwavering focus on Burt Lancaster's prince, a \"vigorous\" adulterer living in opulence as his subjects survive in squalor. But as in a later masterwork where the power games of Sicilians were soundtracked by the incomparable Nino Rota - The Godfather Part II - so the slow-moving, slightly aloof first 90 turns out to have been groundwork, a foundation to be laid so the stunning second half could exist. Then, when the curtain falls, that first section too appears elevated, its events coloured by what has come since: resonant and important, echoing through time.It is 1860 and Sicily - like Italy - is changing, the middle class coming to eclipse the old order. As Lancaster and his impoverished nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) realise, the aristocracy can only survive through compromise, whether that means joining Garibaldi's marauding forces, who are agitating for change, or marrying into the nouveau riche. A chameleon in both the personal and political spheres, Tancredi can ultimately write-off his former comrades as easily as break the heart of the girl who loves him. Lancaster himself, while acting as matchmaker for Delon and the loaded, faintly bawdy Claudia Cardinale, appears to view the new world with quiet detachment. But it's just an act, his facade evaporating behind closed doors in the utterly extraordinary 45-minute ball sequence that ends the film. There he laments the changes, shedding tears for the loss of an age, and for his departed youth.Il Gattopardo is a remarkable movie, loaded with symbolism and significance, while being as far away from the groundbreaking neorealist films that made the director's name as it's possible to be. Well, almost as far. While Senso appeared to completely jettison Visconti's preoccupation with the working classes, he does acknowledge them here, suggesting that the upper classes protected the church and therefore the poor, while the nouveau riche would have no such lofty role. A Marxist and an aristocrat, Visconti oscillated between those apparently contradictory states, drawing heavy fire from left-wing critics after this one for supposedly revealing his true colours. But it seems curious to suggest that a socially-conscious filmmaker should only be allowed to make pictures within a narrow thematic and polemic framework. The world would be a poorer place if Il Gattopardo didn't exist, and no-one could have made it quite like Visconti.Quite aside from its breathtaking ambition, its glorious score and the exquisite cinematography, the movie scores as a human drama, perfectly blending the grandiose and the personal as all great epics do. That's largely down to the acting, much of which is simply superb. Lancaster, Delon and the great French character actor Serge Reggiani are all dubbed, but expertly so, with even Burt acknowledging that the Italian soundtrack essentially completed his performance. Delon, pretty enough to turn even the most macho reviewer a little bit gay (and I am far from being the most macho reviewer), is utterly seductive. Tancredi must draw on charm in his slippery quest for greatness - Delon makes him irresistible. Cardinale too is at the peak of her powers, superbly cast as his swarthy, widely-idolised lover. And Lancaster is towers above all, giving perhaps the most deep and nuanced performance of his illustrious and varied career. Admittedly Rina Morelli is annoying and one-note as his constantly-sobbing wife, but one can't have everything.",

Burt Lancaster, in a bit of unlikely casting (since he couldn't speak Italian and had his entire part dubbed by an Italian actor) represents the aging nobility that recognizes the need for change but at the same time the fact that there will no longer be a place for it in the new order. Lancaster gives a marvelous performance despite the dubbed voice over. As an actor, he was always good at doing resigned nostalgia (see \"Atlantic City\" from 1981).The movie is probably longer than it needs to be, since it doesn't really have much story to tell. But it looks outstanding, thanks to Visconti's meticulous attention to period detail and his use of saturated colors in the film's art direction and costume design. A 45-minute fascinating ball scene caps off the film, and gives the viewer the feeling of being a fly on the wall.Some knowledge of Italian history would probably have helped me to understand this film's nuances more, because Visconti doesn't spend much time catching the uninformed viewer up to speed.

            "content": "This is the story of Don Fabrizio, an aristocratic Prince of Salina in Scily. It takes place in 1860, a turbulent time when there was a nationalistic movement to unify disparate regions and kingdoms to form the country of Italy as we know it today. Don Fabrizio sees that, in the revolutionary spirit of the times, his wealth and land holdings, and indeed his way of life, are destined for dissolution. The Prince is a practical, realistic man and he makes difficult compromises to perpetuate his aristocratic lineage as best he can. Not only is the Prince faced with the threat to his way of life, but also with his own mortality. So, there is an air of melancholy that runs throughout the film.The Criterion Collection set has three DVDs - one containing the subtitled Italian version (with an informative commentary track by Peter Cowie), one containing a dubbed English version, and one containing supplementary material. There is a downside to the dubbing in either version. Burt Lancaster's part is dubbed into Italian in the Italian version, but I found this to be less distracting than others have commented. Lancaster speaks in English in the English version. The English version has about twenty-five minutes cut from the Italian and can serve as the \"before\" of a \"before-and-after\" example of restoration - it has uneven lighting, off colors, blips, and scratches. Compare the first ten minutes of both versions and you will quickly abandon the English version. The Italian version is stunningly restored, I have rarely seen a high-definition image to compare with its picture quality. The costumes and set designs are magnificent. Every scene is a set piece - you could watch this with the sound off and give it a high rating from experiencing the visual beauty alone. How \"The Leopard\" lost to \"Cleopatra\" for an Oscar for best costume design is beyond me. One of the most spectacular scenes, Garibaldi's storming of Palermo, seemed staged in spite of the manifest planning and costume designing that went into it.This may well be Burt Lancaster's best performance; it is subtle, nuanced, and expressive. Alain Delon is perfect to play Don Fabrizio's dashing and ambitious nephew, and Claudia Cardinale has never been more beautiful. Among the supplementary materials is a brief segment containing background historical information. I would suggest that most viewers see that before watching the movie. In fact, even after watching this supplementary segment and doing some brief research, \"The Leopard\" still leaves me a little in the dark as to the details of the complex politics of the time.I first saw this movie in its original English release in 1963 and remember being bored out of my mind. The reason I decided to give it a second chance is due to the consistent praise it has received, and I now understand the basis for such acclaim. I guess there is something to be said for appreciation coming with maturity. And at this time I can better identify with Don Fabrizio's mind-set.",

            "content": "Visconti's Palme d'Or winner in Cannes 1963, a lavishly epic film recounts Italian's royal dignity clashing with the new revolutionary era (triggered by Garibaldi's upheaval), a historic keystone erecting in the base of this ancient country, a superior nobility runs in the blood of its people. Sociologically and psychologically the film rings very true to Italian audience, the specter of a glory's downfall is haunting both Burt Lancaster's Prince of Salina and all the viewers, a condescending compromise with rich merchants is a shrewd move but younger members of the family (Alain Delon's Tancredi Falconeri, the nephew of the prince) have descended into some sort of opportunists, the society lumbers everyone with the inexorable progress, which is set stubbornly to alter each individual's destiny. There are bountiful enchanting parts in the film, particularly with which Visconti are adept at, the maze palace, the opulent banquet and ballroom dancing, nostalgically right pitches to soft spot of evocation, but the siege section is risible and inane, out of his comfort zone, Visconti has to condemn his wealthy backdrop to impede his vision of the true brutality of warfare. The cast is no more showy than the settings and the costumes, Burt Lancaster laboriously portrays his character with contrived sentiment which is too unrealistic to be credible, Alan Delon and Claudia Cardinale are poised concretely as eye-candies, along with other numerous sidekicks (including a dashing Terence Hill, whose name was still Mario Girotti then), whom one could almost assume as hollow and detached as any walking-dead. Nevertheless, THE LEOPARD cannot be bypassed in the history of films, its the summit of Visconti's career (arguable LUDWIG 1972, which also obtain an 8/10 rating, occupies my predilection), and its solemn beauty is undeniable.",

            "content": "In 1860 Garibaldi and his volunteers conquered Sicily, defeating the Bourbons and setting the stage for Italian unification. In The Leopard, Visconti's adaptation of a great Italian novel, a noble Sicilian family, led by pater familias Don Fabrizio Salina (Burt Lancaster), faces this crucial event and its aftermath.The film is impeccable, gorgeously shot with a great eye for colors, lighting and composition, luscious costumes and set design, a marvellous soundtrack by Nino Rota.In one of the great examples of serendipitous casting in cinema history, Burt Lancaster was imposed upon Visconti by the production, much to the director's distrust: it turned out to be the best performance of Lancaster's career, as he perfectly embodied proud, educated, fiery, sensual Prince Fabrizio. Alain Delon plays his nephew Tancredi, the happy-go-lucky youngster who falls for beautiful social climber Angelica (a young and radiant Claudia Cardinale), daughter of nouveau riche Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa). Every supporting performance is gold, with my favorite probably being Romolo Valli as keen, quietly disapproving priest Padre Pirrone.The Leopard is about the entropic dissolution of life - rituals and divertissements like the famous ballroom scene are the last moments of a dying breed which is either desperately trying to adapt to a new world or tragically oblivious to it. With a sensitivity worthy of Tolstoy, the novel and the movie follow Fabrizio, torn between his intense physicality and a painful understanding of time running out for both himself and his class. The last waltz is for death itself.\"We were the leopards, the lions, those who take our place will be jackals and sheep, and the whole lot of us - leopards, lions, jackals and sheep - will continue to think ourselves the salt of the earth.\"10/10",

            "content": "Luchino Visconti was the last scion of the Visconti di Modrone family, one of the oldest and richest families in Italy. He was also a lifelong member of the Communist party, whose first major masterpiece, LA TERRA TREMA is one of the harshest and most compassionate films about the lives of Sicilian fishermen, which was furthermore shot in the Sicilian dialect and released in Northern Italy with the appropriate subtitles. Andre Bazin noted that the fishermen of that film seemed imbued with the nobility of Renaissance Princes. As an artist, Visconti was like his greatest character, Prince Fabrizio, \"straddling two worlds and not comfortable in either.\" \"The Leopard\" is set in the period of the Risorgimento, the Re-Unification of Italy. It was in this period that a group of principalities and isolated city-states grouped together to form a single nation, the Modern Italy more or less as it exists today. The film is however set in Sicily, the small island situated below the toes of the Giant Boot of Italy. A small island that in centuries was invaded and conquered by foreign nations and rulers and never had a say in the running of it's land. The promise of \"being a free state in a free country\", articulated by the Chevalley(Leslie French), is for the Sicilians, too late or not enough, when they are charitable or merely the latest in a long line of outsider powers ruling the small region of golden fields and beautiful mountains that is uncaring of the problems of the people or the Salina family.In the middle of this turmoil is Don Fabrizio Corbera, the Prince of Salina. A fictional aristocrat modeled in part on the grandfather of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. As incarnated by Burt Lancaster, Salina is a man of great presence and intelligence, he claims he is 45 but realizes at once that he is already very old when he learns that his daughter Conchetta is in love with his nephew Tancredi Falconeri(Alain Delon). He realizes that his daughter is no match for the ambitious and handsome nephew and that all his family has left is a name and fading splendor but no money at all. However Anjelica Sedara(Claudia Cardinale) is a Goddess and her father is as rich and upwardly mobile as he is crass and vulgar.IL GATTOPARDO is a film that deals with the birth of the Middle Class. 19th Century Europe witnesses the slow disintegration of the aristocratic families and the arrival of the middle-class mercantile consumerist faction in it's wake. The film more importantly shows this process, gradually and symbolically but also precisely rendering the machinations in detail. Dozens of films can recreate history by simply play-acting an event, it's another thing to show it as a process. This is one of the great achievements of Visconti. The middle-class, the bourgeoisie will take power but it can do so step by step. First it supports a peasant-led popular revolution only to compromise it, then it accepts democracy only to sabotage it, and then through marriage establishing itself as the chief ruling class of a nation giving the old Leopards a shiny new cage in a stately zoo, in effect allowing the aristocracy to survive as the walking dead.Released in 1963, Visconti's film must have felt a little incongruous. A big international production on a scale not seen since the commercial disaster of Ophuls' LOLA MONTES, an adaptation of a respected literary source and starring popular international stars - Lancaster, Delon, Cardinale. This was the period of the French New Wave of Modern Italian cinema as embodied in Antonioni and Fellini(Cardinale in fact went back and forth between this film and 8 1/2, essentially in two separate solar systems). Yet Visconti's film could not be conceivable any other way. A film about the dying aristocracy, this film is also about the classical tradition embodied in that culture which is slowly disappearing and which Visconti, despite being a progressive, was a product of.So THE LEOPARD is also self-reflexive about it's own style and mode of storytelling, yet the ending of the film is also vastly more different and more richer than that of the novel that it takes as a source. The novel written by a cynical aristocrat dilettante is a work of great emotions the chief being nostalgia for the old ways. This nostalgia is tossed out by Visconti, alongside its shameless misogyny. In the transaction the characters are richer and deeper than their literary forebears.Visconti put his entire heart and soul into THE LEOPARD. You will never see widescreen and colour used as powerfully in all of cinema as it is used in this film. Light, colour, camera movement and the movement of the actors is choreographed in a single whole, the framing has a depth of field that is unparalleled in film history, comparable only to the works of Welles, Ophuls and Mizoguchi. This is a true spectacle - rich and grand, yet personal and intimate.",

It is also a film that is enjoyable to watch and specifically delve into the details and psychology of the characters.The story centers around a descendant of the Sicilian nobility who faces the new revolutionary times of the mid-19th century which saw the ascendancy of the bourgeoisie as well as the formation of the modern Italian state. The prince acted by Burt Lancaster in the best role of his career understands the winds of change and tries to adapt economically and socially to the new epoch, while deploring the decay of the morals and the passing of time measured by his own aging.It's such a complex and well made movie that words are difficult to be used to describe. Watch the extraordinary setting of the movie with decrepit castles and shining ballrooms, best try to see the film in a theater or at least on a big screen as there are many scenes with tens of characters, each acting wonderfully and having a role of themselves in a complex setting reminding big Flemish masters paintings. Follow the wonderful acting, not only of Lancaster but also of the mega-stars of the 60s Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale, at the pick of their physical beauty.

            "content": "There are some superstars whose work remains timeless, seemingly ahead of their times in many ways. American acting legend Burt Lancaster was a dark and brooding Everyman who could reach the audience's heart, even in the most seemingly sinister of roles. He could add a twist into the characterizations of the darkest of men and make them suddenly identifiable. Actors like Lancaster, Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando were a refreshing change as America exited the war years into a dark domestic period and lead the way for modern cinema as we know now.Veterans by the 1960's, these actors kept their artistic ideals alive by becoming in international celebrities, working in Europe as well as in Hollywood, and \"The Leopard\" is Lancaster's masterpiece of what was driving early 60's cinema, telling old fashioned stories in different ways and adding a touch of class in the way they were told outside the American studio system. Whether you decide to watch this in Italian or in English, you will be enchanted by the beauty in which the story of how these Italian aristocrats adapt to change. Lancaster is the family patriarch, a charming but powerful baron who can be kindly and charming one moment but vicious and domineering the next. He gets pretty much what he wants from his family, and it is apparent that he is both admired and feared, thus a commanding presence rather than demanding.The extremely handsome Alain Delon is marvelous as Lancaster's free spirited nephew, scandalous in his determination to marry only the woman he loves, and rather shocking in his verbose demeanor. Pretty much the rest of the actors outside of Lancaster speak in Italian and are dubbed in the English language version, which I chose for my first viewing of the film just to hear Lancaster's voice in his native English. I bet this is sumptuous to watch on a big screen, and I wouldn't hesitate to spend three hours reading subtitles to catch every glorious detail put out by director Luchino Viscoti.",

            "content": "Widely regarded as Luchino Visconti's finest achievement as a film director, The Leopard (also known as II Gattopardo) quite rightly deserves the critical acclaim it has accrued since its release in 1963. A period piece set in the mid-1800s Sicily where political and social upheavals were threatening to overwhelm the established aristocratic order, The Leopard accounts for the tumultuous events that foreshadow the decline of aristocracy in Italy. At three hours in length, the film is distinctively broken into three parts, with the final act most unforgettable.The film unfolds from the perspective of Prince Don Fabrizio Salina (Burt Lancaster), a man who with his mannerism and speech exemplifies the ideals that aristocrats seek. Yet he remains uniquely pragmatic, understanding the fact that his caste would one day lose their power and influence. He knows that day is nearing, bringing his entire family to a safer location in search for peace and security. The first part of the film introduces us to its numerous characters. After which, they transit to a new place that would not only become the setting for the second act, but also marking the first appearance of arguably the silver screen's most beautiful woman \u2013 Claudia Cardinale.Cardinale plays Angelica, the daughter of a local mayor who is about to be married to Prince Salina's nephew. The moment she appears on screen, there is no reason not to let out a soft gasp. She steals the screen with her breathtaking beauty, transfixing us every second she is on. Visconti tempts us by using Cardinale sparingly in the second act, but he fully unveils her beauty in a glorious white wedding gown in the last act \u2013 a grandeur party only for the very, very rich that makes up the film's last hour.This is where Visconti is admired greatly for his direction. With economical editing and a moving camera, the whole act immerses us, for better or worse, into the lives of these people as they have sumptuous dinner, dress in elaborate costumes, and dance with partners in waltzes. Such is the extraordinary opulence that it remains a wonder how Visconti managed to convince his financial backers to cough up enough dough to not only pay for the expensive props and lights, but also the hundreds of extras and their elaborate costumes.There are several moments of lengthy dialogue in The Leopard that may bore viewers, but most of the film remains oddly humorous, especially of the relationship between Prince Salina and Father Pirrone (Romolo Valli), a bubbly priest who lives with his family. Nino Rota's lush, strings-heavy score fades in and out like a soft, gentle wind, accompanying the primarily bright cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno. While I rate Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) as the pinnacle of the epic costume drama genre, The Leopard is still a magnificent effort from one of Italy's great directors.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",

            "content": "To make a long story (187 minutes) short, Burt Lancaster is the leopard of the title, a Sicilian aristocrat of 1860, who watches the world change around him. There was a revolution in Sicily in 1860, too, with the rebels led by Garibaldi trying to unite Italy at the expense of the local nobility like Lancaster. He's disturbed by it all. And why shouldn't he be? For God's sake, they want to substitute the Italian tricolor flag we're familiar with today -- green, white, and red -- for Lancaster's family flag -- white with a golden lily. That's HIS flag, man, and he doesn't want to see it replaced with some rag representing the hoi polloi. And on top of that, he's middle-aged and seems to be growing more obsolescent by the day.Visconti wanted an all-Italian cast and evidently made it clear to Lancaster that he didn't fit the role. An argument ensued, after which the two got along much better, or seemed to. This was an epic movie and a lot of money was at stake.It must be said that Lancaster is figure instead of ground. He stands out if only because of his bushy hair and impressive mutton chop whiskers. But it must also be said that it sounds queer to hear Italian coming from Burt Lancaster's New York bred speech organs, especially when it's someone else's voice. He really doesn't have that much to say. He's taciturn, gruff, commanding, aloof.Yet he has one memorable scene. Everyone in this movie is concerned with appearances. They're always stopping in front of a mirror and patting their faces with a handkerchief, or smoothing out their mustache or something, ladies and gents alike. Towards the end, Lancaster stops in front of a mirror and stares at his own face for a long time. His features are expressionless. He seems to be looking into another temporal sphere -- the past or the future -- and his eyes water as the tiny rivulet of a tear becomes barely perceptible on his rough cheek.There's some humor too. Not much. All of these tiny Sicilian villages seem to have a raggedy band ready to play as the prince's entourage enters the town, and all the bands, maybe a dozen men all together, seem to feature not one but three tubas. Now, a tuba is a preposterous instrument to begin with, and to have three of them flatulating and burping along behind a pompous march is funny in itself, a perfect score for a silent Charlie Chaplin comedy.Then there's a scene in which a cheerfully corrupt mayor is reading out the fake results of an election. (Lancaster kept his vote open and everybody's vote was counted the same.) The wind keeps blowing out the candles and the band begins to play, on and off, and he turns red with exasperation while trying to keep up a proud front.Visconti makes good use of the wide screen. Each frame looks like a colorful painting. But it's long, and the themes are mostly understated. You have to pay attention. It could have profitably been chopped by twenty minutes or so.",

With mutton chops beard and careful bearing, Lancaster is very much the Leopard, slyly shifting alliances when it's to his advantage. That's why his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Alain Delon) is so likable to him, a young leopard certain to earn his own place.This is more a film of character and theme, taking its time to show the contrasts between rich and poor, young and old.

He marries his nephew, Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon) to the daughter of a nouveau riche mayor (Claudia Cardinale), who should infuse fresh blood into an old bloodline threatened with extinction: the alliance between \"the Leopard\" and \"the Jackal\" exemplifies the blend between old and new. The collector's box of this film includes an interview with Alain Delon who, in retrospect, claims that Visconti had almost played the role of prince Salina himself, given the analogies between the two characters. Like Salina, Visconti preoccupied himself with questions of disappearing social class and transience. Beyond the splendour and revelry in his films always lies a dark horizon, the imminence of death, whose premonitory signs are perceived everywhere. The closing marriage scene is a lamenting farewell to vanishing beauty. Awesome Burt Lancaster in tuxedo looks into the mirror and tears well up in his eyes. Outside, a coffin is brought out. Majestic grandeur and striking dignity intertwine with elegiac melancholy, grief and regret. The perfect illustration of Friedrich Schiller's definition of tragedy: \"Tragedy is not synonymous with suffering. Rather, tragedy is the futile protest of the individual against inevitable suffering\". Delon claims that today he finds himself unable to watch the film, which evokes memories and images from a world long since forgotten, let alone listen to the soundtrack, \"qui me fait pleurer\"...",

Knowing Burt Lancaster's rich voice and seeing his lips move to some Italian actor dubbing him (the same applying to Alain Delon) costs my rating a star. Apart from that, it is a visually lush, superbly photographed, acted, and choreographed work directed by the great Luchino Visconti. It boasts perhaps the longest and most famous ballroom sequence in the history of the cinema, some well choreographed street battles, and it does a convincing period reconstruction job.Delon and Cardinale are breathtakingly beautiful, but under the surface they are driven by greed and other designs that reflect the cracks in the outward grandeur, splendor and beauty of the aristocracy in Sicily just before its demise. The leopard of the title, Prince Salina (Lancaster), is \"straddled over two worlds and cannot leave either\" - ultimately, he cannot change his spots, and must accept fate with what nobility, grace and dignity he can muster. And he does.Lancaster's role is generally regarded as one of his career's best, possibly supplanted only by his far smaller, and more cynical, part in \"Atlantic City\" and - a personal choice - his role in \"Trapeze\". Only a great visionary like Visconti could have sensed in the American symbol, mostly used as gunfighter in Westerns or a pirate in swashbucklers, Lancaster, the potential to play a Sicilian aristocrat. It is to Visconti's, and Lancaster's, credit that the latter imbues his performance with a perception, a sense of belonging, that perhaps few expected at the time, and even now leaves me wondering at the marvel and mimetic depth of human talent.Visconti's careful, sensitive and well-informed direction ultimately unites this rather long work, giving it a magnificence that even the best Hollywood-produced epics found hard to convey.It is a masterpiece one should see at least once in this life.",

The realization of the society as seen through the prince's extended family and his marvelous estate makes this film unbelievably intricate and fascinating. Though some may say it's a bit slow moving, the director Luchino Visconti, seemed to want us to enjoy each scene enough to let them play out in their entirety. Add in the most attractive Claudia Cardinale as the daughter of a peasant who's made it big and now represents the new money, as opposed to the old, who's set to marry into the prince's family through her engagement to Delon, and the film really starts to take off. Lancaster is still a good looking guy, and his waltz with Cardinale at this ball that lasts for more or less the last third of the film, knocks everyone out.

As a result of a film of practically no action, there are some battle scenes in the first part but that is all, showing mainly trivial pursuits and concerns of the Prince and his closest of kin, we have a very meditative and almost philosophical film of a very noble resignation. The book is of the same character. It was the author's only novel, left unpublished until after his death, it is a slow and meditative account of sentiments and feelings and impressions of an old aristocracy losing its influence and social establishment, with a deep melancholy and yearning for the release of death constantly accelerating during the course of the account, while the Prince never dies. At the same time it is a stupendous tribute to the way of life of this aristocracy, accentuated by the 40 minutes long ball scene concluding the film, undoubtedly the greatest ball scene in cinema history. It is also perhaps the most interesting character part Burt Lancaster ever made, his princely stature is impeccably convincing in nobility and elevation, which is consistently sustained to the end, which is no end. The whole film is also an unsurpassed masterpiece of beauty, beauty being the dominating element of the film, every scene being imbued with beauty. I doubt that a nobler film was ever made.",

            "content": "The version of \"Il Gattopardo\" I saw was the one on the Fox Movie Channel. Running about 180 minutes, it contained what appeard to be a rather strange blend of languages.  In a single scene, two characters would be conversing in two different mediums, with lip movements not in synch with the English soundtrack.  Some of Delon's lips didn't match up either, to the extent that I'm not even sure it was his own voice being heard.  Lancaster's English-speaking voice was pretty much his own, but a number of others were obviously dubbed.  This didn't help the viewer get closer to characters that were already rather aloof.Cut down from its original 205-minutes, one was conscious that something was missing here.  Lengthy talks about politics and war of the 1800s are not exactly all that relevant today, no matter how painstakingly accurate its historicity may be. Too, viewing this film letterboxed on a 27-inch monitor, one longs for an experience in a movie house, to see the film as Visconti truly intended.  \nFortunately, I saw the film in such a setting some years ago, and it made an indelible impression.  I too long for a bona fide uncut print, with its original soundtrack. However, I'm pretty convinced that even a restored DVD version won't do justice to Visconti's great canvas.  This film requires large screen viewing to make its full impact.  \"Il Gattopardo\" seems to have built up quite a loyal following.  It's time some enterprising production company assumed the task of a full-scale restorative revivial of this near-legendary classic.",

It looks incredible. The film is in rich color with absolutely breath-taking settings. I have never seen such beautiful color cinematography! There's also a great music score by Nino Rota which perfectly matches the images. The story is long and drags at times (a sequence between Tancredi and Angelica in a deserted mansion should have been cut) but I was never really bored. There was ALWAYS something to look at. The acting varies. Delon was a little too lightweight for this role but Cardinale was good. Best of all was Lancaster. He's dubbed but is magnificent. His face perfectly shows what his character is going through. This is an Academy Award winning performance. So very long but never dull. Just incredible. A true classic!",

            "content": "Some films, sometimes, seem to emerge primarily from the urge to create the most sensual, beautiful spaces and then putting characters there to live and inhabit, explore and reveal those spaces. Kubrick's \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975), Bergman's \"Fanny och Alexander\" (1982), Tarkovsky's \"Nostalghia\" (1983), Zhang's \"Da hong deng long gao gao gua\" (1991), and many films by Greenaway come to mind as pinnacles of this modus operandi, or whatever one might call it. Then, Visconti's \"Il gattopardo\" (1963), of course.To think this is my first Visconti! I don't know about you, but for me this is the perfect start. I steered away from this film for a long time, not out of spite but out of energy and commitment. I've had enough bad experiences (read: dull, monotonous) with films that are not only masterful but could've appealed to me had I been patient enough not to rush to them. At worst these things take years to repair.While in my mind the visual side of the film speaks to me the most, the characterizations are as superb as one could conceivably hope for. Here even the most rudimentary knowledge of the historic period in question helps a great deal \u2013\u00a0so it happens that I'm very much into Italian history, not least because I've studied the language and culture and lived there for a while. But all the history and politics bring me back to a central theme that I love in all storytelling: characters playing parts, some involuntarily bestowed, others voluntarily taken on. And is there a stronger sense of pretense and inevitable clash of \"interpreting\" these given roles than in clear class-related structures? Everyone in the film plays a role, some with more conviction than others, some with more relish, but all of them contribute to a growing crescendo of submerged tension, intensifying towards an inevitable release. Some players are silent observers, some take on appearances and speak (sometimes still saying nothing at all), and Visconti indubitably seems to relish the underlying comedy. Lancaster is justifiably lauded for his performance. Considering he's working with and appears alongside Cardinale and Delon who both have strong magnetism, he towers over everyone with a presence that's inescapable, palpably human and visceral. He lights up the screen every time he enters, and the air around him almost vibrates. He is the point of reference not only for us but for everyone in the film, as his character should be.The film takes a lot of work. It's languid, demanding, but for the most part rewarding. The final 45 minutes are transcendental, where everything and everyone is brought together. Leopards and lions, jackals and sheep. Longing beyond one's own life, love beyond one's death. Perceived change from up close, immobility as seen from afar, just like the stars gazed at towards the very end.",

He is a Leopard of the title, and these are his words, \"The leopards and lions are being replaced by jackals and hyenas ... and they all think they're the salt of the earth.\" Lancaster is one of reasons I loved the film so much.The film also features two of my favorite actors, young Alain Delon who played Salina's favorite nephew, Tancredi, and heavenly beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Angelica, Tancredi's beloved.Each moment and each frame of the film are breathtaking, and the final act, an hour-long ballroom extravaganza, ranks among the grandest cinematic set pieces of all time.9.5/10",

The first hour is interminable, with perhaps one of the largest, and most listless battle scenes ever caught on film.When Visconti moves away from his uneven 1st hour, and his failed attempt to film the anarchy of the revolution, and gets back into personal relationships, his specialty, the film picks up.While it never attains the sumptuous, wrenching power of Visconti's black and white Neo-Realistic masterpieces, such as the absolutely harrowing and brilliant ROCCO AND HIS THREE BROTHERS (also starring Alain Delon), it has moments of subtle satire, and dripping beauty. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the return of the Noble family, after the revolution.They come back to the town that has moved on, and they sit in church surrounded by people making a new destiny, the masses full of life and energy, and the Leopard and his family by comparison are dusty relics, looking mutely on, as the world leaves them behind, A brilliant visual moment.However there are too few of those moments to sustain the films length. And much like the nobles it details, the film (mostly about indulgence and boredom) winds slowly down, slowly, like a tired machine. And finally, mercifully... stops. An interesting flawed film, far from great, far from the director's best, and not one I'd want to sit through again. ** out of ****.",

            "content": "Il Gattopardo is one of the greatest achievements in film-making! It's original entry in the US was poorly met as it was heavily edited despite winning at the Cannes Film Festival. Based on the historical novel of the same name by Guiseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, it has been compared to Gone with the Wind. Actually it is much better in many ways. It is about historical characters (I actually met and dined with one of the descendents in Sicily years ago) who come to life with accurate portrayal. Burt Lancaster fits the Prince's role very well. He commands the stage with a princely demeanor. It is, he once said, his best role. But perhaps better in terms of accurate portrayal is Claudia Cardinale's Angelica. She had to avoid the sun and wore a ridiculously tight corset (she didn't complain to Visconti that she actually was bleeding) to match the historical Angelica Sadara inch for inch. Her entry is one of the defining moments in cinema and if you knew (from the book) she was on the edge of a breakdown, you could swear you saw it on Cardinale's face. The film pays such much attention to details as when after the voting is met, drinks arranged in the Italian tricolore are used in toasting the celebration. The palaces are accurate and the last grand ball (45 minutes) was conducted late in the Sicilian night with extras -- many of whom represent the real Sicilian nobility -- in real costumes. The film and book are commentaries on the end of the old era and the entrance of the risorgimento and the reppublica. I do recommend reading the book to check out the attention to details. When you read the book, you will marvel and appreciate the film even more. I think many Americans cannot appreciate the historical perspective since they are unfamiliar. The Leopard, or the Prince, acknowledges his decline, the arrival of the new rich and arranges to marry off the dashing Tancredi to the coarser class, represented by Angelica Sedara. Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon are the most beautiful pairing in cinema history, not unlike Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable or more recently Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas in the inferior but fun, Mask of Zorro (actually, as Antonio said, Catherine is very similar to Claudia in many ways). The score by Nino Rota is stunning and as good as his score from the Godfather trilogy but less recognized. This film is not only Director Luchino Visconti's masterpiece but equally cinematographer Guiseppe Rotunno's crowning achievement. Films may never be made like this again. If you get to watch this on a big silver screen (not just HD TV), you will rate it a 10. Criterion Collection recently produced a beautiful DVD version of the film.",

            "content": "Luchino Visconti's film The Leopard is about the death of the aristocratic way of life in Italy and is set during the time Garibaldi was attempting to unify the country. The aristocrats are embodied by Prince Salina (an excellent Burt Lancaster with a difficult role) the patriarch of a family in decline. Although the Marxist Visconti wasn't entirely sympathetic to the aristocrats, he allows Salina to be shown as a good man who is powerless to stem the tide of history. Salina is aware that the rulers of his homeland have been doing a lousy job of governing; he sadly comments on the contrast between the extravagant palace that he lives and the squalor all around. That even this palace looks to be in a state of disrepair only serves to emphasize the sad state of things. Still, he doesn't see the future as being any brighter: he compares himself and his peers to powerful, dignified leopards and his heirs apparent to sneaking, slovenly jackals.Salina and his ideals have been bred into him, he can no more change his ways than the leopard can change its spots. He is in sharp contrast to Tancredi Falconeri, his opportunistic nephew, who joins Garibaldi's army when they seem unstoppable but quickly changes sides when their luck turns. In a humorous scene he fails to mention his change in allegiance until his uncle asks him why his uniform is a different color. Since the family's fortune is in decline Falconeri can't follow in the family tradition and marry his first cousin (Salina's daughter) and is instead forced to marry the beautiful daughter of a low class but newly rich minor public official. A marriage of convenience is of course anathema to Salina but he has no choice in the matter.In spite of its 3 hour + running time and a fairly thin plot The Leopard is quite a captivating film. This is in no small part due to the amazing visuals; The Leopard exhibits Visconti's mastery of composition throughout, particularly in the exterior scenes. The acting is also uniformly excellent and the theme is expressed with that rare mix of subtlety and clarity. In spite of my general dislike of costume dramas I found The Leopard to be an essential film.",

While recognizing that reality, he nevertheless maintains his life-style, right to the end: the compelling ballroom scene in his grandiose home. But while maintaining his traditional ways, he not only accepts but admires his nephew Tancredi, who has joined Garibaldi's forces.Several things about this film stand out: *Burt Lancaster's magnificent performance, one of the best of his career. Lancaster speaks in English but it is his face and his bearing that makes this performance. His dignity and realistic self-awareness, conveyed masterfully by actor, director, and scenarists, makes this film as much a character study as it is a historical epic. (The young Alain Delon is a wonderful, animated contrast as Don Fabrizio's nephew.) *The look of the movie, atypical for Visconti, whose membership in the \"Realismo\" school was entrenched by 1963. Not only is the film in color, but it is DRENCHED in color.*The SOUND of the movie. Not only the wonderful ballroom scene and Nino Rota's beautiful series of dances, but the dramatic Rota score.*The ballroom scene, its look, sound, and the culmination of the movie's majestic story. This scene was butchered by editing when the Leopard was released in the US, leading Visconti to disown the American print. Not until Francis Coppola helped restore the ballroom scene in a newly-minted print did American audiences get to see the real movie.The movie re-debuted in New York, with screenwriter Suso Cecchi D'Amico present as Coppola's guest of honor. If you watch Il Gattopardo, make sure you see this print.And make sure of one other thing: This movie is long, and so is the ballroom scene, so it's best seen by letting the film watch over you rather than wondering what happens next.

            "content": "I know I'm probably going to make many disagree with my views of this fine film but that is what opinion is all about. First, let's start off with the novel. It is wonderful, long and full of the zest and color of the end of an era of Sicilian life and the beginning of the modern Italian realities. I highly recommend people to read it and then watch the film again. Of course it is almost always said that the novels which inspire movies are generally superior to the visual representation. In this case, alas, it is true. This is not to say that I felt that Visconti failed or that this is not an important film.I was not happy with a few things in this film. The script clipped off the latter part of the Counts life and I could not really understand that choice. For me, the way Visconti ended the film appeared too mannered with a tinge of the romantic. The count of the book in my minds eye would not have gone out on such a limp note. I keep hearing in my mind the Dylan Thomas lines \"....rage, rage against the dying of the light\". This is what the count embodied, even though he was not volcanic and over wrought in his countenance. The fight against his aging was all internal. In this respect, the great American actor Bert Lancaster was a perfect choice and he does not disappoint. Even though the version I saw last night, a newly printed and crystal clear one, was entirely dubbed in Italian and was about 3 hours long, Lancaster's body language carried through even though his famous voice was not there.To finish with my comments about the book, it portrays more of the sense of the passing of the era than the film did. What almost all commentators mention is the very long ball scene that closes out the film. On a positive note, the ball is incredible to watch. The many people fill the screen with a splash of colors, seen against a fabulous mansion, dripping with opulence and wealth. What grated on my nerves after a while was the constant repetition of the same waltz themes. I mean, really, this was not great music and to be forced to listen to it over and over again was a bit much for me. What was worse was the feeling that this music was probably not from that time period. I was reminded of two other films that got carried away with a scene and both were dances at parties. The famous wedding scene in \"The Deer Hunter\" and the party scene in \"Heaven's Gate\". Both films see the director (same guy: Michael Camino) strutting his stuff just a bit too much for my tastes. Both scenes seem to go on forever and could have been just fine with half the time allotted to the screen. Like this, Visconti was flexing his muscles and the party, with all it's bustling activity, became something of a three ring circus after a while, with the Count trying to come to grips with his discomfort. We expect him to pass out any minute but he rallies and dances like a young man, impressing all and making his son jealous. Quite an accomplishment for the old leopard. The book reveals the Count's much more passionate sexual desire for his about to be daughter in law. Perhaps Visconti just could not portray that in the world of 1963? I'm sorry, but I tend to desire more simplicity and minimal exposition; this film is overly indulgent of it's joys, its women, heavily fanning themselves in what must have been a sauna steam bath heat, everyone dressed to impress.I lament that Visconti did not turn his considerable talents to fleshing out more of the closing chapters of the book. I also lament not hearing that fine Lancaster voice. The dubbing has its own problems; I mean, what could they have done? Put in Lancaster in English and then have everyone else speak English? It would have been terrible. The inevitable solution of dubbing him into Italian was bound to annoy English audiences but that's what we have.This is a really fine but too long film that could have stayed closer to the books path.",

            "content": "\"The Leopard\", Golden Palm winner of 1963, might have the prestigious look and feel of a big-budget historical drama, confidently directed by veteran Luchino Visconti and sublimated by the melodies of Nino Rota... and yes, to some degree, it can be regarded as an Italian equivalent to \"Gone With the Wind\". But it's within the resignation not the determination of its main character that we find the soul of the film.\n Indeed, for a story supposed to be about historical upheavals and political turmoil, \"The Leopard\" is remarkably static and stoic. This owes a lot to the performance of Burt Lancaster as Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, he carries both the codified solemn authority of a man of his rank and the poignant vulnerability of a man at the nadir of his splendor, belonging to a chapter of Italy's history whose pages are soon to be turned. We're in 1860 when Garibaldi's troops are dethroning the then-ruling Bourbons in Sicily. Salina might be a leopard but an endangered species in that particular context.\n Yet \"The Leopard\" isn't much a character study, the film is adapted from Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel of the same name, centering on the decay of the old aristocratic system. And without reading the book, I guess it carries the same resonance in Italy as Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\". I suspect the book starts with magnificent descriptions of all the lavish vegetation that graces the landscape, the natural sprays that float over the warm sky of Sicily, among them the breeze of modernity coming from the continent. And I suspect the film while not absolutely flawless does justice to the novel.\n Yet what a bizarrely quiet journey, we're getting prepared to a downfall... that never occurs. The film is very much about the way Sicily was under the noble rulers before the Unification of Italy under the King but isn't much interested in the future. But it's easy to miss that we're witnessing one of the first glimpses of the Island's unique beauty before \"The Godfather\" would give the most vibrant homage. History and locations are constant markers of the film but trust our knowledge a little too much. \"The Leopard\" might be too difficult for most viewers and maybe a little introduction about the context wouldn't have hurt the film or at least, a few geographical notes.\n And despite some very well-choreographed battle scenes, war always seems distant, as contemplated from the passive perspective of the Salinas who just idly move from one palace to another, the heirs enjoying the bucolic lifestyle while the patriarch can exchange a few quips with his priest (Mario Girotti) and a few heated political gossips with his hunting companion (Serge Reggiani). The dialogues go from minimalist to passionate, superficial to subtle, but to those who don't pay much attention to politics, the highlight of these conversations is in the body language, the way they indirectly establish that the Prince still inspires respect and a servile attitude (sometimes the corniest) proving that nothing had changed as far as he's concenred. The best thing about Lancaster is that he plays a man talking about losing his power while always being powerful.\n So what we have is a film that works in two paces, it is history in motion and a cross-country travel yet strangely motionless, it's as puzzling and beautiful as one of these mechanically arranged ballroom waltzes. The Prince is one of these paradoxes the silver screen is enamored with, in one of his best scenes, he's asked by the priest to confess his sins but there are limits the Prince can't tolerate, like searing seven children from a woman without ever seeing her navel. The Prince is a man of life, love and passion and the fading of his aura just coincided with the Italy he knew, but having to endure his petite Devout catholic nagging and whining wife is one blow to his manhood he can't have.\n But the story would have been quite austere if it wasn't for the additions of two more high-spirted characters: Tancredi, played by the distractingly handsome Alain Delon and Anjelica, the daughter of an opportunistic mayor, played by the exquisite Claudia Cardinale. Tancredi is an ambitious go-getter who fights for either army depending on his interest but with such charisma it reveals the level of ambition so severely lacking in the Prince's progeny. The parallel between the two men isn't just highlighted by their relationship but the way they instantly feel the same lust toward the same woman... a gilded cage is something \"The Leopard\" can consent to... but losing his paws?\n Luchino Visconti was a descendant of this Sicilian nobility yet refused to play the titular part although everyone acknowledged his regal persona. Burt Lancaster was picked so the film could get the necessary banking from Hollywood and I thought he gave a presence to the film, he's charming, charismatic and can turn from intimidating to friendly in one simple grin, he's accessible like an old friend but sacred like an old relic we venerate out of habit. But he's also a pragmatic man who understands that all the prestige of the world can't do without money and even marriage can turn into financial bargain, the end justifying the means. Aren't we after all in the country that gave Machiavelli?\n All these torments pinnacle in the iconic ballroom sequence, which is as long as the wedding opening in \"The Godfather\" and culminates with the same inter-generational dance, but what a moment! By having a final waltz with the beautiful Anjelica, we see a rebirth for the Prince, a rejuvenating shoot before finally surrendering to the march of time, more ruthless and permanent than any conquest or invasion... but still using a party as an opportunity to tie bonds and take decisions (like \"The Godfather\") not much have changed for Sicilian traditions... and if it's any consolation, the Leopard was right!",

In Luchino Visconti's 1963 masterpiece 'Il Gattopardo' we see a wealthy prince (played by Burt Lancaster who were later dubbed to Italian) who reflects upon the political changes that his country experiences, he has the insight and understanding to cooperate and uses his power in an deliberate way. Although I experienced a certain distance between me and the true core of the film, I were certainly overwhelmed by the beauty and intelligence of it. Shot masterly by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno whose pictures is beautifully composed with Nino Rota's luxuriant score, the film has got a underlying emotional power that's only truly apparent in small bursts of the film. And there's a feminine quality to the surroundings, the country's culture and the characters' make-up and costume that holds measure with Visconti's great stylistic drama. The perfect casting, and their dialog combine aristocratic devotion and political insight, but also deepened emotion that shackles the third act, which features the famous and absolutely fabulous balldance.",

As long as the film is, I would recommend pausing it occasionally to appreciate the lighting, costuming, dramatic scenes, and faces, for it is like going through an art gallery of 19th century genre paintings. Not surprisingly, the main character played by Burt Lancaster does much of his reflection standing in front of works of art, and the visual assault of ball scene makes the viewer feel the same dizziness and disorientation that this former social leopard feels. Expecting a work of neo-realism, a la The Bicycle Thief, I found the film hard to get into at first, especially as I grasped at the straws of knowledge of Italian history available to me. A modern American viewer indeed would need a short background history to be able to get into the film's majestic flow. As masterfully as the actors play their parts (Burt Lancaster is a visual lion, if not an animal leopard; Claudia Cardinale stunning and earthy, Alain Delon roguishly charming), it is the ways in which they are caught in the sweep of history that move the film forward. Visconti harmonizes all the elements in such a way that I really felt the need to review the film over and over in my mind, if not on screen. The role of Catholicism frames the film, the intricacies of class intrude in many ways. It is hard for the viewer not to get lost in details on the way to the film's conclusion.",

Such an assumption appears heavy-handed on the strength of one film, but upon seeing Il Gattopardo, this is undeniable. Quality literary source adapted in a more cinematic fashion? Check. Amazing cast bent into shape for outstanding performances? Check. Superb photography, production design and music? Check (and the Criterion release of this film is beautiful beyond words).Il Gattopardo tells the story of a changing Italy as seen through the eyes of an aristocrat, the Prince of Salina (Burt Lancaster), as he bemusedly watches the next generation come into power (Alain Delon and an incredibly sensual Claudia Cardinale). It is epic in scope, theme and scale, again very much like Lean's color epics of the sixties. However, whereas Lean's films relied more on plot and were equally balanced between several characters, one element of Visconti's film has an unmatched gravitational pull and stands head and shoulders above any other: Burt Lancaster.Lancaster is a legend of cinema, balancing a unique physical presence and charisma with solid dramatic skills. Here however, he gives one of his best performances ever (with the possible exception of his man-child brute in \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"). His Prince of Salina is more royal a presence than any that has ever graced the screen, conveying grace, power, wisdom, nostalgia, sorrow and sometimes disgust, very often without even using words (which is more than fortunate since his performance was dubbed in Italian!). If only David Lean had used Lancaster... Watch this film. Dive into the lush and complex world that Visconti has created for you, with Lancaster at your side. The rewards are innumerable...",

The one thing that really stands out about this epic is its beautiful locations, costumes and the mesmerizing colors that run throughout the three hour running time. I would probably go as far as saying this is the most beautiful color film that I've ever seen. The incredibly Italian locations will take your breath away, especially when viewing them on a large screen. The colors are so vivid and lively that they take on a life of their own. The early scenes inside the garden and the final ballroom sequences are quite amazing on the eyes. I first heard of this film during an interview with Lancaster where he called this his favorite film and role. I think Lancaster does a very good job here but I wouldn't call it his best work but some of this might be due to it being rather strange hearing his voice dubbed. Claudia Cardinale steals the show however. It's interesting to learn that Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy, Anthony Quinn and other major acts were also considered for the Lancaster role. The only flaw with the film is its story, which runs out of steam somewhat and especially during the second hour. I haven't watched the cut American version yet but will get to it soon.",

In particular, the ball at the end is justly famous. The magic for me was in the sense that a real ball was being held and the camera was capturing as much of it as possible. The same was true of the battle scenes, where the scenes went on to the point where many of the combatants would engage with each other and then not quite know what to do. This contrasted so clearly with contemporary films today where the fight or battle scenes are punctuated with endless cuts. This is supposed to give a sense of movement and dynamism, and it allows for spectacular stunts by only requiring that someone do a small proportion of what the film depicts, but it also gives me a sense of unreality.I found the plot a little bit odd, in the sense that the first part of the film seemed to be quite different in moral message from the second half, but I suspect if I was more familiar with the reliance on symbolism in mid-20th century films I would have grasped it more easily. In general, if you think something is implied by a scene, it definitely is.I watched a three hour unrestored archival version on the big screen and it was definitely worth it.

That's quite a bit more than the version that was originally released in the U.S. the first time around, but there's obviously something missing, somewhere around 20 minutes. As it was, I found it difficult to follow. Especially near the beginning: I had no clue what was going on or who the characters were. They refrain from telling us When and Where for a long time. If you come here before you see it, it's Sicily circa 1860. Burt Lancaster plays Prince Salina, a man of distinguished family who can trace his line back to Emperor Titus (why not Vespasian, Titus' father?). The film seems to be mainly about the end of an aristocracy. Salina's nephew, played by Alain Delon, very sexy with his mustache, fights in a rebellion on the mainland. I don't know. I don't want to speculate on The Leopard too much. It's a beautiful film, obviously. It's much better than the other Visconti costume drama that I've seen, Senso, even if it didn't make too much sense. My favorite, by far, is Rocco and His Brothers, made three years before The Leopard. Still, The Leopard is more than noteworthy.

            "content": "I've been on IMDb for over 10 years and I've never written a review before, but this time I was so disappointed with this film that I needed to write something. The Leopard is a film that's universally praised, even the great Martin Scorsese hails it as an essential piece, so I expected a solid masterpiece, but that wasn't the case here. I'm a big fan of Death in Venice and Rocco and His Brothers (both directed by Visconti), I usually enjoy long period films and I'm not really concerned when \"nothing happens\" in a film, but that's because when a film doesn't have a clear plot, it usually involves some serious character development or images that tell a story, even if it's not linear; unfortunately this film gets lost in itself, not really knowing what it wants to be, it's incredibly uneven, the political aspect that provides the context seems rather superficial even if the dialogue is mostly about politics and in the end it doesn't commit to anything, we get the main character who is the only one who seems like a real human being and not a one-dimensional statue, and Lancaster does a very good job with what he's given, but he becomes a spectator to the central couple that could not be more bland and uninteresting, they're supposed to be young and full of life but they seem to be uncapable of any real emotion (and Alain Delon is usually a great actor) and there's no way the audience could actually care about them. The production design, cinematography, costumes and music are indeed remarkable, I don't know how the book tells the story because I haven't read it, but even if it's a faithful adaptation, there should have been some sort of work in character development, pacing and finding a central line, because even in a film that's simply about \"a few moments in the life of a family\" there should be a theme that's fully explored, and yes, Don Fabrizio has an arc, seeing he's no longer relevant in the world but that would've worked if the people around him actually felt like real people. At last I'd also like to mention that the dubbing IS a problem, a lot of people say that it shouldn't take you out of the story but isn't a truly great film in the sound era supposed to have audio correctly synced? That's actually a problem for most (if not all) Italian films from the 60s (including La Dolce Vita, and 8 1/2) and I just can't ignore it because it is ultimately a flaw. So overall, I would never call this a terrible film or even a truly bad one, but I would say it is ineffective, flawed and definitely not a masterpiece.",

Luchino Visconti had something quite clear in mind, and it doesn't even bother us that the story moves slowly, because in the same charm of Once Upon a Time in the West, it is a constant slow pace that resonates as perfect, because we can tell what each characeter feels by the way the camera is placed and by the music that plays in the background, and every visual metaphor can be fully picked up.Visconti visualizes this film as a portrait, much in the way Kubrick had with his own Barry Lyndon, although the two films have different themes, the two directors portray a huge similarity in style even in the other films that they directed. The change of the ruling class, the changeover from an independent monarchy to a united Italian kingdom. Burt Lancaster is excellent as the powerful man who feel he must step down, as he represents the old class, but he is even better at portraying the mysterious man, the one that secretly envies his nephew's youth, the life he will live, the things that he'll see, the woman that he will love. Too bad that the other actors don't look like they are understanding their characters at all, and come across as either farcical (Terence Hill) or just not bothered (Alain Delon). Claudia Cardinale doesn't act, she poses.It's not too hard to get past all that, because while Visconti may have not had a great feeling in this film with his cast(apart from Lancaster), he does with the crew. The art direction is sublime, as is the cinematography, which must be praised. This is a film with a deep historical meaning, as well as a political one, and the fact that it's resolved in a waltz makes it all more charmingly beautiful. At almost three hours in length, the film in never overstretched, rather by the end of the film we don't want to let the characters go, although we can imagine how life will go on.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - The unforgettable waltz Lancaster and Cardinale share.",

Also I like a great many dull movies so I hung in there, and it's qualities began to shine. Visconti's camera is so calm and confident that the footage has an air of inevitability about it. It avoids both the dull, even lighting of most contemporary mass-market films, and the over-dramatic chiaroscuro of later films. The strange casting of Burt Lancaster turns out to be very smart, just based on the way he carries himself, and his willingness to participate in the film at the correct, slightly humiliating scale. Kudos to him for having enough character to challenge the Hollywood mold and make such atypical choices (this, The Swimmer). The presentation of this haughty family is really well done. Everyone has complemented the camera work and you can add my voice to that. There is a nice distance from the subject matter that makes for striking, calm compositions. The sparse use of close-ups relieves the movie of the crass excesses of melodrama. Lastly, the movie is astonishing for its complete faith in the intelligence of its audience. I'm so glad I rented this.Scorsese and the makers of Jean de Florette have definitely seen this.

The sensuous Claudia Cardinale plays Angelica Sedara, the daughter of the vulgar bourgeois mayor (Paolo Stoppa) ,who marries the Prince's nephew. Romolo Valli does a great job as Father Pirrone, who keeps the Prince company as he slips into the slums at night to carry on his affairs with a local prostitute.The film rivals \"Gone with the Wind\" in its epic scope and detail.

The scene when Prince Fabrizi and his family arrive in Sicily and are attending mass, the camera panning slowly across the face of each family member which all, covered in dust, appear almost as statues or figures from the distant past with the mass being chanted in Latin, proves an exceptional shot, without equal in my view. We come to see, along with Prince Fabrizi, that money and political connections mean more than honor in the new order of things.

Yes the theme is compelling, Lancaster is good, and the sets, costumes and artfully composed, painterly scenes are beautiful and artistic. But this does not make for a 2 hour movie experience. I think it's pretentiouso and self involved and visconte lackes respect for an audience, to put them through such a monumental bore. The script and dubbing are offputting. The scene were claudia cardinalle at the dinner table comes out with that raucous, over done, over prolonged laugh is really exaggerated to the ridiculous. What was the point of that,and how did it fit in with overall plot and characteer? Was there a follow up? I may have missed it as I was half unconscious as the film wore on, and on and on. I wonder why lancaster was picked for this role, does anyone know?",

The film is undoubtedly beautifully shot, and if they removed 2 and a half hours of footage it MAY be worth sitting through under the guise of watching a piece of art like looking at a beautiful painting. However if you demand more than this from 3 and a half hours of your precious time then you will be incredibly disappointed.I spent the whole film thinking something amazing was going to happen to reward the unbelievable boredom heaped upon the viewer. I watched it in a cinema, and 70% of the audience had fallen asleep around the 2 hour mark. I knew they were fools for allowing themselves to fall asleep for surely they were going to miss out on the most amazing film. After 3 and a half hours and after the most over long scene in the history of cinema (it made the wedding scene from Deer Hunter feel like a 5 minute blitz of action) the film just ends. It honestly felt as if the director had laboured and laboured with this film and in the end thought enough is enough I can't be bothered to finish this film, downed tools and went home. I looked at my sister-in-law (the only other person still awake) and we both laughed out loud when the credits rolled.Watch this film at your own peril - you have been warned. You can never retrieve the time you'll waste watching this and you'll wish you can!",

Definitely NOT a film for an audience which wants fast-paced action and everything explained/laid out in the clearest possible manner with no \"loose ends\" left to worry about. (Cardinale says (in an interview which was included in the DVD of the film I purchased) that the film was more or less a total flop in the USA (with some in the audience not being able to accept Burt Lancaster in any role outside a Western!) and one can easily believe it.) If instead you want subtlety, psychological drama and insight into reactions to revolutionary times with acute social commentary, this is certainly one to watch (again and again). Apart from these aspects, the film is also just stunningly beautiful to look at with some magnificent \"set pieces\" (the street battle in Palermo, views over various Sicilian landscapes and, of course, the 40 minute-long scene of the ball which comes at the end of the film. Delon and Cardinale also bring enormous acting talent to bear in their roles, although the full honours must go to Lancaster. This film proves beyond any doubt whatsoever that he was one of the finest screen actors there has ever been and how, like Bogarde, for example, he never stopped striving for new roles/aspects of acting to develop until the very end.",

It is based on Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel of the same name.Garibaldi's troops come on Sicily. Prince of Salina sees that event as an obvious threat to his current social status. However, his nephew takes an opportunistic attitude and becomes an officer in Garibaldi's army. He has returned home as a war hero. He begins a romance with the beautiful daughter of a newly appointed mayor of their city. Prince of Salina despises a new mayor as an upstart who made a fortune on land speculation during the recent social upheaval, but he supports an emotional relationship and engagement of his nephew. He, later, declines an offer from a governmental emissary to become a senator in the new Parliament in Turin. He, painfully, experiencing the downfall of the aristocracy and the birth of a new class - the bourgeoisie...This is a very emotional epic, which considering social turmoils, through a sad look of a man. A magnificent ambiance is very personal. The atmosphere is melancholic and nostalgic at the same time. The story is full of memories and sorrow, so smile and dance of young people become uncomfortable. A revolution is not marked with bloody conflicts. A slow pace fully corresponds with emotional crisis of the main protagonist.Mr. Visconti has showed us a harmonious luxury, which is limited with emotions, ambitions and desires. The surface is decorated, and the core is rotten. The changes are inevitable.The scenery and costume design is at the highest level. Characterization is also very good. The closing section, an almost hour-long ball is a spectacular sequence, which shows the culmination of social changes in a subtle way.Burt Lancaster as Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina is a solid and imperious man who has frequent attacks of melancholy. His sharp patriarchal character is softened with sarcastic interruptions and moments of nostalgia. Mr. Lancaster has offered a convincing performance.Alain Delon as Tancredi Falconeri, Don Fabrizio's nephew is a charming and handsome young man, who does not have enough self-confidence to become the hero of this story. Claudia Cardinale as Angelica Sedara / Bertiana is, in addition to her beauty, a grotesque character. She is a strange combination between an indecent bourgeois girl and a serious young woman in love. Her uneven character is an embodiment of a social change.Further, clumsy, vulgar and shy characters fit perfectly into the atmosphere.Mr. Rota has offered a very rich and vivid soundtrack.",

Visconti's first cut was 205-minutes long, but was felt to be excessive in length by both the director and producer, and was shortened to 195-minutes for its Cannes Film Festival premiere. Visconti then cut the film further to 185-minutes for its official release, and considered this version to be his preferred one. The U.S English-dubbed version, in which the Italian and French actors were dubbed over (except for Burt Lancaster, whose original English voice work is heard), was edited down to 161-minutes by its distributor 20th Century Fox.Who today (2015) has heard of Garibaldi? Who had heard of him in 1963 when the film was released? I suspect that fewer know him now than then, but he is still an obscure figure in America outside of the Sicilian community. And this is too bad, as he really sparked huge change in Europe. This film does not focus on Garibaldi (he does not appear in the film), but does discuss that change. And it is quite interesting.",

            "content": "Il Gattopardo is known in English-speaking countries as \"The Leopard\". It exists in many versions, but two are especially common:- one a full 205 minute release, the other a clumsily dubbed 165 minute edition which omits so much that it is incoherent. I've seen both versions and if you're planning on watching the film it's a much more rewarding experience in its full, uncut, undubbed form. The film frequently crops up on critics' top-100 lists, though the general public might not be so enraptured as the film demands a degree of knowledge about Italian history at the time of the Garibaldi uprising. Indeed, if you don't have that basic grasp of the political and social backdrop against which the film is set, there's a good chance you'll find it a heavy-going and somewhat confusing yarn. However, if you know a little about these events and you appreciate a film in which the director, the actors and the cinematographer understand perfectly what they are trying to achieve, The Leopard could well win a place in your heart as one of THE all-time masterpieces. I could never recommend this film as whole-heartedly as classics like Lawrence of Arabia, 12 Angry Men or The Wild Bunch - The Leopard is much more of an acquired taste and in some ways isn't as accessible as those other titles - but nonetheless it remains a majestic, brilliant movie for those prepared to stay the course.Fabrizio di Salina (Burt Lancaster) is a Sicilian nobleman in the 1860s who realises that his family stand to lose everything during the Garibaldi uprising. He believes that occasionally people have to make changes in order to keep their life in balance, so regretfully he leads his family away from the violence to their retreat at Donnafugata. Here, he is obliged to form a bond with the area's ruling middle classes so as not to seem to be imposing himself in their district and belittling their leadership. Salina decides to allow his nephew Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon) to marry Angelica Sedara (Claudia Cardinale), the daughter of the local mayor, as a gesture of his goodwill. In turn, the mayor (Paolo Stoppa) senses that the courtship represents a chance to move up in the world from his bourgeoisie status.Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno gives the film a stunning visual quality almost unmatched in the movies (the only film I can think of which might have better cinematography is Lawrence of Arabia, but it's a mighty close call). Lancaster gives his career-best performance as \"The Leopard\", under the guidance of director Luchino Visconti whose finest - and most autobiographical - film this is. Also, Delon and Cardinale are brilliant, playing arguably cinema's most memorable screen lovers. Though the script is exhausting and, on many levels, very heavy-going, the film still emerges a truly tremendous work of art and it has a very realistic claim to be the greatest film to date to have come out of Italy.",

Alain Delon as Tancredi,on the contrary, shows the signs of decline ,if compared to his brilliant performance in \"Rocco and His Brothers\" by the same director.Still, he is good and solid , but no more.The beauty of Claudia Cardinale is beyond reproach and she is a good student: she has followed all director's suggestions (if not orders!).The true lovers of BEAUTY can enjoy every single frame in this film: each can be a lovely picture to put on the wall.

The fifteen minutes or so of prayers initially bothered me but there was promise of action and I was interested to learn a little more of the Italian politics of this time. Fat chance. Visconti is not really interested in anything but the interaction of men, men with women and women but mainly the former and although Claudia Cardinale appears late on for the main part this is about the man of the house and the guys he likes and doesn't like. There is a hint of politics, some confusing battle scenes, more praying, lots of speculation as to who is richer than who and whether marriage might grant a portion of that. There are what should be wondrous landscape sequences but this is Sicily and all is rather bleak and scorched by the interminable sun and heat. All very pretty otherwise, with the dresses and furnishings but I am beginning to tire its time for dinner with some 35 minutes left. The ball has just begun.

To me personally, it was even boring in certain sequences. I pay tribute to Burt Lancaster who played the main (title) role, he was very good, he did a lot of scenes, all in Italian, he positively surprised me. The film brings us closer to the situation in Sicily in the 1860s, it seems to me that the film is a set of events and situations that tell us more about that topic than about some meaningful story. Many of the events in the film are not inextricably linked. The last third of the film is probably one of the harder scenes to shoot as we have one lavish ball with a lot of people, costumes and dances. Although I can appreciate such things in the film I still didn't like them. The film has great size and splendor, it is almost megalomaniacal so it reminded me of some other classics with similar themes, but I will never watch it again in my life.",

But, that is the difference, Visconti was above it, on another level of existence, removed from the need/want of publicity, fame, etc, he knew who he was and where he came from.This is hard especially for Americans to understand, because they have no sense of self, their is no continuity of human experience in this country. Watching this movie, you see how he saw his experience as a continium of existence going back thousands of years with his ancestors, it is this background which is so hard for an American to understand, and comprehend.

Basically, set in the 1860's, against the Sicilian landscape a dying aristocracy, led by the Prince of Salina, Don Fabrizio Corbero (Burt Lancaster), he is also known as The Leopard, and the film traces the slow waning of his noble home. We see how he turned from peasant and rose to become the enormously wealthy prince he is, but with the decline of his empire and personal fortunes he refuses to take steps and halt this or rebuild Sicily, but assuring his own position to marry Don Calogero's beautiful daughter Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) is the nephew, Tancredi, Prince of Falconeri (Golden Globe nominated Alain Delon). Angelica is introduced to society by Tancredi in the climactic sumptuous forty minute ball, but in the end the conclusion is unclear whether Don Calogero recovers his empire or any of his personal fortune. Also starring Paolo Stoppa as Don Calogero Sedara, Rina Morelli as Princess Maria Stella Salina and Romolo Valli as Father Pirrone. It is obvious that Lancaster has been dubbed over by an Italian voice, but he otherwise gives a good confident performance being the head of the family and of the aristocracy, I admit I did not really know everything that was going on, because it involved political stuff, like about the republican movement or whatever, but the performances and costumes are well done, and I know it is a most watchable period drama.

You really have to set your mind to it, since it isn't really an easy movie to watch, also because of its pace and length. But as far as these sort of long, epic, drama's go, this really isn't the longest though. And even though I don't too often watch these sort of movies, it are still being ones that I can't help enjoy watching and appreciate them for what they are.It's one of those movies that you, by just watching it, can tell that it got based off a novel. It has all of the typical characters and side-plots for that. You can also tell that the novel it got based on must be a really thick and long one, since it handles a lot of different themes, lots of different characters, with each their own little story and some epic settings. The Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa novel is indeed a couple of hundred pages long and it's a story in the typical style of a family drama, that got spread out over the length of a couple of years. Interstingly enough it was the only novel Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa had ever written and he didn't even lived long enough to see it get released and gain lots of acclaim and recognition, in especially Italy itself. He was a born aristocrat himself, so he probably based some of the events, themes and characters on his real life experiences. It's definitely interesting to see how this story and its entire set-up continued to inspire writers and film-makers. This movie for instance shows definitely some similarities in style and tone (the rise and fall of a big and powerful family) to the first two \"The Godfather\" movies, perhaps also due to the fact that this movie also features a Nino Rota musical score.So it's the story that makes this a mostly compelling one to watch. Lots is happening, with all of the many different characters, which perhaps makes the movie at times a bit too hard to follow. It does has a main storyline in it and you feel that the movie could had used some more focus at times, purely on its main story-line, involving the Burt Lancaster.There is of course absolutely no reason for Burt Lancaster to be in an Italian production, playing an Italian- and also Italian speaking character. It's a bit ridicules and pointless if you ask me, also since he for obvious reasons got dubbed in the original Italian movie version. Seems to me they simply wanted to have a big international name attached to their project, for financial and marketing reasons. I'm not saying that Burt Lancaster doesn't do a decent job with his role but him playing the characters still felt forced, which did worked out as distracting at times. I was seeing Burt Lancaster playing an Italian but I was never really seeing the character. Of course the rest of the cast does mostly consists out of native Italians, such as the lovely Claudia Cardinale, who truly was one of the most beautiful actresses at the time and also had a streak of great movie roles in the '60's, with also roles in movies such as \"8\u00bd\", \"C'era una volta il West\" and \"The Pink Panther\".It's not just the story that is being epic about this movie but luckily the movie also does has the right required looks for it. It got obviously shot in Italy itself, at some great places. It got some nice landscapes and some big looking interiors and exteriors for its old, grand expensive looking palaces. The cinematography all really captures it well and the movie also has some convincing costumes, make-up and such, that all help to capture the right mood and atmosphere of the time period the story is being set at.Yes, the movie does feel as a long sit, mostly because the entire story is being told slowly and doesn't just focus on one character or main plot-line but it ultimately by the end is a very rewarding watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"Il gattopardo\" or \"The Leopard\" is a co-production between Italy and France that is mostly in the Italian language. This should not surprise anybody if you look at who made this film. The director and writers are Italian and same is true about most cast members. Actually, this seems to apply to almost everybody except Lancaster and Delon, but I will get to the cast a little later. The director is Luchino Visconti and this is one of his most known films, even if it is not the one for which he scored an Oscar nomination less a decade later. This movie here is from 1963, so it will have its 60th anniversary next year already or, depending on when you read this review of mine, maybe it even happened already, which also means that the people who worked on this one are not alive anymore or really old now. Visconti is no longer with us and that makes sense because he was already in his 50s when he shot this film, which would mean that in 2022 he would be among the oldest people still alive. The fact that many remember this film when hearing his name also has to do with the awards recognition it received. It won the prestigious Palme d'Or in Cannes, which is always big and also scored one Oscar nomination for its costumes. The man in charge there was Piero Tosi and it was the first Academy Award nomination he received. Four more would follow, two of those again for Visconti films, but a win was never meant to happen. He took home a BAFTA though and eventually received the honorary trophy from the Academy not too long ago. He died just a few years ago. If you look at the writers, you will find three names. Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa was no more alive when this film came out and he is the one who wrote the novel this is based on. The other two are Suso Cecchi D'Amico and Pasquale Festa Campanile. The latter scored an Oscar nomination in 1964, so the year after this came out and the aforementioned female writer got in in the year 1966. Big successes for them. While she is the one who was more than a decade older, she also outlived him for decades.Now, let us look at the cast. I gave you a few names already. The title character is played by Burt Lancaster and he made this a little while after his own Oscar-winning effort. He was around the age of 50 here or slightly under. Then there is Alain Delon who was really a rising star in his 20s still at that point and he is still alive today. The exact same thing is true about Claudia Cardinale whose name is also still familiar to many in America and here in Europe these two are household names anyway. Cardinale is known for her blonde mane by many, but here in the early years of her career, she is still wearing black hair and I think it suits her very well too. Having these three names in the cast is surely quite something. You can say it would be the equivalent of having three of the best and most talented rising actors from the year 2022 in the same movie. It can happen. But it would maybe turn out more spectacular and more wild than this movie did here. It was a pretty slow film for the most part and heavily relied on dialogue. I have not read the base material, but I guess they used many quotes form the book. So I can also not compare book and movie and point out parallels and differences. The rest of the cast then does not include any truly big names, even if some actors were also at least in Europe relatively popular back then. The reason I got to watch this one was in fact Terence Hill. I always keep an eye out in terms of films starring him and/or Bud Spencer that are on television and this was on the small screen here the other day. Does not happen too often. The way things are going right now with many movie theaters showing old(er) films again, it could very well happen that it is more likely you get to watch it at a movie theater. Also not the worst choice given the film's visual impact. The costumes, cinematography and sets were really a joy to watch at times. Maybe my favorite shot was from high above when we see several characters inside carriage that is pulled by horses through a rather bleak valley-like area and the characters are feeling a bit sick inside because of the bumpy road and also complaining about that. I really would have liked to be there. Not inside the carriage necessarily, but there in the nature. Beautiful spot!Anyway, I was talking about Hill and he was still going by the name Mario Girotti at that point of course. He was only in his early 20s there and the Bud Spencer years were far away. Still, it is surreal to see in how many films Girotti already acted before this one here. An incredibly prolific actor since his years as a teenager. He was also quite handsome and maybe there was talk about him becoming the next really big thing from Italy. Well, things took a different turn at least in terms of success in America not really happening, but he had a dream career here in Europe where he will probably never be forgotten. His character here, however, is not really lucky. He does not even woo Cardinale's character, but Lucilla Morlacchi's and even if the men in this film are all crazy over Cardinale and her looks, I probably would have picked Morlacchi if I had to decide. Quite a natural beauty. La Cardinale is of course for Delon and I did not find him too likable in here. Or maybe I should say that I did not find his character too likable. But I think he was kinda meant to be seen as likable. For me it did not really feel this way though, perhaps because of my Hill bias. The poor guy did not even get Morlacchi's character. He wooed her and charmed her and brought her a nice present that resulted in a funny comment about being deaf, which was one of really not many slight comedic inclusions this film had. Or maybe it was also rather meant in a bit of a sad way when this book was written or movie filmed, even if with Hill for me it is never really easy to take him truly seriously as a dramatic actor. This obviously has to do with me and how I know him from all these entertaining films and is not meant in a derogatory fashion linked to his talent. He is a gifted actor I believe.I already talked about this being a rather slow film, but this only comes as the movie continues. In the beginning, a lot is happening. We understand there is a man with an honorable job killed outside on the protagonist's premises, so drama is there right away when people are praying and it is interrupted by the noise outside. The action moves forward to the protagonist then dealing with a complicated situation that even brings out some tears in the people around him and we also get a young man's decision to stand up and fight with those who oppose the king. So, the revolution is a big factor here in this film that is set in the early 19th century if I remember correctly. This also already could have been enough content and plot almost for a film itself, a 1.5-hour movie perhaps, but this one here runs for over three hours, so it is an incredibly long watch and could even have worked as a miniseries consisting of four parts for example. However, it is nothing unusual at all that Italian feature films from that era have a really long running time. While we are talking the basics again, I could also mention that this film is in color, which is really not a given for a film from the first half of the 1960s. I could still mention two other actors: Giuliano Gemma had a truly prolific career and maybe you came across him in other films and Romolo Valli also left a bit of a lasting impression on me here, maybe because he was the only somewhat comedic character in here and his mannerisms made me smile on a few occasions. It is a bit ironic because he is a man of the Church and this is really an institution that is not known too well for its humor. Of course, the scene that stays most in the mind is when he enters the room where the main character is naked and that made for a funny and awkward situation, also when he starts rubbing the man's back then after receiving the towel. Of course, Lancaster's character's words there about how the religious man has seen stuff that burdens people's souls that is much more aggravated than physical nudity (I don't remember the exact quote) also stayed in the mind as one of the film's most memorable quotes.Aside from that, I struggled a bit with the movie title. I surely did not expect a nature documentary or something, but the inclusion of the elaboration why the film (and maybe also the protagonist) would have such a nickname did not feel memorable enough to me that I would support the movie being named like this. It was basically from one single quote in which the main character also mentions other animals. But well, it could have been the case obviously that this was handled differently in the book and made more sense there then. The first half included a battlefield scene and this was when we saw Hill/Girotti for the first time and also this lengthy sequence was one example of how the first hour was much more fast and wild than what followed afterwards. In the last third of the movie, politics play a bigger role for example. One character is trying to convince the protagonist to step into politics, but the latter is hesitant and says that ideology-wise his views still lie with the past and that he is not the right person to bring new inspiration, so he suggests somebody else, but that is a character who does not have the same reputation or class like Lancaster's. So of course, there are many plots and stories packed in here with this running time. Here and there, I was surprised that Lancaster was not as much at the center of the film as I would have thought given the title. All in all, this was a decent movie. I think the rating on imdb and some of the awards recognition are still too much. The positive recommendation and thumbs-up are safe though, even if I guess it is not a film I would consider among my favorites from 1964.",

Burt Lancaster plays the patriarch, an embodiment of the former age unwilling to accept the changes that are sure to come about in the newly formed country. Alain Delon plays his nephew, with Claudia Cardinale as the nephew's love; their romance reminds one of the generation gap that was to come during the next few years after the movie's release.It's the sort of movie where almost every scene reveals something new about the characters. And those outfits! Has Claudia Cardinale ever looked prettier? There's a reason why the costumes earned the movie an Academy Award nomination.Basically, there's a reason why this movie is on Steven Schneider's list of movies to see before you die.

In cinematic terms, it curiously serves as the background radiation to The Godfather Trilogy, as it represents the Sicily of the Andolini family, albeit from the royal family point of view. In fact, the sicilian sequences in The Godfathers I and II bear a striking resemblance to the Sicily portrayed in Ill Gattopardo, a supreme tribute by Coppola to Visconti.Incredible but true, Burt Lancaster is picture-perfect as the tormented prince who deeply feels his mortality at age forty five, even as he struggles to keep his royal heritage alive for future generations in chaotic times, willing to make compromises his ancestors would have flinched at, which only makes our prince more royal.The textures and nuances in Ill Gattopardo run constant and deep, the hand that directs them is as steady as a rock. Make no mistake, this is the work of an artist at the height of his powers, not caring if he puts half of us to sleep, probably even not caring if he hypnotizes the other half. If you want to see supreme confidence at work, you can do no better than Ill Gattopardo. Equal maybe, but no better.",

I got the same impression from this film that I got watching \"I Vitelloni\" by Fellini - namely an easy accommodation to a new political era. In \"I Vitelloni\" no one has any problem with Fascism; it is just the way things are. In \"Il Gattopardo\" Prince Fabrizio has no problem compromising with the \"Risorgimento,\" or resurgence of Cavour and others that forms the new unified Italy (historical sidebar: achieved more with politics than military might). Delon's character, Tancredi, has absolutely no problem fighting both with Garabaldi and against him. This is quite a modern film in the ability of powerful people (aristocracy serves as the proxy) to make deals and promote their best interests even in a time of turmoil. I see it as a comment on Italy's tragic love affair with Fascism. If I am reading too much into a sumptuous film, so be it. I like films that make me think.",

            "content": "\"Il Gattopardo\" is a towering masterpiece, one of those films which one must see to complete one's visual education. Burt Lancaster's performance has an intensity and an understated quality he never achieved again. Forget his OTT performance in \"Elmer Gantry\": it was here, in \"Il Gattopardo\" where he showed what he was REALLY capable of. He plays Prince Salina, and he is truly princely. But if he is the prince of the screen for the whole length of the movie, there is a princess next to him: Claudia Cardinale, whose name should be changed to Carnale or perhaps Boccato di Cardinale -simply exquisite! Visconti was an aristocrat, and he lent to the subject of this film, the inevitable decadence of the aristocratic class and the rise of the bourgeoisie, an elegiac tone, but without forgetting his sense of humor and some touches of comedy. And the sheer beauty of it all: the famous party sequence has been imitated again and again (e.g., in Scorsese's \"Age of Innocence\"), but no pupil has managed to outshine the master. The cinematography is simply gorgeous (Visconti, a Lombard, was obviously seduced by the shining light of Sicily). And Nino Rota's score is a tour de force, which can only be compared to his scores for Fellini or for \"The Godfather\", parts 1 & 2 -and believe me, I think I like \"Il Gattopardo\" even better. And talking about \"The Godfather\", the influence of \"Il Gattopardo\" is clearly visible. So, if you are among those that voted for Coppola's Shakespearian work to be among the top 10 in the IMDB list, please, do check \"Il Gattopardo\" and help it make it to the top 10, too. It certainly deserves it.",
