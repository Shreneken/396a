            "content": "Just one of the many marvelous moments in \"Charade\", one of Cary Grant's and Audrey Hepburn's best films. There's a quarter of a million dollars floating around instant-widow Hepburn but nobody can SEE IT (it's right in front of their eyes). Filled with running jokes, colorful and eccentric oddities (such as trenchcoat-wearing George Kennedy with his hook and the little guy who won't stop sneezing), funny set-pieces (like the funeral scene, and Audrey's priceless exaggerated reactions) and suspenseful sequences, not to mention Audrey and Cary looking smashing together. This is one of 50 best films ever made, as good as \"Casablanca\" and \"My Fair Lady\". In fact, I think it's better.",

            "content": "I was one of those people who was convinced this was a Hitchcock movie when I first saw \"Charade\". I think this is because the idea of the plot, some of the set pieces and the style of direction are remarkably similar. The director here is Stanley Donan(co-director with Gene Kelly of \"Singin' In The Rain\"), and I thought he did a great job directing.The real stars of this classy, entertaining and I think underrated Hitchcockian-like comedy thriller are the clever plot(with an ingenious McGuffin) and the marvellous romantic score from Henry Mancini. The cinematography is skillful enough and the Parisian locations are ravishing. Not to mention some truly wonderful set pieces such as Grant taking a shower fully clothed, Grant and Hepburn falling in love on a river boat, a hair-raising cliffhanger on the roof, the priceless funeral scene and the sequence under the stage.The acting is marvellous, with charming, brooding and urbane Cary Grant and lovely and equally charming Audrey Hepburn making a dream pairing and making the most of a crisp, funny and sophisticated script. James Coburn makes a star-making turn, Ned Glass is deliciously obnoxious and Walter Matthau, a wonderful comic actor in his time, in an understated performance here that I personally think is the strongest one of the film. In fact, while I have nothing against George Kennedy, I did feel as though he was slightly phoning in his performance here, but considering how good this film is that is a minor criticism.Overall, this film is terrific, not the best movie ever made but a long way from the worst. It is such a shame people have to be so derogatory to not only this film in general, but also about Grant, Hepburn and other movie stars like James Stewart when they have a lot more talent than most of the actors working today and that is a fact. Not trying to sound opinionated, but I'd rather watch any Hitchcock or this than any of the Friedberg-Seltzer spoofs or Steven Seagal's most sloppily paced, lazily acted film. 9.5/10 for \"Charade\".

            "content": "Let's see: what we got here is one of the best romantic-comedy/thriller scripts ever made, one of the best Hollywood directors from 50's and 60's, the more elegant and classy actress ever (Audrey Hepburn), the more elegant and classy actor ever (Cary Grant), two of the best \"tough guys\" from the big screen (G. Kennedy and James Coburn), one of the best comedy actors ever (Walter Matthau), and the city of Paris. Nothing could possibly go wrong, don't you think? Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert, an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert (at least that's what she thinks)... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and, as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain, he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie: Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade, Stanley Donen merged suspense and romantic-comedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect, the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame: side by side with Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant (him once again!), Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies, they do their best as CIA agents. And least but not less, we got Walter Matthau, one of the best comedy actors ever (I should've put Walter Matthau-Jack Lemon in my Couple's Hall Of Fame!) doing the best he can (that is a lot!) as (in principle) an American Embassy employee. So if you liked North By Northwest or Breakfast At Tiffany's, if you think that there's never been a more classy actress than Audrey Hepburn, if you do believe that Cary Grant's been one of the more talented actors ever (and one of the funniest ones)... please, don't miss Charade. You'll spend one of the times of your life. Aur Voir, Mon Amis!My Rate: 10/10 or even higher.",

A wide-eyed youngster gaping at a big silver screen at the theater can be more memorable than a middle-aged guy seeing that film decades later on a small television.However, here is one film that is EVEN BETTER than I remembered it. Yeah, it's a little dated here and there, but not much, just mainly Audrey Hepburn's dialog. However, the story with all its twists is just as suspenseful and fun to watch as it was over 50 years ago. I've seen this three times in the last two years, after that long, long absence. (Tip: spend the extra money to get the Criterion DVD disc. It is the only clear, sharp copy of this film I have seen.)The story's strength lies in getting the viewer involved. One never knows whether Gary Grant is a good guy or a bad guy. The dialog between Grant and Hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. There are lots of good lines, particularly by Grant. That in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. The pacing of this story also is good; the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.This has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s. I have never known anyone who didn't like this film.",

Audrey Hepburn was never more appealing than she is here--badly in need of help to discover the whereabouts of the hidden money her late husband's enemies want to find. With her life hanging in the balance, she enlists the aid of Cary Grant--but since all is not what it seems, you're in for some surprising plot twists along a very merry ride.Just relax and let Cary and Audrey do all the work--with the help of a great supporting cast including Walter Matthau, superb in a surprising supporting role. Stanley Donen keeps it all moving at a brisk pace and Henry Mancini's music is a sheer delight.Highly recommended as an expert, elegant mixture of humor and suspense, even if it does seem to imitate the Hitchcock way of filmmaking.",

            "content": "If Audrey Hepburn fell in love and blossomed to luminous womanhood in Paris as Jo Stockton in FUNNY FACE, CHARADE -- Stanley Donen's very Hitchockian thriller complete with Saul Bass-like opening credits -- has her not only falling in love but in constant danger from some stylish baddies who are after some 250,000 dollars which her late husband stole during the war. A convoluted plot in which Cary Grant and Walter Matthau swap more identities than two schizophrenics suffering from multiple personality disorder, requiring us to look closely and keep a scoreboard, CHARADE is quite straightforward -- since everyone is after the 250,000 and Hepburn must rely on Grant for protection even if he may at times be shady, it's inevitable that a romance will develop even when things get hairy (and they do). Both Grant and Hepburn exude an irresistible charm as a couple and it's a pity they did not work together after this film because despite the constant twists and turns and identity changes in the plot, they're the ones who light up the screen on their presence alone. CHARADE was remade in 2002 as Jonathan Demme's THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE with Thandie Newton channeling Audrey every moment she was on screen in the lead role and Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role.",

            "content": "CHARADE is the best Hitchcock movie Hitchcock never made! With romance, sophisticated comedy, and stylish suspense (including a smattering of graphic-for-its-era violence) balanced out deftly, CHARADE is the movie that made me a fan of both Peter Stone and Stanley Donen (yes, I actually saw this before I ever saw one of Donen's musicals!). Every other line is sparklingly quotable, and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are among my favorite screen couples; pity this was their only big screen teaming (I liked the wry way they kidded the age difference between them, too). James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Walter Matthau (all Oscar winners now!) are in top form in these early screen appearances of theirs. Both Hepburn and Paris look their sophisticated best, and the theme is my favorite by Henry Mancini next to the PINK PANTHER theme. Do try to get ahold of the marvelous Criterion Collection DVD of CHARADE; it's well worth seeking out, with nifty extras including an utterly delightful commentary track by Stanley Donen and the late Peter Stone. By the way, CHARADE is also piggybacked onto the DVD of Jonathan Demme's well-meaning but disappointing remake, THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. On a related note, Donen's second Hitchcock spoof/homage, ARABESQUE, was released as part of a Gregory Peck boxed DVD set. I'm glad ARABESQUE is available on DVD, but I wish they'd recorded a commentary track by Donen and Sophia Loren while they're both still alive and reasonably well. But I digress...watch CHARADE today! :-)",

This is a witty and affectionate comedy/romance/mystery featuring impeccable performances from Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn as two people thrown into a mystery involving a hidden fortune and some deadly foes.CHARADE has a lot going for it, not least the crisp, neat, early '60s style. Grant is at his charismatic best, even though it's clear he's past his prime here, while Hepburn plays the usual intelligent, glamorous and slightly fragile character that she's so adept at. Film fans will be in their element with the presence of numerous soon-to-be-famous actors, including George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau.The story twists and turns at a merry place, ably mixing romance with murder and coming off well as a result. I particularly liked Grant's murky character motivations and how you're left constantly wrong-footed as to his character's true intentions. There's little to dislike here.",

Now they and the government are looking for the money from her.All that's been left to her as far as her husband's things are the contents of a Lufthansa travel bag and the rather mundane contents of said bag.It's all one big Charade for Audrey, she doesn't know who to believe. She'd like to believe Cary Grant and who wouldn't, but every time she turns around Grant's got a different character name. He has a total of four during the film. The others are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau.Charade boasts a fast moving plot and great location photography in both Paris and the Swiss Alps. It also has a nice musical score with a title song that was up for an Oscar that year. If the song Charade had won it would have been an unprecedented three wins in a row for the songwriting team of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. But the song lost to Call Me Irresponsible from Papa's Delicate Condition.It's ironic that Cary Grant at the last minute backed out of doing Sabrina because he thought the contrast in age between him and Audrey Hepburn would not be believed by the audience.

Long underrated and underappreciated (and only available in horrible-looking, grainy video prints), this fabulously entertaining comedy-thriller is the cinematic equivilant of a champagne cocktail. Often compared (perhaps unfavorably) to Hitchcock's films of the period, \"Charade\" contains little of the heavy psychological tension that marked Hitch's work. Instead, the film concentrates on witty banter, Audrey's wardrobe and a clever script--and we're the richer for it. Audrey is a sudden widow who is terrifyingly thrust into a web of deceit; her late husband, it seems, was being hunted by three ex-war buddies with whom he stole $250,000. Audrey, they think, has the money--and if she doesn't come up with it quickly, she'll be joining him. Cary Grant is the handsome, mysterious stranger who may be friend or foe. It had been done before, and it's been done since, but never with such panache. Henry Mancini's stylish score adds immeasurably to both the fun and the tension; and the ever-nimble Stanley Donen directs the suspense scenes just as deftly as the comic ones. My favorites: Audrey trailing Cary dressed \"inconspicuously\" in a white Givenchy trenchcoat and huge movie star sunglasses, while giving a poor German tourist the fits; Audrey finally cornering Cary in her hotel room and lightly kissing her way down his face--today's filmmakers might take a page from her book: this scene is intensely romantic without ever seeing a bit of exposed flesh or dueling tongues; and of course, the fabulous opening scene (I won't give away the surprise)--with Audrey wearing one of my favorite Movie Star get ups of all time: a hooded mink poncho over a catsuit. This is entertainment with a capital \"E\", made all the more enjoyable because it never panders to the lowest common denominator, never dips into \"camp,\" and never breaks a sweat. Today's films continue to mine the same territory, and the results are ceaselessly boring, tawdry or both. You can FEEL the strain of the writers and actors as they attempt the kind of slick interplay that came naturally to those involved in \"Charade.\" The beautiful, magnificently restored Criterion DVD edition now allows us to revel in this film like never before.",

            "content": "While I do not think this movie is good enough to make the IMDb top 250, it still is an excellent movie that is a lot of fun. I think some of the reason it is rated highly is because there seems to be an \"Audrey Hepburn cult\"---a devoted group of people who see her as the greatest actress that ever lived and her movies as masterpieces. While I would admit she was a heck of an actress, I just don't think BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, ROMAN HOLIDAY or CHARADE are great--just very good and entertaining.The film automatically is guaranteed to be very good just because of its pairing of Hepburn and Cary Grant. Both are such professional and likable actors that it's no surprise at all that the movie succeeds. And while Cary is significantly older than his co-star, this is handled pretty well in the movie. The older Cary isn't as sure of himself or tough as he once was and he even makes a few remarks about his advancing age. This is a very graceful way of making the pairing actually work. About the only aspect of the pairing I didn't care for was how many times Cary turned out to be someone else. Considering how often he lied to Audrey, it didn't make much sense for her STILL to fall in love with him. This does prevent the movie from scoring a higher rating from me, but it is a relatively small quibble since the rest of the film works so well.The supporting cast is exceptional--particularly George Kennedy as the hot-head. The writing decent and direction superb. In particular, the exceptional camera-work result and music resulted in a wonderful romantic mood and the director worked with his crew to ensure this. Also I was impressed by the scenes where the two would-be lovers were on the barge having a romantic dinner. I noticed that they actually worked with the sound to make it sound as if the barge was actually going under the bridges--with Grant's and Hepburn's voices echoing realistically to this. That's an excellent touch that many directors would NOT have included. It was obvious that this was a work of love.So fans of the two stars as well as fans of romance should enjoy this film very much. About the only ones who might not like CHARADE are action-loving teens and kids who might just think the whole thing is \"icky\" and can't understand why Ms. Hepburn would fall for \"that old guy\"--if only they knew and understood!",

Name recognition portends no specific knowledge, so I didn't truly know what I was getting into as I sat to watch, but I'm positively delighted by what 'Charade' represents. There are robust, strongly balanced elements stirring together romance, comedy, thrillers, and mystery. These disparate parts are swirled together with an exquisite expertise that means no one facet ever overshadows another, and one is just as attentively considered as the next. With all these flavors blending together so well, the length progresses surprisingly fast, very capably holding our attention all the while. Whatever I could have anticipated about this feature before I pressed \"play,\" my assumptions were handily bested - this is fantastic!Peter Stone's screenplay, adapted from the story he co-wrote, is a bit of a marvel. It's one matter to fashion a fastidious fusion of far-flung forms; it's another to harmonize multiple, conflicting, ongoing secrets and kernels of knowledge. Some bits of truth are revealed to or hidden from the characters; others, to or from the audience. All the while, there's bite, intelligence, and witty repartee in the rich dialogue, and the characters are written with welcome personality, depth, and complexity. The scene writing is wonderfully sharp and varied as it swings from one mood or essence to another, propelling the plot with aplomb while giving the cast plenty of room to inhabit their roles with vibrant, gratifying spirit. And the narrative is an absolute blast. The tale is taught with tiny twists and turns, complete and cohesive and acutely captivating. From one point to another it's charming, funny, exciting, or fascinating, if not all at once.Stone's screenplay is the greatest joy in 'Charade,' but it's not the only one. The cast is outstanding, all embracing their parts with fabulous energy. Whatever the tone may be that the film adopts from one scene to the next, their performances are remarkably adept, shifting at will with the demands of the writing. Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, Walter Mathau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass all offer up displays of acting rife with terrific range, nuance, intensity, passion, and zest, pairing perfectly with the humor, tension, thrills, suspense, intrigue, or enchantment. Captured in a shot by themselves or sharing time on the screen with one or more of the others, everyone involved unquestionably illustrates their skill and deserved renown, and it's a tremendous pleasure to watch them at work.All this is to say nothing of the round excellence of every other aspect of the production. I quite appreciate the contributions of wardrobe, hair, and makeup, while the filming locations and set design and decoration are swell. Henry Mancini's score is occasionally a little too playful, yet much more so than not is ace in complementing the content and tone of any given scene. Director Stanley Donen demonstrates a keen eye for arranging shots and scenes, while Charles Lang's cinematography and Jim Clark's editing are instrumental in bringing the title to such vivid life. And so it is on down the line, with the work in every department coming across as all but impeccable as it builds the whole.I expected a good time, but I really had no idea just how brilliant this film is. Many movies try to toss together an array of styles, and sometimes that effort just doesn't pay off. Here the amalgamation is seamless; each strain is readily identifiable when given prominence, but also combines with the others to create something fresh and new. Stone's writing and the cast and their acting are stupendous anchors for a feature that is incredibly well made in all regards, and I cannot overstate how thrilled I am to have at long last watched 'Charade,' and found it to be as great as it is. Honestly, this is undoubtedly one of the very best movies I've ever seen, or ever will. Simply put, there's no particular reason why anyone should pass up an opportunity to watch it, and more than that, it's 100% worth seeking out if that's what it takes. 'Charade' is an exemplar of cinema, and it is not to be missed.",

Unless it's called for.\"\n\"How would you like a spanking?\"A woman on a ski holiday (Audrey Hepburn) talks about getting a divorce, but it turns out she doesn't have to, because her husband has been murdered. Worse yet, three men are now after her because of some money they think she might have gotten from him. They were with her husband behind enemy lines during WWII as part of a covert operation to give a quarter of a million dollars to the French Resistance, but decided to bury the money instead, and dig it up after the war. Another man (Cary Grant) has turned up as well and seems to be her protector, but is he really on her side?It's a fantastic concept, and as everyone and their grandma has noted, the film is reminiscent of Hitchcock. We see that in its tension, shots like the view from the perspective of a corpse as a morgue drawer closes, and dramatic scenes using the environment, like the fight on the roof behind the giant neon sign, or the chase down in the Paris Metro. Maybe it's also got a bit of Clouzot's Diabolique in a bathtub scene, or just how long the viewer is held in suspense before knowing who the bad guy is.It's lighter than the average Hitchcock fare and in ways that sometimes border on silliness, but on the other hand, the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is far greater than anything Hitch ever produced with his obsession over icy blondes. The banter is risqu\u00e9 and Hepburn's come-on's to Grant are steamy, even though Grant's character regularly reminds Hepburn's how much younger she is. This has to be one of my favorite performances from Hepburn, as she ranges from comedy to flirtation to frightened for her life seamlessly. Meanwhile, you have Cary Grant at 59 still getting it done as a debonair romantic lead, and also cutting loose with silly faces, getting into a shower in his suit, and trying his best not to grope women as he plays Pass the Orange with them in a nightclub.Does it all hold together? Hepburn's character knowing so little about her husband, falling in love again so quickly, or how several characters figure out how the money is hidden? Maybe not completely, but I don't care. It's a rare film that has fantastic moments as a thriller, comedy, and romance, and the star power is through the roof. Besides the leads, the supporting performances from George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau make for a very strong cast. There is depth in other ways as well, e.g. Little moments of humor in places like Matthau asking Hepburn if she knows how much cigarettes cost when she wastes one, or the lovely shot of the reflection of the lights from a boat going down the Seine. Hey, I'd love for the 60's animation style over the opening credits to make a comeback too; between the dead body being tossed from a train and the snazzy graphics, this film hooked me from the beginning. All in all, it's a charming package.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.This is the last movie I can recall that really worked well by employing actors in their native roles as celebrities. It works -- I think -- because there are three elements involved: take away any one and the enterprise falls below the threshold of watchability.--The story works. This is no small matter. It requires both mystery and screen sensibilities. People ascribe this mix to Hitchcock, but that's not really true. He was a cinematic master so far as blocking shots and playing with the difference between what we know and the characters do. But he never was able to center the narrative itself in a purely visual world. Here, the mystery form is reduced to the barest elements: how is the money hidden? how is the killer hidden? And these are pulled off expertly.--The celebrities work. These celebrities aren't actors in the real sense. They just act the one public character they've created. I do not think we have the equivalent today, just the sexy actress of the moment. But these two really are unique and charming personalities, constructed by their time, that we get to watch.--The tone works. The tone is one of chic Americans, exhibiting then desirable American stereotypes: intelligent banter and style. The plot is American, so are the villains (including a cowboy!), the money, even the American Express and Embassy locations. But the setting is Paris, and so are Audrey's clothes. Those costumes are like a character unto themselves, adopted into the American sphere while leaving the ridiculous out, like the hapless policemen. He is flummoxed as much by the pajamas of the bodies as the bodies themselves. More about clothes: I think it a uniquely 60's Americanization to be so extreme with the woman's wear, and so casual about the men's (with the suit-shower).This film premiered shortly after the JFK assassination.

            "content": "Charade is an elegant and witty adventure. Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by ex-soldiers James Coburn, Ned Glass and George Kennedy, fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot (five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who double-crossed them) is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains \u0096 particularly Kennedy as a one-armed hood who literally makes sparks fly \u0096 are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow, and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment (especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour). Charade's director Stanley Donen (former dancer and maker of musicals) easily out-Hitches Hitchcock. In its way, this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die, while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle (the film even has a pre-title teaser scene, a trait the later Bonds would make their own). The subplot, about stealing gold during wartime, provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography, lighting and music (courtesy of Henri Mancini) are as good as \u0096 if not better than \u0096 anything the Bonds of the time could come up with (this is 1963, the same year as From Russia With Love). Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the one-armed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history, nasty, suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film, you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part, but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one. Director Donen, composer Mancini and scriptwriter Peter Stone reunited three years later for Arabesque, a suspenser with Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck in the Hepburn and Grant roles.",

It also features Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Dominique Minot, Ned Glass, and Jacques Marin. It's shot on location in Paris with Charles Lang on cinematography and Henry Mancini provides the score - where his memorable theme tune was Oscar nominated.When her husband is murdered, just prior to seeking a divorce from him, Regina Lampert (Hepburn) finds herself pursued by a number of men who seem to think she knows the location of a quarter of a million dollars in stolen loot. Of all the men who are now thrust into her life, it's the handsome Peter Joshua (Grant) who she trusts and sides with. Trouble is, is that his name keeps changing and she's finding it difficult to determine who exactly are the good guys and who are the bad guys - especially as the corpses start to mount up.Pure Hollywood entertainment featuring two of its most endearing and classy performers, Charade shows how a multi genre spliced film should be made. It's rare to find a film that works on all levels, as a comedy, a thriller and a romance. But thanks to the astute direction from Donen, Charade comes up trumps whilst also oozing an elegant sheen about it. That Grant & Hepburn have charisma in abundance is something of a given, but they are given a quality script to work from and a Hitchcockian plot to revel in. It has been said from some critical quarters that there is no peril in Charade, thus its reputation is not entirely lived up to. Yes we can say it's a playful movie, but it's meant to be, pretty much like \"North By Northwest\" is. Yet the peril exists, lest we forget a great rooftop fight and the last quarter of the movie as we follow our hurried protagonists through the Parisian underground - and on to a memorable encounter at a theatre. Or what about a metal handed George Kennedy putting the pressure on, or James Coburn menacingly playing with matches? No peril my eye!.There's also been the odd dissenting voice proclaiming the structure of the story to be confused. Well it's very twisty, delightfully so, but nothing to tax the brain. Everything is laid out in simple terms and all dialogue is spoken nice and crisply. All played out amongst the splendid back drop of Paris. This was the first and only time that Hepburn & Grant appeared together. A crying shame, for in spite of Grant worrying about the age gap before hand (Grant 59/Hepburn 34), to the extent he requested some dialogue changes to make Regina the romantic pursuer, their chemistry sparkles and they make a very believable coupling. Coburn, Kennedy & Glass are effective bad boys, while Matthau is a key presence throughout. Stylish, charming, suave and suspenseful, with an ending that's truly a pleasant surprise - both in revelation and character closure, Charade is not to be missed by anyone who likes a bit of comedy, romance and thrills in their respective movie diets. 9/10",

It turns out that some very bad men (James Coburn, George Kennedy, and top character actor Ned Glass) are after some money that Charles had stolen along with them, and then pocketed for himself. In a great deal of danger now, Regina must rely on a new acquaintance in her life, the handsome and dapper Peter Joshua (Mr. Grant).Regina finds it very hard to trust *anybody* in this thing, and that includes Peter, who's got an alias for every occasion.Peter Stone scripted this ingenious, involving film, from a story he concocted with Marc Behm, and it serves up endless twists, especially in regards to Joshua. It's all stylishly directed (and produced) by Stanley Donen, features great use of Paris locations, and its fantastic cast also consists of Walter Matthau (as a helpful man at the American Embassy) and Jacques Marin (as an understandably flustered French detective). Even considering the obvious age difference between Cary & Audrey, they make a wonderful pair, and have excellent chemistry. But then, the entire cast works well together, with Coburn and Kennedy especially making for fun antagonists.Granted, there was at least one twist that this viewer was able to successfully predict, but this is all a tremendous amount of fun, as it delivers humor, romance, intrigue, action, and suspense.

In a way, he was a natural for directing this marvelous movie of adventure and romance based in Paris, a city well known to the director. In fact, it didn't come as a surprise this is one of his best movies Mr. Donen ever directed. In fact, \"Charade\" has all the right elements to work as it does. First it's a thriller adventure as the beautiful Reggie is being menaced by some unsavory characters and she has no clue why are they doing that to her. Her dead husband ties her in to all the bad guys that want to get hold of a treasure she possesses, but has no idea about what could it be. When Peter enters the picture, Reggie feels protected, but then there is a doubt planted in her that makes her think twice about his intentions. In the meanwhile, Reggie has to put up with those bad guys shadowing her. \"Charade\" is so appealing because of the immense talented Audrey Hepburn, who was perfect for the role of Reggie. This young woman who works as a translator is one of the best things Ms. Hepburn did on the screen. The actress was a good comedienne as well as an elegant figure that graced whatever she played. Dressed by Givenchy, Audrey Hepburn is a beautiful excuse to look at. Cary Grant is seen as the man who ultimately conquers Reggie. In spite of the age difference, Mr. Grant was always a welcome addition to any film. The easy chemistry between the two stars is one of the strong points of the film. Cary Grant is perfectly suave in the film. The supporting cast was excellent. Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, among others, were perfect.\"Charade\" offers a melodious musical score and gives the film a dimension and adds to the action. The great cinematography by Charles Lang takes in the beauty of Paris at its best.

The film wisely focuses on them and leaves the thrills to the background.  Not to say that stuff isn't well written.  The idea isn't terribly enthralling, but it's executed with enough twists and turns to keep you interested, though if you're anything like me you'll see the surprises coming a mile off.  That was probably the weak point of the film.  It was simply too predictable.

Regina is contacted by an official from the American Embassy who informs her that there was much about Charles that she did not know. He was not, as she thought, Swiss, but American (although he was in possession of several forged passports). During the Second World War he served with an American army unit that was responsible for the theft of $250,000. Charles was murdered by his former comrades-in-arms whom he was attempting to cheat of their share of the loot. Regina learns that she too may be in danger from these men, who believe that Charles has entrusted the missing money to her. During her skiing trip, Regina befriended a businessman named Peter Joshua. Joshua turns up again in Paris, and offers to help her search for the money. The plot then becomes very complex, and Regina begins to doubt whether Joshua is who he says he is or whether she can trust him.Like another film from 1963, Mark Robson's 'The Prize', 'Charade' owes an obvious debt to the work of Alfred Hitchcock- not the dark, sinister Hitchcock of 'Psycho' or 'Vertigo' but the lighter Hitchcock who could blend suspense with humour in films such as 'North by Northwest' and 'To Catch a Thief' (both of which also starred Cary Grant). The atmosphere of 'Charade' is surprisingly light-hearted for a film which has as its themes murder and robbery. This impression of light-heartedness is achieved in several ways. There is the casting of the two leading roles, Audrey Hepburn as Regina and Cary Grant as Joshua. The film-makers of the fifties and early sixties seemed to love casting Hepburn alongside leading men who were not only older than her but old enough to be her father. This did not always succeed (I have never regarded either the casting of Henry Fonda in 'War and Peace' or that of Fred Astaire in 'Funny Face' as inspired decisions), but sometimes the chemistry worked, as with Humphrey Bogart in 'Sabrina' or here with Grant. Despite her doubts about his trustworthiness, Regina finds herself falling in love with Joshua, and there is plenty of playful, bantering flirtatiousness between them, helped by a witty script. Hepburn is as captivating as she always was, and Grant, despite some greying hair, is surprisingly handsome and youthful for a man only a few months short of his sixtieth birthday. Besides the verbal humour, the film also makes good use of visual humour, starting with the opening scene where Regina seems to be menaced by a gunman before we discover that it is only a child with a water-pistol. There are also some attractive, if conventionally touristic, shots of Parisian scenes. ('The Prize' makes equally effective use of shots of Stockholm).Although there are many good things about this film, I was rather surprised to see it so high up in your list of top films. (In my view it is far from being Audrey Hepburn's best film, but it is the one that your voters seem to esteem most highly; indeed, of her others only 'Roman Holiday' makes the top 250). 'Charade' may be influenced by Hitchcock, but it falls some way short of genuine Hitchcock, at least when he was at his best. Even in films that have lighter moments, Hitch was always able to conjure up a genuine sense of fear and danger. Stanley Donen never quite succeeded in doing this; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous scene with the crop-dusting plane in 'North by Northwest' or even of the car on the bridge in 'The Prize'. The scene with the water-pistol is about as close as Donen gets to genuine tension. Seen as a light romantic comedy 'Charade' is excellent; seen as a thriller it seems to lack a dimension when compared to truly first-rate thrillers. 7/10",

However I DID find it hard to believe that Hepburn fell in love with Grant. He's a great actor and very handsome but come on! He could be her father! It has some extreme (for its time) violence but it's VERY tame by todays standards. It carefully walks the line between mystery, humor and romance and never looses its footing. There's also a very funny funeral sequence at the beginning. This is a Hitchcock like film--hard to believe he didn't make this.The acting is very good by Hepburn and Grant and Coburn is fun. But Kennedy and Glass are just so-so and Walter Matthau is horrible. Still the focus is mostly on Hepburn and Grant so these are minor complaints.This was a hit upon release. Unfortunately the TV version is heavily edited (for example--the movie runs 114 minutes and played in 2 hour time slots on TV!). That might be why the movie is still pretty unknown even today. Stiil, well worth catching. Recommended.",

The Paris location had nothing to do with the film, the rest of the story blends into something so horrible and the action is barely existent. It's just horrible on so many levels.There is one magical piece in here - it's the setting under the stage floor - which is a real masterpiece in the entire film - quite unique in the entire film era of the 60's and to some degree - even 40 something years later.Aside of that fantastic little segment, this movie is a dismal mark on cinematic history.",

            "content": "This is such a fun movie! It's an engaging thriller that has clever twists and turns. Audrey Hepburn plays Regina Lampert, an expatriate, and not to mention wealthy, American (she's vacationing in the French Alps at the beginning of the film) who works as a simultaneous interpreter. When she returns to Paris, she discovers her apartment is empty. She finds out her husband sold their belongings, and was subsequently murdered as he was leaving Paris. Regina meets with CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Matthau), who informs her that three men - Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass) and Tex Panthollow (James Coburn) - were assigned by the OSS to deliver $250,000 to the French Resistance. They stole it, and Charles, her husband, double-crossed them. The remaining survivors are looking for the money, and so is the US government. He tells Regina she has the money and that her life is at risk. When she goes back to the empty apartment, she's approached again by a man named Peter Joshua (Cary Grant). She previously encountered him when she was in the French Alps. He has two other aliases. After she moves into a hotel, Herman, Leopold, and Tex begin threatening her. I was glued to the screen the whole time. Well, I'm like that with any thriller, but Charade was unique. The dialogue between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant was sarcastic and witty. He felt awkward about getting intimate with her in the film, due to the significant age difference (he was 58 and she was 33 at the time). The filmmakers changed the dialogue to where his character said something about her age, and had her character flirt with him. His lack of comfort with showing romantic interest towards a woman who was young enough to be his daughter, even though they were only acting, exemplified that he was a decent man. If you ask me, he was still kind of handsome to be in his late 50s. The movie overall, despite the seriousness of the storyline, was also funny. The silly game people were playing in a restaurant, the man who kept sneezing, CG calling AH a nut, and then showering in her bathroom with his clothes on. Not everyone will like this film. They might think it hasn't aged well, but I disagree. I love movies from the 1960s. They're just so hip and quirky. I also find it enjoyable looking at the women's fashion. I don't see how this movie is archaic. From Russian With Love was showing in theaters the same year, and watching it now through a 21st century lens, it's horribly outdated. James Bond cuddles with/kisses the woman, then later on in the movie grabs her by the sides of her arms and hits her. At least when Peter threatened to spank her, Regina told him she would punch him in the nose. I won't give away anything that happens - this is a movie you must see for yourself. I'm glad it's on YouTube so I can watch it whenever I want. Great choice for a Saturday evening.",

            "content": "The opening music for \"Charade\" sounded so familiar, maybe because in 1963 I was a recent high school graduate and about to turn 18. Cary Grant was 59, starring in his 75th film, and only made two others after this one. Audrey Hepburn was 34, and \"Charade\" came between two of her most memorable films, \"Breakfast at Tiffanys\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" In this one she plays an easily love-struck lady who actually makes several plays for the affections of the older Grant.SPOILERS follow, read cautiously.Returning home in Paris from a ski vacation, where she met Grant, she finds the place empty, stripped, no clothes, nothing, her husband had auctioned off everything for $250,000 and was headed for Argentina, his belongings later showed. He is found dead, thrown off a train in rural France, and they suspect he had $250,000 which had been stolen during the war, in 1944. Figuring she had the money now, it appears that 4 others are looking for it, including Grant, Matthau, Coburn, and George Kennedy. But she was clueless. The 3 stamps on the envelope addressed to her were worth $250,000!! One at a time, each of the 4 turn up murdered, until only two remain - Grant and Matthau. Turns out Matthau, playing a CIA agent, is the bad guy, Grant, who is the real government good guy, gets both the upper hand and the girl in the end!Interesting setting for the climax, an empty theater at night, Hepburn is in the cue pit, Matthau is walking towards her on stage, gun in hand, while Grant is below. Just at the last moment, he pulls the trap door release and Matthau falls through.The story is mainly a romantic comedy, with a serious theme. The writing is clever, with a lot of reparte' between Grant and Hepburn, as if the writers delighted in their own cuteness. However, it works well for a 1963 film, but wouldn't go over so well today. A thoroughly enjoyable \"whodunnit\" that mainly kept me guessing right up to the end, I rate it \"8\" of 10, and probably would have been a \"10\" for 1963. It is worth the time just to see Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn at the top of their craft in this film.",

I suppose in the 60's, they were experiencing the darker side of stories rather than mostly the sweet movies from the 1950's you normally would see! I swear Hepburn was just stunning as usual on this like really, she should've starred in more movies with Grant as she was the right woman for him to play as his lover. I even liked her yellow coat, it just looked fabulous on her, no wonder girls would want to be like her. I have to say, I would be the same myself if I wasn't so lazy lol!

            "content": "Owing to the romantic setting of Paris and the haute couture style of the two lead actors, \"Charade\" fits right in with the cultural ambiance of early 1960s Camelot. Producers could not have picked two lead performers more suited for such a pretentious film: the annoyingly suave Cary Grant and the annoyingly sophisticated Audrey Hepburn. Completing the ensemble of annoying contributors is Henry Mancini, with his dreamy \"romantic\" music; mercifully, the film doesn't contain his song \"Moon River\".The voluminous dialogue driven script is a mess, as it is as contrived and talky as we would expect for early 1960s haughty Hollywood. Worst segment is the \"romantic\" riverboat ride at night, all schmaltzy and dreamy, that just reeks of Camelot idealism. Further, the plot's alternating humor and murder is unsettling. It conveys the impression that both Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) and Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) are both plagued either by ten second attention spans, or worse, self-deception, wherein multiple deaths in two hours function merely as inconvenient intrusions into their budding love affair.All that said, the mystery element is pleasantly reminiscent of Agatha Christie's film \"And Then There Were None\". And the final few scenes are suspenseful. The whodunit element is rather easy to figure out for most of us, except for the giddily delusional and oh-so-na\u00efve Regina Lampert. The plot's predictability in turn results in a somewhat disappointing ending.Color cinematography is average. I didn't notice any problems, but nothing about the visuals struck me as being overtly laudable, either.\"Charade\" has no significant message to impart. It's a mainstream film that provides a pleasing two hours of diversionary entertainment for a star-struck mass audience. But the dreamy, romantic, sophisticated style of Grant, Hepburn and Mancini, set in romantic Paris, makes me yearn for a rowdy Western wherein old, cantankerous characters lacking teeth get dirty and cuss up a storm.",

When she arrives home, she finds her apartment totally empty and that Charles was murdered, dropped from a train. She goes to the morgue, to recognize the body, and she receives his assets in a small wallet. Later, she receives a call from Carson Dial (Walter Matthau), from the American Embassy.

Then, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), the freak Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold Gideon (Ned Glass), Charles' former partners, threatens her.

Yesterday I had lunch with a couple of colleagues and one of them told me that `Charade' is one of his favorite movies. I decided to check it out and I do not regret: it is indeed a movie that presents action, romance, comedy and mystery in right doses. All of that, supported by the wonderful Audrey Hepburn (in my opinion, one of the most beautiful smiles in the history of the cinema) and an older, but still handsome, Cary Grant. The ironical and sometimes acid dialogs are great. Some parts of the screenplay seem to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock, with a delightful mystery. There are many shifts in the plot until the last scene. The quality of image of the VHS available in Brazil is not good. A magnificent entertainment, indicated for the whole family.

            "content": "I actually recall seeing CHARADE when if first the movie houses in 1963, and it has remained a fond memory ever since - one of the examples of a clever plot with a good cast and a surprisingly adroit director. Stanley Donen is best recalled for his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s on several of the best MGM musicals (usually working with Gene Kelly). But it is an interesting surprise that in the 1960s he did two thrillers (CHARADE and ARABESQUE) which were very well done indeed. CHARADE is about Reggie Lambert, a woman about to get divorced from her American husband. But before the divorce can get underway she learns her husband has been brutally murdered (we see his body thrown off a train). Soon she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) who starts befriending, even romancing her - but their relationship is twisted when it turns out his name is not Peter Joshua but Alexander Dial, the brother of a man who was killed in a suspicious incident during World War II, where a fortune in gold was lost. Although the Germans apparently were responsible, the suspicion was that the men guarding the gold hid it, to divide it up later on. These men are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, a dead soldier named Carson Dial, and the deceased husband of Hepburn. The three living ex-G.I.s are in Paris - they had apparently tracked down Hepburn's husband, and one of them may have killed him. But each denies this, and suspicion is also on Grant (supposedly for the share of his dead sibling), and Hepburn. To add to the tensions, Hepburn is contacted by a Mr. Hamilton Bartholemew of the U.S. Embassy in Paris (Walter Matthau) who explains that the U.S. Government is interested in recovering the stolen gold.There are several mysteries in CHARADE: what happened to the fortune in gold; what is the game that Grant is playing (is he friend or foe to Hepburn); and who is bumping off the various ex-G.I.s. For as the film passes first one then the other is killed off. As these problems are wrapped up we reach the conclusion, a scary showdown in the empty Paris Opera House.Photographed in Paris, the film is also an able visual valentine to the great city. Only another Hepburn film, FUNNY FACE, shows as many romantic sites (a third one, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, comes close too). It sort of fits the mood, with Grant romancing Hepburn in the great city.If you want to be totally surprised, I advise not reading beyond this point of this review. But if you want a personal observation read on:SPOILER COMING UP:All his career Cary Grant wanted to play a villainous part. He was always the hero (his roles in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART and MR. LUCKY and SUSPICION were the closest to villains he played). This film was his last chance, and it would have been curious if he had played it as such. Oddly enough, the actual chief villain in the plot, Walter Matthau (as Carson Dial, pretending to be Mr. Bartholemew) was also at a crossroads. Most of Matthau's early film parts were villainous, such as the whip-happy tavern owner in THE KENTUCKIAN. However he had shown signs of being a \"good guy\". In A FACE IN THE CROWD, as a television executive, he tells off a scheming, collapsing, Andy Griffith that he'll be lucky in a year or two to be recalled as a has-been. And in ONIONHEAD, he was a good natured cook on a naval craft who befriends Griffith. Still his most recent performances were mostly villainous - as when he was the government adviser in FAILSAFE who recommends the accidental launching of an attack of Russia be followed up by a full scale sneak attack. I might add, to Matthau's later success, he demonstrated where he could his great sense of timing and humor.It has often struck me that if Donan and Grant had gotten together, rather than a routine romantic adventurer for Grant he should have been the killer and villain, and been the threat to Hepburn at the conclusion - that Matthau would have been great fumbling his way to rescuing her. There need not have been a romance between Matthau and Hepburn, but he could have saved her. After all, she had started the film married to a man with a secret about a government theft, and if she fell for a killer (as Grant would have been) it would have been consistent with her being a poor judge of character.",

            "content": "Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" and \"To Catch a Thief\", and in some minor ways better than both, Stanley Donen's \"Charade\" finds actor Cary Grant teaming up with Audrey Hepburn to find her murdered husband's fortune before it is snatched up by a gang of thieves (George Kennedy, Ned Glass and a young James Coburn).Other than some ordinary camera work (when compared to Hitchcock's more clever eye), \"Charade\" is Hitchcockian in every other respect, smoothly blending romance, slapstick, crime, clever sight gags, flirtatious banter, wrongful accusations, suave \"running man\" heroes, another debonair performance by Grant, murder, ghoulish humour, sumptuous European locations and much black comedy. In modern cinema, dozens of films like this are released every year, but back in the early 1960s, \"Charade\" was novel; it's a 1950s Hitchcock movie with a certain 1960s edge.Donen was known for several musicals (\"Singin' in the Rain\", \"Seven Brids for Seven Brothers\" etc), so he has no trouble matching the operatic, luscious tone of Hitchcock (Truffaut was doing a similar thing during this period as well), with sweeping scores, big images, bold colours, big emotional moments, Technicolor titles and overly voluptuous location photography. What separates \"Charade\" - the film's title itself plays like a self-reflexive joke; a deceptive emulation of Hitch - from what it imitates is Peter Stone's screenplay, which is light on its toes, jaunty, self-aware and self-parodying. It's also a script intimately aware of Grant's early history with studio comedies and Howard Hawks screwballs.Audrey Hepburn is fine in her roll, but she's mostly our avatar; it's through her we gawk and salivate over Grant's perpetual cool. The film's cinematography was by Charles Lang, recognised as one of the greatest American cinematographers. While modern audiences will justifiably find \"Charade\" dated, and while opinions as to what is \"cool\" and \"entertaining\" are constantly shifting (Grant is not as suave as he once was; he's pathetic, old and dorky by today's standards), those with an affection for a certain style of 1950s popcorn will find much to like.8/10 \u2013 See Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's \"The Tourist\", which also does to Hitchcock what Donen does here.

Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead.She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government.At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept.The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.",

            "content": "A superbly stylish sub-Hitchcock comedy-thriller,only Hitch didn't make it.Still,it had the classiest leading actors ever(Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn),a witty script(Peter Stone),impeccable direction(Stanley Donen) and a faultless supporting cast(Walter Matthau,James Coburn,George Kennedy).The story is of course decidedly far-fetched,but this is a minor negative as the film was designed to be pure entertainment,which it succeeds in achieving in spades. Despite the greying hair and nearing sixty,Grant is still as handsome as ever,and despite the marked age difference between him and Hepburn,they make one of the best screen couples of all time.With any other actor of his age,it would've been an embarrassment but the witty,clever banter and romantic clinches are funny,delightful and charming.The most memorable of many memorable scenes for me is a beautifully judged sequence featuring Cary and Audrey on the boat trip on the Seine.In it's own way,this is one of the most charming and romantic scenes of it's kind ever filmed. CHARADE does counter balance it's superb romantic comedy elements with a surprisingly ruthless edge with the amount of killings involved,done in an admittedly imaginative way but still a trifle over-macabre.But the plot twists are very clever and suspense builds extremely effectively,and despite the plot's improbability,CHARADE still succeeds in being enormously funny,entertaining and thrilling. Screenwriter Stone and director Donen applied this style three years later with ARABESQUE,and although the results were perfectly acceptable,with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren a decent romantic screen pairing,it didn't repeat the greater all round brilliance that CHARADE passed off with such \u00e9lan.It is a shame Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn never made another film together,but we can be all grateful that they at least appeared alongside each other once;the chemistry achieved has rarely been matched anywhere else.CHARADE is now rightly regarded as a classic of it's kind,and it's reputation will hopefully continue to grow.RATING:9 out of 10.",

            "content": "1963 was a good year for Hitchcock imitations, what with the superb The Prize and the delightful Charade. In Charade, it is the turn of great musical director Stanley Donen to show that there's more to his talent than song-and-dance routines and Gene Kelly getting rained on. A surprisingly sinister film, which expertly releases the tension with moments of charm and wit before reapplying it with a vengeance, Charade is engrossing from beginning to end. It is ludicrous, of course, with so many outrageous twists that in the wrong hands it would have looked somewhat absurd. But with Donen at the helm, and a cast of sublime actors, its improbabilities can be forgiven with ease.Unhappily married Parisian beauty Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is contemplating divorcing her husband when she learns that she will not have to bother doing so. Poor old Charles Lampert was murdered on a train while she was away on vacation in Switzerland. Reggie also learns that her late husband was involved in the theft of $250,000 worth of gold during WWII from the American army payroll. It seems that he may have been murdered by one of his gold-snatching accomplices, perhaps someone keen to increase his share by reducing the number of shareholders? Amongst the suspects are one-armed thug Scobie (George Kennedy), sneaky Gideon (Ned Glass) and the vicious Tex (James Coburn). The three hoods, all participants in the afore-mentioned gold heist, decide that Reggie must know where her husband hid the fortune.... so they terrorise her, hoping to intimidate her into revealing its whereabouts. Bewildered and frightened, Reggie's only hope is that a suave stranger (Cary Grant) can protect her.... but is he really her knight in shining armour, or just another killer trying to claim the stolen loot?Charade moves with breathless speed from one scene to the next, rarely pausing long enough for one to notice how far-fetched it all is. The dialogue between Grant and Hepburn is superbly written and just as superbly delivered, with some priceless and very quotable lines. Henry Mancini's score is perfect throughout, with a lovely bounciness in the picture-postcard scenes around Paris, but a sense of heightened tension during the suspense sequences. The revelations are concealed well, with the truth about who is who and what is what kept well disguised until the very end. On the whole, Charade is splendid entertainment.",

Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story.The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming.But there's still something not quite right.

            "content": "A captivating and outrageously funny spy spoof, this is one of the great romantic comedies of all time. While Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are about 30 years apart, this gives a new twist to \"Bringing Up Baby\", Grant's comedy classic with the other Hepburn. Grant got to work with practically every younger actress of his day, often having more chemistry with them than the young actors of the time did with actors the same age. Hepburn herself had her share of older leading men, and Grant is perhaps the best for her as she was perhaps the best for him. She's a recent widow, shocked to find out that the husband she was about to divorce was a thief, allegedly having stolen a huge amount of cash from the C.I.A. Now an agent of theirs (Walter Matthau) wants the money back, warning Hepburn that dangers involving two stalkers (James Coburn and George Kennedy) are out to get her to get their hands on the money as well. The charade going on keeps making Hepburn doubt Grant's honesty, even after he risks his life for her. Grant, charming as ever, takes a shower fully dressed, fights with hook armed Kennedy on a rooftop, and even parodies himself in \"To Catch a Thief\". His attempts to grab an orange from the double chinned neck of a society matron is hysterical. Hepburn, as lovely as she was in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", is a stylish and elegant comic, but not afraid of taking the brunt of a pratfall or spoofing her princess like image. They are just perfect together, with Matthau, Coburn, a creepy looking Kennedy and \"West Side Story's\" Ned Glass in excellent support. In an ironic reference to \"My Fair Lady\", Cary Grant responds to Audrey's inquiry of where they are with \"On the Street Where You Live\". She also mentions Gene Kelly dancing by the river in \"An American in Paris\" and several other iconic Parisian cultural references as well, a touch obviously of director Stanley Donen's, a major factor in many of the great 1950's MGM movie musicals. In fact, the elegant touch of MGM and the stylish look of Hitchcock's recent hits is very evident. You'll not soon forget the Henry Mancini theme, either.",

Grant's dimple and Hepburn's eyes could have sold a movie all by themselves. Gawd, she was stunning, a la gamin. Alas, features harden or sometimes soften with age and the end result, even if only barely noticeable, is a little depressing. A couple of jokes point up the difference in age between the two but it doesn't help much. Time's winged chariot. Shudder.Their performances, though, are as fine as ever. Grant had nearly perfect comic timing and Hepburn looked born to be shocked. Stanley Donen's direction is efficient and Henry Mancini's musical score is appropriately mysterious and romantic at the same time. The supporting players do exactly as much as needs to be done -- Walter Matthau (in the dubious role of mustachioed villain), the angular James Coburn, the bulky George Kennedy, and the treacherous mouse, Ned Glass.It's a bit weak, compared to other romantic comedies of the same period -- Blake Edwards' \"The Pink Panther,\" for instance. The chief problem is with the screenplay, which thinks its funnier than it is. The amusement seems forced at times, too much given over to lengthy scenes in which Grant takes a shower in his drip-dry suit while Hepburn laughs herself silly, or to scenes in which the couple try to transport an orange from under one neck to under another without using their hands.\"Do you want to see where I was tattooed?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good, we'll drive around there sometime.\" You can hear joints creaking as the guffaws are reached for.I saw this when it was released and found it charming.

            "content": "One can be grateful that Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn co-starred at least this one time during their illustrious careers since they were likely the two most sophisticated, urbane stars to grace the screen. Just saying their names together and the chemistry between them seems assured. They were supposed to appear together in \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Sabrina\" (according to Marc Eliot's recent biography on Grant), but in retrospect, it's probably a blessing that they waited until 1963 when both were at the peak of their abilities exuding a confidence that is deceptively casual. Stanley Donen, who had worked with both actors before, has expertly directed a supremely entertaining thriller juggling suspense with a romantic comedy sensibility.Although many consider this film derivative of Hitchcock, in particular, \"North by Northwest\" (also strongly recommended), I have to say that Donen sets up Grant much more convincingly as a potential villain than Hitchcock did in \"Suspicion\". It's also obvious that Donen adores Hepburn (consider \"Funny Face\" and \"Two for the Road\", the latter especially recommended), and in this, arguably the least of their collaborations, she is far more interesting and provocative than the usual damsel in distress. Perhaps liberated by her then-recent Holly Golightly in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", she is surprisingly forthright sexually with Grant. Much of the credit also needs to be given to screenwriter Peter Stone, who penned a clever script revolving around a young wife in Paris named Regina Lampert, whose husband is mysteriously murdered, and then is besieged by a gallery of unsavory characters, her husband's old WWII Army buddies (a Texas-twanged James Coburn and a scarifying George Kennedy among them). Providing protection, sort of speak, are a solicitous U.S. intelligence agent named Bartholomew, played with characteristic dryness by Walter Matthau, and of course, Grant, debonair as ever under various pseudonyms starting with Peter Joshua. Twists and turns abound amid the glamorous Paris settings, Hepburn's smart Givenchy clothes and several comedy set pieces like the rolling orange game in the nightclub, some steamy nuzzling in an interpreter's booth and Grant's impromptu \"drip dry\" shower.Even though the ending is never really in question, the journey there is quite enjoyable as it hinges on whether Grant will ever inspire Hepburn's trust and on all of the characters getting their hands on a stash of money left behind by Regina's dead husband, the form of which provides one of the more intriguing plot turns. I particularly like the climactic, much-imitated chase scenes through the Paris metro and ending on a stage with a tic-tac-toe trapdoor awaiting the fate of the villain. The Henry Mancini score certainly sustains the suspense and romance topped off by the familiar title theme. If you can get your hands on the Criterion Collection DVD, the film transfer is exceptional, and Donen and Stone provide insightful, often quite funny commentary on an alternate track. This is one classy thriller and great fun.",

Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy are a fun group of supporting players. I think this film flatters both stars very well and you will discover that the matching is perfectly correct.

But the romantic pairing of Hepburn and Grant transforms this otherwise commonplace thriller into something magical. There may have been better or prettier actresses than Audrey, and there may have been better (though not handsomer) actors than Cary -- but no two actors ever exuded sophistication and playfulness the way these two do, and they play off one another in this movie with extraordinary charm and electricity. It is truly a pity that they never made another movie together because it would also have been a classic. I don't believe Hepburn ever had another leading man or Grant another leading lady as perfect as these two are together. And the story is sufficiently tense and amusing to make reasonable use of the time when Hepburn and Grant aren't on the screen together. The film also brings together three later stars -- Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy -- as foils for Hepburn and Grant. But it is THEIR movie all the way!

It took awhile, granted, but he got his chance, which also marked the only teaming of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Donen said that it would be difficult to turn down any movie with these headliners, however, mastering the technique of Hitch was another story. Donen will always be credited for having an eye for detail and he went straight to work on this project, capturing that black comedy slash edge of your seat genius Hitchcock so well projected in his films and he nailed it. Easier said than done. There was also another stumbling block, as CHARADE was released not too long after the death of President Kennedy, so he had to be most careful of any references to assassinations, and what to do with a story of a bunch of no-gooders who specialized in murder! Careful, now! It all worked out, because audiences were especially interested in the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant and what a dynamic team they made, if for only one film! Best of their scenes together are just watching Grant's comedic expressions, which are knock-down, drag-out hilarious. He truly was a master of comedy and Donen, a master himself, knew how to put this actor to work, if not just let the camera roll. The nightclub wiggle and jiggle scene, without giving too much away, is now legend, again crediting Grant's looks of utter surprise! And as for the baddies, notably George Kennedy, he truly comes off as a member of the Hitchcockian troop of villains, ALSO Ned Glass, who was in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, which was Donen's favorite mystery. Last but not least, a nod to Walter Matthau, himself a scene stealer like Grant, who most definitely keeps your attention and then some! Simply said, one of the great movies of all time and it goes by fast, and kind of sad in retrospect that Grant and Hepburn never returned together. But at least we have this one to cherish for many years to come and to attract a new generation of fans, that without a doubt. Thank you, Mr. Donen.",

            "content": "Having never seen a film with Hepburn (My fair Lady) in before I was very excited about watching this film after her many praises and after watching the opening sequence in the Ski hotel I was immediately hooked.Hepburn stars as Reg Lampert, a sophisticated woman unaware of her husband's life. When hearing of his death she is left with a sum of money, only she doesn't know where it is. What she does know is that many men want it, and they are going to track her down to get it themselves.Conforming brilliantly to a thriller genre, Charade presents a somewhat light-hearted entertainment for the family through the use of a diverse set of characters and their own humour and antics. It's slow at points to allow audiences to become familiar with the characters but when necessary, for example the ending, it becomes fast and tense.Relationships between characters are great, especially between Grant (Monkey Business) and Hepburn who are simply terrific as they try to weigh each other out. Grant's character is very cool and classy and made me pay particular close attention to his actions in the film.The mystery behind this story is great. Audiences are always wondering who has the money and why and through many scenes involving close confrontation between each the film is always exciting and expecting.A few scenes had me put of where the whole plot seemed to easy and not realistic context wise. However it is minimal criticism for a film that is simply entertaining and engaging throughout.Hepburn's character has become one of my all time favourites. Her charisma and attitude towards her position in the film was sensational. Her class and sophistication in the most tense circumstances is a must watch and now I can't wait to see the actress in more films.a must watch for enjoyment",

            "content": "Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is a young American woman on vacation in Paris, whose marriage to her husband Charlie is about to unravel. The situation is solved quite unexpectedly when Charlie is murdered, and almost instantly Regina realizes that something sinister is going on. During WWII her husband had been a member of the OSS who had stolen a shipment of Nazi gold along with several others, and now the surviving gang members (James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass) are willing to kill Reggie to get it back. Bewildered, frightened, but always with ready with a snappy comeback, Reggie holds her own, but must rely on a seemingly upright CIA Agent (Walter Matthau) and a man whose name, identity, and allegiance seems to change at every turn (Cary Grant) to find the money and avoid a grisly fate at the hands of the criminals.\"Charade\" is a borderline impossible film to classify. The plot description makes it seem like a rather straightforward Hitchcockian thriller: an individual trapped in circumstances they don't understand, protagonists who can't be fully trusted, menacing bad guys, and a rather ingenious Macguffin. But the movie also works as a wonderful romantic comedy, with an extremely witty script and two old-school Hollywood romantic leads. That the film works as both is a testament to its status as a classic. It may not be the smartest or most inventive film of all time, but it's certainly one of the most entertaining.The main attraction of the film is undoubtedly the two leads. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were both stars of classic Hollywood, and both were entering the later stages of their careers. Audrey Hepburn is simply one of the greats. She aged incredibly well on film, maintaining the class and lovable straightforwardness from her earlier films, and adding to it a degree of sophistication and wit as she grew older. Audrey's charm is undeniable; even in her lesser works like \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", it's almost impossible to dislike Audrey. In \"Charade\" she is as beautiful as ever, dressed in a gorgeous array of Givenchy dresses, and carries herself with her trademark class and dignity. If anything she's more appealing in this film than in \"Roman Holiday\" or \"Sabrina\".On the other end is Cary Grant, one of Hollywood's greatest leading men, nearing the end of his career. His character is never who he seems; his identity and name change every other scene or so. You WANT to think that he's a good guy, I mean he IS Cary Grant, and he IS flirting with Audrey Hepburn. But when Reggie sees him conspiring with the three villains, when he gives himself a different name in every scene, how can you be sure? The film somehow manages to pull this character off without it being laughable or predictable, and I think Grant is to be credited for this. He and Hepburn have great chemistry and are helped by a witty script with an endless stream of verbal bantering, which together makes their rather large age difference superfluous. Nowadays, these two actors playing these characters would be decried for \"typecasting\" or \"lack of range\", but when something works, particularly as well as in a film like this... who cares?The film makes brilliant use of gorgeous Paris scenery throughout, and features marvelous set pieces, most notably a roof-top fight between Grant and Kennedy's characters and the lengthy chase sequence/shootout at the climax. Peter Stone's fine screenplay deserves credit for somehow managing to amalgamate the comedy and thriller aspects and keep the viewer guessing as to who the bad guy is. Charles Lang's cinematography captures both the beauty of Paris and also adds a touch of darkness appropriate to the story. Stanley Donen's direction is fabulous and he keeps a brisk, even, suspenseful pace throughout. Henry Mancini provides a catchy and extremely memorable score.The supporting cast is also solid. Walter Matthau does a good job as the CIA Agent who seems to be the one honest character in the film. James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass are perfectly cast as the menacing yet goofy bad guys. Coburn and Kennedy would soon go on to bigger things and they show why in this film, while Glass is wonderful as the obnoxious sniveling twerp. Jacques Marin also provides an amusing turn as the bewildered French policeman investigating the whole mess (\"Three men dead in their pajamas? What is this, a new American fad?\").All in all, \"Charade\" is just a fun film to watch. It works on many different levels and anyone looking for a pleasant waste of two hours should definitely check it out. Supercritical writers could pick out the various plot holes and improbabilities, or pick out the plot twists before they develop. But most viewers will undoubtedly be charmed by the two leads, the wonderful script, and the gorgeous Paris scenery, all the while wondering whodunit? And that's all one can really ask from a film like this.9/10",

            "content": "Cary Grant entered the 1960s a seasoned veteran, who had cemented himself as a legend in Hollywood. Even though he had the graying hair, it didn't effect his energy or his charm. He had compiled over 30 years of remarkable achievements in film acting. This film would be his third from the last film of his career. It was a stunning career, that was in its twilight.As for the audience of the time, they were able to see, within the last eight years, two Alfred Hitchcock movies, that he did with Cary Grant. They were the films, To Catch a Thief (1955) and North by Northwest (1959). In both films, it was Cary Grant running through a menagerie of bad situations, full of Hitchcockian suspense and in full color. Also, earlier in the year, before this film was released, Alfred released, The Birds (1963), in March of 1963. The audience was ready for more.Another director, Stanley Donen, who was doing pretty good for himself in the movie directing business as well, found a project, based off of a set of novels, that fit in perfectly with the popular image of the Hitchcock/Grant style. It contained plenty of mystery, suspense, romance, comedy and danger. So, what better way would a director approach this situation? In order to accomplish making this film, Donen would need to make the best non-Hitchcock, Hitchcock film ever and hire Cary Grant to star in it.The character, however, who would be the one to drive this film forward, would be the one that everything is centered around. It was really her movie and everyone else was her guest star. I'm talking about Audrey Hepburn, as Regina Lampert. Regina is a sophisticated, rich lady, who comes home from a skiing vacation to find her house empty and her husband dead. Turns out, he stole some money, may have been killed by the very people he robbed and the killers are after her now. Enter the dashing, but older, Peter Joshua (Grant), who is trying to protect her. It is from here when the twists, turns and surprises come from. It is an extraordinary plot. There are plenty of laughs too.A rogues gallery of bad guys get involved with the pursuit of the missing money, that Regina knows nothing about. Acting greats, in their early years, James Coburn as Tex, George Kennedy as Scobie, Ned Glass as Gideon and leading the investigation is Walter Matthau as Hamilton Bartholomew. Add in the excellent soundtrack music of Henry Mancini, sweeping DP work by Charles Lang and this film is a great time.Back in 1963, Universal Pictures published the movie with an invalid copyright notice, so the film entered the public domain in the United States immediately upon its release in the theaters, which gave us all the chance to easily see it for a long time. This was a wonderful thing for decades, because it was always easy to get a VHS copy, see it on late night tv or even catch it on YouTube for free, in later years. But, that aspect may have turned out to be a problem, because finding the original version in its original widescreen proportions has been difficult over the decades. The film got stuck in a 4:3 rut and the widescreen version has been tough to find. In the age of streaming services that has changed things though. I was able to finally see this movie in widescreen a week ago, maybe brought on by a blu-ray release at some point. It just seemed to evade me for a long time. Either way, seek out the widescreen version of this film. It enhances Charles Lang's cinematography and creates an even better epic tale then the one that's been floating around in 4:3 limbo forever.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "I've never seen Charade before, this seems like a glaring omission in my cinematic education. Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, I could go on. Henri Mancini provides the score over a gloriously 60s infused opening sequence, that introduces Regina Lampert (Hepburn) and Peter Joshua (Grant) in all their effortless cinematic glory. We just don't put stars like this on screen anymore. Their opening exchange is fast, funny and fabulous. Regina is a wealthy woman thanks to her husband who she's planning to divorce. Before she gets chance, he turns up dead in Paris where they live, having unbeknownst to her, sold all their possessions for a quarter million in auction while Regina was away skiing and chatting to Peter. He was planning to scarper to South America, but never made it. Despite, we find out, owning 4 passports with different identities. We have ourselves a mystery! One that kicks into gear at the deceased sparsely attended funeral, as a string of unusual characters come to pay their respects... and check that Charles is dead. Despite the obvious cloak and dagger direction we're headed, the one liners are relentless. It's a lot funnier than you'd expect something like this to be. Enter the excellently named Hamilton Bartholomew (Matthau) with that killer wry smile. He says he's a \"CIA Desk Jockey\" and dishes all the dirt. Producing a photo of Charles with his mates Tex, Herman & Leo in uniform who all want the quarter mil... as does Bartholomew. To be honest I'd already spotted the clue as to where the money is in the opening 10 minutes, I've clearly watched too many films. But anyway Regina is tasked trying to find the money she's completely in the dark about. She needs help, she needs Peter. Only because this is the 60s and \"(A)young woman can't handle (this) by herself\". Their double act works though, but not in the suave elegant leading man, leading lady sort of way. There's not really any chemistry, despite Grant being dashing and Hepburn being vivacious. Comedically though they click. Now I'm a little loathed to divulge too many of the twists, but suffice to say there are many and most of the players have a trick up their sleeve, especially Herman (George Kennedy) who has a steel mechanical claw like something from a Bond movie. No one is quite what they seem and this deftly dances around with characters dodging, double crossing and generally pulling the wool over each other and our eyes. It's a lot of fun. It lacks the style that Grant delivered with Hitchcock in North By Northwest, but it's definitely singing from the Hitch playbook. Despite its tone of slapstick, it does the menace and mystery of espionage well too, not least with Herman and his claw. It's a really odd mix though and I'm not sure how I feel about watching Cary Grant shower in a suit or Walter Matthau doing squats on the telephone. Essentially we've an hour of smoke, mirrors and messing around, book ended with a great half hour either side. Everyone is great, looks great. It's cut well and uses its Parisian location beautifully. Mancini's music is gorgeous, it's a lovely piece of cinema. A classic. I didn't grip me though as I'd expect it might, but although the twists become glaringly obvious I did still really enjoy it.",

Returning back home to Paris from a ski vacation in the Alps Reggie is first shocked to find that her very spacious apartment suite is totally empty of clothes and furniture. Later Reggie gets the shock of her life in finding that the police did in fact find Charles dead from being thrown from a speeding train.With this mysterious Peter Joshua, among his many other aliases, played by the very cheerful charming and witty Cary Grant popping up all over the place we're, both Reggie and the audience, walked through the movies very complicated plot that has to do with a missing 250,000.00 dollars in gold. The gold that was stolen from the French Resistance back in 1944. It seems that the CIA, back in 1944 when it was called the OSS, was involved in this transaction that was covertly sabotaged by four of it's very greedy and unpatriotic member. One of them included the now deceased Charles Lampert. The three surviving former OSS agents, or spies, Tex Herman & Lenny, James Coburn George Kennedy & Ned Glass, are now out looking for the stolen gold and feel that Reggie being that she was married to Charles, a member of the gang of four who suspected of stealing the money , knows where the missing cash is and will go so far as to commit murder to get it.The movie \"Charade\" has so many twists and turns that by the time that its over you feel like a pretzel in trying to follow them. There's Reggie and the mysterious Peter Joshua getting involved in all sorts of entanglements with the three former OSS agents in their attempt to find the missing money. The fact that the money is right in front of them, in what Charles had with him on the train at the time of his murder. This is all so obvious that for a moment I had the feeling that they were either too blind or drunk, on that rich exquisite and full bodied French wine, for them to see it and that includes both Reggie and Peter.Peter who changes identifies like you would change socks during the movie. From a member of the Rothschild family to the brother of one of the crooked OSS men, who was killed by the Germans, to an agent of the US Treasury Department or Diplomatic Corps or to just plain Gary Grant. The guy is just a bit, to say the least, too much for the already confused and befuddled Riggie to take. Riggie later gets in touch, in order to get a handle of just what exactly is going on, with the CIA's man in Paris the ultra secretive and shadowy H. Bartholemeu, Walter Matthau. Bartholemeu comes across as being so oily and slippery, in his keeping things to himself, that he looks like he was accidentally dropped into a barrel of crude oil, doesn't make things any better for her as well.It soon becomes obvious that one of the four surviving renegade OSS agents is the one who murdered Charles Lampert. With the other ex-OSS men getting knocked off one by one until there's none of the ex-OSS men left alive to find the stolen and missing cash it becomes quite clear that the killer might very well be the lovable and friendly Peter Joshua himself. An eccentric sort of a guy who's so harmless and lovable, even though he can get a bit testy and sarcastic when you push him too far, that you wouldn't worry at all about him being left alone with your teenage daughter or your pet poodle.Like they say looks can be deceiving and from what we've seen in Peter's strange and bizarre actions like taking showers with all his, except his shoes, clothes on he might very well not be what we, and Reggie, all think that he actually is: A happy go lucky bumbling, if not a bit fluttery between the ears, schmuck.",

Rather than charming and feminine female character I always turn to older movies for, Hepburn is cold and hysterical. No help comes from unmotivated Grant, and Matthau, Coburn and Kennedy are all underused. The most dumbfounding disappointment though is the location: despite being shot in Paris, the movie stays mostly inside seedy hotel rooms and offices, and even when the action takes us outside, we're treated to process shots and fake backgrounds. This gives the film the hopeless, depressing feel of a Disney sitcom, where you know nothing exciting is going to happen as the plot won't escape the constrains of the 5 rooms it's trapped within.Pros: Henry Mancini score, some witty dialogue in the first actCons: Boring, contrived, claustrophobic",

She was a big star at this time and had already appeared in \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" - her iconic performance. This film finds her in a role that is not that impressive nor character-heavy. She portrays Regina Lampert the wife of a husband who is killed as the film opens. As an investigation ensues, she discovers that her husband, who was fabulously wealthy, had stolen money from the American government and had been a CIA man. Walter Matthau portrays Hamilton Bartholomew, who is supposedly on her side and whom she trusts. Regina discovers that three men are after the money her husband left and have threatened to kill her, thinking she is in possession of the money. Cary Grant's character is a man with many names who is also lying to Regina and whom we mistakenly believe is also after her money. Deception, lies, murder, CIA, are all elements in this mystery thriller which also pretends to be a romance. Cary Grant, no longer the young and handsome talent he had once been, is still charming and very funny. But the romance element is hardly the focus in this film. For fans of movies of Audrey Hepburn, you'll find that this one is not entirely romantic and some parts appear to have been inspired by the popular \"pulp fiction\" movies of the time. At times, owing to the music by Henry Mancini such as the opening credits music, the film has the feel of a James Bond movie. Add to that a girl running for her life, three dangerous men (one with a hook for a hand) and Cary Grant's debonair role and you do feel this is a James Bond movie. But what we have here is a mix of romantic comedy and thriller, almost as if it is poking fun of the thriller and mystery genre. I've loved Audrey Hepburn movies in the past and she is clearly comfortable in various types of films but this one is too much of an attempt to appear in a genre that is not suited to her. The best performances here are neither Grant and Hepburn who try to do romantic comedy in an otherwise bleak murder setting. Walter Matthau is a two-faced guy, who does it without even looking truly murderous, is the strongest performance, followed by James Coburn and George Kennedy. Filmed on location in Paris, with Charles Lang's usually excellent cinematography, and Givenchy's beautiful and chic wardrobes, this is a movie that is good and at the same time bad. I didn't care for the script and the comedy, considered old fashioned and early 60's inside jokes, can be lost to modern audiences. At times you don't know what this movie is trying to be. It's not the type of romance Hepburn did in \"Funny Face\" or \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\". It's Audrey Hepburn doing a film with mystery and thriller elements which was becoming more and more popular throughout the 60's. The romantic comedy elements are written into the dialogue mostly. Certain scenes are very \"60's\". For instance, the nightclub \"orange\" game in which couples pass an orange using their bodies and not using their hands has strong sexual innuendo, a sign of the more sexually liberated times of the 60's. The ending is abrupt and rather unusual and the romance happens far too quickly. But if you like Audrey Hepburn movies and if you like Cary Grant, this is the one film they did together and Charade has always had some appeal and fame, considered to be a classic.",

Charade is unexpectedly a great mixture of Comedy, Romance, Mystery and Thriller that you just can't hate. Charade is fully deserving to be known as 'Best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made'. A story of a window who is pursued by several men for the sake of fortune which her murdered husband had stolen. Charade is a great script i must say, although screenplay is imperfectly perfect. The first meeting of Grant and Hepburn doesn't sound like a real incident. Come on, a formal hello to stranger doesn't make you fall in love. But after that, Charade is flawless for next 110 minutes and you will keep counting the twists it has till 'The End' slate appears. Cary Grant worked in 4 films of Hitchcock but to be frank i Personally found most of them overrated, especially after watching Charade those films surely looks overrated or may be Charade is Underrated. Charade has more twists than all those Hitchcok-Grant films which are known as classics and additionally Charade is more entertaining and more romantic. Now you can compare these 5 films of Grant and Charade might just Top the list. Cary Grant plays a very healthy character in charade as he's constantly changing his identity and making us blow away and when you just think no he's telling the truth this time, he's actually got more twists to follow. Even the last scene of the film has a surprise for you. Like i said he finally gets more entertaining and more twisty thriller he couldn't get with Hitchcock and thanks to god for making it happen during the last phase of his career. Audrey Hepburn looks elegant and sizzles with Grant. She got most of the laughter lines to mouth. The only problem is Grant looked too old for her with those white hairs and old look. Kudos to Stanley Donen for making a solid compilation of 4 genres and delivering a Classic Movie. You know mixing 4 genres and still making a logical and engaging film is a very tough job and Donen did it exceptionally well. Charade is Must Watch and deserves more recognition by the audience. 7.9/10 is surely Underrated for this Awesome Show.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Charade is supposedly the result of Singin' In The Rain's director gambling his better hand on a Hitchcockian thriller. There are echoes of and references to Spellbound, Stage Fright and North by Northwest, but rather than being remotely Hitchcockian, Charade is silky, glittery, childish, overacted and far too self-aware to be in any way thrilling. Cary Grant referring to Audrey Hepburn's apartment \"on the street where you live\" is the kind of fun little reference to the musical work of his stars that Stanley Donen would probably be interested in. Frankly, if Donen had adjoined musical numbers or a repertoire of prominent theme songs, that kind of consistency would've made it glorious, but in its present condition it's a trivial case of star-cuddling.Everything is too bouncy, there is no danger, even for the foundling-like Audrey Hepburn moving up and down on waves of trickery after her worthless husband disappears and is reported dead. With this pitch established, the film's march of assassinations and laborious twists are carried with a jolly indifference, punchlines to frivolous gags. It would have a sense of anticipation of tension if Donen didn't capture Paris as a silky castle in the sky. This movie is so flippant and vain, it skirts on scatterbrained. However, the writing is clever, and if Cary Grant is your leading man, you might as well take full advantage of that fact.Grant was more overstatedly Grant in this movie than he'd been in anything since his slapstick days, that manic persona translated with age into his trademark broken bluster, puckered look of offended sensibilities, his ribbing impression of being able to get precisely what he wants if he could only afford the sweat. When one particular hooligan, out of a zanily over-the-top group of such brutes, pushes him to a rooftop with the intent of teaching him to fly, Grant is so earnestly matter-of-fact: \"All right, but the view better be worth it.\" He's superb, but Donen's lack of economy in indulging his charisma plugs up the momentum like brakes on what's supposed to be a racecar.Hepburn is a good equal, all jolts and moans, carrying the kind of frustrated babe-in-the-woods openness of her Susy Hendrix in Wait Until Dark, although far more virginal. The most un-Hitchcockian thing about the movie is watching them become smitten, which ironically would be significantly expedited if she could solve where his allegiances truly lie. There is a tangle of secrets and deceit to decipher, and the location of a hoard of money her dead husband had supposedly pilfered from his friends, played with casual heartlessness by James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. But the plot is mere lip service. It's the sagging of Hepburn's suspicion that matters, and the anchoring of Grant's contrariness. Just slurp the silky romance of the movie's most famed line, as Hepburn's intoxicated Regina rends her heart asunder: \"Do you know what's wrong with you?\" she asks of Peter. \"Nothing.\"",

It is so obvious who the villain is from the very beginning of the movie. Grant should have retired before this rubbish.

I'd have to say they took it pretty well in stride to create an entertaining comedy/mystery that more than a few viewers on this board compared to an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. My thoughts were in agreement as the film started out as well, the train sequence was a regular Hitchcock motif.What was distracting to me though was the age disparity between the fifty nine year old Grant at the time, romantically paired with Hepburn who was thirty two. This wasn't uncommon for the era, but it comes across as rather unrealistic today. Grant's shower scene with his suit on would have played much better with a younger actor, and probably more credible. But in relation to the main story, I think they more than pulled it off with Grant's constant change of identity right up until the surprise reveal at the American embassy. What the picture did more than anything for me was to wish that we had gotten a look at the 'real' Charles Voss. He must have been quite the character if all three of his funeral attendees felt it necessary to test the integrity of the corpse. Reading some of the other reviews for this picture, and even though I enjoyed it quite well myself, I would have to agree that there's a somewhat dated quality to the writing, most notably at the finale with Regina Lampert's (Hepburn) gushing over the idea of a marriage license. That's something that was all too typical Fifties and Sixties that wouldn't pass muster with today's audiences.",

The plot involves buried treasure--more or less--and three violent men who are as convincing as the Three Stooges, and a supposed chemistry between Grant and Hepburn.The repartee between Hepburn and Grant is about as sparkling as yesterday's ginger ale. The plot is ridiculous, and the denouement is incredibly bad. What I don't understand is how this film can be carrying an extremely high rating of 8.0 from IMDb viewers. My thoughts are that maybe people had a very different outlook about plot in the early 1960's, or they were so dazzled by Hepburn's beauty that they didn't care about the plot.If you want to see this film, it will work well on DVD.

Charade is a classical romantic-comedy disguised as a spy thriller. The first noticeable sign that this is going to be brilliant is the witty and quick dialogue. Most comedies today don't generate so many belly laughs. This is a serious world, filled with real people. This means that everyone has a slight sense of humor, and interesting character quirks.

But Donen has directed and produced many other successful films, most of them between the 50's and 70's of the last century. Blessed with a long life, Donen died two months ago, and on this occasion the local cinematheque screened a few of his films. On this occasion, we saw 'Charade', a typical blockbuster entertainment for that period, combining the genres of espionage thriller and romantic comedy, taking place in tourist advertising landscapes and casting famous celebrities whose clothes gave the tone of the fashion to the times. It's here that the James Bond series started.The main heroine of the film is an American young woman (Audrey Hepburn, permanently dressed impeccably by the Givenchy house) who finds herself a widow of a husband she did not know much about and whom she was planning to divorce, deprived of the comfortable life she had before, in an illustrated postcards Paris. Moreover, she is suspected by the French police of being involved in her husband's violent death and becomes the target of the pursuit of a gang of picturesque gangsters who are convinced that she is the possessor of a wealth she has no idea about. She is helped or at least seems to be by another American in Paris (Cary Grant, about 26 years older on screen and in reality) and a clerk of the American embassy (Walter Matthau). Our heroine will inevitably fall in love with the older man despite the age difference, but he also seems to hide more than one secret and will assume successively several different identities. The love story and action thriller progress in parallel with the game of changing identities of the hero, with the young woman having to guess and choose permanently between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' while the number of corpses increases.The introduction scene and the generic are so modern that in the first two or three minutes I was wondering whether I entered the wrong cinema hall and I was seeing a new movie. I cannot say the same about everything that followed. I never was a great enthusiast of Cary Grant's type of actor and I believe that the difference in age between him and Audrey Hepburn makes the relationship between them on screen look not so credible in this movie. High quality acting creations can rather be found in the secondary roles, and here we have an exceptional cast including Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy, all of them gorgeous actors. Paris of the 1960s looks very well, filmed with the characters one in pursuit of the other. It is said that 'Charade' is Hitchcock's best film that was not filmed by Hitchcock. The reason is that around the same period the master of suspense made several films based on spy stories, including 'North by Northwest', which also features Cary Grant, or 'Topaz', which also takes place in part in Paris. I believe that Hitchcock would have been able to get more out of this movie, perhaps with different casting, perhaps with a more subtle use of the identity mysteries in order to create a denser suspense atmosphere. I am sure however that he would have liked Henry Mancini's music. Anyway, 'Charade' remains now, 56 years after being released, overall, more than honorable entertainment.",

Besides, the stars here, Grant and Hepburn, have enough charm and charisma to slide us over the logical rough spots. Then too, the narrative is a cleverly constructed guessing game. We never know what the next twist will be, right down to the final scene. Thus we're engaged from the start. Still, the 2-hour runtime is more than the developments need. But then plot threads have to accommodate the two celebrities with enough personal screen time to show their shine. Lengthening runtime was always a problem with star-studded A-productions, and is why many of those compact old B-movies often carried greater impact. Impact's not a particular problem here, since the screenplay does a pretty good job of combining star-power with storyline, even if concessions to Grant and Hepburn are made.

Both movies are set-in-France mysteries in which Grant stars opposite a glamorous woman born in 1929. But I notice something else about \"Charade\": a series of patterns relating to the number 7. Bear with me.The word \"charade\" has seven letters. It was released in 1963, and 63 is 7 times 9. Cary Grant died in 1986, Audrey Hepburn in 1993, and Walter Matthau in 2000, all at seven year intervals.

So are the chicken and liver wurst sequence with Walter Matthau, hilarious as it unfolds but lacking in credibility when you reach the end of the film. Are smart dialogues the criterion to judge good screenplays?Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are great to watch but are they providing great performances? Even Henry Mancini has made better music for films than in this one. George Kennedy's character is never developed. The film seems to anticipate the James Bond films right from the title sequence.While I heartily agree the film is an enjoyable family film that keeps you engrossed as any good thriller should, I am surprised it made the grade of the top 250 films on this website. You might consider it to be a classic only if you were not exposed to the cinema made in France, Cuba, and Eastern Europe in the Sixties and Seventies.",

I'm sure I saw it years ago when we were confined to TV with one or two channels, but with the online choices we have now I can't believe I watched it to the end. The plot was easy to follow, the 'twists' were all predictable, and in the end I just didn't give a toss. The 'romance' was one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen - a relationship between a 60 year old man, who never was that attractive, and a supposed crush from Audrey Hepburn, about half his age and one of the most appealing women in movies. Nah, toe-curling stuff. Much idiocy thrown in, and much of which one would now find quite repulsive - the crass joke about rolling an orange over the breasts of a woman who was actually around the same age as Grant, and the utterly stupid shower shot. The rest of the cast can hang their heads, or just take the money and run, apart from Matthau, who was passable. I'm so glad we've graduated from nonsense like this.",

The dialogue (I am sure) must be clever and (at times) amusing but not funny. Perhaps the comedy is that a man of advancing years (Cary Grant was 59) could convince a young lady (Audrey Hepburn was 34) that, no matter how many times he lied to her about who he was, she was still in love with him (whoever he was at the time!). Ignoring the absurdity of all that means that we have a pretty good thriller with top class actors (Grant, Hepburn and the magnificent Matthau).

            "content": "Suspense movies don't get any better than this one. A great cast lead by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with an excellent supporting cast. Hepburn is married to a man who turns out to be a thief from WWII. Along with four other OSS agents that were suppose to deliver $250K in gold to the French underground. They buried it instead and reported it stolen by the Nazi's during an ambush. Hepburn's husband doesn't wait for the rest but steals it first. So the remaining three show up after her husband is murdered trying to leave. There are only three left because Grant's brother (?) was one of the five but he is dead. There is some nice word play about spies/agents between Matthau (supposedly a CIA desk jockey) and Hepburn. Grant is superb as the suave, urbane, witty, older man to the rescue or is he?? There appears to be another player in the game as the three OSS thieves start getting killed off one by one. Turns out there is no brother, Grant confesses he is actually a thief (or is he?) and is trying for the gold also. Every time Grant is caught in one of his lies about his name and who or what he is/does he comes up with another name and occupation. Since this film was made in 1963 it only follows that the Hepburn must fall for the much older Grant but he does a role reversal and plays hard to get. Things start coming to a head as the nears it's end, of course it has too after all. It seems that the gold got converted into three very valuable stamps and are hidden on an envelope. This has been given to Hepburn's nephew and he trades them to a stamp collector for a whole bunch of worthless stamps. This guy turn out to be a rare thing, an honest man. He gives the stamps back to her. Thinking Grant is the killer and is now after her she calls Matthau and they are to meet. Grant and her pass in the hotel. He follows her to the train station where she ends up calling the US embassy. Here is where we find out that it has been Matthau all along who is the real bad guy. He is the fifth man that was left behind to die and is the killer and is now after the stamps. So now there is the chase scene only it is on foot. The chase ends up in an empty theater. There is a clever ending in the theater when Grant drops Matthau through a trap door ending his involvement. At the very end Grant is a treasury agent and has been trying to recover the loot. The two of them go off into the future to get married and live happily ever after.",

            "content": "\"Funny Face\" director Stanley Donen's suspenseful and mysterious crime thriller \"Charade\" assembles Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn together in Paris as they search for a quarter of a million dollars. Composer Henry Mancini received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Music Score. The cast is first-class with George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau playing the villains who will do whatever it takes to find the loot. \"Charade\" has enough twists and turns to keep you interested throughout its 113 minute running time. The scene where Grant has to remove an orange from a stout woman's body in a French restaurant without using his hands is amusing.The story really begins in World War II when the villains were U.S. Army agents working with the Office of Strategic Services. This quintet was ordered to deliver $200-thousand dollars to the French Resistance. The resistance never got the money The action opens as a body of Charles Lampert is hurled from a train careening through Europe. The authorities find Lampert's pajama-clad corpse lying next to the tracks of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line. According to the dates, the police reported Lampert's death on May 4, 1963. Meantime, the murdered man's wife, Regina (Audrey Hepburn) is planning to divorce Charles because she doesn't love him. She feels that Charles has been keeping something from her. When she returns to Paris, Regina finds their apartment barren and a police inspector, Inspector Edouard Grandpierre (Jacques Marin of \"Shaft in Africa\"), waiting for her. Later, in his office, Inspector Grandpierre points out that Charles had bought a ticket for a ship sailing in the morning for Venezuela. Naturally, Regina is confused. She tells Grandpierre that Charles was a Swiss citizen. He tells the policeman that Charles had no profession. Not only does stashed his money. An exasperated Grandpierre wants to know what happened to the quarter of a million dollars that Charles received from the public auction where he sold the contents of their apartment. The only thing found that belonged to Lampert was a blue Lufthansa traveling bag with his passport, an unsealed letter, a wallet with four thousand francs, an agenda with the last notation written on a Thursday, a ticket to South America, a comb, toothbrush, and a container of tooth powder, etc. Now, Regina is truly mystified by all this information.Later, she runs into a mystery man who she met initially at the ski resort and afterward at her apartment. Regina tells this individual that she plans to get her job back at EURESCO where she works as a simultaneous translator like her friend Sylvie. Unlike Sylvie who translated English into French, Regina translates French into English. She was working as a translator before she met and married Charles. Since she cannot remain at the apartment, Regina allows her mystery man to help her find an affordable hotel. The scene that ensues is pretty strange. Essentially, the villains make their entrance at the funeral. Aside from Sylvie and Regina, the only person attending the funeral is Grandpierre. The inspector sits quietly and clips his fingernails. The first of the villains to enter is Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass of \"Blindfold\"); he sneezes on Charles' corpse. The next is Tex Panthollow (James Coburn of \"Our Man Flint\") and he checks Charles' corpse with a mirror to be sure that he is dead. After Tex comes Herman Scobie (George Kennedy of \"Cool Hand Luke\") who has a mechanical contraption in place of his right hand; he sticks pin into the corpse to check it. A short, thickset man appears after Scobie storms out and hands Regina with a letter from the U.S. Embassy. An official named Bartholomew requests Regina's presence at his office at noon-thirty. Bartholomew is \"anxious to discuss the matter\" of Charles' death. Bartholomew tells Regina about the war and the mission that Charles embarked on with the others. Bartholomew is an administer for the CIA, He informs Regina that Charles was wanted by the U.S. Government. Specifically, the CIA wants Charles because the money that he received from the auction. Bartholomew tells Regina that Charles stole $250-thousand from the U.S. Government. He suspects that she has the money, but she claims that she doesn't. Nevertheless, Bartholomew urges her to find the money because she is in a great deal of danger. Things really get sticky after this interview.\"Mirage\" scenarist Peter Stone relies on misinformation to distract audiences from solving the mystery as well as the whereabouts of stolen fortune. Although the dialogue is often neat, it isn't quotable. Hepburn gets ample opportunities to scream, be harassed, and feel betrayed, while Grant epitomizes suave sophistication in a suit and tie. Charles Lang's photography is excellent and the camera work in the morgue is imaginative. Hepburn looks gorgeous in a variety of outfits. James Coburn menaces Hepburn in a telephone booth at one point by striking matches and throwing them at her. \"Charade\" qualifies as an exciting but literate woman-in-jeopardy thriller.",

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)This is a distinctly Stanley Donen film (some others: Singin' in the Rain 1952, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers 1954, Funny Face 1957, Damn Yankees 1958, Indiscreet 1958) characterized by light comedy prepared expressly for the middle American palate a little past mid-century, professionally done with offense to no one. There is just the barest hint of satire with a few laugh-at-the-genre jokes but nothing so blatant as to detract from the woman's fantasy, wish-fulfillment that is the essential point.One of the jokes in the film is that Audrey Hepburn always kisses Cary Grant first. This is entirely appropriate, I suppose, considering that he was at the time 59-years-old and she was 34. Both were (and are) two of Hollywood's enduring stars, Miss Hepburn perhaps at or near the pinnacle of her career when this movie was made, and Cary Grant in his last significant role. The chemistry is nice, creative and there are some funny lines. She chases him and he catches her, is the way it is played, when of course it is usually the other way around: HE chases her and SHE catches him!The stars are given fine support from Walter Matthau, James Colburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass in quasi-comedic roles as a quartet of sinister bad guys. The music (and the memorable \"Charade\" theme) are by Henry Mancini whose musical scores adorned nearly a hundred Hollywood movies beginning in the fifties. I particularly remember his music from the Pink Panther flicks in the sixties and seventies.Director Stanley Donen, despite being a paragon of commercial success, has a quality of making sardonic fun of the audience or of his stars in a way that is barely discernible. I think it's the cynicism of the Hollywood product that he became so adept at making, and his subconscious realization of what he was doing, that sometimes seeps through. Here he begins with \"Boy Meets Girl, Cute\" in the Alps with Hepburn in a costume reminiscent of something out of the middle ages, covering almost as much of her as a burka, her beautiful eyes masked by big dark glasses. It's a joke and perhaps a setup for contrast. When Audrey Hepburn smiles and her eyes light up in delight, she is most arresting. Imagine the whole film without seeing her eyes. (In Blame It on Rio 1984, Donen deliberately had Michael Caine in those hideous square plastic frames big enough for Mrs.Doubtfire.) And what I mean by Donen's attitude toward his audience, that he believes they only want familiar escapism, is the touristy feel of the Parisian scenes in which most of the action takes place. They are mostly spots frequented by American tourists seeing Europe for the first time, the Seine, the Metro, the Arc d'Triumph, Notre Dame cathedral, the Louis XVI apartment sans furnishing, the Paris opera house, etc. The fact that we can't be sure who-done-it until the very end when it becomes obvious by the process of elimination, didn't sit well with me. I also did not like the chase scenes in the Metro because it seemed abundantly silly to imagine that Hepburn in her long skirt and dress shoes could outrun Cary Grant, who had, in a previous scene, engaged in fisticuffs a bigger man (Kennedy with a steel claw for one of his hands). Nonetheless, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn together for the first (and only) time is a treat not to be missed. Cary Grant is particularly good as he maintains a wry stoicism against the power of Miss Hepburn's charms. Noteworthy is the excellent camera work exemplified in the two shots of Hepburn's face caught in light and shadow in the Paris opera house.For those of you thinking of seeing Jonathan Demme's remake of this film, The Truth About Charlie (2002), I would caution against it since the unreality of the story borders on the ridiculous and must be played as comedy. Without the star power and some of the clever dialogue of Donen's film I am afraid the plot contrivances would be embarrassingly exposed, although the idea of getting a quarter of a million dollars past customs in the form of very expensive (hint: small) art objects that appear to be ordinary objects, is a nice device that would probably work.See this for Cary Grant whose rugged good looks and smooth and effortless delivery made him a Hollywood legend and the epitome of a suave leading man.",

With a central plot/love story hinging on the relationship between the Grant and Hepburn characters. And...this is where Charade succeeds greatly as the chemistry between the two is strong, thanks to the smart, forward-thinking idea of having Hepburn as on top of her game as Grant is of his. She is no \"damsel in distress\", but rather a worthy sparring partner for Grants (and the other mugs).Of course, it doesn't hurt that Hepburn is dressed - impeccably - by Edith Head in stunning Givenchy outfits all set to the music of Henry Mancini.Speaking of mugs, they don't get more character-y to look at than Matthau, Coburn, Kennedy and Glass and they all are terrific in their roles as shadowy, sinister figures who are after something that they think Hepburn has...but she just might not have it.Beautifully shot by Donen in Paris of the early 1960's, this film captures a bygone era and a real feeling of a romanticized and glamorous Europe. This is interesting characters doing interesting things in an interesting way in an interesting place.And...I'm glad all of this is interesting, for if you stopped for a moment to think about the plot - or the rather languid pace of this film - then Charade would lose quite a bit of it's luster and appeal.But, fortunately for me, I didn't do that. I sat and immersed myself in these characters, settings and circumstances and was rewarded with a very entertaining evening brought to the screen by master players who know what they are doing.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",

            "content": "I have always wondered when 1960's movies started using those rather psychedelic and/or cartoon title intro sequences. And always with the accompaniment of some exotic-inspired music soundtrack with conga drums accompanying lush strings. It came into vogue somewhere in the early 1960's with The Pink Panther, Doris Day films, and other light-hearted action-comedies. Even the original James Bond films jumped on the band-wagon. Charade, a movie NOT directed by Hitchcock, uses the psychedelic opening with the letters of the words dancing around the screen to Latin jazz rhythms which immediately gives away its 1960's roots.The plot is simple enough. Audrey Hepburn's spouse is dispatched and dumped from a train in France before the titles of the movie start dancing around the screen. Turns out he had $250,000 in his possession but the loot has vanished. For a guy worth $100,000's, no one comes to his funeral in Paris except three American baddies, a one-hand trench-coat, a southern red-neck, and an allergic nerd. They didn't come to sob at the funeral. Instead, they each visit Hepburn demanding the dearly departed's money. They threaten to dispatch her they way they did her husband. Of course, she turns out to be a lot more difficult than her husband who appears to have been knocked off without much of a struggle. She then turns to Cary Grant for help, until she discovers he has been lying about who he is. Whom can she trust? And of course, there is Walter Matthau, an American agent (or spy?), who represents the US government's interest in retrieving the money.What saves the movie is the clever banter between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Of course, Grant has the wittiest lines, although Hepburn keeps up with him stride-for-stride, or rather line-for-line. At one point Hepburn points out she is a widow, and Grant replies that so was Juliet at 15. To which Hepburn says \"I am not 15!\" Grant then replies \"Well that's your trouble. You're too old for me.\" Grant was almost 60 and Hepburn was 34 when they made this movie.If some of the actors playing the baddies used their footage in this movie as the final exam for an acting class, they would have failed miserably. It's amazing the likes of George Kennedy and James Coburn weren't in the actors' unemployment line after the release of Charade. And some of the writing is also a bit weak, especially Kennedy, replete with prosthetic metal hand, walking around groaning \"Give me the money!\" And James Coburn as a Midwest red-neck called Tex whose lines are little better, if you can distinguish the words through his rough-and-ready rather mediocre attempt at a Texas accent. I doubt whether real Texans could understand what he is saying! You will neither confuse this movie with Film Noir of a couple of decades earlier nor with action movies a couple of decades later. The entire look and feel was born out of a slightly new Hollywood style where filmmakers were trying to give their work a little more pizazz than some of the overly fluffy stuff produced in the 1950's. Action movies were no longer set in dark urban America where lesser-known actors limped into alleyways to avoid their pursuers. Now, they were shot on location all over the world, often in Europe, with the biggest movie stars imaginable. And the experience wouldn't be complete without the innocent sexual innuendo that permeates these films. In Charade, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, the Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig of Hollywood, take the audience on a roller-coaster ride of entertainment masquerading as over-the-top intrigue. It is just pure escapist entertainment, and you'll also breathe a little when you disembark from the roller-coaster. And it is a perfect representative of a bygone era of Hollywood film-making.",

After repeated viewings, I didn't feel so negative about it anymore, but I still experience it as an uneven combination of light comedy and suspenseful mystery that suffers from some badly misplaced elements.Firstly, the three villains played by Coburn, Kennedy and Glass really seem to belong in another movie, as they are way too quirky characters for this kind of glossy flick. (There's also a terribly annoying kid with his water pistol.) Secondly, the romantic angle between Grant and Hepburn seems ludicrous, mainly due to the huge age gap.Although there are indeed some very nice location shots around Paris, nearly the entire middle section of the film takes place indoors and tends to drag on a bit. Also, Hepburn's acting doesn't quite convince at every turn, but that's almost inessential since she looks so elegant in her Givenchy costumes.

            "content": "The one thing that this film really has going for it the entire time is, indeed, the script. Never once does it let itself down and never once does it shy away from what it should be doing. The script has a certain degree of cynicism in it and this adds to the comedy throughout. After the early exchanges and dialogue, it could've gone done a slightly different route and taken a more serious approach but it didn't and credit where credit's due because it stuck to its guns. Everything is quick and witty and this is blended it with a very interesting and mysterious atmosphere which really works well.Often the film will make you laugh and there are simply too many one-liners and jokes within the dialogue to list. This works well in juxtaposition with the air of mystery and murder also contained throughout. People may be dying rather gruesome and unpleasant deaths throughout but the fact 'they all died in their pyjamas' is a fantastic example that you shouldn't really take it too seriously. In fact, it's like the film is actually ashamed of being too graphic and too serious, but it works in its own little unique way. The music also adds to this experience as it's often rather dark and foreboding and to me, it sounded a little ahead of its time.What's also interesting is the setting. We really do see both sides of the city of Paris in this film. You have grotty hotels and dank little streets but there's also the element of romance thrown in amongst a wonderful boat ride scene. This is ultimately a hint as to the love interest forming between the two of them from one characters point of view, at least. Also; the dialogue, bizarrely enough, actually echoes when the scene is taken under a bridge via the boat ride even though it doesn't LOOK like they're on location. It was a nice touch, anyway.The story clearly plays second fiddle to the script as Grant's character takes on so many different aliases; it's close to impossible to keep up on a first viewing. The fact that all of the characters whom are 'at war' with one another within the narrative are all within a few feet of one another pretty much throughout the film is another odd thing about this film but it doesn't detract too much.A final thought is the scene where the child asks James Coburn's character 'if he's a real cowboy' or not. A rather quaint little 'nod' to 'The Magnificent Seven' from three years earlier.",

She meets Peter Joshua (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Cary Grant), well, this is the first name he gives her, he changes his name every fifteen minutes or so, but not so much his back story that there is a Mrs. ?, but they are divorced, anyway, he too is interested in her husband's fortune, which was stolen from the U.S. government during World War II. The husband's former partners in crime: Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), are staying close to Reggie as well as they are sure she may be hiding the whereabouts of the gold, Peter says that he will help her getaway from them, but in fact he is apparently in cahoots with them to get the money. Reggie and Peter are staying together and following all the clues that would lead to where the money is hidden, but one by one the other searchers are turning up dead, and it is only a matter of time before the killer catches up to them in this charade. CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) from the U.S. Embassy is the only one Reggie can trust besides Peter, and although he continues to change his name, from Peter Joshua to Alexander 'Alex' Dyle, to Adam Canfield, and not telling her everything she perhaps wants to know, she cannot help but find herself falling for him, and vice versa. Eventually it is discovered that the fortune is not gold or money at all, the fortune all rests on the value of a bunch of postage stamps, but Peter and Bartholemew have Reggie cornered, and she unsure whether to believe her love interest or the supposed government officer, in the end she goes with her heart, Peter reveals himself to be an investigator in the case of the missing fortune all along, and he assures her she will know his real name on their marriage certificate, Reggie is happy, they will marry once Peter gets the stamps back. Also starring Jacques Marin as Inspector Edouard Grandpierre, Dominique Minot as Sylvie Gaudet and Thomas Chelimsky as Jean-Louis Gaudet. Grant as usual is charming and cool, Hepburn is glamorous and cast well as the woman in the middle, the pairing of them is perfect, supporting cast members Matthau, Coburn and Kennedy all add well to the mix as well, the ravishing Paris locations work well for the story as the search for a hidden fortune goes on, the romantic and tense music by Henry Mancini is great, there are the lovely couple sequences, the exciting action sequences, and there are good moments to laugh at, it all adds up to a satisfying romantic comedy thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for \"Charade\".

But its Competency is No Surprise and its Delight is Determined Beforehand. It is Simply a Well Crafted Homage to Hitchcock that is Dated with most of its Charm Highly 1963-ish.The Most Striking Flourish that seems Progressive is the Way Director Stanley Donen Disposes of the Bad Guys with a Static Scene of Bloody and Terrifying Images. He Pulled that from the Collective Consciousness as Movies were Showing Signs in the Imaginations of Hip Filmmakers that the Code was in Need of a Quick and Decisive Death. But the Codes Demise would Not be very Quick and Not so Decisive. It will take another Five Years or so and it Would Erode before it was Laid to Rest.What Makes this Charming Movie seem Really Dated? Well for One Thing Audrey Hepburn's Clothes, although by some Hotshot Designer, are about as Attractive and Sexy as an Egyptian Mummy. Tightly Wrapped from Head to Toe the Attire was Simply Stifling and Dull. Another is the Cute and Cuddly Way the Gary Grant and Hepburn Characters Exchange Highly Witty Banter that can only Come Contrived by a Script. Yes, it is Debonair but Occasionally just Silly. The Villains are a Bit Boring and One Dimensional, Stiff and are Caricature. Here are Two More, The Shower Scene and the Oranges Segments can Cause a Cringe Today.But Beginning with a Snazzy, almost Psychedelic Credit Sequence the Movie does Maintain its Intentions for the Two Hours. A Fine Film, but Not Great and Not a Classic.",

At least the police, trained to notice details, ought to have seen it. And how could Regina, when she was all out of money and all her wardrobes empty in the flat, still wear a new very expensive coat every time she goes outside..? But one does not care about these flaws, because when one watches a movie with either Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn, the main reason is that one wants to see THEM! He still so incredibly handsome and desirable there at age 59, and she so lithe and beautiful, and them both so elegant in their perfect clothes and hair-styles... The dialogue is witty most of the time (but sometimes silly), and one also gets to see a bit of Paris. This is elegance for all times!",

It is funny, exciting and scary and a genuine thriller with so many twists and turns, it bewilders one on first viewing. But the film is good enough to see again and again. Kennedy,Coburn and Glass make terrific villains - funny but truly menacing at the same time. The musical score is sublime and adds to the movie. Matthau is great as a CIA agent and one is kept guessing about Grant's character. A truly brilliant concept which rewards the viewer who can give it their full concentration.",

One of its many charms is that is filmed in Paris. Art direction, sound, editing, a wonderful music score by Henry Mancini, costumes for Hepburn by Givenchy that add to her glamour and more assure its status a classic. Donen adds quite a few Hitchcockian touches in the dialog and cinematic scenes. An example: Peter Joshua, Alexander Dyle, Adam Canfield and Brian Cruikshank. If you see the movie you'll know who they are. Plot involves gold stolen from the Nazis in World War II by a few GI's and what's become of it.

The opening credits, by Maurice Binder (same as 60s Bond films), European locations that prevents this film from looking dated (many Bond films), & Mancini's score, which was recorded in the same studio using the same musicians as many of the early Bond films. The 1963 soundtrack RCA Victor album was a re-recording, recorded in RCA Victor studios in CA, typical for Mancini soundtracks. The OST, released a few years ago, on Universal/Intrada is the OST from the film, recorded in London, but not as polished of an album, technically, as the RCA studio recorded album. John Barry's Bond films were recorded in the same London studio. The dialogue concerning terms: \"spies versus agents\", Scobie's intimidating character, Tex's drawl, was a clear indication that it was a spoof of Bond films, such as 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Grant was the Bond, Hepburn was the Bond girl. Both films were released that year, with CHARADE following the first 2, (Connery) Bond films, Dr. NO & FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Give Donnen credit for making a film as entertaining & timeless as FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, with romance, comedy, graphic violence, and spoofing the spy genre decades before the Austin Powers series with arguably, the best cast & crew available during production. I sometimes wonder if the Bond films used CHARADE as their template. May we please put this delution that this a \"Hitchcock film\" to rest. I wish this film someday gets released in 5.1 dolby digital surround as the Bond films. Since its in the public domain, it is doubtful.",

She has an unhappy marriage with Charlie, a man she doesn't know very well. So she decides to divorce her. But before she does, he's conveniently assassinated. And so begins one of the greatest cat-and-mouse games in the history of cinema, as war criminals, CIA agents and Reggie not only try to find the killer but also the $250,000 the dead man was supposed to have on him.With beautiful Paris as the backdrop, it's inevitable that this thriller become a romantic movie, and there's no one better for Hepburn to fall in love with than the great Cary Grant. Their relationship is witty, heartfelt and enjoyable to watch on the screen. He plays an American who conveniently meets Reggie in her moment of crisis, but as the movie progresses his role changes many times until we're not sure who he really is.Twistful as the plot may be, it's also a lovely comedy, poking fun at the crime and thriller genres, with amazing inventions and situations for the characters to get out of. Peter Stone deserves all praise for his inspired screenplay. I live for movies like this, that mix a good dose of light-hearted fun with the best aspects of thrillers. This is the equivalent of a good Agatha Christie mystery. They just don't make movies like this anymore.With a cool cast that includes George Kennedy, Walter Mathau and James Coburn, Charade is a suspenseful movie that lives up to its title: you'll be guessing throughout the movie the truth about everything you're watching until the satisfying and logical conclusion.

I appreciate dry humor, which Charade attempts throughout; however, the quality of the writing is such that the humor almost always fails to raise a chuckle. You can see the writer was trying VERY hard to be clever and urbane, but he just wasn't very successful.Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are their usual wonderful selves, but it's very hard to swallow Hepburn's character's choices, both in survival and in romance. Still, the cast is solid, and the manipulative plot, despite some logical holes mentioned in other reviews, does ultimately engage the viewer enough that boredom never sets in.",

The plot has holes in it and it's fairly easy to guess the identity of the killer. However, it is so entertaining that any shortcomings can be overlooked.

I mean, with stars like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, one can't help but see how perfect they are in this mashup of thriller/comedy/romance that Hitch so perfectly did in his heyday especially whenever Grant keeps us on our toes when guessing which side he's on. Director Stanley Donen must have either seen many of Hitch's movies in preparing or he simply had the right instinct of what to do when filming. Also loved Henry Mancini's score and the Maurice Binder credits but I really loved seeing some of the other supporting cast like that of James Coburn and George Kennedy, both of whom provided just the right amount of menace for their parts. One other player I haven't mentioned yet that I loved was also just right for his part: Walter Matthau as someone Ms. Hepburn has to trust to get pertinent info from in order to move the plot along and who also provided a twist that I managed to predict but I didn't mind that I did since it also provided such an exciting climax.

Despite my longstanding dislike for both the stars, they endeared me through the entire from start to finish, quite an accomplishment in itself. Seeing the Seine boats and street scenes, pensions with rickety staircases and now-illegal elevators, subways that are all lost to modern \"health and safety\", triggers a grinding nostalgia for the Paris of yore.

            "content": "Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is on holiday in the Alps and she is contemplating divorce from her husband, Charles. She has grown weary of his secretive ways and has come to the realisation that she is no longer in love with him. During her trip, she encounters Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) and takes an instant liking to him, although it is initially unclear how mutual Peter's feelings are.On Regina's return to Paris, she discovers that her husband has been murdered. Not only that, a group of shady war veterans, who first appear at her husband's funeral, soon turn their attentions to Regina. They claim that she has inherited a large fortune which belongs to them and use a range of intimidation tactics, including the threat of violence and worse, if they do not get their money back. However, despite undergoing a desperate search, Regina is unable to find any trace of this money in any of her late husband's accounts.Regina also finds herself contacted by a Secret Service Agent (Walter Matthau), who is just as certain that her husband possessed the money as the intimidating war veterans seem to be. Regina is told that it is imperative the money is found as it belongs to the American government. Amidst all of this, Peter Joshua reappears and at first seems to be the one person who is more interested in Regina than her phantom fortune. But, as events evolve, Peter Joshua's real intentions, and even his real name, begin to come under much greater scrutiny.As one can see, the plot of Charade is exceptionally intricate and part of the intrigue of the film is in being drawn into what appears to be an impossible conundrum. The film has been described as being the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never directed, and there are moving parts galore, including shifting identities and changing allegiances, as well as an almighty MacGuffin which drives the whole plot along. As a result, most audience members will be left largely confounded by the evolution of the film's events. But, rest assured, all of the mysteries will be resolved and some of the resolutions will even make sense...Yet the above is only one layer of what the film has to offer. Charade also has wonderfully memorable performances by the two leads, both of whom have so much natural charisma, charm and screen chemistry that the film almost explodes through the effervescence of their pairing. Hepburn and Grant simply belong on the screen together. In fact, their interactions are so perfect that the 25-year age gap simply melts into the background. Their cat and mouse relationship shows each character to be the absolute equal to the other in terms of instinct, energy and resourcefulness. Hepburn and Grant are also wonderfully assisted by a crackling screenplay from Peter Stone. For instance, during a romantic boat ride along the River Seine, Peter says to a romantically charged Regina: \"When you come on, you come on!\" To which Regina replies: \"Well, come on!\"And here we have yet another layer to Charade. Despite ostensibly being a heavily plotted thriller, at times it also sparkles with the wit and madcap charm of a screwball comedy. Note the juxtaposition between the opening scene of the film, in which we see a dead man being thrown off a train, and the very next scene which features the following dialogue between Regina and her female friend:\nFriend: \"But, I don't understand; why do you want a divorce?\"\nRegina: \"Because I don't love him and he obviously doesn't love me.\"\nFriend: \"That's no reason to get a divorce, with a rich husband and this year's clothes, you won't find it difficult to make some new friends.\"\nRegina: \"Look, I admit I came to Paris to escape American provincial, but that doesn't mean that I'm ready for French traditional...\"\nThe patter is so outrageously light-hearted and deliciously mischievous that you wonder what on earth any of this could have to do with a plot involving a murder. Yet, therein lies the genius of this film: it is the first ever screwball thriller. It's both irreverent, hilarious and wonderfully over-the-top while being suspenseful, gripping and, at times, uncomfortably intense.One particular scene demonstrates the above rather well. It places Regina and Peter in a restaurant in which a game has commenced involving the passing of an orange down a line of customers. The goal is to pass the orange along without using one's hands. Cary Grant performs some utterly exceptional physical comedy during the scene, complete with magnificently-timed body-contorting reactions and impossibly funny facial expressions and the entire mood of the piece is one of mirth and high-level entertainment. This is then followed by Regina being called to a phone booth in which she is threatened by an extremely sinister looking James Coburn. He physically backs Regina into the booth creating a menacing sense of claustrophobia before proceeding to flick lighted matches at her person knowing she has no means of escape. Hepburn's desperate, wide-eyed, terror-stricken reaction is genuinely difficult to watch.How the film manages to constantly balance such extreme contrasts can only truly be explained by, firstly, its excellently controlled and highly unique pacing. It works in a similar way as a trip to a fun fair might do in which there are regular shifts in energy, tempo and mood: from the roller coaster to the Big Wheel; from the whirling Waltzers to a more sedate ride on a Carousel. Part of the joy of the event as a whole comes in the very variety of sensations and experiences that such contrasts provide. Such is the case with this film. Yet, alongside this, what remains throughout is the sense of intricate and enthralling spectacle. This provides an overall unity to the piece which avoids what could easily have been a collection of disparate scenes in the hands of a less skilled director than Stanley Donen.The other reason the film works has to come back to the sheer excellence of both Hepburn and Grant. Their performances are so engrossing that they are able to sell their audience pretty much any plot theme of their choosing, ranging from romance, to comedy, to cold-blooded murder. The joy the audience may take in being manipulated by the film's constantly contorting plot is replicated in the way Peter charmingly manipulates Regina with numerous cock and bull stories throughout the film's run time, and also in the way Regina toys with Peter in order to break through his thinly constructed armour while he futilely attempts to resist her charms.The very title \"Charade\" is a glaring clue to the audience that this film is an experience which is utterly eccentric and unabashedly silly, and, yet, it is actually a work of pure brilliance. It is a near magnum opus for both Hepburn and Donen. And, perhaps even more importantly, it is one-hundred-and-fifty-three minutes of highly immersive, completely original, tension-charged fun.",

            "content": "With the talent that was in this film it should have been much better than it was. I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream here and that most consider this a classic but I just didn't see it. I actually gave it four stars only because of the actors who were in it, not for the movie itself.\nHepburn's character comes across as a na\u00efve, sort of clueless and helpless woman who believes pretty much anything that's told to her by Grants character. Hepburn was a great actress but she misses on this one, even overplaying scenes from time to time, possibly in an attempt to make her character believable because it really wasn't.\nCary Grant at times seemed to me like he was just going through the motions and some of his attempts at comedy; showering in his cloths and especially the face he makes when the final plot twist is revealed are totally out of his range and persona and fall completely flat. And the romance between he and Hepburn never seems believable in the film, possibly because in real life she's half his age but mostly I think because there isn't great chemistry there.\nThe supporting cast include some great actors but while they're meant to be funny they mostly come across like the three stooges and feel out of place in what's supposed to be a sophisticated romantic comedy.\nFinally, this movie was filmed in Paris which offered the opportunity of many stunning backdrops and yet most of it takes place in dreary hotel rooms and offices. And when scenes do take place outside they're filmed in front of obviously fake backdrops. The dinner cruise is the worst example of this.\nThere is some clever dialogue here, especially early on in the film but overall it's a disappointment among both Hepburn and Grants canon of work.\nIf you're looking for a funny and well done Hepburn romantic comedy then watch \"How to Steal a Million\" where she stars opposite Peter O'Toole. It's a much better, much funnier and enjoyable film. For a great Grant romcom I'd suggest \"Father Goose\", his last film in which he stars with Leslie Caron, it's a really funny and enjoyable movie.",

He thought that cinema is all about (Stanly Kubrick) only!What's wrong about some glamour time? In fact, it's so right. Having a fun time is what movies were grounded on. And still are to a considerable extent; if only well-made. And in the case of (Charade), it is very well made.First of all, the script. I adore it. Look how it creates a real charade by making a story of a crime, a conflict of evil associates which leads to more crimes, with dividing the truths, hiding them, then giving them away one by one, to design a movie of non-stop murders, surprises and twists all along. Not only this, it leads this thriller hand in hand with a romantic comedy that has snappy smart lines. So the catchy formula perfects. I guess Hitchcock was jealous!Add to that, the star value. Ahhh, it can't get any better than this. (Audrey Hepburn) is a dream, especially in that blue pajama. She had that iconic face and humor, lighting the screen with a smile, a gaze, or maybe a scream. And (Cary Grant) is the very definition of this movie, as a combination of sparkle and magic. He's a load of charisma, fun, vitality. The thing is you wouldn't believe his performance only; you have to fall in love with his persona also. Very few starts in the history of cinema can reach this zenith while being in their third act (Grant was 59 year old at the time, and he retired from movies for good - after couple of more movies - in 1966). 3 moments of him had his stamp utterly, forcing you to re-watch them with increasing fun every time; showering with his suit on, picking the orange competition; where Hepburn was laughing for real I suppose, and the funny face that he came up with at the last scene; which was very much the best parody out of the audience's reaction towards this heavy long run of twists up to that point (which was very early for a movie back then). The rest of the cast is fine to say the least, with their different looking and speaking characters.Then, the magic continues. A music score by (Henry Mancini). That guy was elegance to movie music. He wrote, as usual, a fascinating theme. And this time, it could be played whether as interestingly suspenseful or tearfully romantic. I loved the way it's played in the dining boat scene; with a vocal version of it, or in the amusement center scene; as a part of the place's music, like the whole movie is amusement center. Why writing a theme song to be played in different arrangements throughout a movie seems so old and forgotten these days?! Undoubtedly it was part of yesterday's special charm. The cinematography is pure cozy, rather analgesic with deeply worm colors. It's the classically dazzling Hollywood movie image back then. (Stanley Donen)'s directing did very good. The fight over the building is memorable. Mixing the on-location shots with the in-studio ones was done adeptly. However I think that the best thing (Donen) achieved here was his 2 leading stars' so smooth performance and interplay.Though, (Hepburn)'s character was unconvincing. I didn't buy her as someone under stress or afraid for most of the time. She was having fun, falling in bottomless love with (Grant)'s character, and not having the slightest problem at all, which was a problem for me, the only problem this movie has in my viewpoint.There are some nice references along the way: mentioning American in Paris by (Gene Kelly) who's an old friend of (Stanley Donen); they co-directed together 3 classic musicals (On the Town - 1949), (It's Always Fair Weather - 1955), and (Singin' in the Rain - 1952). Or a line like: \"I taught them everything they know\", said by (Grant) about the young lovers' kisses, not as his character in the movie, but as himself; the romantic lead of countless movies. In terms of references to himself, (Grant) didn't feel shy admitting his age, and for more than once (the glasses to read is one), I think at the time he held a position of a \"movie star\" that allowed him to be (Cary Grant) more than his character here, whatever its true name was, and the movie friendlily toyed with that for honoring purpose.The last scene has it all. The 2 stars shine with magic. The boy, old boy, speaks to his girl about marriage; assuring that every love story has to end with marriage; noticing the decorous time; which I personally love and long for. And it's the movie's last surprise, twist, whatever.. when (Grant) turns out to be a government agent; now see how that script played with the cards brilliantly, switching them to make the real thief (Walter Matthau) as the policeman, and the real policeman as the thief (Grant doesn't stop lying from the start about his identity, deciding - until this moment - that he's a thief). Sure this was the script's best game, and it saved it for last.This is nothing but great entertainment. It's full of magic's sparkle or sparkle's magic, well, you name it. At any case, worth the love, the DVD, and the fight with that snob professor!PS: Don't care much for the remake (The Truth About Charlie - 2002) (Yes, they had the guts to remake THIS!). Enough to tell that they handed over the role of (Cary Grant) to (Mark Wahlberg)!!!!!!!!!",

Charade is just simply damned good mystery entertainment, at times thrilling, funny, and occasionally bewildering. It's one of them twist upon a twist upon a twist movies (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) set in the gorgeous backdrop of Paris (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) and featuring an almost automatic romance between a couple who are basically ready to jump each other's bones from frame one but have to worry through all that plot first (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn). Unlike Paris When It Sizzles, however, it's not all just meta ultimately pointing to one sole purpose, but has some really gripping storytelling.This is the type of movie where I had the killer figured out within a moment, but it didn't exactly mean the story was all that predictable. My favorite part of it is the constantly changing relationships of the characters as they all vie around each other attempting to gain the upper hand. Hepburn's own doe-faced surprise at every turn is less a character under duress and more an audiences' chorus as she watches with bright eyes the layers peeling back in front of her. If there's any real unbelievability to the movie, it's that she has so much patience for it, or if she has that she's ever telling the truth during the many times she says, \"I'm scared\".--PolarisDiB",

But who is he really? I mean Cary Grant can't be a bad guy. Or can he? Well, in in the course of the picture, Grant poses, as a businessman, the revenge-seeking brother of one of the bad guys' victims and a professional thief who's also after the stolen money. Each time Hepburn catches him in a lie, he simply comes up with a new name and occupation. \"The man's the same even if the name is different,\" he assures her. Who can she trust? Suspense, intrigue, murder and the screen presence of both stars make this a must see film. Grant and Hepburn are just magical on screen together. The chemistry between these two stars is a timeless thrill to watch and it is also the sad but true fact that there are no stars like these anymore. I mean come on- could you imagine any stars today who can deliver such lines as \"You know what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing!\" I think my favorite scene from the entire film is the one with Audrey Hepburn, in disguise trying to trail Cary Grant. It is just hilarious and Hepburn is absolutely adorable. That scene at the end, where it is revealed who Cary Grant really is, simply priceless.

The dialogs were witty and pithy, the acting was right on the money, the pace was brisk and airtight. Alas, all that fell by the wayside the moment the movie turned into a romance- wannabe. The main female protagonist is as sexy as a cold dead fish, and the aging male protagonists (Grant) is barely plodding along.Another huge opportunity missed.

            "content": "It's often called in that clich\u00e9 term the \"Best Hitchcock Movie He Didn't Make\". It's understandable of course - the mistaken identities, the spies (sorry, \"agents\"), and Cary Grant, plus a foreign locale in particular with France and Paris (and To Catch a Thief, which this has a somewhat similar flavor to most of all, had two of those things for sure). But it's really in the shallowest terms that it can be described like that, even as I'm sure it would make a fine second film on a double bill with North by Northwest or Notorious. Something about the film is a little too... light, yes, even in comparison with Hitchcock. Not that it's a bad thing, far from it, but Charade is its own Hollywood escapist animal.The director here is Stanley Donen, who's Singin' in the Rain is maybe the greatest movie musical Hollywood produced. He brings together these stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, along with supporting players like Walter Matthau (for me a bit underused, though when you see the movie you'll know why), James Coburn and George Kennedy, and takes Peter Stone's comic script and gives it polish and flair. It's also filled with an air of romance - of course, if it's from Hollywood in the 50's or 60's and it has Grant and/or Hepburn, you're bound to usually find romance, and why not, they're beautiful people to look at and even more attractive when they're having to play irony or cute-sarcasm in their dialogs.The plot is fairly frivolous, and in the third act (though only then really) there's a kind of MacGuffin, but it all links back to money. I have a feeling Stone set up this plot, and knew it was good, but even compared to Hitchcock the stakes seem kind of low. When the fellow past-WW2-thieves get together to try and hash out where the quarter of a million are, though there are snarls and comically timed sneezes and Kennedy's got that hook for a hand, nothing is too menacing, and the threat level is actually quite low, and Donen's direction, though solid, doesn't have that calibrated, sometimes experimental side that Hitch had in spades. At least, I should say, it was for me. Perhaps I've just seen too many of these films (including, I should also note, Jonathan Demme's 2002 remake, The Trouble with Charlie, which I hadn't seen since then but suddenly seemed as fresh as it was when I first saw it, but I digress).For those going into it as a casual movie-goer, maybe seeing just a thriller or a comic escapade here and there, Charade will seem fresh as all heck. One thing that I can give it, aside from the obvious and light (but wonderful) chemistry and playfulness of the stars, is the element of the twists. People's identities keep coming into question - most of all for Grant's character - and it was actually something that remained clever throughout. We can guess that one isn't who he's saying who one is or the other, and it's all thanks to Hepburn, her character and her performance. She's the star, but she's also the audience (at least for the time), trying to piece together things and having to take trust at face value. Of course, who doesn't want to trust Cary Grant? The man at one point takes a shower with his full suit on just to amuse the pretty lady by his side. Again, adorable stuff.If it is kind of a frivolous movie, it's at least presented with gusto, a mostly cracker-jack music score (only one scene, with a fight on a roof-top at night, seemed kind of weakly composed), and the supporting players give as much a boost as do the stars. It's the kind of movie that would be good for a first date, if you have the date that likes movies from Hollywood's 'classic' age before those darn hippies took over. It's elegant, it's flashy, it takes its audience on a ride and we're glad to go on it. The only thing it doesn't do is leave an incredible, lasting impression, which is why it's still Hitchcock-lite ultimately.",

She was always long and slender even after she left the movies and became a crusader for the starving children of the world. Gracefulness was her stock-in-trade, and although it came easy to her, it was almost always a star turn--self-conscious, a crutch--until \"Charade.\" It's here--paradoxically--that the actress of whom director Fred Zinnemann (\"The Nun's Story\") complained was too concerned about her image lets her guard down playing a character who is forced by circumstances to keep her guard up.  As Regina Lampert, the widow of a mystery man, a befuddled middle-aged woman who must rely on the aid of another mystery man to protect her from a motley trio of plug-uglies from her husband's past, Hepburn engages in the sort of acting games that women dream of trying only when they're trying them with Cary Grant.  And together she and Grant go through their paces; let the lights of Paris (courtesy of veteran cinematographer Charles Lang) play off their faces like delicate, fleeting emotions; and glide almost effortlessly toward the inevitable closing embrace. With James Coburn who is made to greet death with the strangest look of surprise ever frozen on an actor's face; Ned Glass; George Kennedy; and Walter Matthau who must surely possess the funniest deadpan face since Buster Keaton.  The denouement--a stirring chase that winds through the Parisian metro to the colonnade of the Palais Royale and beyond--is thrilling, a collaborative triumph of the talents of Stanley Donen who directed it, of Charles Lang who shot it, and of Henry Mancini--fresh from his Oscar win for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\"--who furnished the dazzling score.",

            "content": "After the waning of Hollywood musicals, Stanley Donen, the king of the Hollywood musicals, steers into comedy genre and convenes two of the most popular and bankable movie stars in the business, Hepburn and Grant, concocts another exceedingly entertaining masterpiece, CHARADE, penned by Peter Stone, blithely blends a Hitchcock-ian thriller with a rom-com with banters galore, and the result is superbly satisfactory, if one compares it with a later analogue, the Goldie Hawn- Chevy Chase vehicle FOUL PLAY (1978) made by Colin Higgins, one can effortlessly taste the difference in quality, how the storyline of the latter is dumbed down to a no-brainer and the characterisation of its female protagonist as a dim-witted blond is plain prosaic.CHARADE is a nonpareil of the hybridisation of comedy-thriller-romance, Regina (Hepburn) is a newly widowed American in Paris, the mysterious murder of her husband Charlie brings danger to her too, since it concerns a fortune stolen by Charlie and his cohorts during WWII, yet she doesn't have a clue about its whereabout, soon, a knight errant appears, an American compatriot named Peter Joshua (Grant), voluntarily offers her his protection, but whose real identity will only reveal in the film's coda, a minor spoiler, he has four identities altogether. Grant was approaching sixty when the film was making while Hepburn was in her early thirties, the May-December romance seems incongruent at first, but Hepburn had already mastered a wondrous rapport with Gary Cooper in Billy Wilder's LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON (1957) with a 28- year age difference, also it is a stale manoeuvre in the industry to pair senior matin\u00e9e idols with red-hot and much younger female stars. Thus, Stone's script leans heavily on Regina's proactive move, to contrast Peter's more self-effacing and suave appearance. Hepburn has what we call the essentials of a screen idol, she can enchant audience with her innate geniality and sublime elegance, and leave them forget how far-fetched or ridiculous sometimes the narrative turns out to be. Grant can do the same trick in his prime, but here, his downplayed joviality and less outspoken nature suit the role very well, the most droll moment comes when he takes a shower with his drip- dried suit on, although it is amazing to see him still acquire agility in all the chasing and jumping sequences.Matthau plays the CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew, who summons Regina in insisting that the missing fortune should be given back to USA, and holds the key of the big twist, which is not that out-of-the-blue, due to the movie's rather small cast, there would not be enough red-herrings in the killing game. James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass are three cohorts discharging menace and distrust invariably in their one-note design, and Jacques Marin's inept French gendarme brings the ultimate deadpan humour.The film is snubbed by the Academy despite being a lucrative box-office hit, only Henry Mancini's alluring theme song is blessed with an Oscar nomination, and CHARADE is a top-notch star-vehicle ingeniously incorporates laughter onto the usual whodunit template, which very few of today's mainstream products can remotely match.",

Walter Matthau is at his best as a member of the American legacy that also gets involved in the case.

For jaded twenty-first century types, part of the solution should be obvious.  Getting there, though, is the fun. Hepburn's husband has been killed, leaving $250,000 (a lot of money in those days) that no one can find. The bad guys think Hepburn has it.  Hepburn is intrigued by, and believably falls for, Cary Grant, in one of his most interesting roles. Grant's film persona is funny and sexy, confident and vulnerable by turns; Hitchcock successfully explored a darker side to the persona, making him a menacing playboy.  Here, Grant is never menacing, but as the story unfolds his character, never changing outwardly or in tone, nevertheless becomes one of the puzzles of the pieces:  is he one of the good guys, one of the bad guys, or a lone ranger after the loot for himself?  Made the same year as another classic, \"The Pink Panther\", the music is another feather in the cap of Henry Mancini, especially with the many variations on the theme song, \"Charade\";  while this score doesn't have the originality and humor of \"The Pink Panther\", it's immensely hummable.  Highly recommended for an audience willing to take its breezy flippancy as offered, rather than looking for something needlessly profound.  It's fun.  It's not a main course, it's a fluffy dessert.

This movie has more twists and turns than it should even be possible to fit into 113 minutes, and every time you think you have it figured out, it smacks you in the nose with another curve-ball.The plot is a successful marriage of humor, murder, and danger.

Hepburn and Grant really get to flex their comedic muscles, thanks to a script that provides excellent banter for the two leads. Hepburn is her typical beautiful, charming, girlish, impossibly adorable self. No surprises there. And Grant handles both the funny and dangerous aspects of his character quite well, to the extent that you never quite know whether to trust him or not. There's great chemistry between the pair, almost to the level between Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief.

And while it stays safely on the side of light entertainment, and doesn't quite have the magic of some of my favorite classic movies, it's a fun movie to watch. Do yourself a favor and see this film; there is very little chance that it could possibly disappoint you.",

            "content": "The Plot. Regina Lampert, a Paris based American, has decided to divorce her Swiss husband, Charles Lampert, because of the secrets and lies that have pervaded their marriage, she coming to the conclusion that she no longer loves him and really knows nothing about him. Before she can make that request to Charles, he is found dead, seemingly pushed off a Paris to Bordeaux train. While Regina was on holiday in Meg\u00e8ve, Charles sold all their possessions making $250,000 in the process, and seemed to be on his way to the coast to leave the country for South America probably for good. The money, however, was not among his possessions on the train, those possessions which are returned to Regina. Regina further learns from Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA that they were after him, Charles Lampert only the primary alias he has been using of late.So first of all, this is a VERY 60's film. The music and costumes are all \"mod.\" which makes the movie rather dated. Cary Grant was pushing 60 when he made this movie. But he's never dated. The issue with the movie is the dialog which is snappy and out of place. It's as if they wanted to make this a pithy comedy drama instead of a straight dramatic presentation. It doesn't really work.Plus it's a rather slow and talkative movie low on action. And Audrey Hepburn is a think of the past. Her \"acting abilities really don't fit today. As I said earlier, VERY 60's.",

The film had so much going for it, but besides the surreal, New Wave feel of the end, just before the credits, it was a major letdown. I flipped the disc over upon completion to check out the bonus movie, Charade, which it was based on. I fast-forwarded it a bit and discovered the dialogue was much the same in that part, so I took it out and returned the rental. Now, four years later, I finally took the plunge and sat down to watch Stanley Donen's highly acclaimed Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn vehicle. This one is a winner.After only seeing Grant in Notorious, I wasn't quite ready for the comic chops he shows here, (even though I have heard so much about them from lovers of Bringing Up Baby). The quick wit was enjoyable as he and Hepburn were a great comic team. Sarcasm flowed freely from their lips and helped lay the tracks for why a love tryst could work between a 60 year old man and a 30 year old woman. I'm not quite sure if they tried to make Hepburn's Reggie older, as she looked it in parts, but either way her youthful mannerisms came out on top. Surprisingly, I kept thinking back to Thandie Newton's take on the character from Demme's film, and marveled at the similarities. Their faces are alike, especially the large eyes to get lost in. Grant and Hepburn really looked like they enjoyed each others company and it helped propel their characters through the intelligent, twist-laden script.When Reggie discovers her husband Charles has been killed and that his accomplices, from an old army booty theft, are looking for his money, she doesn't know who to turn to or who to trust. Everyone she encounters has a hidden agenda or identity, tripping up her plans to find the loot and save herself from her husband's fate. Nothing is as it seems and everyone is in on the \"charade,\" including her deceased spouse, whom it seems she really didn't know at all. Her life has been full of strangers and they are all trying to get to know her now, with hopes of finding the spoils. Among the many men she encounters are top-notch performances from James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and George Kennedy. Coburn and Kennedy are great as the mystery men from Charles' past, causing trouble and just being plain maniacal. The funeral scene, where the two of them are introduced, is hilarious and all involved are pitch-perfect. Matthau also does admirably playing against type, as I'm familiar with him, as a serious character. While his CIA administer Bartholemew has many instances of comic relief, it is his dramatic presence that really surprised me.Charade has it all: mystery, intrigue, romance, confusion, and an abundance of fun humor. Hepburn is radiant and sharp in her delivery, while Grant is comical and yet on a dime turns deathly stone-faced. The script is clever at most times, but never goes overboard to the absurd. I credit the actors and director Donen for steering it with enough reality to make us care for those involved in the plot. Unfortunately, it seems Demme decided to let his actors run loose in his adaptation, causing it to be a farcical retelling, making everything from the original that came close to being too much, fly right over the top. Charade needed to be grounded to succeed and that succeed is exactly what it did.",

            "content": "As anyone with even a minimum of experience in the real world can attest, life often has a way of taking an unexpected turn that in an instant can turn an uncluttered existence into veritable turmoil, which is exactly what happens in `Charade,' a mystery with romantic and comedic overtones, directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.  An American living in Paris, unaware of her husband's covert activities and associations, Regina `Reggie' Lampert (Hepburn) is informed upon returning home from vacationing at a ski resort that her husband (whom she was about to divorce) has died, having been thrown from a train en route to a destination (unbeknownst to her) that would ultimately have taken him to South America.\tSuddenly widowed and without resources, Reggie quickly finds herself surrounded by murder and mystery as the strange secret life of her husband slowly comes to light, and she finds herself the target of some unfinished business that has to do with her husband's clandestine associates.  But as luck would have it, this damsel in distress is befriended by a stranger, Peter Joshua (Grant), a man with whom she had a momentary encounter during her vacation at the resort.  Together, they attempt to assemble the pieces of the discomfiting puzzle that has become her life, in order to get her back on track.  It's a tall order, however, and like the man said at one time or another, `Nobody said life was going to be easy.'  Along the way Reggie also discovers some things about her knight in shining armor that adds yet another perspective to the conundrum into which she has inexplicably fallen.  And she begins to wonder if anything in the world is actually the way it seems.\tWorking from an excellent screenplay by Peter Stone, and backed by a terrific score and that familiar theme by Henry Mancini, Donen invades Hitchcock territory to weave a web of intrigue and suspense that, while it lacks the nuance and that special touch that Hitchcock always managed to bring to this kind of material, will keep you guessing until the very end. The overall film has a decided `60s Cinema' look and feel that virtually defines it, and while this isn't a bad thing, the presentation as such has a way of keeping the viewer at arm's length and prevents the kind of emotional involvement that would've made this a riveting film.  Suffice to say that, comparatively, it lacks the realism that you find in more recent offerings of this genre.  What it definitely has in it's favor is the great cast, and especially the stars, Hepburn and Grant.\tAudrey Hepburn is lovely as Reggie, bringing a knowing, yet innocent quality to the character.  Charismatic as always, and imbued with that natural, refined beauty that is her trademark, she epitomizes the sensibilities of the era with a waif-like consistency and bearing that makes her a joy to watch.  She has a radiant screen presence, and seeing her in this place and time makes it easy to understand all of the things that truly made her a movie star as well as an accomplished actor. \n\tGrant, of course, is charming as usual, slipping into his character with facility and creating an instant chemistry with Hepburn that makes this story come alive.  His performance is smooth and believable, and his easy, yet commanding presence leaves no doubt that he is in control, even when faced with some formidable opponents and situations.  He conveys something of an invincibility in this role that lets you know that no matter how dark things get, all will be well by the end.  After all the twists and turns, you feel relatively certain that if they stick together, Reggie and Peter are going to land on their feet.  But then again, this is a `Charade,' isn't it?\tThe supporting cast includes James Coburn (Tex), Walter Matthau (Bartholomew), George Kennedy (Herman), Dominique Minot (Sylvie), Ned Glass (Leopold), Jacques Marin (Inspector Grandpierre), Paul Bonifas (Mr. Felix) and Thomas Chelimsky (Jean-Louis).  An entertaining film that has a place of it's own in Cinematic History, `Charade' affords the opportunity of seeing two of the giants of the silver screen together, doing what they do best: Making magic.  Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are stars of rare magnitude, and together they make the screen sparkle.  And it's no charade.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",

Audrey Hepburn plays a slight variation of her \"Holly Golightly\" character from BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. She embodies Mrs. Charles (Regina\\Reggie) Lampert as an impulsive professional woman, willing to marry any guy who asks, if she at least knows his name. Cary Grant slings up \"Peter Joshua,\" \"Alexander Dyle,\" \"Adam Canfield,\" and \"Brian Crookshank\" on her wall, figuring he'll eventually get one to stick. As he says he's from crime-ridden Detroit, this makes sense. Everyone in the Motor City from the Georgia Peach to Slim Shady has at least one alias. But a plot that involves a large sum of money whimsically transforming from Nazi gold to furniture and lingerie to expired postage stamps seems more suitable for an episode of BEWITCHED than a spy thriller feature flick. I think that I like the parlor game Charades better than this film incarnation. The acting in the game usually is more believable than what's seen here, and the game's plot is less muddled.",

Despite the box- office-busting stars present, this little gem remains relatively obscure. The Grant-Hepburn team was truly delightful- what a shame it was never repeated.In that vein, this is one of the quirkiest films I would have pictured these two typically refined actors working in. While hardly screwball, the performances were definitely not the straight-laced fare I am used to seeing. They really seemed to just be having fun, bantering and goofing off. I think it's great when an actor doesn't have to worry about making every line come out like Shakespeare.The film itself, with its psychedelic James Bond-like intro and self- aware cornball dialog still manages to be gripping. Lots of twists and turns right up until the end- it really keeps you on your toes and interested. A bit more violence than I was expecting for a 60s flick. Nothing overtly gory, of course, but I was shocked that the audience was allowed shots of an asphyxiated corpse.In the end, though, this is a film that will win your heart, and attention, solely on its ability to entertain. No thrilling car chases, no sex in a dark alley, not even a particularly inspiring script. Just a solidly intriguing plot and excellent banter between two of the screen's loveliest gems.

Headed by two very big names (Carey Grant as Peter Joshua, etc. and Audrey Hepburn as Regina Lampert) and supported by folks like Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy, you expect fine performances all round, and basically you get that. \"Charade\" is a mix of suspense and comedy. Regina's husband is found murdered as the movie starts, and it turns out that he has $250000 stashed somewhere, stolen with some accomplices during World War II. Those accomplices now want their money and they assume Regina has it. And the story goes from there, the question being : who has the money?The mystery slowly (very slowly - in a good way) reveals itself, and along the way there's a good dose of humour mixed in (Grant taking a shower while wearing his \"drip dry\" suit; the passing the orange game; the funeral scene.) While the mystery around who has the money is the hinge around which the film turns, it's the humour that I found most appealing in this - and that probably makes me rate this down a little bit. Most of the truly humourous scenes take place in the first half or so. After that, it becomes much more dramatic and suspenseful, and this movie just doesn't work as well in that genre. The humour really needed to be a little more evenly spread out in my opinion. The budding relationship between Regina and Peter was at times very sweet, but Grant being 25 years older than Hepburn also had the potential to make it a bit uncomfortable. That was overcome (perhaps deliberately) by having the relationship sweetly romantic, but also a hesitant and even protective relationship, and in fairness I thought Grant and Hepburn worked together very well. The final revelation of who was actually who didn't come as a huge surprise, but that was probably because the story had set us up to expect pretty much anything.In all honesty, though, this did run out of steam after a while. Enough had happened by that time, though, that there was no way I was going to stop watching to find out where the money was and who really wanted it, mind you. (6/10)",

            "content": "Charade is director Stanley Donen's masterful attempt to outdo Hitchcock in the department of big screen cinema suspense. To say that Donen succeeds on every level is an understatement. He excels! When Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) returns home from holiday she discovers that her fashionable Paris apartment has been cleaned out by her husband, Charles - who was a double agent, embezzled money from a trio of crooks (headed by James Coburn) and has been murdered. Into the thick of this mystery comes the savvy stranger with too many names, played by Cary Grant. Presenting himself as a friend and confident, Grant is determined to put Regina's mind at ease. But is he or isn't he working for the same men that killed her husband? Walter Matthau does serious, and rather convincingly in an uncharacteristically diabolical role that is particularly engaging.THE TRANSFER: I have a problem with Criterion charging an arm and a leg for their DVD's when so many of them come with little more than bare bones in the way of extra features. Their reissue of \"Charade\" is no exception. You may remember that this title was previously available from Criterion in a non-anamorphic transfer. That oversight has now been corrected. But although colors are exceptionally vibrant and sharp, there remains a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine shimmering that is detected in horizontal and vertical details throughout the film. The audio is mono and nicely rendered.A more fitting transfer can be found on the flip side of Universal's \"The Trouble With Charlie\" a remake of Charade starring (oh, no!)Mark Walberg and Thandi Newton. Though this remake from Johnathan Demme is about as dismal and disturbing as going through a bikini wax, its one saving grace is that an impeccably rendered and 16X9 enhanced copy of the original film - \"Charade\" comes with it. Hence, the latter is well worth its $15 price tag.EXTRAS: On Criterion's edition only: An essay on the films of Stanley Donen and an audio commentary that is \u0096 well, just ample as far as audio commentaries go.BOTTOM LINE: Universal has made \"Charade\" available as part of a double feature with its remake, the genuinely awful \"The Truth About Charlie.\" However, for the difference in price, and because Universal's DVD is absent of digital all the digital anomalies I have already mentioned, that version is recommended over Criterions.",

The protagonist isn't quite as active as you'd like (Hepburn would have to wait a while until she could contend with the baddies herself in the superior 'Wait Until Dark (1967)') but she remains a compelling composite for the audience, assuredly navigating the complex web of lies known as the narrative with a keen mind and sharp wits. As I mentioned, the typical 'age-gap romance' is a little frustrating because it isn't developed all that well and sort of feels forced in for the sake of it, almost like it's included just because Grant can't be seen on screen without exuding some sense that he's an irresistible 'ladies' man' despite his age. It's lucky, then, that both key players make for enjoyable screen-presences and that their banter is actually quite charming. Plus, it helps that our leading man can apparently take a good-natured jab or two, evidenced by his odd but oddly funny fully-clothed shower. Occasionally, the picture does feel like it is getting confused as to who the protagonist is, with a couple fairly long segments dedicated purely to Grant's enigmatic every-man taking away from our otherwise steadfast connection with Hepburn's imperilled heroine. Still, this is a small issue and it allows for a fantastic, if out of the blue, fight sequence that's far more brutal than you'd expect - as are the various murders shown after the fact. It's this edge that keeps the stakes seeming real, even when the tone takes a turn for the comical or when the reveals start to come so fast that they almost tumble atop one another like some sort of last-minute pile-up. Indeed, it's the reveals themselves that make up the majority of the marketing for the movie (from what I can tell), so it's a good job that most of them are rather surprising - if not earth-shattering - and, even when they aren't, well thought out. The plot comes very close to being confusing but just about stays on the right side of that line, remaining a fun puzzle that you actively try to solve as it plays out. You never know who to trust, even the lead seems slightly suspicious, and the ending does a satisfying job of tying everything together. On the whole, the feature is a fast-moving, well-written and likeable experience. It does start to slow a little towards its mid-section, but it soon picks back up to culminate in a truly suspenseful and exciting climax. 8/10",

Director Donen keeps the surprises coming with pleasing regularity keeping the audience on the hop throughout until a denouement somehow reminiscent to me of \"The Third Man\".Underpinning all the kills and thrills is the chemistry between Grant and Hepburn as both play their parts and act their ages with great aplomb. It's fun to see Hepburn chasing Grant in an inversion of the norm although I don't think you'd find too many men running away from her. There are some surprisingly shocking images of the deaths of Hamilton and Coburn in particular and liberal doses of the type of black humour of which the Master would have been proud, none more so than when early on in the film, a supposed mourner sneezes over the deceased in his open casket. Inventively and stylishly directed, it perhaps lacks those directorial flourishes of you-know-who which stay in the memory, but the dialogue is smart, witty and occasionally risqu\u00e9, the Parisian locations highly attractive and the playing excellent by all throughout.A fine homage to Hitch but with enough of its own identity and flair to entertain satisfactorily on its own merits.",

Oh it was celebrated in its time, but the years highlighted the charm (and the legend) of the actors in it, and we can look at it with a sense of lost world, past things.Stanley Donen, here already away from the Hollywood system, though depending on it, is one of the best directors coming from America.He was deeply original in his more prolific years as a musical director, and he was never less than competent in what he did after that. That includes this enjoyable film. To me, one of his strongest points as a director, was the ability to mix opposite forces and talents, and create an unified vision out of it, by motivating genuine cooperation. Isn't that the best we can expect a director to be? And what a good mixture he makes here. The idea was, i suppose, to create a plot which keeps grabbing the audience by constant twists. We don't know more than Audrey's character, and we try to guess the true character of Grant's. It's tremendously effective, because the twists are subtle and clever, and the dramatic effect that they might have is always brought down by the comedy feel of the whole thing.Grant spent a good part of his career doing comedy, and in fact he probably set most of the standards for comedy acting that were still in use at the time of this film. What public believes is 'funny' becomes easily dated but what he does here still works today, and that is absolutely remarkable. Audrey/Givenchy are in this ride, and being the character she invented for herself on-screen suits this one perfectly.The supporting cast also allows this to work, specially Walter Matthau whom, because of how his lines are placed in the film, and how he distracts us with his great skills as a comedian, fools us as much as he fools Hepburn's character all the way.Henri Mancini is one of my favourite film composers. The music has less presence here than in other films he scored, by i think that's in the mood of the thing.I don't know any recent film that works so easily with this comedy/suspense environment and looks so natural and unforced. I praise the people involved here.My opinion: 4/5 watch it and keep it with youhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

            "content": "\"You know what's wrong with you?\" Audrey Hepburn demands of Cary Grant in \"Charade.\" Then, moving aggressively toward him, \"Nothing.\" The same is true for Stanley Donen's \"Charade.\" From beginning to end, the film pretends to be nothing more than it is: brilliant entertainment.It also functions, perhaps, as the most \"revealing\" exposure of two Hollywood stars ever filmed. \"Exposure\" because, at moments, the carefully tailored script invites Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant to be loose and silly -- an opportunity never afforded either of them on screen before or since.In being silly, we see and know more about Hepburn and Grant as PEOPLE (forget their roles, here, or their Hollywood personas) than in any of their other films.Their delight in working together as actors is palpable from the opening.Their surprising chemistry together seems to develop before our eyes. Their playfulness grows and grows until, at the final reveal, Hepburn opens an American Embassy office door in Paris to discover that the man she (and we) alternately loved, rooted for, suspected and feared has always been a United States official -- and he's making a cross-eyed goofy face at her.We have no reliable way of knowing if that idiotic look was scripted or simply improvised by Mr. Grant and wisely included in the final cut by Director/Producer Donen.Coming thirty years into Grant's remarkably long-lived career, that perfectly-timed boyish stupid expression effectively undercuts his entire filmic persona -- while simultaneously being true to the character and the relationship that has blossomed with Miss Hepburn's character.(Hepburn's responses during \"Charade,\" where her character is essentially a passive victim of circumstances, exhibit astonishing range -- from elegant boredom to sadness, resignation, bewilderment, fright, love, courage. One cannot take one's eyes off her. She too seems to relax here more than in any other of her films, revealing an unencumbered sexuality and forthrightness not apparent in other of her roles.)The sequence with Mr. Grant showering fully clothed is, in retrospect, almost jaw-dropping. Funny? Yes. Shocking? Well, for a supposedly heterosexual screen icon to play this stereotypically \"gay\" may seem shocking today. Limp wrists, sing-song voice, mincing steps and all. How Mr. Donen ever convinced Grant to play this scene this way, or why Grant delivered, it still remains a fascinatingly comic picture of a deeply and \"secretly\" conflicted homosexual actor of a certain era camping it up. And camp it up Grant does. The sequence went over the heads of audiences of the early '60s, when \"Charade\" was released. Nobody was openly gay then.Knowing what we do today, it's delightful. And shocking on more than one level.Just another \"in\" joke like others threaded through this film. (\"Here we are, on the street where you live,\" anybody?)The supporting players are all strong. Particularly Walter Matthau, playing (finally and convincingly) against type.Then, there are Miss Hepburn's costumes. Givenchy. Has anyone ever looked so gorgeous or worn clothes so well? Hepburn's celebrated collaboration with Givenchy in both her personal and screen lives is thoroughly documented. Yet here, for some reason (ask Donen) her wardrobe commands attention in every frame.How are clothes CUT like that? What is that coat MADE of? How did they get the seams in that hat? Has any woman -- in Paris OR New York -- ever dressed this well? Nah.She's Audrey Hepburn, you see. And he's Cary Grant.If you want to see two actors, two Golden Age Stars, generations apart, obviously delight in each others' talents and fall in love on screen, glamorously, while undercutting their own glamor and defying you to figure out who's who . . . see \"Charade.\"A tour de force on every level.\"What's wrong with it?\" \"Nothing.\"",

            "content": "Henry Mancini's music and the lyrical title song are not the only virtues of the attractive production of \"Charade\". Stanley Donen, probably the best Alfred Hitchcock school-of director in the twentieth century, also mounted a film featuring beautiful sets, lovely costumes, very fine lighting, sound, cinematography and mush more. And the camera-work and blocking of the actors is extraordinary. But the strongest feature of the film is is intricate and logical storyline. The mysterious death of a young woman's husband makes her the target here of a trio of frightening types. She somehow enlists an enigmatic but attractive man she has met, who signs on to help her. But he proves to be as delusive, have as many false names and be more worrisome than was her mysterious husband, about whom she knew nothing. The four, along with her husband part of an army quartet that had stolen something valuable in WWII, want the item which her husband had stolen. The wife enlists a man from the American Embassy also; but she and the mystery man have to evade the nefarious trio, and try to trust one another; and finally she has to decide if the mystery man or the Embassy man is a killer, and which one will save her life and return the stolen item. Cary Grant does very well, despite being a bit too old to play the mystery man. Walter Matthau is effective as the Embassy man. The three villains are played energetically by James Coburn, intelligent Ned Glass and powerful George Kennedy, with a hook for a hand. There are wonderfully memorable scenes in the film such as a frightening first meeting with the bad trio in the funeral home where her husband is lying; a fight between Grant and Kennedy on the roof; a trip on a barge down the Seine; a hunt for the lost treasure; and a final confrontation in an empty theater. The slow growth of the romance between a reluctant-but-interested Grant and an eager by hesitant Audrey Hepburn as the bewildered wife works very well. This is a fine noir film, very colorful, and with tons of interesting and humorous dialogue. Highly recommended, and almost as good as its reputation says.",

Hitchcock loved to exploit the audience's fear of heights, for instance, and darned if people in this film aren't standing on ledges and looking over railings etc. The locale is, of course, a foreign one, Paris in this case. And Hitchcock regular Cary Grant is here too, with ultra-chic Audrey Hepburn along and fitting the Continental setting perfectly as she so often did. The 'McGuffin', the device that gets the plot rolling, turns out to be some missing money that a criminal gang assume Audrey has in her possession. Cary comes to her rescue. Or is he working his own angle on her? Her suspicions play beautifully off her developing romantic interest, just as every other element in the film fits together seamlessly. The jokes all work, the thrills thrill, the fast paced segments really move, and Audrey and Cary have fabulous romantic and comedic chemistry together. The production design is gorgeous and posh- looking, yet filled with menacing shadows and glaring lights - more of Hitch's visual devices - and Audrey looks suitably lovely in her trademark Givenchy outfits. And it's not all just a trifling style-piece either. The spy-thriller business at the plot's center, without giving too much away, is logical and compelling. When the movie is over, a viewer is conscious of having had an entirely satisfactory entertainment experience. Unfortunately, this was a one-shot for Cary, Audrey and Stanley. With all of the silly spy nonsense that came out in the mid- 60s, I would love to have seen this group team up for another go.",

Real rating = 7.7 (= maybe one of the 10 best films of 1963)It really relies on a great storyline, script and sense of humor mostly with terrific twists. However, it is quite a goofy plot in many ways as Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) doesn't know her husband and falls in love with a liar and suspected killer. Shouldn't she stay clear? No! Danger is about and Reggie loves to stay in the middle. There are tons of twists, half of which is created by Cary Grant's nameless character. He's not the Man with No Name, but rather than Man with a Hundred Names. Despite the twists and Cary's changing names, it's as predictable as Cary's character answer to Audrey's \"Is there a Mrs...\" Cary: \"divorced\". So predictably: girl meets boy, the chase, the mystery solved, etc. It runs as smooth as a brand new Mercedes and Cary and Audrey had great chemistry. The audience can get enamored by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn but it reality, it's one of their weaker performances. It doesn't showcase their talent but relies on their clich\u00e9, not much acting but more like (director:) Cary, you are supposed to be know for this, so do that. Same for Audrey. It is largely a star vehicle like Houseboat was for Cary Grant and Sophia Loren. The acting was quite mediocre. George Kennedy and James Coburn were even worst. However, the supporting casts including Jacques Marin (\"Three men were killed in their pajamas\") and Ned Glass was funnier and better fits. Although this film is compared to Hitchcock, it rather is much more limited in director's artistic skills. Scenes are limited and routine, cinematography is plain (but I love the opening). It lacks the spectacular Hitchcock camera-work and scenes like Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest. Still the lively pace, writing, suspense and twists keep moviegoers on their toes.Although it falls short on merit, Charade might be one of the 60s most entertaining tangled comedy-mysteries.",

Regina is one of Hepburn's least interesting creations, the character's sole trait is that she's funny (and she is. Hepburn and Grant both are very funny in this).

Marred at the end by a little sloppy gunplay.After the death of her husband, Regina (Audrey Hepburn) finds a gang of crooks pursying her (George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass) who think she has some money her husband pilfered from them. She is helped by Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) but is troubled that he keeps coming up with new names. Is he all he's cracked up to be?By turns funny and disturbing (as when Coburn, not yet \"Mr. Cool,\" has Hepburn trapped in a phone booth and throws lighted matches on her), it's a mostly frolicsome farce that never takes anything too seriously, especially not the hilarious funeral setting.It'll probably bore the kidos, and perhaps modern adults who grew up on faster-paced comedies. But like some great comedies of my youth (Ghostbusters, Back to the Future) it's not ashamed to dawdle a bit setting up its premise. I don't know if Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn fans are extinct or if I'm a voice crying in the wilderness, but those two phenominal stars play well together. And the rising stars like Coburn make the most of their screen time.At times it's almost a perfect changing of the guard, with old-style Studio product Grant facing down exciting new blood like Coburn, two huge stars of their respective days with totally different styles. It's clear in retrospect Grant's day has passed and a new breed of actor will be seizing the screen. *But not yet.* Grant looks a little creaky but he's still Cary Grant. Hepburn is lovely and funny and what else do you need?Overall, lots of fun and excitement and romance for those who can stomach a leisurely comedy that takes time over details.One caveat: the ending feels uncomfortably rushed, as if the movie took up all its time up front and has to cut the end off with a knife.

It is unlikely that I have anything entirely novel to say about it, yet I still feel compelled to give my impressions of this excellent film, having just seen it for about the fifth time.Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are excellent here; despite his advancing years Grant is pretty spry and Hepburn is as lovely as ever, if painfully skinny-looking.Comparisons are made with Hitchcock films, and not without some justification; Cary Grant rushing around under an assumed identity, helping a beautiful woman involved in a mystery, it is reminiscent of 'North by Northwest'.But this film is really its own thing. The dialogue is so sharp and witty, particularly in the first half of the film; it is difficult to imagine anyone else saying those lines. (BTW this feeling is in no way diminished by the idiotic and lacklustre 'truth about charlie' remake). There are even a few goofy moments and sight gags too (such as when Inspector Grandpierre is watching the Punch and Judy show; I missed that before).There really isn't an on-screen moment wasted, and as it goes on the film's pace and seriousness both increase to a crescendo. I won't spoil it for the first time viewer, but you really are kept guessing, right up to the end.Weirdly this film is in the public domain because of a copyright marking cock-up.

            "content": "When Audrey Hepburn says to Cary Grant in 1963's CHARADE \"You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!\", it is a great line because everyone watching knows that she is really talking about Cary Grant, not the character he is playing. When Thandie Newton says to Mark Wahlberg in THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE \"You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!\", it is a relatively meaningless piece of dialogue, because, even though Wahlberg is apparently a nice guy and pretty good actor, he is no Cary Grant, and his character has done nothing to garner such praise. But then again, Newton is no Hepburn. And CHARLIE is certainly no CHARADE.CHARADE is one of the most pleasing pieces of fluff that Hollywood has ever made. Despite a notable body count and a few suspenseful moments, the film is really a romantic comedy. Despite its intricate plot of double crosses, fake identities and a mad search for some missing loot in a picture-postcard Paris, it is designed to amuse. It is Hitchcock-lite; as directed by Stanley Donen, a man best known for directing films like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the film also is constructed like a musical, stringing together a few remarkable set pieces with a silly plot and clever banter. But most of all, CHARADE is an excuse to pair up Grant and Hepburn, two experts in the field of romantic comedy. If ever a film were personality driven it is CHARADE, which sports not just pros Grant and Hepburn, but a batch of gifted character actors such as Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Nobody would ever mistake CHARADE for great filmmaking, but as sprightly comedy tinged with dark humor it is hard to beat.But for some inexplicable reason it was remade in 2002 as the rather blandly named THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. I can only assume that the filmmakers realized that there was no way they could equal the wit and style of the original -- not to mention the difficulty in finding contemporary stars comparable to Hepburn and Grant -- so they opted to play the film more or less straight. That may have made sense if the plot of the original was anything to be taken seriously. But remaking a comedy-thriller as just a thriller and stripping it of its Hollywood gloss for a gritty realistic look really does not make a lot of sense. Add to that some ill-conceived politically correct updating -- a dash of lesbianism, a bit of feminism (the police detective is now a woman) and a multiethnic cast -- and the style and the content of the film seem mismatched. Jonathan Demme, a director who once showed a knack for making light and quirky comedies like HANDLE WITH CARE and MELVIN AND HOWARD, now makes mostly dark and dreary dramas like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He has become a \"serious\" filmmaker in the worst sense of the word.The film might still have been above average with proper casting, but the best that can be said for Wahlberg and Newton is that they are okay, but they never come off as a romantic couple. Certainly the sparkling chemistry of Grant and Hepburn is missing, but then the film never even tried for that tone in the first place. Only Tim Robbins, taking on the Walter Matthau role, seems to remember that the source material for the film was a comedy.As is, CHARLIE is a perfectly competent and perfectly forgettable little thriller. But that is not enough to make it anything more than just a dour stepchild of a minor classic.",

Coming just one year after Sean Connery wooed the world with his characterisation of James Bond, this cheerful outing, with themes of murder, theft and deceit, has the initial feel of Terence Young's iconic 007 debut, in its colourful, yet cartoon-ish opening credits sequence.Henry Mancini's music helps in setting an early mischievous tone that reverberates throughout the entire film. Audrey Hepburn is introduced, framed in a suitably beautiful looking ski resort, with an enjoyably playful early scene between herself and Cary Grant. It's a sharp, funny scene that assures a certain comical impetus.After this, the main thrust of the plot kicks in, which rotates around a web of secret identities and bubbly flirtatiousness. The film does occasionally cross genres over to being that of a thriller. One rooftop fight scene between Cary Grant and the ever burly George Kennedy, could easily be mistaken for one of 007's more exciting exploits. Furthermore, there are some surprisingly visual glimpses of the aftermath of murder, which given the established, lighter tone, might catch you off guard.The real draw here though, is the repartee between Hepburn and Grant. As Regina Lampert, Hepburn carries over her kooky charm from Breakfast at Tiffany's, with another quick witted display that see's the film through some of its more silly, screwball sections. Likewise, Cary Grant, although reportedly insecure about the age difference between himself and his co-star on set, cuts a relaxed presence, making for some delightful interplay between the actors.Charade is pure, old school Hollywood charm. If anything, the plot is little more than a vehicle for the fun and games that Hepburn and Grant enjoy. If you try and see it as anything other than a little bit of light fun, you've got yourself a case of mistaken identity.",

Meanwhile she is asked to display all this haute couture stuff and whoever thought it was a good idea to display clothes on that body must be having a laugh. Sad and cringe making at times there are just enough moments, especially those with Walter Matthau to keep this going until the delirious last section. Why, oh why couldn't we have had more of this? Instead of a motley collection of gents in hotel rooms we could have been out in the sunny streets of Paris.

Do you shoo him away and continue your work, or leave in the middle of a U.N. meeting to go be with him? It's utterly ridiculous and unbelievable.\nThen you find out the guy has lied about his identity 4 different times, yet you STILL trust him?\nYou accidentally give valuable stamps to a bratty kid, who in turns sells them to a stamp vendor.

The money is supposedly in the possession of Reggie Lambert's (Audrey Hepburn) husband (one of several unlucky folks who aren't around for the final reel) but, after he is murdered, the money is not anywhere to be found.  To help Reggie cope with her husband's murder, the divorcee Peter Joshua mysteriously appears in her apartment, having first met her briefly on a ski vacation. To her dismay, she discovers that some rather unsavory folks are looking for the money -- and think she has it.  A CIA agent named Bartholomew (Walther Matthau) offers to help her, as long as she helps him find the money.  From this point, the movie takes a long of unexpected twists and turns that will frighten and delight you the first time you see it, and amuse your memory every time after that.  You will NOT know the entire story until the last scene.If Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and a Parisian setting don't sell you, than add Matthau, George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, great dialogue, and a soundtrack by Henry Mancini.

Hailing from the days when Hollywood knew how to make light, sophisticated, thoroughly artificial entertainment. (When modern Hollywood tries, the results generally thud.) This movie has nothing to do with \"reality\" as we understand it; it's a playground for adults. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, wears faultless Givenchy clothes (on a translator's salary?) and tosses off endless Parisian-style bon mots without the slightest effort (everyone's favorite has got to be her summary of \"what's wrong with\" Cary Grant.) When her life is put in danger, she is just as intense as she was in the thriller \"Wait Until Dark\", but without losing her sense of humor. (After an unsettling sadistic scene where James Coburn corners her in a telephone booth and tortures her with lighted matches, she's discovered by Grant, who asks, \"What are you doing in here?\" \"I'm having a nervous breakdown,\" she growls.) In fact, this movie may be unparalleled in its balancing of comedy and suspense.

Grant thought it would be unattractive for a guy his age to chase a much younger woman, so he insisted Audrey be the one who is enamored of him, in the film. This works, more or less - Cary is remarkably well preserved for a 59 year old man. He looks good, and some of the things he's required to do in the film would exhaust a man ten years younger. I don't think there's much sexual chemistry between him and Audrey, but that doesn't seem to bother too many people who see the film.There are a few good set-pieces, in the Hitchcock vein, like the fight on a hotel roof and the business with the theater trap doors.Overall, the premise seems a bit contrived, and the people don't seem real, but a lot is done to try to hide that fact, and it almost works.

At least it works as a framework for the spontaneous and intimate interplay between Hepburn and Grant, who seem so smitten with each other that they're happy to digress from Peter Stone's meaningless screenplay to flirt heavily. (At one point, Hepburn hilariously interrupts Grant to ask how he manages to shave his cleft chin.) The score by Henry Mancini, including the now-famous title song (with lyrics by Johnny Mercer), is actually pretty good--dark, mature jazz that's more memorable than Donen's disinterested direction, a minor effort from a worthwhile filmmaker.",

All I could remember was that the plot had to do with some extremely rare stamps which I liked because I was a big stamp collector at that age. Otherwise, I seem to recall I found the film slow-moving and quite unappealingNow as an \"old man\" at 69, I still found the film slow-moving but now believe I have a slightly better idea why it's so unappealing and the reasons why it \"doesn't work.\"For staters I didn't buy the idea that Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) was not able to provide any information about her recently murdered husband Charles to the investigating Parisian police inspector. It sounds like he never spent any time with her, and they hardly spoke to one another. A wife would not have tolerated that from the beginning and would have known at least a few things about the husband.Reggie seems like a complete fool (despite being a French-English translator) after being duped by a man pretending to be the US Ambassador Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) who somehow sneaks into the US Embassy and pulls off this huge con.Reggie learns why Charles was murdered: it seems he was an OSS agent who pilfered $250,000 in gold ($3.8 million in today's money) scheduled to be delivered to the French Resistance during World War II. Charles double crossed four fellow agents who were going to split the proceeds of the theft.The fellow agents were: Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), noted for a metal hook prothesis in place of a hand, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), with a marked southern accent, Leopold Gideon (Ned Glass), the more intellectual type of the bunch and Carson Dyle who allegedly was killed by the Germans during the war.In steps Cary Grant adopting various aliases to prevent Reggie from really knowing who he is as he seems after the cash too. Grant had screenwriter Peter Stone rewrite the script because he felt it was creepy that an almost 60-year-old man would be running after the much younger Reggie (Hepburn being 34 at the time).Instead, Stone has Reggie pursuing Grant. Better than the aging Grant going after the younger Hepburn for sure-but the other way around still makes you wonder why Grant bothered to play such a part. And may I say that Hepburn never fit in as a romantic leading lady given her overall physique and demeanor (she should have been solely a character actor throughout her career as evidenced by her bravura performance in the 1959 hit \"The Nun's Story\").The bulk of the machinations in Act II involve the trio threatening Reggie, demanding that she reveal where Charles put the stolen loot. The scenes with the bumbling former OSS agents seem contrived for several reasons. First, why do they all now show up trying to find the pilfered funds when they could have confronted Charles years ago?Why do the three keep threatening to kill Reggie for if they went through with their threats they would be no closer to finding out where Charles stashed the money. I suppose they're supposed to be hotheads who think they can scare her into spilling the beans. Instead of trusting \"Grant\" (who now claims to be Carson Dyle's brother) to sweet talk the beleaguered translator into revealing where the money is, they would rather unpleasantly continue to harrass her.The former OSS agents all turn up dead in gruesome ways which clash with the film's main selling point as some kind of romantic comedy.You know the rest: Walter Matthau turns up as Carson Dyle who survived the war and is now gunning for Reggie who figures out how her husband hid the money: he used the cash to buy those extremely rare stamps.Cary Grant saves Reggie from the clutches of the fake ambassador and then reveals himself in the film's best twist-as a US Treasury agent.None of these characters really have any interesting back stories especially Reggie who seems merely intent on landing the Treasury agent as the marriage fodder he clearly comes to be.As farce, Charade's bumbling trios' machinations are too ridiculous to be taken seriously and the romance between an aging actor coupled with an actress unsuited in playing any romantic leading roles at all, leave Charade to the dustbin of all overrated rom coms in cinematic history.",

            "content": "CHARADE would be a movie-lover's treasure for no other reason than it gave Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn their only on-screen pairing. Were there ever two film stars easier to look at than Grant and Hepburn, who epitomized elegance, glamour and sophistication over two generations? Despite their 25 year age difference, their on-screen chemistry is like watching cotton candy being spun out of the air. \"You know what's wrong with you?\" a querulous Hepburn demands of Grant after a trying evening out. \"No, what?\" out-of-sorts Grant replies. Hepburn leans over to him with her liquid doe eyes and dreamily intones, \"Nothing.\" That triple entendre, meltingly spoken by Hepburn, delights as a moment of cinematic perfection. Another is Walter Matthau's impeccable comic timing as he corrects Hepburn's mistakenly calling the CIA the \"CIO.\" It's worth waiting for.But the stars, gorgeous and witty as they are (check out Hepburn's hilarious final line of the film) are not the only element that makes CHARADE sparkle. The script shines as much as the acting and the direction. The film is unashamedly full of Hitchcock touches (why apologize for borrowing from the best?) yet never feels derivative. The clever original story by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and fine pacing by director Stanley Donen keeps the audience guessing through the many twists and turns that lead to Hepburn's climactic discovery of Grant's true identity--the \"charade\" of the title.My only quibble would be the shower scene--perhaps taking the borrowings from Hitchcock into parody. It feels unnecessary and slows down the story. Seeing Cary Grant embarrass himself in this way with his effeminate gestures as he washes in his \"drip-dry\" suit jars the viewer temporarily right out of the picture. And the trio of heavies that dominate the first 2/3rds of the film, played by James Coburn, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy, seem to be working too hard to be frightening when no one seems particularly scared of them. Hepburn's panic only begins to register when she confronts Grant at the end. Hepburn saved her intense terror for WAIT UNTIL DARK five years later, so why not let these villains lighten up a little and get into the spirit of the fun? These are minor distractions. With its effervescent score by Henry Mancini, gorgeous wardrobe by Givenchy for Miss Hepburn, and shimmering photography in Paris and Swiss locations by Charles B. Lang, CHARADE is the assured work of old pros, supremely confident movie makers who set out to entertain and did so while barely missing a beat. Even The Master himself was charmed. Hitchcock wanted Grant and Hepburn for the lead roles in THE BIRDS.",

The entire movie focuses on the achievement of one goal : to find the money that was stolen during war by a group of fellows. There are lots of surprising, funny and intelligent turnarounds, until the last minute of the movie, therefore the suspense is really intense and the movie can proudly be called a police film. A mix of action and romance very well balanced. Not to mention the remarkable performances of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, without whom the main characters would be nothing.An excellent movie.",

His less-than-dashing appearance is accentuated (exacerbated?) by the much younger, cream-colored and waif-like Audrey Hepburn, who however throws herself at Grant's fatherly figure at every available opportunity--that is, whenever she is not eating something. One can only wonder whether she has an extremely overactive thyroid or is perhaps bulimic, given how thin she is, despite eating constantly throughout the film. The story is amusing and lightly entertaining. It's a comedic murder mystery caper whose primary intention appears to be to stoke Cary Grant's ego. Charade was fun to watch, despite my issues with the Audrey Hepburn character, who does not seem to have much of an identity and seeks only to endear herself to the duplicitous Cary Grant character for reasons which remain inscrutable. The film would have been better in black and white, aesthetically speaking. Overall, I'd say that this production is a far cry from Notorious, where a younger Grant becomes romantically entangled with Ingrid Bergman with some similar dynamics in play. Notorious is a film worth watching over and over again. Charade is not.",

Being characterized as\"the best Hitchock film that Hitchock never made\",in my opinion \"Charade\" combines every element that makes a film classic and at the same time a sheer joy to watch!! More precisely, it includes two screen legends,clever plot with twists and smart lines, nice supporting actors, suspense, a sophisticated love story and a perfect musical background by Henry Mancini-...in other words this is as good as it gets!! Audrey Hepburn plays Regina Lambert,a young woman whose late husband's mysterious illegal connections when they are revealed get her into trouble, since she had no idea!!!...And of course at this point enters Cary Grant who appears willing to help her and trustworthy..but is he?In my opinion, one of the main elements that makes this film so unique is the fact that Cary Grant ,plays one of his most popular roles in his filmography in such a sophisticated and comfortable way that depicts his confidence and star quality just perfectly. What if his leading co-star is 20 years younger?-his absolutely smooth way and his incomparable style cover this soft spot completely. Generally,Cary Grant during the 50's and the 60's is quite clear that chooses to perform in a more sophisticated and less extroverted way, in comparison to his popular roles in the earlier decades of the 30's and the 40's.Thanks to this change he demonstrates the extent of his talent. Probably he makes that change due to the fact that he is a bit older and therefore much more experienced and confident and has no need to prove his value to anyone. Of course in order to be fair we have to acknowledge Audrey Hepburn's talent as well as her comfort and wit that match perfectly with Grant's more introverted character.Let's be honest..!who else could ask Grant \"how does he shave up there?\" in a cuter way?..I believe no one...If you like suspense, clever and hilarious lines and you like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant there is no reason to miss this nearly perfect film 10/10",

            "content": "From the first running minutes of \"Charade\", I could tell that I was about to watch a very special, outstanding film. The way I feel about classic Hollywood film, especially comedy, is that there is a certain magic about it, something that is able to reconcile the viewer with the world. I've never known exactly what it is -it may be the light-heartedness spirit that those movies convey, with their witty dialog, their absence of any kind of crudeness -or, in the case of dramas and action or adventure films, the moderation and prudence with which adult content was treated-, and the charisma, talent, and elegance of the Golden Era stars. Well, \"Charade\" is one of the quintessential representatives of all of the above.\"Charade\" is a delightful and very funny comedy, a sexy (for the time it was made) romance and a challenging suspenseful mystery that, yes, reminds of Alfred Hitchcock, and it gives you an idea of what could have come had \"Hitch\" and the exquisite Audrey Hepburn teamed up. Here, we already have her coupled up with one of Hitchcock's favorite male stars, Cary Grant, and the result couldn't have been better, for they make up one of the most exciting and in-tune on-screen couples. Add to the cast Walter Matthau, Charles Coburn and George Kennedy, and it can't possibly get very far from anyone's dream cast. Set the story in a beautifully photographed Paris, and voila, a glamorous, fast-paced, intelligent, and very funny film.In \"Charade\", Audrey Hepburn, at the peak of her renowned beauty and her fame, plays Regina Lampert, who finds herself a widow upon returning to her Paris home -her husband has been murdered. She immediately gets a call from US Embassy representative Hamilton Bartholomew (Matthau), who requests that a quarter of a million dollars unlawfully kept by the late Mr Lampert be returned to the Government. But the US Government is not the only one that seeks Mrs Lampert, for she is soon chased after by three mysterious -and not at all friendly- men who were apparently in some kind of relation with her late husband. Only the attractive and nonchalant Peter Joshua (Grant) jumps in for her rescue. Lucky her... or is she? I believe that even those many viewers who are not accustomed or are even perhaps not appealed to classic films could enjoy this. It can hardly get any better.My vote is 10/10.",

With information provided by Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) of the American Embassy, Reggie's hunt for that elusive quarter of a million dollars begins... with the dubious help of the man she meets (and instinctively trusts) in the mountains, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), and the dogged pursuit of Charlie's partners in crime who want a cut of the money, Tex (James Coburn), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Gideon (Ned Glass). The illicit deal made in the past between Charlie and his army buddies tangles with the present as, one after another, the people after the money keep coming up empty-handed... and dead. Can Reggie's one friend, the man whose name she can never be sure of, be trusted? Or, in the end, is he the one who is ruthlessly eliminating everyone until there's no one else to share the money with? Speaking of which, where *is* the money that Charlie was killed for? Are they all hunting for something that just can't be found?You'll have to find these answers--and such answers they are!--by watching CHARADE yourself. What a treat you'll be letting yourself in for... this in spite of the fact that the film starts out a little slowly, and never quite dispels the feeling that everything one sees and hears as part of the audience is all too well-manufactured. A lot of the banter between Reggie and Peter, for example, seems just a little *too* glib; all the coincidences and plot twists (though they make for simply marvellous movie-watching!) just this side of too perfect. It all fits perfectly during the film, but you do come away from it wondering if you--and Reggie!--have been cheated just once too many times. However, that's just about the only caveat one can find about the extent to which you'll enjoy watching this film. Quite frankly, leave disbelief behind and you'll find yourself just enjoying the ride. Revel in the dialogue (crisp and stylish in the best tradition of romantic comedy), the settings (it's a nice picture of Paris, the ideal backdrop for high espionage and deep romance), and the cleverness of the script. The plot really is quite exceptional, though a bit contrived, and some of the twists--for there are several!--really leave you gasping. If for nothing else, this film is as good as any to serve as an introduction to Cary Grant. He's suave, just a little bit roguish, smiles that heartbreaking smile and tosses off those lines so naturally you'd wish he *had* become the original (James) Bond. From the absolutely priceless orange-game scene, through to his shower fully-clothed for Reggie's sake, Grant displays that impeccable and under-rated comedic timing he was born with... just as he shows his talent for darker drama (mined so successfully by Hitchcock in NOTORIOUS, another top-notch spy thriller) in the final scenes of this film. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, has that innate ability to make the audience fall in love with her over the course of a film--I must say that I hadn't warmed to her at first, thinking her too detached for the film. I don't mean her character, who is *meant* to be a little 'nuts' and detachedly asks for food (repeatedly!) and cigarettes every time she's faced with another stunning revelation. Hepburn herself seemed a bit removed from the action going on in the film, a little oblivious to the other actors around her. Fortunately this sense of distancing didn't last too long--by the time Reggie and Peter stared into each other's eyes while passing oranges under their chins (it's a lot sexier than it sounds, trust me), you could tell that Hepburn was in quite formidable control of her role. I couldn't let this review go by without mentioning the delicious telephone scene in CHARADE, surely a nod to a similar, electrically-charged scene in NOTORIOUS between Grant and Ingrid Bergman. It works, of course, just as one can believe Reggie chasing after Peter despite the discrepancy in their ages.With a great cast, a great script and excellent direction by Stanley Donen (which might explain the Gene Kelly references--one explicit and another subtler--in the film), one really wonders why anyone would even consider remaking CHARADE (i.e. save yourself the trouble of seeing 'The Truth About Charlie', and watch this instead). Grant already is irreplaceable. Add in the other elements of this film--suspense, comedy, drama, the luminous Audrey Hepburn--and CHARADE really is untouchable. 8.5/10",

It has an excellent suspense plot, great romance played by Audrey and Cary Grant, crisp and witty dialogs, excellent background music and simply superb finish.The plot revolves around Regina Lampert (Audrey), widow of a recently deceased American Charles Lampert, who is killed on a train and has supposedly left behind a fortune of a quarter million dollars. Only trouble is, no one seems to find the money. Regina is chased by 3 thugs; add in the mix the mysterious Peter Joshua/Alexander Dyle/Adam Canfield/Brain Cruikshank (Cary Grant), who seems to change his names like everyday clothes, but is still enchanting enough to gain trust from Regina. The money supposedly belongs to the CIA (and not the CIO...ha ha!) and Mr. Barthalomew wants to recover it for the American government. Needless to say, he wants that money as badly as the thug gang and the mysterious Peter Joshua.The story has great twists in the plot and the on suspense rating, it is at least 9 of 10. The motives of Peter Joshua are very suspect throughout the movie and the end is pure Hitchcock style double somersault.OK, now the great bits. This is the only movie to pair Audrey and Cary Grant, 2 of the most beloved and captivating leads together. Though Grant is 25 years older than Audrey, their romance is not only believable, it is electric!! Audrey has a successful stint of acting opposite men much older than her and this is the best example. Crisp dialog, excellent situational comedy embedded within a great suspect plot and Audrey's enchanting innocence paired with Grant's urbane sophisticated connivery adds a great flair to this movie. This movie can also pass as one of the best classic comedies. Though the movie is a suspense, it is not a thriller. Your heart won't race at incredible pace with anxiety keeping you on the edge throughout. Instead, you can only sit back and enjoy a great romance on the backdrops of a worthy suspense story. A full 10 points to Audrey and Carey as one of the best romantic couples of all time.This movie has the taste of a cultured wine. At no point does it touch vulgarity even once. Even when Audrey asks Grant to use her shower (which would arouse too many amorous hormones in todays cinema), the scene is turned tastefully into one of the best comic sequences of the movie. According to me, this movie demonstrates clearly Audrey has an incredible sex appeal...maybe the best of all time...and she has done it without a single vulgar gesture. Todays female leads need to take some lessons! Finally, \"Truth about Charlie\" is the recent remake of this movie. Frankly, it was not as bad as I expected...but it comes nowhere close to this original gem. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and dare them not to love Audrey and Cary Grant after viewing it. One important hint: You can have both the movies in one single DVD. Get the DVD of \"Truth about Charlie\" and be delighted to find Charade on the other side!",

I've just rented the DVD of Charade issued by Madacy and this seems a classic example of how not to do a DVD. The extras are a poor, 20 minute \"biography\" of Cary Grant that contains some inaccuracies and has the narrator droning on over grainy clips of \"coming attractions\" from his films. It commits the cardinal sin of saying that \"North by Northwest\" was Grant's \"last important film\". Then why rent this one, which was done four years later?It also has an insipid three question trivia quiz where, if you get the wrong answer, they show the scene of the water from the child's water pistol being squirted in Audrey's face and if you get it right you see a shot of a combo from the film playing something involving beating the drums. I was expecting production notes. Then there is the \"Bonus Feature\", a 1953 film also called \"Charade\" starring James Mason that has absolutely nothing to do with the decade-later film. How is any of this supposed to enhance your enjoyment of the movie? There are no commentaries, production notes, newsreels of the premiere, documentaries about THE FILM, etc. Nothing. Charade, indeed.My view of Charade itself is that it's THE classic romantic thriller. I like it better than North by Northwest. Hitchcock made some greater films, (especially \"Rear Window\", one of my all-time favorites), but even his romantic thrillers take a back seat to this romp. Later films have tried to match it but none of them do. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are the two most charming performers ever to be in the same film. How many performers today would you describe as \"charming\"? It's something that has virtually disappeared from the cinema.",

I could go on for hours about Hepburn but to sum up: Audrey Hepburn was a Lady who was a great actress who was the most glamorous well dressed star of her era.This pic is set in glamorous Paris and the suspense works well. With these stars one becomes immediately entranced in the story.The likes of Grant, Hepburn and Matthau do not exist on today's Hollywood.Audrey died far too young. Audrey Hepburn was and still is the only woman who could wear a polka dot top and a stripe bottom at the Oscars as a presenter and get a standing ovation.* Cary Grant's last picture was Walk Don't Run at Columbia with Jim Hutton in the Joel McCrea role and Samantha Eggar in the Jean Arthur rookie, and Grant in the Charles Coburn role.",

            "content": "It is certainly understandable how this movie has come to be known as \"the best Hitchcock movie he never made.\" Nor should we fault those who have called CHARADE a Hithcock movie. The similarities are uncanny: Shocking opening scene involving a corpse, psychedelic opening credits (a la Vertigo and Psycho), Cary Grant stars as a thief, international intrigue plays a part, the female lead is strong yet beautiful, it has an unexpected plot twist, and it ends with a surprise. AND it's even put out by Universal (just like nearly every other American Hitchcock movie)! Most of all this movie is filled with incredibly black humor that trademarked many of Hitchcock's films. But Charade is not a Hitchcock film, it is a Stanley Donan film. And while it does star Cary Grant as a thief, it does not star a blond-haired leading lady (and by 1963, Hitchcock was deep into his blond-haired obsession - Tippi Hedrin anyone?). Instead, the stunningly beautiful Audrey Hepburn stars opposite Grant, and she has jet-black hair. The story is basically one in which Hepburn's character (Reggie Lampert) finds herself the widow of a murdered husband. She goes on to find, thanks to CIA agent Bartholomew (Walter Matthau in a rare dramatic performance), that her husband had left behind $250,000 in stolen money in some form or another. But that money is not only wanted by the CIA, but by her husband's three - or is it four? - companions who had helped him steal it. These companions, played by Grant, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass, start dying off one by one, and Hepburn finds herself fighting to trust Grant (who keeps revealing a different identity), while all the while falling in love with him.This is truly one of the most underrated movies of all time. First of all, the directing is worthy of Hitchcock. Although it does not include any of Hitchcock's memorable tricks (probably because this is NOT a Hutchcock movie!) it does a very good job of keeping the pace of the movie interesting, while not sacrificing character development or subtlety.\nThe acting is simply stunning. Cary Grant, slightly gray in this, one of his last movies, is stunning as always, capturing that blend of humor and mischief that  made his To Catch a Thief performance so classic. He shines as always, proving that we may never get an actor like him ever. In CHARADE, it is quite obvious that Ian Flemming knew what he was talking about when he modeled James Bond after Grant's characterisms and acting style. Hepburn is gorgeous. The chemistry between her and Cary is fantastic (on a par with Grant and Grace Kelly in TCaT). Not only that, but on the eve of the sexual revolution, Grant and Hepburn were able to create a movie filled with sexual and steamy romance without a single iota of nudity or crass language. The supporting cast is equally good. Grant's three cohorts are equally funny and diabolical, partly parody and partly malevolent. Matthau also provides some good acting. although he falls somewhat short towards the end.But what really stands out throughout CHARADE is the humor. In the funeral hall, as Hepburn's dead husband lies in repose, his still-living compatriots march in, each in an increasingly funny entrance (think sneezing and door-slamming). The amounts of macabre humor rival any Hitchcock movie out there. Likewise, the screwball hilarity is reminiscent of other Grant classics like \"Arsenic and Old Lace\". For example, after several minutes of debating Grant's taking a shower in Hepburn's room, he walks into the shower and begins scrubbing with his clothes on. The humor and romance intertwined around the intrigue and death is simply beautiful.Once again, CHARADE is severely underrated. It deserves the recognition that \"Rear Window\" and \"Psycho\" receive as being top-notch thrillers. Undoubtedly one of Grant's best movies, and it would have been one of Hitchcock's best, too... If only he had made it.10/10",

            "content": "I'm sure that you've seen plenty of movies that have tried to mix different movie genres.  There have been quite a few successful romantic comedies, as well as action flicks that mix in a little bit of comedy.  But no movie measures up to the eclectic genre mix of 1963's Charade.  Stanley Donen could have played the safe route and made a simple dramatic thriller about a woman whose husband is killed and is pursued by three men wanting the money that he left behind.  But instead, he chose to successfully mix drama, romance, suspense, and comedy into a classic movie featuring two of the best actors of all time, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn.  Today's actors only wish that they had the fantastic dialogue that these two throw back and forth effortlessly in this film.  Sure, Grant is about 20 years older than Hepburn, and initially it's a little silly thinking about the two of them hooking up.  But the movie makes the couple work, even playing upon it with the quips that the two exchange about their age gap.Grant and Hepburn are perfect in their respective roles.  The movie does a great job trying to throw the viewer a loop by the constant name-changing of Grant's character; soon you begin to wonder what the heck his name is and what in the world he is up to.  The movie also features a young Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy... yes, Leslie Nielsen's partner from the Naked Gun movies, looking a little frightening as the one-handed Herman.  One of the most entertaining scenes in the movie involves Cary Grant taking a shower... fully clothed in a suit.  Watching it will bring a smile to your face.One last thing: there is currently a remake of this movie called The Truth about Charlie underway starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton.  I'm sure that plenty of things will be changed... I see that the character name of Peter Joshua that Grant's character had at the very beginning of the movie has already changed to Joshua Peters for Mark Wahlberg.  While Grant and Hepburn only got to some mild smooching during the film, I'm sure that the two main characters will be hitting the sheets in the remake.  While the new spin on this movie is still a few months in the future, I hope that it at least attempts to measure up to the greatness of the original.10/10",

            "content": "Charade is often hailed as \"the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never got around to making\", sometimes thought of in terms of ersatz Hitchcock, and that's understandable. But in hindsight, it really does director Stanley Donen a disservice because he brings into Charade a lot of flair and chutzpah, resulting in a delightful mystery-cum-romance that sparkles with all the vigor of freshly uncorked champagne.The stunningly playful opening credits designed by Maurice Binder places you right amidst the snow- capped mountains of the French Alps, where we see our leading lady Reggie Lambert enjoying a ski trip. She soon returns to Paris to find her house ransacked and her husband dead. His funeral is attended by three curious thugs, each of whom makes sure that the corpse is indeed dead. Peter Joshua, a handsome pickup acquaintance from her vacation, comforts Reggie and offers his assistance, as does CIA man Bartholomew who informs her that her husband was part of a gang which, during World War II, stole and stashed a quarter of a million dollars. Naturally, everyone thinks \u2013 mistakenly - that Reggie knows the whereabouts of the money. Meanwhile, Reggie finds herself falling in love with Peter, although she suspects that he too is after the money, especially given his fondness for aliases \u2013 first Peter Joshua, then Alexander Dyle, the deceased's heart stricken brother, later as professional thief Adam Canfield, and still later as Brian Cruikshank. The gullible Reggie can't help being befuddled. As the corpses begin to accumulate, it becomes increasingly important - and difficult - for Reggie to determine who the good guys are and who are the villains.Charade plays out as a slick, stylish thriller, with great on location shots and a chic Henry Mancini score, humming along in a breezy entertaining way with plenty of charm. But the film owes its reputation largely to the crackling repartee between its leading stars - the always elegant 32-year-old Audrey Hepburn and the always charismatic 60-year-old Cary Grant. Grant always had a bit of a dark side, a sinister center to his suave humor, that helps him out here as he plays different variations of essentially the same character. We only ever know as much as Hepburn does, and we're never sure we can trust him. It's a great performance. The luminous Hepburn is equally fabulous as she plays the damsel in distress, without giving into the clich\u00e9s associated with such a character. The sexual chemistry between them, when set against Charade's tumultuous backdrop of shifting identities, makes this movie an enduring favorite.After all these years, Charade still remains the real deal, not some cheap, exploding cheeseburger of a movie pretender. Charade reminds us that when all the elements come together, it's possible for Hollywood to make a flawless entertainment that thoroughly whisks us away. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.",

            "content": "As dark comedies go, Charade is about as entertaining as you can get and a must see. All the elements of a great thriller pass before your eyes in a little less than two hours, but you also leave (or get off the couch) with a smile and perhaps even a chuckle, instead of just the usual stretch and yawn. I mean really, how can you get better than this? Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were perfectly cast in the elegant lead roles of \"Peter Joshua\" and \"Reggie Lambert.\" Whether or not those characters were written to be particularly chic, they attained that status by association (or perhaps osmosis) as a result of being played by those two great stylish actors. Yes, there is an age difference between the two (which both Mr. Joshua and Ms. Lambert allude to several times during the movie), however, we seem to accept the building romance between them rather easily, largely due to Mr. Grant's aging, but still well received, charisma. Here, two of the most glamorous stars of the middle portion of the twentieth century...albeit from different halves...work some mild form of sexual magic on film without ever literally going to bed with one another. It works because the 'sex' in this case is the alluring mix of murder, romance, marriage all rolled together in one chaotic screenplay. The real mystery of this multi-mystery thriller lay in the question(s) (which are really presented at the very beginning of the movie...and continue to its very end) \"How, where, and when will Peter Joshua (is that his real name?) and Reggie get together?\" Now for the rest of the fantastic acting/directing ensemble. George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass nailed the \"less than loyal mean natured old Army partners of the deceased (murdered) husband of the pretty widow who is thought to be hiding a small fortune which is really 'theirs' parts.\" The CIA/mystery villain of the story was played to a comic, confusing, and at times terrifying tee by Walter Matthau. And then finally you have a great, a-one, first class director in Stanley Donen (also the producer of the film), who is probably best known for making the greatest musical of them all, \"Singing in the Rain.\" Mr. Donen's musical background can be felt throughout the picture as the laughs, surprises, editing (with Jim Clark at the editing reel) and overall pace are well choreographed in the way that a musical would have been told/shown\u0085had this been a musical. Of course, much of this great pacing (and dialog) is due to the terrific writing skills of Peter Stone (and Marc Behm). The addition of some great musical scoring by the legendary master of '60s cocktail music himself Henry Mancini, helped to further support this heavy weight film (which garnished an Academy Award nomination for the title song -the only one for the movie by the way). So what do you get when you put all of this together?...you get a finely orchestrated thilledy or comeder (depending if you are a glass half full or empty person). Often times the movie feels like a Hitchcock film (which I am using as a complement) in the sense that it\u0085looks like Hitchcock, feels like Hitchcock, smells like Hitchcock, tastes like Hitchcock\u0085must be Hitchcock\u0085or not. Perhaps it's its own thing\u0085a musical mystery\u0085without the music (which I know is just a mystery\u0085but it's really too lyrical to be JUST a mystery). However you look at it, you get one hell of a fun (killer) ride. What you've missed if you haven't watched: Regina Lambert (Audrey Hepburn) is pursued by four ex (or could be 3 or 5) WW2 Army cohorts of Charles Lambert (is that HIS real name? \u0096 her freshly murdered, but was going to divorce anyway, husband). She soon learns that Charles, her husband, stole $250,000 of the US government's money during the war and double-crossed his Army war \"buddies\" in the process. Everyone wants the money, but no one knows just where it is (or that is what we are led to believe). The only real clue(s) left behind by her husband are stored in a Lufthansa bag\u0085and seem of little consequence. The story is chock full of deception, with nobody knowing just who is who. Reggie, through all of the new found truths and lies, becomes more and more vulnerable\u0085seeking occasional comfort under the multifaceted guises of Peter (whatever his name is). All this fun and action takes place in Paris, which was adeptly filmed by master cinematographer Charles Lang and is one of those films that really makes you feel as if you are in France\u0085not on a set made to look like France. Around every twist there is a turn\u0085what's up is probably down\u0085and nothing is what it appears. There's some great banter, exciting chase scenes, and a most excellent fight sequence that takes place on the roof of the American Express building between Herman Scobie (George Kennedy's nasty artificial armed character) and Peter (Joshua). Humor and intelligent action pervade until the end though as the tale continues to provide for more murders and deceit\u0085culminating in a great game of \"Who do you (really) trust?\" Even the very last few minutes of the movie, after the climax, keep you (or at least Reggie) guessing. This is first rate entertainment\u0085a combination of several genres all rolled into one. It certainly showcases the talents of all the actors, with of course the comic and dramatic timing of Mr. Grant held as a standout. But, it is much more than that. It is also a movie that you can enjoy time and time again for all of its virtues\u0085for it is not one dimensional. So go ahead and be tricked, thrilled, and tickled for a couple of hours and come away from it \u0085 a different person? (Is that really your name?)J. Braun",

I've rarely ever seen something pulled off so flawlessly.  2) Grant and Hepburn.  Two of the most charismatic film stars ever with (at the time) their choice of scripts.  Of course they would choose this absolute gem.3) The dialogue.  It brought be back to the great films of the 40's like Notorious, Big Sleep and Maltese Falcon.  Grant's witty replies to Hepburn's questions are some of the best I've ever heard.  I sat amazed at the brilliant writing.10/10.  Unquestionably one of the finest mysteries ever made and up there with the greats of all time.",

            "content": "I just can't help but think of Hitchcock when watching this film. The secretive plot, the twists and turns, its all there.Following the death of Regina Lampert's (Audrey Hebpurn) husband, she find out that he had stolen some 250,000 $ from the government and they want it back. She is also suddenly approached by a man by the name of Peter Joshua who seems to be offering her a helping hand. At the same time however, a group of men are trying to get to her to get that stolen money, which they believe she has. Lampert, who was unaware of her husband's dubious past, must now play a dangerous game of cat and mouse, not knowing who to trust since hardly anyone seems to be who they say they are.Directed by Stanley Donen, this film is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. However it can still stand out by itself. What really amped up the interested was how every development in the story brought about a twist or turn that made you think, who is who and who can you trust. The beautiful Hebpurn plays her role superbly and along with Grant, forms a formidable and interesting duo.A fine film, well worth the watch.",

The dialog is funny & memorable, the plot twists are incredible, the mounting tension is delicious - just what you'd expect from Alfred Hitchcock, but somehow tempered in the capable hands of Hepburn & Grant so that it isn't a frenzied sort of tension.You simply cannot go wrong by pairing Audrey Hepburn with Cary Grant. These are perhaps the two most charming, attractive & likable actors this world has EVER seen, or is likely to see again. The chemistry is palpable. The supporting cast was also remarkable. The child actor who played Jean-Louis was excellent (it's the only film he's ever done!), as were the actress who played his mother, and the stamp merchant. The 'gang of four' criminals that are after the stolen loot are fantastic - Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass portray their menacing characters beautifully.

The scene where Audrey Hepburn discovers James Coburn's body doesn't ring true to me. About three quarters of the way through the film Hepburn enters the hotel room and finds a body on the floor. We see James Coburn dead with a plastic bag over his head. Following that, we then see Hepburn staring in fright at a name written on the floor. If the character could have a hand free to write the name, why didn't he tear off the plastic bag? Did I miss something?",

            "content": "Thriller, detective, comedy. I continue a kind of marathon of paintings with the participation of the magnificent and charming beauty Audrey Hepburn, and today this detective thriller is in turn. The fact is that this picture is part of a collection of three dvd discs, which I acquired relatively recently, in addition to this picture there is \"Afternoon Love\" and the famous \"Roman Vacations\", which I will definitely get to, but a little later. In the meantime, here's my brief opinion - an intricate detective with a great ending. And, if in the film \"How to Steal a Million,\" I didn't mention the minuses, since I didn't find any, then he was found here, but only one, and I will certainly tell you about it, but for now let me begin to analyze this picture.\nSo, the pros:\n1. A confusing story - to be honest, at first the story didn't hook me at all, because the film will talk about a beautiful married lady who has a husband killed, and several suspicious gentlemen who demand a fabulous sum from the newly made widow who allegedly her dead husband stole from them. And then an elderly, but charming Mr. Peter Joshua comes to the rescue, and the girl will have to decide who he is, friend or foe? I was expecting platitudes, in some places I guessed scenario twists, and with this picture I managed to confuse me. Sometimes I myself was lost in thought and conjecture about heroes, events, circumstances, and so on, sometimes even small details. What can I say - the scriptwriters caught me. I can't say that history is drawn to the highest score, but it can't be called a passing middle peasant. This is a solid four, and only because I guessed a few turns. During timekeeping, the story manages to spin several times so that you involuntarily peer at the screen, trying not to miss anything. My regards!\n2. Music - and although, apart from the title topic, it does not stand out here, it definitely creates the right mood and immerses the viewer in the events that are taking place. But the title topic is fast, sharp, makes the heart contract as quickly as possible, fast and very dynamic.\n3. Paris - and again, all the action takes place in Paris, with its quiet and narrow streets, famous buildings and structures, references to the French classics, and of course the surroundings naturally, though we will not be pleased with the views of the city often, but even in these rare moments Paris mesmerizing.\n4. The final - let's say so, everything went approximately to this, there were hints at it, I completely guessed it - and this is good. The ending for this type of picture should be just that, and even from a moral point of view, not to mention another. Yes, I understand that I wrote the obvious thing, but this is my position, you can agree with it, or not - you decide!\nMinus. Comedy - I don't understand this from the word \"completely\"! We seem to have a serious story with cruelty and murder, a tense atmosphere, and here, in the midst of all this, the heroes begin to show a circus tent at the exit. At first I was not opposed to this, but after the first half I clearly understood how this comedy looks alien here. She does not belong here. I'd better keep silent about the romantic line, because if in \"How to Steal a Million\" I saw a \"spark\" between the characters and I saw circumstances, then this simply did not work here. It turned out a stupid farce, no more.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Regina Lampert performed by Audrey Hepburn is an attractive married lady whose life is turned upside down after the news of the murder of her husband. In this situation, she is forced to trust a new friend, Peter, who promises help. It manifests itself as a brave Amazon, dressed in elegant costumes. Beauty Audrey did not disappoint me. Her sweet and innocent smile disarms, her eyes captivate, acting is at the highest level. Bravo Audrey!\n2. Peter Joshua, performed by Cary Grant, is Regina's new friend, ready to help her deal with this problem. Charming, strong, clearly has his intentions. A crafty look betrays a true professional. Carey very skillfully played the role of the already elderly protector of the widow. Bravo Carey!\n3. Inspector Edouard Granpierre, performed by Jacques Maren, is a Parisian police officer investigating the murder of Regina's husband. In terms of behavior, it looks very much like Inspector Lestrade - he grimaces, tries to follow the trail of a killer, and so on. Jacques very soundly and emotionally played this role.\nSo why did Soviet censorship not allow this picture to reach the Soviet audience? The whole thing is about one scene, a little frivolous content, and more in the picture I did not find a hint of the \"detrimental influence of the West.\" If this scene were not there, then everything would be fine, but we have what we have.\nAs a result, we have a good detective thriller with a complicated story, a tense atmosphere, an excellent title theme, Parisian surroundings and excellent acting, especially the beautiful Audrey!",

            "content": "The greatest compliment you can bestow on Charade is that it is often mistaken for an Alfred Hitchcock film. Charade's greatest asset is the ingenious screenplay by Peter Stone. A romantic/mystery/comedy story that sometimes comes very close to being a parody, but never crosses that line. That Stone did not even receive an Oscar nomination for best screenplay will remain a mystery.Despite their age difference of 25 years, the pairing of the irreplaceable Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn is gold and paid off at the box office. They were two of the biggest stars in 1963 and this is their only film together. They are supported by memorable performances of then upcoming stars: James Coburn, George Kennedy and a clever Walter Matthau in one of his first comedic parts.Director Stanley Donen had already made his mark in film history with classic musicals like On the Town (1949) and Singin' in the Rain (1952). This sidestep was not only successful, but I consider it his best film. His lightweight tone makes it all seem effortless. Donen tried to repeat the success in 1966 with Arabesque. This time Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren were matched in the leads. But I found this one forced because of an inferior screenplay and the absence of Cary Grant.Maybe it's just me but I also had an early sixties James Bond vibe with Charade. But this must be a coincidence since the second Bond epic From Russia With Love was just released a few months before Charade and the James Bond-formula would not be defined until 1964 with Goldfinger. The similar tone could be that the title design was done by Maurice Binder, who did all the title designs for the official Bond films from 1962 till 1991. But especially the surly George Kennedy with his mechanical arm would have been a great Bond villain. Grant and Kennedy have a Bondian fight scene on a rooftop.Charade does give you a good indication of what Cary Grant would have been like as 007. Grant was on the (long) wish list of the Bond producers. But Cary Grant was too expensive for a modestly budgeted English thriller and a star of his stature in those days did not sign for a series of films in which he would play the same character. In the end they settled for a Scottish amateur body builder with some acting experience who was cheap enough and was willing to sign a six picture deal.And the rest is history......",

It was wonderful to see the sights during the movie. But,what park was used for the outdoor stamp booths? I have been trying to find this information with no luck. Anyone with the answer?",

A must for any fan of Grant, Hepburn, or just the whole early-60s comedy/thriller genre. The only flaw is in the revelation of the \"McGuffin\" that everybody is chasing; I won't reveal it here, except to say that once they find it nobody (least of all the scriptwriter) seems to realize that it is no longer valuable.",

I'm glad I didn't go into the movie with any expectations.  This movie had so many twists and turns.  I thought I had it all figured out, then the next scene bam! what you know goes out the window. It's funny, romantic, and thrilling like everyone has before stated.  I really liked the mysterious music during the movie and the trailer.  It's perfect for a spy movie, yet it's different from the Bond series which I'm so accustomed to.The criterion version came out pretty well.  It didn't seem like it was in that bad a condition.  Too bad it was in mono though.All of Audrey's movies I've seen so far, she has made a great pair with the leading man.  I'm glad to have seen her movies; I only wish I didn't wait so long.10 out of 10 definately!",

The direction of the movie is just awful--with too many \"one shots\" of the glamorous Hepburn, I guess selling lines-of-fashion of the times. The numerous rear projections are clunky and look like student work. The age gap between Hepburn and Grant (25 years) shows, and the writers should have shut up about it rather than having so many references in their script. It was unfortunate--once again--to see the Ms. Hepburn caught up in a cinematic fashion show, she was better than that. So, the writing and direction of this movie age horribly, and I'm sorry I wasted my time.",

            "content": "Ok, so it's Hitchcockian.  Enough already.The story of this film is wonderful.  Sure, while everybody gets distracted by watching Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn cavorting happily through Paris (and very distracting they are), the story of this film really deserves more credit than it gets.  The location of the hidden money is very clever, all the more so for being right under everyone's nose all along (including the audience).  In addition to an intriguing story filled with colorful characters, this film is also packed with terrific dialogue of the \"witty banter\" variety.  This contributes enormously to the film's charm, which, other than its stars, is its most bankable asset.  No wonder it is so well-regarded.I'm frankly puzzled by people who seem to resent the fact that this film is compared to Hitchcock.  As though anyone attempting to imitate Hitchcock must be, by definition, a fawning little hack.  Stanley Donen is no hack, and he wasn't fawning.  He realized that Hitchcock was monopolizing a genre he didn't invent, and thought \"Why should he be the only person allowed to make such films?\"  Now, Donen doesn't have the reputation Hitchcock has, which is understandable enough.  When compared to films like \"Rear Window\" or \"Vertigo\", \"Charade\" looks rather slight and unimportant.  But it stands toe-to-toe with a film like \"North by Northwest\", and is stronger, I'd say, than \"Notorious\" or \"Strangers on a Train\", just to pick out a few examples. The blending of comedy, romance, and suspense is a difficult one to pull off, and Hitchcock didn't always get it right.  \"Charade\" does. \nThe only complaint I have is a small plot detail.  Granted that Cruikshank must adopt a false identity for the purpose of a) deceiving the \"Marx brothers\" and b) finding out whether or not Reggie is involved, he gives Reggie one or two more false identities than he has to.  He tells her he's Peter Joshua, then that he's Alexander Dyle, fine.  But by the time his Dyle persona is blown apart, she already trusts him for the most part (as evidenced by the ease with which she accepts his rather thin story about being a thief), so why not just tell her the truth?  But it's a small flaw, and it doesn't do anything at all to undermine the enjoyment one takes in this lovely and endlessly watchable film.",

            "content": "\"Charade\" ranks as one of the best non-Hitchcock films to come out of the suspense genre.  Audrey Hepburn is simply marvelous as Regina 'Reggie' Lampert, a young woman, who upon finding out that her husband was killed on a European train, later discovers that three men (with whom he was once acquainted) are after a hidden fortune they believe that she has access to. The men (played by George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass) ransack her apartment and send her threatening messages via telephone, causing her to seek help from Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), a seemingly helpful man with whom Reggie soon falls in love with.  However, an official by the name of Bartholomew (Walter Matthau, in one of his early noteworthy performances) also offers to aid Reggie in helping to recover what the men are looking for -- a large sum of money that he pilfered with them after WWII.  The usual cat-and-mouse formula follows, but with Stanley Donen's captivating direction and Henry Mancini's breathless score, this film is anchored far above the standards of regular suspense-filled hokum.  Key scenes include Coburn and Hepburn's 'fiery' confrontation in the telephone booth, Grant chasing Hepburn through the subway station, the climax between Grant, Hepburn and Matthau in the theater, and the conclusion (Grant probably has more alias' in this film that any other character in film history!).  A witty and urbane romance-thriller with class that truly delivers.  This is one film that dosen't have to just rely on 'star power' to keep it going. Let's see if Johnathan Demme's 2002 remake, The Truth About Charlie, can match the magic of Charade (thought I highly doubt it).  ***1/2",

This is probably more down to the 2 leads chemistry and their acting abilities, but its great stuff to watch.Audrey Hepburns husband has been murdered. Pretty soon it arises that her husband stole some money and 3 bad guys want it back. Cary Grants character also secretly wants it, though his intentions are for the most part unclear.

Everything about this movie is just cool...in an old fashion cutting edge sorta way. This movie has it all, suspense, comedy and an interesting story line. The scenery isn't that bad either; it is very stimulating visually-it is directed by the same guy who did 'Funny Face', 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Out on the Town'.

            "content": "Actually, I liked \"Charade\" a lot, but I wrote the above provocative headline to make a point about the movie's primary flaw.First, though, I'd like to focus on the positive. \"Charade\" is very enjoyable and very suspenseful, has surprising twists and turns, and has very interesting supportive characters. While watching the movie, I wanted to keep watching to see what would happen next.I was particularly interested in the mystery of whether Cary Grant's character was a good or bad guy. As a viewer, I bonded with the Audrey Hepburn character as she tried to figure out whether Grant was on her side, colluding with her late husband's foes, or a cold-blooded killer and thief.\"Charade\" hooked me so much that I watched it three times and was never bored as I rewatched it. Watching the movie again also gave me an opportunity to look for the clues that I didn't pay attention to the first time. \"Charade\" was definitely an effective mystery.However, \"Charade\" was NOT an effective romance. It wasn't credible that Hepburn's character would pursue a man who lied to her constantly, confessed he wanted to steal her husband's $250,000, might have murdered him, and was twice her age. The second he said he was the brother of one of her husband's co-conspirators in the theft of government gold, she should have realized that what appeared to be a chance meeting at a ski resort was, in fact, a reason to suspect he was evil.Hepburn's constant romantic advances were extremely annoying. I blame Grant for the lousy romantic angle because everything I read about this movie says that he would not take the part unless the script was rewritten. Originally, the script had the man pursuing the woman.Director Stanley Donen should have selected someone else to play the male lead \u0096 a 40ish James Bond-type playboy whose roguish charm eventually seduces Hepburn, who should have been resisting a romance for most of the movie. Choosing a celebrity over a script is not a good idea.\"Charade\" also would have been better if Alfred Hitchcock was the director. Donen does a nice job of balancing suspense, humor and sharp dialogue, but the tone is way too light. People are being killed, but the characters don't convey as much fear as they should. They act like bystanders observing the murders from a distance rather than principals who could be the next to perish.These flaws, though, were not something I thought as much about as the mystery. \"Who killed Hepburn's husband?\" I kept thinking to myself. As \"Charade\" progressed, my interest in the mystery deepened as the possible murderers were killed themselves and the suspect was not shown. Throughout the movie, the supporting characters played by George Kennedy, Ned Glass, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau were all distinctive, entertaining, and well-developed.Getting immersed in the characters pays off when the writers throw viewers for a loop by making surprising revelations about a couple of them near the end.I realize I've asserted that \"Charade\" has major flaws, but I'm giving it an 8 because I really enjoyed its primary plot, suspense, and characters.ZWrite",

            "content": "Charade is a timeless and classic thriller starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn plays Regina, a widow whose recently dead husband seems to have left a secret fortune behind. Now she must race against three crooks to find the fortune, assisted by Grant, who is never what he seems. This movie has always been one of my favorites because it combines romance, suspense, and murder in a way that is both thrilling and comedic. Grant steps out of his good guy persona and into a character that may or may not be the bad guy, and Hepburn is fantastic as a woman who really has no choice but to trust him. The film really appeals to all audiences because it does cover so many genres and types. Although this is a great film, no movie can be perfect. Some of the plot twists are a little too twisty, and Grant switches names and aliases so much that only a few of them get fleshed out and understood by the audience. There was a remake of the movie made in 2002, starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. The newer film was never as popular or well now as its predecessor, and Peter Stone, who was a screenwriter for the original, was so against the remake that his name was changed in the credits of the 2002 movie.",

            "content": "Personal Rating: 6.4/10As a kid, did you ever look at a slide and think I can't wait to go down that, it has plenty of twists and turns. But come to find out there's no slip to the slide, you have to scoot yourself down the whole time and you end up looking back up at it with distaste?That might be too specific of an illustration but it sums up my experience with Charade. I had high expectations going into this film based on the star-studded cast and while Hepburn and Grant had some alright performances, it certainly wasn't their best.In multiple places, the film felt lacklustre, with camera work that lacked intention. The story told while giving you whiplash with unexpectedness, I felt leaned too much on the \"didn't see it coming\" element and forgot to tell a deeper story. It's not all doom and gloom as the dialogue in many places was quite witty and refreshing.I do have to mention, though I don't have much to stand on as a male, I felt the portrayal and treatment of Audrey's character did not age well and is quite distasteful by today's standards.One example was the constant changing of opinions based on the frivolous come and go emotion of \"love\" in this movie from Hepburn for a character (Grant) mysterious and nothing more than a pretty face: \"I love you\", \"you're a murderer\", *let me kiss you a thousand times*, \"who are you\", all of these changes in feelings based on nothing left me quite confused and dissatisfied with the breadcrumbs of character development here.The script even recognises this fault when Gary Grant says: \"One minute you're chasing me around the shower room the next you're accusing me of murder\"By now you are quite aware of the faults I find with this film, but don't get me wrong, it's certainly not the worst thing I've seen. If you're looking for some light-hearted mystery with a great cast this is the film for you. Avoid it though if you're seeking something that you want to stay with you days later.",

Really absurd and ridiculous meandering stupid movie. Don't waste your time; it's really bad.Nice clothes on Ms. Hepburn bu Givenchy. That's it.",

Maybe it's unfair to Donen to contrast and compare to Hitchcock, but I can't help but feel there are areas in this movie that Hitchcock would have done better, and that would be a sense of danger.  Maybe others will disagree, but I did not feel one from this movie.Okay, so that's not really a flaw, just something I personally felt was missing.  But I do like the movie.  I think the acting was great, even Hepburn was good at comic delivery, and normally she leaves me underwhelmed. The directing was good, but not great.  The script was probably the strongest element.There are flaws though.  The script has weak points, some of the most important events in the movie hinge on some very unfeasible things, like Dyle managing to sneak into the US embassy during lunch hour to set up a phony appointment with Hepburn.  And perhaps I missed the explanation for this, but why is it that Hepburn seems to know next to nothing about her husband?  She doesn't know if he's rich or poor, has friends, or anything. Grant's changing identity seems to be an overly-elaborate attempt to keep an otherwise straightforward plot twisting around.  Why would the OSS trust five greedy psychopaths to deliver gold in an important, secret mission?I gave this movie a 7/10.  It was a good, entertaining movie, but not a must-see, and something I doubt I'd watch again.",

There is such a chemical between Hepburn and Grant that any other actor or actress would have broken the film's essence completely.But, I warn you: if you are not used to this kind of film, you may find it a little boring. Different from the thrillers made today in Hollywood in which the studios make use of sex and violence to get a huge audience, 'Charade' works in another side. It is not a film developed though scenes, but from smart dialogs, characters and an involving story \u2013 and that is why this film is a classic one and proves once more that we don't need a lot of explosions and sex to have a good movie.I took almost a year to see this movie because I was always reluctant with it \u2013 I was underrating it before even watching.
