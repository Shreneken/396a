            "content": "A Christmas Story, there is absolutely no way that anyone could ever say they never saw this film since it's shown every Christmas, especially on TNT when they do the 24 hours of A Christmas Story, lol. But onto the movie, I've watched A Christmas Story since the day I was born, it's one of those films you never get sick of because of the simple fact that each year of your life you could relate to it in some way. Each character has these memorable moments and you could say that you've been in the same situation. It's great seeing this movie because it makes us laugh about the silliest moments in our life during the Christmas season.Ralphie is a little boy who just so badly wants a B.B. gun for Christmas, it's just his dream. Only one problem, it'll shoot his eye out according to the adults around him. We go through Christmas with Ralphie and his family, his father who is obsessed with a prize leg lamp he won. His mother who is greatly under-appreciated but extremely loving. His brother, Randy, who is your typical silly and annoying younger brother who makes fun of him. And his friends who are on a constant run from the school bully. But all Ralphie can think about during this hard time in his adolescence is that B.B. gun.A Christmas Story has constant unforgettable scenes, like the pink bunny out fit that Ralphie gets as a present from his aunt, him saying his first swear in front of his dad, Mom and Dad's fight over using the glue on purpose, visiting Santa at the mall, and of course that great ending that is sure to bring a that is sure to bring a tear to your eye. It's just the perfect Christmas movie that is a BIG recommendation for the season. It has great comedy, terrific acting, and just the most touching moments you'll ever see in a Christmas movie.10/10",

            "content": "Nostalgic tale of a Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) growing up in the 1940s (I believe). He wants nothing more than a Red Ryder Ranger Model Air Rifle (a BB gun for short) for Christmas but everyone tells him it will \"shoot your eye out\".That's about it for plot but the film has sequences that every child (and adult) can relate to. My favorites: Ralphie's best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he's dared to lick it; Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father; the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up (in a GREAT scene); Ralphie's constant fights with his little brother (wonderfully played by Ian Petrella) and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents-- especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It's now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever made--right up there with \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (which was also ignored at its release).A charming, wonderful Christmas film. A 10 all the way!",

            "content": "A Christmas Story touches my heart as does no other film, and I know the reason for this is because it reminds me so much of my own 1950's boyhood. For sure it strikes a nerve in persons of my generation. This is Bob Clark's masterpiece and I know I am not the only person who feels this way. I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, chances are you have seen the film; indeed, probably have seen it countless times as I have. This is not a film review in the normal sense. It is more a reminiscence and appreciation of a great story captured for all time in moving pictures which, in turn, captured the essence of the time and place of its setting; that time and setting being a typical town in Indiana during Christmas season in the 1940s as we observe a typical family (the Parkers) with two young sons named Ralphie and Randy. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate very well to the story's key elements. I recall vividly family outings to crowded downtown sidewalks, Mom and Dad squeezing in a season's worth of shopping in one day and doing it under the nose of one who had a visit to Santa Claus on his mind. Staring at the prominent HIGBEES sign in the downtown square, I could almost see the words John A. Brown in its place. Browns was the main department store in my hometown of Oklahoma City and the place where I would make my annual visit with Santa Claus.I am sure most who have seen the film realize this is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon as the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work. The stove in the Parker's kitchen reminds much of the one my grandmother had, and the rest of the house reminded me of the home my other grandparents lived in. As you see, viewing A Christmas Story is always a magical experience for me. It is almost as if Mr. Clark made this film with Tom Fowler in mind. There are so many comments to make. It will be impossible to relate them all in a short review, but here are some that I know people my age will be most familiar with:Beautiful toys displayed in department store windows. The agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. I could go on and on. I will make two more observations and then will sign off and let somebody else speak.In the film's sweetest scene, we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's (ably played by Peter Billingsley) face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments. But, for me the best moment was the last. Ralphie is in bed at film's end. We see snow outside and Ralphie dreaming of his wonderful gift, as the story's author and narrator Jean Shepherd, speaking as the grown up Ralphie, realizes this was the best Christmas he ever had, or ever would have.If you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story, you are perhaps unaware that you have cheated yourself. Buy or rent the 2003 20th anniversary DVD. It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas.",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" is a rare film about children yet for adults.  While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmas-themed saga, adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated, polysyllabic narration of Ralphie, filled with nostalgia and lucid memories, and the soft, high-pitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word.  The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film, but a character wholly outside the story, reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes.  Yet he is the heart of the film, the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Clause and a BB gun - it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke.  To that end, \"A Christmas Story\" is flawless.\"A Christmas Story\" tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he searches for the golden, upheld idol of all red-blooded American boys:  A Red Rider Air Rifle.  Ralphie spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it - including an essay, a trip to Santa Claus and more.  The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family - his irritable, foul-mouthed father with a good heart, his whiny brother Randy, and his sweet, all-American mother.  It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes, but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film.  The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story.  He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment, Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing - only to have Billingsley note in his awe-filled, high-pitched voice that \"I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun.  It's very good for Christmas.\" (paraphrased).  Most of the humor is similar - the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also, there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season - it's a movie everyone can relate to.  There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power.  I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child - in this case, the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously, \"A Christmas Story\" is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane.  It simply excels at its simple goals, and comes together as an extraordinarily entertaining piece of cinema.",

What's hard to believe now is that \"A Christmas Story\" (released the same year) was ignored everywhere. If anything it should of been nominated for best adapted screenplay!Now when the film was released it was \"Critically Acclaimed\" but, MGM failed to capitalized on that. The film was poorly handled & failed to capture a large theatrical audience!Well thanks to the Home Video Market & television this film has now become part of Americana. It also helped that Ted Turner made \"24 Hours Of A Christmas Story\" an annual event.It is now 2017, and \"A Christmas Story\" it is now one of the most popular films of all time. Even \"Return of the Jedi\" ( The Highest Grossing Film of 1983) \"Isn't gaining as many new fans\". .\"Return of the Jedi\" has always rode the coattails of the earlier \"Star Wars\" films. \"A Christmas Story\" has gained fans for just being a great film!Now my review\nSet in the 1940's the film makes you identify with Ralphie and you your routing for him in every single way!Ralphie is in elementary school. His has a little brother and all he wants for Christmas is a BB-Gun. He wants this more than anything. Before Christmas gets there he has many obstacles to overcome. One of them is getting home! He & his friends are always being bullied before they can make it home. The film is flawless. It is a joy to watch and only improves every time you watch it. It is also true that for some reason the older it gets the better it becomes! You need to see this.

Unlike other films this one actually becomes better with repeated viewings--and it's great to see and hear the wonderful and silly lines again--especially when they are are friends and family there to see it and laugh along with you. Perfect writing (albeit, very, very cynical), wonderful acting, great attention to details (the 1940s look to the film is great--down to the boxes of soap and radio programs) and so many funny and sentimental moments make this a perennial favorite.

It may not be absolute perfection but Jean Shepherd, Bob Clark and the outstanding cast came as close as anyone here.Creating a story centered around nostalgia is a tricky thing as the memories that creates it are unique to each of us. The themes, however, are similar and that's where the success lies.I didn't want a Red Ryder BB gun when I was that age but my Christmas wish was just as fervent and I schemed just as hard as Ralphie. The bully at my school didn't have yellow eyes but he was pretty much like Scut Farkus. And so on, from the fantastically flawed parents to the pop-heroes, A Christmas Story captures it all.Truly wonderful.",

This movie brings out the true essence of Christmas happiness.

            "content": "Even with its somewhat unreliable narrator and his frequent fantastical daydreams, 'A Christmas Story (1983)' is a decidedly more realistic Christmas movie, with its focus on the little familial triumphs which remain in your memory long into adulthood. It's clearly based on a series of short stories as opposed to a long-form narrative, as it very much feels like small 'skits' strung together, but this works in the picture's favour as it replicates the typically sweeping, 'everyday as adventure' feel of childhood. It also allows the audience to empathise mostly with the disembodied narrator, who reflects on his time as a child with the kind of glee only someone who experienced the events could and provides a knowing edge to a lot of the movie's otherwise innocent events. Indeed, adults will probably get more mileage from this typically nostalgic piece than children. 6/10",

            "content": "It will never be a complete Christmas without watching \"a Christmas story\". A Christmas Story is a significant kid's movie directed by Bob Clark. Based on the short stories and semi-fictional anecdotes of author and raconteur Jean Shepherd. The movie is based on a number of things; one is his book, 'In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash\", others derived from 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' and others from short stories from Playboy magazine. All of them, manage to mix in, pretty well. I love Jean Shepherd's narration...a great story-teller. Glad he was given the job. He had a soothing voice that help inspired the creation of 1988's TV show, The Wonder Years. Christmas Story tells the story of nine year old, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) who wants one and only one thing for Christmas: a BB gun. It's not just any BB gun he wants, either; his heart is set on an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle. Sadly, everybody thinks it's a little too dangerous for him. Will, Ralphie get the BB gun or will Christmas for him, be a huge disappointment? Watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much, the movie's main plot isn't that strong to stand by, itself. So the writers add a lot of sub-plots to push the run-time for the film such as Ralphie's father (Darren McGavin) winning a major prize in a contest or Ralphie's friend, Flick (Scott Schwartz) memorable getting his tongue stuck on the icy pole. The movie has tons of filler scenes. Some of them were hits to the funny bone, while others were kinda a waste of time like the Bumpuse's dogs. Glad, they cut the Flash Gordon fantasy sequence. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the film. For a kid's movie, it's very smart. Examples are the mock heroic tone of the narration, filled with great hyperbole motif full sentences. It matched well with the extensive use of familiar classical music themes. The movie is beautiful to listen to. You see a lot of leitmotifs references from other works such as author, Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf story, Harold Gray's comic strip, Little Orphan Annie, Television shows like 1940's Adventures of Red Ryder, and films like 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs & 1939's Wizard of Oz. The movie was shot pretty well and the use of old timing locations really made it seem like it takes place in the late 1930s/early 1940s. There is a debate about when the film takes place as the movie never state it, but still, I like the nostalgia feel of the film. I think the pre-World War II era America is a great location for this childhood majestic. The movie is very well acted. Looks for the cameo of director Bob Clark, and Jean Shepard. It's pretty sad, that none of the main cast went on to bigger success. It's pretty weird, that actor, Scott Schwartz became a pornstar for a while. Maybe, one day, they will. Some people might not like the film, due to its off color humor. For a PG film, it's got tons of some dirty jokes, under aged swearing and violence & a few racist stereotype humor. The film was supposed to be R-Rated, but the R-rated script was scrapped when the vice president of Higbee's, the department store, the filmmakers used for locations, refused to allow the store to be associated with a movie depicting a kid dropping the F-bomb, and the filmmakers were forced to change it. Honestly, I think the movie became a lot clever with its swearing through it use of heavy euphemisms of gibberish. Still, if you're looking for a movie to watch with small children. This movie might not be for you. For me, personally, I didn't mind it, as it gives something, that both adults and children might like. It's still a family-friendly movie, but there an edgy sense of humor; that will be lost on little kids. Some people might hate it for its love for commercialization over the religious aspect of Christmas. Of course, the holiday supposed to be about religion, but I think most people, like to get stuff for the holidays. Is it greedy to love films like this, promoting materialism lifestyle. No, because the movie was still made with a lot of heart and love, and we still see the family in the end, celebrating the holiday as a family unit. A Christmas Story did only modest box-office business in 1983, despite every critic, I know, saying it was a disappointment bomb when it came out. The film became a holiday classic, due to the overplayed value of television. Often in Christmas movie marathons. It's estimated that nearly fifty-five million Americans tune every year to watch the film, making it a Christmas movie juggernaut. The film spawned a play, as well as two \"sequels\": the made-for-TV Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss and 1994's It Runs in the Family aka \"My Summer Story\". Both are not worth watching, as it has none of the original film's cast members. A Direct-to-Video sequel called A Christmas Story 2 was released on 2012. It's a miserable film that fans of the original, must stay away from. In 2008, a documentary was made call 'Road Trip for Ralphie\". It's a fun-watch. Overall: Hands down; it's one of the best Christmas films, ever. It is a must-watch. You will have tons of fun!",

The film looks great with the cinematography skillful and the locations striking. The script is always witty and insightful, I loved the home truths and the lack of smut and saccharin which may have marred the film slightly if included. The story is beautifully structured and an enormous joy all the same. The pace was spot on too, while the entire cast performed impeccably.In fact, everything I have to say about A Christmas Story is good.

The film contains an average family of a regular husband and wife relationship and two young boys. The eldest of the boys is named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) who is the star of the film. All that Ralphie wants is to have a perfect Christmas containing the perfect gift, a Red Ryder carbon action BB gun. This is all that Ralphie can think about day and night. When Ralphie has to write a Theme about what he wants for Christmas, his teacher replies to him `you'll shoot your eye out' which seems to be the only reply to him throughout the whole film.What makes this film so great is the ability to relate to Ralphie with his problems throughout the movie, such as wanting that one gift that everyone thinks that you're too young to have and are unable to get. The acting is very convincing and makes you think that this could even be you in the movie. There are some very hilarious parts in this film that also make it very good. This particular scene also contains some very cheesy acting which also makes it funny. Ralphie has a dream about getting his Red Ryder BB gun and saving his family from a bunch of evil villains. In this scene Ralphie is wearing the white sparkly cowboy suit and he shoots down the evil villains and saves the day with his gun in a very unrealistic way.\nThere really wasn't much music that can be commented on in this movie,  just that it was the orchestral type of music that was out in the time period  of the 40's. The costumes where great and convincing. I also liked how real they made the 40's look. You actually think it might have been made in that time period which makes the film very authentic.  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants some holiday laughs and some great family time together. I would rate this film a 9 out of ten because it's so memorable.",

            "content": "The filmmakers didn't set out to make a lasting piece of Americana, but that's exactly what we got.I have no idea how many times I've seen this movie since I was a kid, but it never loses its lustre. Year after year, it's always a relatable story that any kid hoping for that big Christmas gift can identify with. And it helps tremendously that this movie is well-acted and directed, with great performances coming from not only the leads, but also the supporting players.A great deal of the visual humor rests on the facial expressions and reactions of Peter Billingsley, which go a long way in selling this thing. The same can be said for Darren McGavin, who perfectly wears the mask of eternal annoyance and gruffness for laughs.But it's Shepherd's writing that's the real star of the piece, at least for me. Just as he did in the novel, the man can paint a vivid picture of how things were when he was growing up in Indiana. His words go down smooth, and his impressive linguistic prowess is on full display in his narration.\"A Christmas Story\" has a cultural success story that is unlike that of any other film; or at least any movie I can think of. The movie enjoyed a second life on HBO and home video after being ignored at the box office, but it has made a slow, steady, tenacious comeback into mainstream acceptance. Licensed and marketed to the hilt (novelty leg lamps, action figures, mugs, ornaments, etc.) and maintaining a high cultural visibility for many years, it's become (for my money) the most recognizable American Christmas movie ever made. You can mention Bedford Falls, and someone might get the reference. But if you mention Scut Farkus, a leg lamp, Red Ryder, or \"You'll shoot your eye out!\", everyone in the room will instantly know what you're talking about.It's just about as iconic as a Christmas move can get.9/10",

            "content": "This odd little film has become the parallel-universe \"It's A Wonderful Life\" of our time. It brings up memories that many people can identify with - wanting - with all your heart - a toy that will \"shoot your eye out\", facing up to the school bully and then getting punished for being violent rather than being commended for courage, and for those of you up north, sticking your tongue on a frozen pole and getting stuck to it. This actually happened to my brother-in-law as a kid in Wisconsin.However, Ralphie, the child protagonist in our film, has a completely dysfunctional family. To be specific, he has a completely dysfunctional father. In the narration Ralphie never even calls him \"dad\" - he's just \"the old man\". \"The old man\" cares about nothing more than he cares for the tackiest of lamps that he received as an award that is made out of a mannequin's leg that he displays in a position of prominence in the living room. Ralphie's father is no George Bailey. If he got to see the world as it was if he never existed, no doubt the only noticeable difference would be that the tacky lamp would belong to someone else and Ralphie and his mother would be better off. The narration is wonderful as you see everything from a child's perspective, and if you remember your childhood at all, you can probably remember reasoning things out as Ralphie does. In Ralphie's world adults - including his parents - are the arbitrary givers of reward and punishment who all seem to be in odd and unreasoned alignment. These adults are mazes to be solved, not givers of lessons to be learned. However, as an adult, you'll see the humor in the situations too. Highly recommended.",

McGavin and Dillon are not believable as husband and wife. The script is too episodic to sustain the narrative; the humor is forced. The scenes with the bully are way over the top.

If you have never heard of this movie or heard people quote it or reference the scenes, you live in a cave. And if you DO live in a cave, I question what reception you have to be able to read this review!Well, anyways, A Christmas Story is the classic movie about Ralphie, a 9 year old boy who wants one single thing for Christmas-a Red Ryder BB gun. But there is one obstacle, his mother, teacher, and even a department Santa all say it's a bad idea, because, quote: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"When I was younger, my mother sheltered me from many different movies for religious reasons, examples being- No Harry Potter for witchcraft, and no Titanic for nudity and pre-marital sex. A Christmas Story was one of those forbidden films, for the gun part of the plot, and the swearing, and other aspects of the movie.However, I have seen it now-I was 12 when I saw it for the first time. If I had to guess, I have seen it about 7 times in full, and a few times in part on TV. And it's worth seeing that much, because of how fun and entertaining it is!I mentioned that this has many iconic scenes. Who doesn't know about Flick getting his tongue stuck on his pole? Or Ralphie getting soap in his mouth for saying the F word? Or the Dad's obsession with a sexy lamp? Then there's line's like: \"You'll shoot your eye out\", \"Oh, fudge\", and \"Fra-GEE-leh\" -It must be Italian!\"The acting is great too, and film buffs like myself can recognize other actors- Peter Billingsley is in Elf as the elf that tells Buddy that he's special and not a \"cotton headed ninny muggins.\" Darren McGavin, The Father(or \"The Old Man\" as Adult Ralphie calls him), is the Dad in Billy Madison as well. And for my final example- Melinda Dillion is the Mom in this and also E.T.TNT and TBS also have an annual tradition of playing this on Christmas Day 12 times in a row. I remember seeing in a documentary on TV that they actually offered to do that and that's how the movie's popularity grew. If you have never seen this movie, that's a great way to catch it, but stores are selling it now as well.All who see this should end up cherishing it. While I wouldn't show it to a very little kid, for kids maybe 9-10 and up and anyone older, this is a must watch for the holiday season!",

My kids and their friends enjoyed it, and made me sit through it twice on two different Christmases.But I have to say it: I thought this movie was terrible. And I don't mean, \"Not as good as everyone says.\" I mean, if you tied me up and made me watch this movie again, inside of an hour I'd give you anything you wanted to let me go.Based on this film, the secret to creating a movie classic appears to be: Write a series of disjointed, semi-humorous vignettes about a group of largely unlikeable one-dimensional characters, hire a bunch of loud hammy over-actors to gesticulate wildly and shout most of their lines, narrate it with the most punchable voice I've ever heard, and tie it all very loosely to a Christmas theme.If your idea of a good time is watching some poor kid get his tongue stuck on a iced pole and getting it partially ripped open, or an obnoxious little kid repeatedly smash his face into a plate of food while snorting like a pig, or a loud buffoonish father threaten to forcibly cram the food down the kid's mouth, this may be the movie for you. And don't even get me started on the leg lamp.But do yourself a favor: Before you watch it, go to the Quotes section of the Christmas Story IMDb web site, and see if you find any of the quotes from this movie remotely witty or funny. I don't. But maybe you will.BOTTOM LINE: This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be Prairie Home Companion or National Lampoon's Vacation, so it tried for a 50/50 mix. Apparently this was a winning formula. Just not for me.",

This sweet and sentimental story is a family-focused tale about a young boy growing up in the 1940s and desperate for a toy gun for Christmas. Yep, the usual American preoccupation with commercialism, and not a patch on the likes of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.It is, however, the sort of film that kids would love, given that it charts children getting up to repeated mischief in much the same way as Richmal Crompton's JUST WILLIAM books. I can imagine that it's the type of film that people would watch themselves as a kid in the 1980s and grow up loving it with a fuzzy feeling of nostalgic warmth, which is fair enough.The twist about A Christmas Story is that it's actually a Canadian film, directed by the one and only Bob Clark, whose Black Christmas is one of the ultimate Christmas horror films ever made. As for this film, it's watchable and fitfully amusing, featuring the usual pratfalls and scenes of kids getting their tongues stuck to frozen poles. The main character is a bit annoying although not as much as I'd feared and old-timer Darren McGavin helps to anchor things as his dad. Indeed, I found it entertaining enough, just not the classic I'd read about.",

The storyline is a coming of age gem that takes place in the Cleveland, Ohio area where a blue collar family does their best to get by and teach their two boys about the meaning of Christmas and family. We follow the oldest boy as he goes to school and tries to influence his teachers and parents to achieve his desired outcomes and the depths he will go to accomplish his goals.This movie is directed by Bob Clark (Porky's) and stars Darren McGavin (Billy Madison), Peter Billingsley (Iron Man), Zack Ward (Freddy vs Jason), Melinda Dillon (Magnolia) and Scott Schwartz (the Toy).The storyline for this picture is perfectly narrated, told and paced. The events build-up beautifully throughout the movie and crescendo into a perfect conclusion. The dialogue and storytelling is wonderful and the acting and execution is perfect. There's a fun mix of coming of age and comedic elements. The various scenarios are excellent with many all time greats including the lamp leg, Santa's visit, flagpole tongue scene and constant bb gun references.

            "review_title": "THE 2ND BEST HOLIDAY FILM OF ALL TIME",
            "content": "I'm not sure why I waited this long to review such an excellent film. \"A Christmas Story\" (1983) is my second favorite holiday film, with \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (1946) taking first place. The movie is partially based on the absurdly funny memoirs of Jean Shepherd, specifically, from his 1966 novel \"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash.\" Shepherd's sarcastic imagery makes for a heck of a humorous book to read, and I strongly recommend it. However, the film is so much richer as Shepherd (the narrator) describes growing up in Indiana in 1939. It seems very probable that the 1988 television sitcom, \"The Wonder Years,\" borrowed quite a lot from Shepherd's writing and narration style.Let me set the record straight, although the title suggests as much, this isn't your typical Christmas movie. A Christmas Story is essentially one hour and thirty three minutes of a time and place in Indiana, that no longer exists, all viewed through the eyes of a nine year old boy, Ralphie Parker. Ralphie has a lot on his mind, but it's not Christmas, school, or anything else. Indeed, his primary goal is to get his parents to buy him an \"official Red Ryder, carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle, with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time\" for Christmas.Even though this film predates my own age and experiences, this period of the 1930s-1940s speaks to a much more innocent time than today. America's heroes then were cowboys and generals, not rock stars and astronauts. There was no Internet, indeed, there wasn't even television. Entertainment at home revolved around the radio, where kids and adults listened to programmed series like Little Orphan Annie who instructed her young audience to read her important messages on their Secret Decoder Rings.Fathers straightened their ties and grudgingly went off to work each morning while mothers stayed home, cooking, cleaning, frequently getting bored, but very likely worrying about how to manage a budget on so little income. In the next 45 years all of this changed, and stereotyped gender responsibilities were either reversed or eliminated, but in that particular window of time, this was a reflection of real life in America.The brilliant Director Bob Clarke had to tangle with Jean Shepherd constantly to get this movie made, but it doesn't show. The actors are so perfectly cast that it is impossible to imagine anyone else in their roles. The cast includes Peter Billingsley as Ralphie Parker, Jean Shepherd as adult Ralphie (the voice), Ian Petrella as Randy Parker, Melinda Dillion as Mrs. Parker, Darren McGavin as Mr. Parker, Scot Schwartz as Flick, and Zack Ward as Scut Farkus.No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that the man standing in the Santa Claus line at Higbee's Department Store who tells Ralphie where the line begins is none other than Jean Shepherd himself!",

Until then, I always thought \"Porky's\" was Bob Clark's best film. If Ted Turner hadn't preserved it, it probably wouldn't exist today. The film has its technical faults: 1. Wavy musical soundtrack. 2. Negative scratches and dust. 3. Video \"noise\" and tracking. (Maybe too much \"copyguard\"?) Even Clark couldn't recreate the special magic of this film. Two sequels, one by Clark himself, failed. A perfect ensemble cast and Darin McGavin's funniest role. Everything works: The locations, the nostalgic scenes, the narration. Today this film probably couldn't be \"made\" the same way. The \"Chinese restaurant Christmas Carol\", complete with terrible accents, would offend Asian people. (When it was remade as a 3 hour TV special, all the singers spoke perfect English and the headwaiter gave a broad \"wink\" to the audience.) So many (similar) memories: The house looks like my own childhood home. I had a yellow-haired bully at school. I used to play inside the kitchen cupboards. My school looked exactly like that. I got my mouth washed out with \"Fells-Naptha\" soap. The dept. store reminds me of the old downtown Detroit Hudson's store. The \"mean\" Santa reminds me that I was scared of Santa at first. I had 2 aunts that perpetually thought I was 4-years-old and bought me \"baby\" toys and clothes. (I hated clothing gifts anyway, and only wanted toys.) We constantly blew fuses as well in our under-wired house. I never got a BB gun because my mom KNEW I would \"shoot my eye out\" and target birds and squirrels. Too funny to watch only at Christmastime. Even though it was made in 1983, it \"feels\" like an older movie. Well done, Bob!",

I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY Christmas MOVIES AS I CAN. Say what you want about modern films about the holidays. Yes The Hallmark Movies seem to follow a pattern. They are uninspired and always seem to cast the same people in everything. However the jewel of Modern Christmas Movies is not made by Hallmark but by MGM and it is the crown jewel of \"Modern Christmas Films\" and that film is \"A Christmas Story\".Based on the humorous writings of author Jean Shepherd, this beloved holiday movie follows the wintry exploits of youngster Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley), who spends most of his time dodging a bully (Zack Ward) and dreaming of his ideal Christmas gift, a \"Red Ryder air rifle.\" Frequently at odds with his cranky dad (Darren McGavin) but comforted by his doting mother (Melinda Dillon), Ralphie struggles to make it to Christmas Day with his glasses and his hopes intact.This film is perfect. It captures what every child feels like at Christmas. The cast is perfect and the film is never dull. What was nice about this film was that it was very respectful of the holiday itself and it showed how all of us go through some sort of stress during Christmas. The film not a huge success when released in 1983 however home video and cable showing the show developed a huge following. Its easy to see why. It is the perfect family holiday film.

In the film's sweetest scene, we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments.\nOverall, the movie lived up to expectations and then some.

It's a heartwarming holiday movie, as well as a great coming-of-age story.Peter Billingsly is adorable as Ralphy, the daydreaming, semi-good natured son of a foul-mouthed 'furnace fighter', a mother who does her best to keep her family in check, and older brother of the slightly infantile Randy. The movie follows a series of events leading up to December 25th, 1940. Ralphy has to deal with the neighbourhood bully, convincing his parents and teacher that a BB gun is a perfect gift, and finding acceptance for his own flaws. He swears, gets in fights and gets his friends in trouble, but his family forgives him. Each of the family members have their own flaws, but thats what makes them so endearing. The movie is narrated by Jean Shepherd, who also wrote the book about his own childhood. His hilarious exaggerations and insights are one of the best things about this movie.So what makes A Christmas Story so enjoyable? For one thing, it's absolutely hilarious and endlessly quotable. It's also very offbeat, with many of Ralphy's daydreams coming to life in bizarre ways. Being told from the perspective of a child looking back on his younger days gives the movie a sense of nostalgia, and because it's so memorable it's nostalgic to watch as well. To many people, this film has become as much a part of Christmas as Santa or presents. Personally I watch it every year, and it brings a smile to my face for a whole week afterwards. The house in the movie has even been re-opened for fans of the movie to walk through, and many of the cast members have re-united to visit it. This movie is love in it's purest form.Some of the movie's best moments are when it breaks away from the dreamlike bliss of the child's perspective, and gives us little pieces of reality: The mall Santa hating kids, Ralphy's decoder pin giving him a lousy commercial, and the present from Santa being from the father who had one when he was a kid. Maybe these are the truths about Christmas, and childhood itself: it is fleeting, flawed and illusory, but undeniably magical.",

            "content": "Though Peter Billingsley has grown up and now has a career behind the camera in the business end of show business he will forever be remembered as young Ralphie in A Christmas Story. For those who were young and listened to Jean Shepherd's program as a kid he can do nothing else.I remember turning and listening to Jean Shepherd as an adolescent and I even turned my younger brother into a fan and being he was a precocious lad it very much appealed to him as well. All the incidents you see in A Christmas Story culminating with young Ralphie getting that wondrous gift of a Red Ryder BB rifle are those I remember Shepherd telling on his show. I daresay they made that vivid an impression on thousands of others. Getting Shepherd to not only write the screenplay, but narrate is essential to the story.This all takes place in Jean Shepherd's home town of Hammond, Indiana, steel town and suburb of both Chicago and Gary. The Parkers consist of Melinda Dillon mother and Darren McGavin father and Billingsley with younger brother Ian Petrella. McGavin who thought he'd be best remembered for being Mike Hammer and Carl Kolchak on television got his career. Shepherd on his show always referred to his father as \"the old man\" and so he remains here. McGavin is absolutely perfect in the way that Shepherd described him on his radio show.Billingsley and Petrella are appealing as real kids and not Hollywood type kids. Again I'm sure there was a lot of input from Shepherd in those characterizations as well.For me you'll love that scene when the boys meet Santa Claus at the department store. Seen through a kid's eyes it's both humorous and a bit frightening as well.In fact A Christmas Story is a holiday classic and will be for centuries.",

This warm and funny Christmas story centers on an adorable little boy named Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to find a Red Ryder BB gun under the Christmas tree and the manipulations he puts his parents through to get one. Written and narrated by Jean Shepherd and based on his story \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\", this delicious slice of Americana is a delight from start to finish filled with equal parts belly laughs and warm sentiment. Young Peter Billingsley is a joy as Ralphie and he receives brilliant support from Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon as his parents. Scott Schwartz also scores as Ralphie's best friend Flick, who has a memorable encounter with a telephone pole. Don't miss this one.",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" is perfection at Christmastime. The nostalgic feel of early-1940s Americana at the year's most magical time could not have been more appropriately filmed by Bob Clark (\"Porky's). This excellent comedy proves how through the eyes of a 10-year-old child, hopes and dreams for the ultimate Christmas present can overcome neighborhood bullies, homework and even \"The Old Man\".I have watched this movie at least 30 times. Not just at Christmas but year-'round. It's just that perfect. Although I wasn't around, I would almost guarantee this is what my own father lived like during the time portrayed in this excellent movie. It makes me wish for a time machine to go back to this more innocent and simpler way of life.There is nothing I could add to what the other IMDb reviewers are saying on this site. Although the \"8\" score that this universally is receiving is still too low. Watch it every Christmas as a family tradition with hot chocolate, a roaring fire, snuggly blankets and sitting next to your Christmas tree. You will feel the warmth of family and laughter. This is an American treasure.",

            "content": "My God, how quickly time flies! \"A Christmas Story\" celebrates its 34th anniversary this year, which means that all the kids that fill the classroom or stuck their nose on the toy shop window, from Ralphie to his little brother Randy, are in their mid-forties, even that poor little Flick who stuck his ill-fated tongue on the pole (the film's defining image) will turn 50 the next year. And speaking for myself, it's been 24 years that I watched it (fittingly with my kid brother) on a Saturday afternoon and I remember we laughed, we laughed a lot. We weren't from the narrator's generation, but it didn't make it any less accessible or enjoyable. I guess this says a lot about the way the charm of \"A Christmas Story\" operates, it finds a voice that can speak to any child of any generation and any country, any adult too.Indeed, the age of the film doesn't matter actually, many movies are as old without being classics. Many movies dealt with Christmas with far richer and 'entertaining' plots without reaching that little sparkle of truth and wit. In fact, many movies featured kids that were far smarter than Ralphie, with more 'interesting' problems, but were instantly forgotten. There's just something about \"A Christmas Story\" that rings the right note, something that works. It didn't work immediately, in a year where \"Return of the Jedi\" was the phenomenon, and comedies like \"Risky Business\", \"Vacation\" or \"Trading Places\" attracted more crowds, critics welcomed Bob Clark's film with timid enthusiasm. Others, like Vincent Canby, criticized it while conceding a touching nostalgic value. But the attention got warmer with time, people realized they could watch this film and watch it again, that they could enjoy it as well as their parents or their kids, that the quest of Ralphie could resonate more strongly in the parents' hearts. They also saw that unlike indisputable classics like \"It's a Wonderful Life\", the film didn't rely on its ending, it was interesting from beginning to end. Slowly, the film became the consummate feel-good family Christmas movie, with the charm of nostalgic classics filled with colorful characters like Fellini's \"Amarcord\" or Woody Allen's \"Radio Daus\", with a similar wit coming from the voice-over narration of Jean Shepherd. It's set in the 40's, the kids aren't even baby-boomers, but there's a classic tropism established by Ebert that the more specific a story is, the more universal it is, even more universal since the film is about childhood.And what better time than Christmas to amplify the most basic aspects of that magical yet volatile time? We all know the story: \"Little Ralphie wants the new Red Ryder B.B. Gun\" only to bump into the same frustrating answer: \"You'll shoot your eye out\". You have everything in that premise: the powerlessness of children, the fetishism surrounding toys and the obstruction of overprotective mothers, it's the eternal struggle between kids and parents, culminating in Christmas time and forcing a child to seek escapism in dreams or find stratagems to convince his parents, same as parents who use tricks to talk them into finishing their plates.. It's Childhood becomes a time where communication is never a straight line. And some attempts are so pathetically deemed to fail that it elevates Ralphie as one of the most adorable Christmas protagonists.There's something so irresistible in the face of little Ralphie (played by Peter Bilingsley), he's not your smart ass cute-looking kid, not a Kevin McAllister, he's just an average little boy whose dreams are all focused on the holy grail of all toys and trying to find the proper language to communicate it to his father, his mother or eventually his teacher. The father played by Darren McGavin Is a no nonsense man who spends his time swearing but is oblivious to the fact that his kid would have grew an awareness of a few dirty words. The mother played by Melinda Dillon is more diplomatic and sweet (love the scene where she tries to convince Randy to eat) but God forbid she ever hears swearing, she then becomes the 'bad cop' who knows how to wipe dirty words off a child's mouth, with the perfect brand of soap. The film contains all the elements of childhood, friends, parents, toys, bullies, toadies, daring and double-daring (not to mention triple-daring), snow games, toys, joys and deceptions. Indeed, one of the most interesting scene involves the discovery of an ad message behind a secret code (proof that even at those times, publicity was frustratingly omnipresent). The closest to sensual awakening comes from the comical introduction of a sexy lamp made of a leg, causing a great deal of jealousy between the couple. The film looks likes a series of vignettes but to avoid the episodic feeling, there's that common thread, that constant goal that never deserts Ralphie's mind: the B.B. Gun and the inevitable \"Eye-shooting\" line, inspiring a hilarious comment coming, of all persons, from Santa Claus himself.But \"A Christmas Story\" is not about the gun, but about these wishes that obsessed us as kids. And there's just a gentleness about this film, an innocence that rhymes with intelligence, a desire to talk to the inner child inside us without losing the adult touch, that the narration comes from an adult voice creates the perfect bridge between the two worlds, and makes the film such a unique experience. That and the fact that every scene is original and there's a sense of detail that makes each viewing richer than the first. It's a film that grows on you and gets more special every time you watch it.Not to mention that it's hilarious, you won't shoot your eye out, but you'll laugh your ass off.",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" is a rare film about children yet for adults. While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmas-themed saga, adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated, polysyllabic narration of Ralphie, filled with nostalgia and lucid memories, and the soft, high-pitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word. The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film, but a character wholly outside the story, reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes. Yet he is the heart of the film, the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Clause and a BB gun - it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke. To that end, \"A Christmas Story\" is flawless.\"A Christmas Story\" tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he searches for the golden, upheld idol of all red-blooded American boys: A Red Rider Air Rifle. Ralphie spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it - including an essay, a trip to Santa Claus and more. The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family - his irritable, foul-mouthed father with a good heart, his whiny brother Randy, and his sweet, all-American mother. It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes, but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film. The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story. He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment, Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing - only to have Billingsley note in his awe-filled, high-pitched voice that \"I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun. It's very good for Christmas.\" (paraphrased). Most of the humor is similar - the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also, there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season - it's a movie everyone can relate to. There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power. I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child - in this case, the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously, \"A Christmas Story\" is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane. It simply excels at its simple goals, and comes together as an extraordinarily entertaining piece of cinema.",

Christmas movies probably have a much better chance of becoming \"classics\" that get watched every year but there are likely as many completely forgotten too but A Christmas Story is not one of those. I think I've pinpointed the love of this film. First of all, the movie is not a \"family\" Christmas movie per se as it does have some bad language but adults love it because they can find something in it to relate too. The film is so brilliantly written that you feel like you are living the life of this little boy. The adult narration in his head is just awesome, and hilarious and the entire experiences that he goes through are fun to watch and completely memorable. Although the film is known for being about him wanted that BB gun, that is such a small part of the bigger picture. Its not a coming of age story but rather a being of age story. As with most classics everything just clicks and works so well and you can watch it again and again like a home movie of your own and feel the same warm fuzzy feeling.The discovery and casting of Peter Billingsley was sheer brilliance. Billingsley doesn't have a ton of lines in the film because so much of what goes on is the adult voice in his head. This makes him even better a performer because he has to react to the voice and to the things going on around him and he is perfect. He gives a top notch performance. Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are amazing, memorable, and legendary as Ralphie's parents. They have such unique personalities and you can't help but laugh and smile at their antics. They just light up every scene they are in. Jean Shepherd is the adult voice of Ralphie and he does so with complete ease and utter perfection. He is an adult making everything sound like he's experiencing things as a child and it is perfect for the movie. He literally embodies Ralph as much as Billingsley does. Scott Schwartz, Ian Petrella, RD Robb, and Zack Ward all are brilliant in small doses as Ralphie's peers. None of them have big moments, some of them have very few lines and yet they are all so integral to the story and they all get at least one moment to shine.Bob Clark has had such a mixed back to his direction credit. But there is one thing he knows and that's 80s comedy. He helped take A Christmas Story to epic proportions that nearly everyone holds dear. The movie is, simply put, hilarious fun. You will feel their pain, their memories, their family and the best Christmas they've ever had. I can't say enough about this film because if you haven't seen it, you're likely in a minority and if you have then you likely know exactly what I mean. It is just simply heartfelt, a tad raunchy, and a whole bucket load of fun. 8.5/10",

            "content": "A Christmas Story (1983) :\nBrief Review -An intellectual fun film for kids and an unforgettable nostalgia for adults which leaves all with tears of joy. I keep searching for a kids film that will have a lot for adults so that i can watch the same film with my kids in future but you know what i found most of those films in animated genre (mostly Pixar films). Now i feel like i have found one named A Christmas Story that would be the same film I was looking for. I never thought that a fun film for kids having kids in the main roles will have so much intellectual and thoughtful messages. The film is about a 9 years old boy Ralphie who desires to get a Red Ryder BB gun as a Christmas Gift but he fails to convince his parents, teacher and Santa. Just not this but the film covers many things like desires of kids, parents thoughts on it, teachers views and then how the entire generation of kids is behaving very differently to each other at the same time. It creates lot of laugh riots, many nostalgic moments like we all had in childhood in school, outsider school and at home with parents. I am not an American guy so i don't know much about Christmas films criteria but I can see it as a normal film and enjoy it every time. From slapstick one liners to kids level intellectual jokes to ultimate conclusive thoughts (narrated by adult character) to emotional attachment, A Christmas Story works in every aspect. In 90-95 minutes runtime and universal theme like this it couldn't have got better than this except the fact that the climax could have easily added something from adult version of Ralphie. Maybe i was expecting too much from a 80s film that is basically made for enjoyment of Family audience. Overall, it gets enough of everything which is needed for a Must Watch Film for Families in Christmas Holidays and for many generations.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" (1983), whenever someone mentions Christmas film, or holiday film, this is the first movie that comes to mind. It is based off an original novel by Jean Shepherd, called: \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash.\" It's a great book, and this film really gets the story right. This is the best Christmas movie ever made, it is truly the epitome of Christmas films. It practically breathes Christmas! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story might just be a traditional narrative of an ordinary American Christmas. But, it's told in such a unique, creative, and very entertaining way. The acting is top-notch, Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is phenomenal, Darren Gavin is absolutely hysterical as the father, Melinda Dillon is great as the mother, Ian Petrella as the younger brother, Randy is funny. The rest of the cast does a brilliant job as well, they are really entertaining and perform their characters flawlessly. Even Jean Shepherd, the author of the original novel, narrates the story throughout the movie. That is really cool, the author is really telling us his own story and he certainly proves himself as a great voice actor! Usually, I'm not a fan of narration in a film. But when a movie gets it right it works very effectively and can help tie the film together. The sets/locations may be a typical American town, but in a movie like this it really works. Also, it's a very quaint neighborhood and it is perfect for the tone of this movie! The special effects are well done, and hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, and it really screams Christmas. If I hear any random part of the movie soundtrack, I can immediately pinpoint it to this film. That's how you know you have a perfect soundtrack. \"A Christmas Story\" is truly timeless, and a Christmas film for any generation. I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking for a Christmas film to watch this holiday season and not sure which one to choose, watch this one. Also, if you have not seen this movie, see it. Any one can enjoy it, it's not hard to find it on TV during Christmas season. Every holiday season, they show this film 24/7 on TV. So I don't have to wear out my DVD of it, because the TV channels save me the trouble and play it for me! This is the only Christmas film to air 24/7 during the Christmas season, and there's a reason why. It is truly, the greatest, and always will be, the best Christmas film!",

            "content": "According to LEIGH BROWN, CREATOR AND ENABLER The Lives and Love of an Arty Village Chick by Eugene B. Bergmann, \"Leigh Brown, from the early 1960s through the late 1990s, was the steadfast, all-purpose, vital element in the life and art of the raconteur and wit, Jean Shepherd.\" As early as 1972, she would tell people \"If we can ever get A Christmas Story made as a movie using the Red Ryder BB gun tale, he will have it made. It would be the ultimate perennial Christmas movie like It's a Wonderful Life.\"She was so right.Shepherd took the stories that he told on the radio and wrote in books and worked with his wife Leigh and filmmaker Bob Clark to make the stories \"Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder Nails the Cleveland Street Kid,\" \"The Counterfeit Secret Circle Member Gets the Message, or The Asp Strikes Again,\" \"My Old Man and the Lascivious Special Award That Heralded the Birth of Pop Art\" and \"Grover Dill and the Tasmanian Devil,\" as well as \"The Grandstand Passion Play of Delbert and the Bumpus Hounds,\" as well as the unpublished \"Flick's Tongue\" into a movie.Clark had first heard these stories on the radio in 1968 and worked for years to get this movie made.What amazes me is that Clark made both the darkest holiday film of all time, the perfect Black Christmas, and this film, a movie that for many is the American Christmas film.It wasn't always that way.The city of Cleveland wasn't sure they wanted someone that made a seasonal slasher, much less Porky's, to make a film in their town. Even the department store used for the film, Higbee's, had a clause where vice president Bruce Campbell would be allowed to edit the script for cursing if they used his store. Ironically, the house used for a lot of this movie is on Cleveland Street, which is also the street name - in Hammond, Indiana - where Shepherd grew up.It wasn't an easy shoot. Clark had Shepherd banned from the set at one point for giving his young actor his own direction.The movie did fine - $20.8 million on a $3.3 million budget - but then it went away. That's what movies used to do.But then, something small happened and grew.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's pre-1986 film library was bought by Ted Turner. He needed a holiday movie to show that they owned and didn't have to pay the rights to. They started showing it in 1987 and at one point, showed it the entire day of Christmas. It became the holiday movie, replacing It's a Wonderful Life, which ended its free run of being a public domain film in 1993 when Republic Pictures bought the rights to the original story it was based on, as well as the music in the film.You may know the story of Ralphie, of the gun he wants, of the tongue on the flagpole, but maybe knowing all of the above will add to your holiday watch.",

Perhaps it's how we've all been the kid that wanted that ONE toy over all else. Maybe it's the comforting, hilarious narration. Possibly it's the honesty of a family surviving the holidays. Perhaps it's Ralphie's childlike, melodramatic fantasies. Or maybe it's just the leg-lamp. However, I think we are drawn to it because it embraces the magic of Christmas without falling into the fantastical that many holiday movies dabble in. As one of the most down-to-earth Christmas films of all time, ACS is also one of the best. The story is an episodic vision of what American families goes through during Christmas, purely held together by its honest and quirky tone. Sure, the ending is abrupt, the message is unclear, and there is even some dated, un-PC humor (Chinese restaurant). However, even these elements contribute to the movie's naturalistic feel. The characters are dimensional, with some truly great performances by the four family members, and the period-piece elements are warm, cozy, inviting and familiar. Like a Norman Rockwell painting brought to life, ACS is pure Americana at its truest and funniest, mixing the purity of old network sitcoms with the more nuanced and subtle humor of underground comedy. Playing on the big screen at The Grand next week, on TBS Christmas Eve, and always available OnDemand, its omnipresence during this time can be a blessing and a curse. But don't let the ubiquitous existence of this holiday classic keep you from sitting down and enjoying it beginning to end.",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" is without a doubt one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time! \"Home Alone\" was this close to be my number one favorite, but I don't need to compare the two of them because I love them both in each of their own. So, why is \"A Christmas Story\" my favorite? Here is why. \"A Christmas Story\" is being narrated by an adult Ralphie Parker as he tells his Christmas story, when he was nine years old. The movie takes place in the 40s as we see Ralphie in a young age as he comes across a Red Ryder BB gun, which he sees in his own eyes the \"Holy Grail\" of Christmas gifts. He has always been hoping to get it as a gift, but he keeps getting by others as they tell him with the same warning: \"You'll Shoot Your Eye Out.\" So that is what the premise of this movie is all about. However, we come across with a couple of subplots in the movie such as the Old Man winning a major award which it happens to be a lamp that is shape like a leg; then the Old Man has a major frustration on fixing the furnace; and Ralphie along with his brother and friends get bullied by Scut Farkus and Grover Dill. So, enough explaining on what the plot of the movie is, here is what I thought of this movie. I love \"A Christmas Story\" from beginning to end because this movie always makes me laugh, and I never get tired with these jokes. The cast were absolutely perfect, and I love them each of their own. Peter Billingsley is perfectly cast as the boy who dreams of the perfect Christmas gift. Melinda Dillion and Darren McGavin were perfect as the mother and father, and the rest of the cast were all great too. Bob Clark does an amazing job with this movie for working on the script and directing the movie. Jean Shepherd who also work on the script does a terrific job on the narration, which is what made the movie work. In case if you don't know, the movie is based on Shepherd's book \"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash.\" I know many of you would find this overrated that is either not funny, or just getting sick and tired of this movie that has to be shown on both TBS and TNT for showing it as a 24 hour marathon; if that is why, then I fully understand that. Heck, many other people might get sick of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" being shown on television, which is another movie that I also like. So, with that said, I can relate and identify with this movie because it is like anyone's fantasy dream on what gift do they wish for on Christmas; you can either wish for a pool table, a car, a flat screen TV, and whatever gifts that you want. So, that is why I love \"A Christmas Story\" and it will always be my favorite Christmas movie. Also, I can watch this anytime when it comes to Christmas. I give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, and I wish you all a Merry Christmas!",

You talk about cult classics? This is the Jonestown of Cult movies. Does the film hold up all these years later? In some ways, yes. I get why this film is so beloved. It's the same reason why I find it so weird. It's uniquely anecdotal. Largely based on Jean Shepherd's radio stories, A Christmas Story is a series of awkward holiday mishaps, strung around a story of one kid's dream of getting a BB Gun for Christmas. Don't get me wrong, the stories themselves are great. Many of the gags really stick the landing, and that's this film's biggest asset. They are all iconic. The tongue scene, the department store Santa, The leg Lamp, the bunny costume scene.. and so on. Bob Clark is the director, and this was his first family feature. He typically made horror movies before hand. Unfortunately, that shows here. The weirdness of the stories are amplified by Bob Clark's nightmarish direction. It's a Christmas fever dream. Maybe that was the point.",

            "content": "I came from Chicago... and Jean Sheppard, whose imagination created Ralphie & the rest of the crew in this film, was from just down the road in Gary, Indiana. His time frame was a bit before mine, but his take on Christmas in the industrial, urban Midwest is spot on with what I remember.He captured the hard, gritty aspects of the steel mill town Gary (disguised in the film as mythical Hohman, Indiana) perfectly...  as well as the special, once a year magic that Christmas used to bring us  before we got too sophisticated and modern to let ourselves go and ENJOY a holiday.Jean Sheppard was, IMHO, a national treasure. His writing was the inspiration of CHRISTMAS STORY, tho the film was a conglomeration of a LOT of his short stories.Ralphie, Flick, Kissel, and the rest of the kids are typical for the period, back when Christmas was THE big time of the year...  and Ralphie's quest for the Red Ryder Lever Action BB rifle (with a compass in the stock!) duplicates what EVERY city kid wanted, but couldn't ever  have, and for the same reason; YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!\nJim Backus is EXCELLENT as Ralphie's father...  the flawed, human, but totally real Working Stiff who does what he can to keep his family fed and make Ralphie's world the best place that he can.A CHRISTMAS STORY is a refreshing relief from the countless repetitions of Dickens A CHRISTMAS CAROL that paves the TV channels wall to wall during the holidays. BTW... did you know that a web search will tell you that there have been no less than 247 different film versions of the Dickens tale made over the years???Give this movie a try...   you'll LOVE it. It has become a classic over the 20 - odd years it's been around.\nBTW... because of the film, the folks at Daisy reintroduced the Red Ryder Lever Action BB Rifle for about a year... unfortunately, they forgot to include the compass in the stock.At the age of 44, I finally got my Red Ryder. It's as great a Christmas present (to myself) now, as it would have been when I was Ralphie's age.",

            "content": "This movie is a poor and secular excuse to ruin a good holiday.Christmas is a beautiful holiday for religious people, and non-religious people. It's a time of celebrating Christ's birth (if you're religious) and giving (if you're not religious.) This film does no justice for either side of the holiday....Ralphie is an obnoxious little boy who whines all the time on how he wants a RED RYDER BB-GUN, and that's basically all he does. He's not even that cute a kid (I thought he looked like a child version of Drew Carey.) His brother is stupidly annoying, and his parents are dysfunctional idiots who should never have been allowed to have custody over their kids. I mean, I would have sought relationship counseling if my husband bought a lamp shaped like a Playboy bunny's leg. That's disgusting. But wait, she was an idiot, so what was I thinking? Ralphie beats the snot out of a bully kid, to the point where he's bloodier than Rocky Balboa was at the end of \"Rocky\". But when Ralphie's mom pulls him away from the bully, she doesn't check if he's okay. But I keep forgetting, she's an idiot. I mean, she thought Ralphie looked cute in his pink bunny PJs... that his idiot grandmother gave him. I'm surprised Ralphie didn't grow up to become a mentally insane serial killer.What's worse, is people are all like, \"It was like that when we were kids.\" Really? Then, I pity you all who had to grow up with moronic mothers, obnoxious little siblings who acted like animals, fathers who bought Playboy lamps and cussed all the time, and grannies who sent you pink bunny PJs.Whats worse, is that the best version of this film is the 30 second version with bunnies. http://www.angryalien.com/aa/xmas_storybuns.asp And this isn't saying much.Please, buy \"A Christmas Carol\", or \"Miracle on 34th Street\", or \"It's a Wonderful Life\", if you want to watch a good Christmas classic.

            "content": "If one watches \"A Christmas Story\" in its natural habitat (the holiday season), it would almost be impossible not to give it a full 10 stars. It takes full advantage of the Christmas spirit and capitalizes on baby boomer nostalgia that also filters down through their offspring.All of that being said, \"A Christmas Story\" is also not a perfect film. It really is a collection of set-pieces (almost like a stage play) more than a coherent narrative, and only the quest for the iconic BB gun gives it any structure whatsoever. In this sense, I can't call it my favorite holiday movie, but it obviously is still beloved enough to procure a solid ranking.For a basic overview, this film tells the story of young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his quest for the perfect Christmas present: the Red Ryder BB gun. Seemingly thwarted in this pursuit by a mother (Melinda Dillon) who opines \"you'll shoot your eye out!\" and a father (Darren McGavin) who is too busy fighting furnaces and muttering comic obscenities, Ralphie must take is plea to the big man himself--Santa Claus.Besides that general structure, \"A Christmas Story\" is very much a family-centric (and friendly) film. The antics of the Parkers comprise nearly all of the comedy, drama, and nostalgia in the experience. There's a reason why the house (in Cleveland, OH) now houses an entire museum dedicated to the movie!Upon my recent re-watch of the film, one thing I noticed was how crucially important the \"Old Ralphie\" (Jean Shepherd) is to the proceedings. Much like the later \"Wonder Years\" TV show, some of the best lines and wisecracks of the entire picture are uttered by the narrator here. Without that \"looking back\" perspective, this would all feel a bit hollow.Overall, I consider \"A Christmas Story\" to be a solid entry in the holiday season canon. It isn't in my absolute top tier, but it comes very, very close. It almost works better, in an odd way, watching it in pieces over the now-ubiquitous 24-hour Christmas Eve marathon than just viewing it straight through.",

            "content": "One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine-year-old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in `A Christmas Story,' directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  What is happiness?  To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple; it's getting the best Christmas present a boy could ask for, namely a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot carbine action air rifle BB gun.  But it's getting close to the big day, and his hopes are fading fast; there's an obstacle between him and the coveted weaponry:  Mom (Dillon).  And the answer is `No.'  But why!?  `You'll shoot your eye out.'  Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument. But, as Yogi once said, `It ain't over till it's over,' and a determined Ralphie refuses to give in or give up on his quest for the ultimate gift. And as the story unfolds we get a glimpse, through Ralphie's eyes, of the way life was in another time and another place; an era long since gone, but never forgotten. \tBased on a portion of the Novel `In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,' by Jean Shepherd, with a screenplay by Shepherd, Leigh Brown and Bob Clark, Shepherd narrates (as the adult Ralphie), with reminiscences that are poignant and delightful; about Dad (McGavin), an Oldsmobile man, turkey lover and fabled `furnace fighter,' who in the heat of battle could weave a tapestry of profanity that as far as anyone knows is still hanging in the air somewhere over Lake Michigan; Mom, a woman who hadn't had a hot meal in years, thanks to tending to the needs of her family first; younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella); friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) who share Ralphie's myriad adventures and set the protocol of the `dare,' from the singular all the way up to the coup de grace, the `triple dog dare,' employed during a contest to determine, once and for all, if one's tongue will in fact stick to a frozen metal flag pole; the endearing Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), the teacher who makes them write a THEME; and last, but not least, the yellow-eyed neighborhood bully, Scott Farcus (Zack Ward) and his toadie, Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), who give new meaning to the phrase, `Say Uncle!'  There are humorous anecdotes about flights of fancy and lessons in life, like how to change a tire in record time and how to barter for the right Christmas tree (from Dad), and tricks used to get your younger brother to eat his food instead of just playing with it, as well as alternative uses for soap (from Mom).  We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a `Little Orphan Annie' secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a `Major Award.' \tMcGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, `The Old Man,' as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born.  But the most exemplary performance given here is by Peter Billingsley, who forever after will remain Ralphie Parker in the memories of anyone who sees this film.  There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.  And therein lies the real charm of this movie; because everyone was once a child, and for better or worse, will carry memories akin to Ralphie Parker's (or Jean Shepherd's) forever.  A heartwarming, funny film, `A Christmas Story' is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it.  In the tradition of `It's A Wonderful Life,' and `A Christmas Carol,' this is a movie that can add so much to the festivities, no matter how you celebrate your holidays.  I rate this one 10/10.",

If you didn't know the movie was released in 1983, you'd be shocked to find it out because not only is it set in the 40s, but there is an old, classic quality about the way it's written and filmed.The movie truly is a Christmas story and nothing else. The plot simply follows one young boy named Ralphie on a particular Christmas where he wanted nothing else but a Red Rider air rifle BB gun. What makes it so special is the way it's told. There is a narrator, presumably an older Ralphie telling the story, that adds a strong amount of suspense as well as insight to the characters. The movie then structures itself in little memorable episodes that make you laugh and recall your own childhood all at the same time.Whether it's the kid sticking his tongue on the poll at recess, Ralphie getting soap stuck in his mouth, the delightfully creepy mall Santa, or the immortal words \"you'll shoot your eye out,\" \"Christmas Story\" has something you're bound to never forget. It's replay value is also astounding. It evokes a nostalgia unparalleled by other Christmas comedies.",

The main point of this story centes around Raphie's desire for a `Genuine Red Ryder 200 Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle.'  Ralphie is like many other kids of the 1940's. He lives with his younger brother Randy(Ian Petrella), his mother( Melinda Dillon), and his Father (Darren McGavin). As the story progresses, Ralphie tries to convince the adults in his life that  a ` Genuine Red Ryder 200 Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle,' would be a good choice as a Christmas gift.  He leaves advertisements in his mother's magazine, he writes about why he wants it in a school assignment about \" What I Want for Christmas\". He even asks the head honcho, Santa Clause. They all respond with the classic phrase,  `You'll shoot your Eye out.' Ralphie is let down by this  but he does not give up.This story is not only about Ralphie's quest for a BB gun, it also is a story about Ralphie's childhood n the 1940's. Like any other movie told from a child's perspective, there is some kind of school or neighborhood bully, who picks on others as well as the main character.  This movie would not be the same with out Scut Farcus, a tall nasty looking green/yellow toothed kid. (probably twelve or thirteen) and who could forget a trusty sidekick named Grover Dill.  Ralphie and his friends are afraid of Scut and try to avoid him as much as possible. These emotions build up in Ralphie until one day, he can take it no longer, his anger gets the best of him, and he beats up Scut Farcus.  All the neighborhood kids gather around to watch the fight which came to be known as the Scot Farcus affair. Although Ralphie was worried that he would get not trouble as a result of this fight, he soon forgot about this as he continued tot think of ways to get what he wanted for Christmas.We are also introduced to Ralphie's parents and brother. like.  Any film of the forties can't be complete with out the house wife/ mother.  Melinda Dillon acts, and looks like the typical house wife of the forties who cares for her family. Ralphie's dad, who is refrred to as `the old man',  is somewhat crabby, but for the most part he is a very likable character. He likes to enetr contests and eventually wins a `major award' which turns out to be a sexy leg lamp. The `Old Man has a tendency to use bad language, however, when Ralphie starts to use some of these words, he is punished by having his mouth washed out with Life Boy Soap. . Jean Shepherd's narration, and Peter Billingsley's portrayal of Ralphie make it seem as though the two really grew up in the forties.  From the way he dresses to the way he acts, Peter does a great job acting out Ralphie's part.  The same goes with Jean Shepherd.  Although he is not acting, just narrating, he describes Ralphie's childhood so well that it almost seems as though we are growing up with him. Similarly, the supporting actors and actresses, Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, Ian Petrella and Ralphie's friends, Schwartz and Flick who are played by Scott Schwartz and RD Robb, add a lot of humor to the story.The reviewer would rate this movie a six out of five star rating.  No matter what happens in the movie it manages to have a great plot.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  Make room for this movie on your video or DVD rack at home!",

            "content": "Bob Clark's A Christmas Story is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen in my lifetime, and now I look back to the time where I was a little kid and I remember not liking the film because of one particular scene and that scene is where Flick (played by Scott Schwartz) is dared by Schwartz (played by R.D. Robb)triple dog dares him to stick his tongue to a pole in order for Flick to see if his tongue either sticks to the pole or not, and now that I love it a lot more I regret not liking it then. The movie stars Peter Billingsley as Ralphie Parker a young boy who tries persistently to convince his parents (played by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin) his teacher (played by Tedde Moore who Ralphie writes a theme for), and a Santa Claus impersonator (played by Jeff Gillen) to get him the one thing that he wants for Christmas and that one thing is a Red Ryder BB gun of which he thinks is the perfect Christmas gift for the time period that the movie is set in which is the 1940s. One of the neatest things about this movie is that it is not necessarily a Christmas movie it is a movie about Christmas, but the one thing that I learned from this movie is that joy and happiness are two of the many things that can lead to having a great Christmas, and another thing that I learned was never to be naughty by two scenes where the two bullies Scut Farkus (played by Zack Ward)and Grover Dill (played by Yano Anaya) in which Scut gets a lesson learned in a very manly type of way by getting beaten up by Ralphie, and also not to be a spoiled brat like Randy (played by Ian Petrella) was in the film in which he was spoiled but in a good way because of his performance in the film, the film is also very funny especially the scenes where the old man is swearing at the furnace, and the scene where Scut Farkus gets a lesson learned from the beating by Ralphie among others. The film really works as a timeless classic that never does get old even 31 years after it was released.",

Set in the most unimaginable city on earth for such a movie (not Hong Kong, not Rio de Janeiro, not Tristan de Cunha), Cleveland, Ohio, the movie plumbs the depths of a boy's Christmas desire for what was once far more magnetic than any video game or latest electronic marvel: a genuine Daisy B-B gun (politely known as an \"air rifle\"). The kids he hangs out with are also intriguing, and his family is a joy. As the famous man said, \"Don't miss it if you can!\"",

This movie a is a great example of that, the way this film makes me feel is almost indescribable, It kind of makes me feel like I'm nine again, spoiled rotten and very unlucky (at least in my eyes at the time).

I doubt many people outside of the US know who Jean Shepherd is, or of his popular Ralphie Parker character. In fact, most people in general won't know that this movie is actually the fourth of (currently) seven featuring Ralphie.Adapted from the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, a collection of mostly Christmas-themed short stories, it remind me a lot of Christmas Vacation (adapted by John Hughes from his own Christmas '59 short story) in that it seems semi-autobiographic. But the adaptation of several stories gives the movie a sketchy feel, with a few that failed to resonate with me.The main story has little Ralphie Parker (brilliantly played by Peter Billingsly), a kid with imagination and cynicism beyond his years, beg his parents, and Santa, for a BB gun while dealing with a series of eccentric events in 1940s Indiana. It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half. The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome. But I just can't see myself making this an annual tradition.I am sure many will disagree, but it does make me curious about checking out the other Ralphie Parker movies.",

            "content": "Traditions are not just there for the taking. They are acquired slowly,gradually. Like so much flotsam and jetsam picked up by the raging river currents, joining the flow permanently;as if always a part of it. As for so many of us, Christmas is THE Holiday, whether or not we follow the Christian way. It has in many places, like (chiefly)the United States, it is a Secular cause of Joy, Family Gatherings, good food and drink;all in addition to its original Religious Celebration.One tradition that we have picked up in recent years, and seems to be a true Yuletide \"Keeper\" is A Christmas STORY(MGM, 1983).The working of Author Jean Shepherd's written word into a living, breathing screen presentation is done smoothly and without a labored appearance. The bridging of the two media is accomplished in a most interesting manner, indeed.The feat is completed by using an Adult Voice Actor, portraying the grown-up counter part of 10 year old main character, Ralphie(Peter Billingsley). The selection of the Adult Actor to do the narration wasn't particular brilliant, yet was probably the best choice that could have been made in Author, Jean Shepherd, himself! Mr. Shepherd had a true talent in relating his story to us his audience. His talents make what is an experience that would be specific to a particular period,universally understood,showing its commonality with any person in any period.So, this Daisey Red Ryder BB Gun that's the \"Holy Grail\" to a kid of the 1940's. In the 1950's some item like the Remco Frogman or Hubley's \"Flip Special\"(THE RIFLEMAN'S Rifle) could be interchanged. \"It\" is whatever would be your Heart's Desire, and as such we know that these are universal feelings, common to all.Jean Shepherd has given us all a world from the view point of the Working Class(Prolitarate, Mr. Marx?), not from what all too many of us would label, \"Middle Class\"(Buorguesise, Mr. Engels?). This is a proper designation and carries with it no inherent shame. Depending on the situation and period, they might be called \"the Working Poor\", and again, no shame, no exaggeration-just the truth.So much of our popular fiction is generated by those with a truly \"Middle Class\" background and upbringing, that the pop culture dramatizations lack any common rooting in the work-a-day world.As for the movie A Christmas STORY, the story and treatment is well suited to the time of the year. We join the Parker Family in what is about an eternity before that year's Christmas, which would be about 3 months time to a kid, remember? We meet each family member, one by one and learn about them and their personalities,emotional connections and wants & needs.We have the Mother, Mrs. Parker(Melinda Dillon)the chief-cook-n-bottle washer. She is devoted to the Family, a \"regular Mom\", but possessing a brilliant intuitive knack for \"shifting gears\" when any of her 3 men needed her. 'The Old Man, Mr. Parker(Darren McGavin) is aloof of much going on around. Seemingly worn from his working man's world, he demonstrates a deep understanding and compassion. Somewhat self opinionated(who ain't?), he frets over off season Baseball News(\"...the White Sox traded Bullfrog!(Pitcher Bill \"Bullfrog\" Dietrich)How could they do that!\");and yet his instincts bring him to instant action to defend the wife and kids! And, lastly, Little Brother,Randy(Ian Petrella)is properly quiet, mysterious and secretive, just like a little kid.The cast is put through a number of trials and tribulations, that once again seem all too familiar. From the \"growing pains\" of using Adult 'R' rated language, to fretting about a disappointing school grade; all are universally difficult to deal with and emotionally draining. Our favourite ongoing 'situation' involves Ralphie & his friends, and their dealing with the Neighborhood Bully,Scut Farkas(Zack Ward),his 'Toady'. We see the torment that the kids suffer and the eventual and final ending of the situation! Author Jean Shepherd,Screenwriter Leigh Brown and Director Bob Clark, all did their best to not create, but re-created some beautiful moments, not only for the moment' but for always.",

The story set back in the 1940's gives it an old fashioned look that is warm and cold at the same time. Even though it's hard to relate back to these times, everyone can relate to Ralphie.Ralphie, the main character played by Peter Billingsley, is a great choice to have as this kid. His smart ass and almost too mature outlook on life gives him an edge that will make kids and adults like him. Whether it be trying to get his mom to buy him a Red Rider bee bee gun for Christmas or trying to crack the code for Little Orphan Annie, Ralphie always has his game face on.His mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin) are great as they seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum at times, and at other times on the same page. This gives Ralphie the edge he needs to get his Red Rider. With his younger brother Randy, the two of them battle through their parent's lamp fights and the dreadful department store Santa, who is more like the department store monster!All together, these characters seem to pull it together to try and make the best of what will be an unforgettable Christmas. With a great script and narrating by the writer Jean Shepard (who wrote the novel this was based on) this movie has stood the test of time and lasted of 25 years and is still gaining popularity to people of all ages.Although the premise might seem childish, a boy trying all he can to get what he wants for Christmas, this movie is anything but. Families all over the globe have come to love this movie and make it a tradition to watch it every year on Christmas. Even stations like TBS have dedicated a whole days worth of time slots to show it non stop! Now that is dedication...Director Bob Clark has given us the chance to become little kids again.

Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is pure genius. Its hard to believe a child could deliver such an outstanding performance. He makes the whole movie. My husband favored him as a child so his performance hits close to home for many reasons. But add to that Darren McGavin as the foul-mouthed (although they do \"alter\" his words so he isn't actually saying the words) Dad is pure comic genius. Melinda Dillon as the submissive wife is a good alter ego to the dad.As much as I like the many humorous moments in the film, I think what I like most is that it perfectly captures a simpler time in America. It represents an era that is long gone, when the holidays were less hectic and harried and more traditional. Oh, those were the days! If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely have to.

What's so appealing about the film, too, is the way it makes us feel we're back in the 1940s era, with none of today's materialistic, modern technology touches to spoil a tale of childhood innocence way back then.Peter Billingsley as the boy who wants his Red Ryder rifle for Christmas gives what is probably one of the most natural child performances ever recorded on film. And Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are splendid as his parents, not always sensitive to his needs and sometimes doing foolish things--like forcing him to wear a complete bunny rabbit from his favorite aunt on Christmas Day--or his mother overdressing him in outdoor wear on a snowy day so that he can barely move.All of the scenes involving the playmate bullies are right on target with a nice pay-off when the boy finally stands up to the worst of the lot. There's an hilarious scene at a Chinese restaurant that has the waiters serenading the family before dinner--and the business about the sexy lamp in the window has got to be one of the funniest mishaps in the whole story.Whatever your memories of Christmas are, you're sure to find a glimpse of recognition here in this very clever parody of Christmas past.",

So why does this overly sentimental dash of era-specific holiday cheer hold such a special place in my heart? Why do I still cackle like a fool when I can recite all the punchlines? Why can I relate so easily to its themes and characters? I don't rightly know, but it's all true.As a kid, my sister and I would religiously throw our new pairs of dress socks over one shoulder, aping Ralphie and his brother. I knew the unique endorphin rush of planting myself in front of a favorite evening program; the raw fear of standing up to a bully that had me out-muscled and deeply intimidated; the untamed lawlessness of the playground. As I've grown into middle age, I haven't lost touch with the realities behind those well-loved signature scenes. Instead, I've developed an equally powerful admiration for the adult perspective. Now I appreciate the exhaustive desperation of dinner with a picky eater. The rising urge to spout \"do as I say, not as I do\" without the slightest hint of irony. The amplified magic of giving the best gift of the season and watching stars twinkle in the eyes of its recipient. It delivers all this amid a ninety-minute string of huge laughs, expertly teased and foreshadowed and paid off. There's a lot of meat on this bone, but by the time the on-screen holiday has come and gone, we have nothing left to pick.It's a holiday classic for good reason. Our societal scenery may have changed a little, but the messages and feelings and distinct personalities have basically remained the same. Any other movie, I'd get tired of watching on an annual basis. This one hits my belly like a splash of whisky, all warm and spicy and good. This one feels like home.",

            "content": "I didn't grow up in a bubble. I was exposed to television and movies before I can even remember.Being born in the early 1970's, holiday movies were a tradition in my house. Those movies included \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"White Christmas\". I was later exposed to classics like \"A Christmas Carol\" with the great Alistair Sim and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" with the legendary Jimmy Stewart.With that said, I NEVER recall the release of \"A Christmas Story\" back in 1983. If it had some charm or significance, I don't recall hearing a word about it. The first time I became even AWARE of the existence of the film was when TBS first aired it in 1996 -- FOR 24 CONSECUTIVE HOURS! I sat and tried to watch this movie with an open mind, and it quickly became obvious to me why I'd never heard of this movie until 1996. Apart from Darrin McGavin, there was no redeeming element to this sad, depressing tale that is the poorest representation of a Christmas film that I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.And yet TBS continues its yearly tactic of forcing this overrated, offensive and insulting attempt of a movie on the general public for 24 hours every year (And it appears willing to do so for the REST of the ETERNITY). I've said it before on other movie boards: NO MOVIE deserves this much exposure. Not Casablanca, not Citizen Kane, not the Wizard of Oz. NO MOVIE! I'm sure Jean Shepard is a nice guy, and I guess I SHOULD be a fan of the movie because it's based on HIS experiences as a child growing up in Hammond, Indiana -- just a 10 minute drive from where I grew up.But how does a movie that had very little commercial or critical success become this must-see holiday movie, which has cheapened the classics that have come to define a TRUE holiday movie? It remains a mystery to me.What's even more of a mystery is how film critic Leonard Maltin, whose reviews I generally agree with, would be so duped by recent public appeal of the film (Obviously brought on by TBS's continually yearly tactics) that he would change his rating of the film from 3 1/2 stars to four. And yet he continues to keep The Shawshank Redemption at 2 1/2 stars, despite the fact that public appeal for the movie is GREAT and is the most popular movie on the IMDb! The plot, while based on Shepard's experiences, is TERRIBLY over dramatized (I have a HARD time believing Santa booting children down a slide) and has little charm. It's a painful day-by-day dirge through the depressing life of the Parker family around Christmas time and Ralphie's crusade of convincing EVERYONE that he wants a Red Ryder BB gun as a Christmas present. As far as I'm concerned, NOT getting the gun would have been the ONLY thing to redeem the predictable, contrived plot.Another reason why this movie does not hit home with me is that it lacks a relative message related to Christmas! The essence of Christmas can be defined in the story of redemption (Which movies like A Christmas Carol, Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life beautifully embody). Some might argue receiving a present could be considered a form of redemption, but that would be a pretty SHALLOW example of the word.I guess, in the end, the yearly tactics of TBS have fueled my fire as much as how I just find the movie depressing and offensive. I know many will disagree with my review. But I prefer the aforementioned Christmas Classics, and I'm very happy with that! A Christmas Story, however, remains the most OVERRATED movie EVER!",

When you throw the fact that I'm not even a fan of American 'apple pie' institutions (like Christmas), it was a pretty good bet that I'd hate A Christmas Story...yet strangely, I rather liked it. First of all, I'd like to say that I don't think this is a kid's film at all. Sure, kids may enjoy it; but what A Christmas Story really is, is a film for adults to relive their youth with. Like I said, I don't like Christmas; but I did when I was a kid, and although the story in this film is much more American-friendly (me being British), it's still easy to identify with the central character. The film's main point of interest comes from the fact that it's acted out with a child in the lead, but the narration comes from the same person as an adult, reminiscing on his past. This narration is both very funny, and has a great tendency to make you think back to when you were a kid. The way he explains how such trivial things are important to kids is really well done, and it's obvious that writer Jean Shepherd pays great attention to detail.Christmas films tend to get on my nerves because they often follow a nativity plot line, or follow some kids who find 'the real Santa Claus' or some other such rubbish; but the way that this one follows a plot that is all about why Christmas is so loved (kids, getting presents) makes it original, and also relevant in times of the year other than December. The central character has a lot of depth considering he is just a kid, and that is why A Christmas Story oversteps its Christmas bounds. The entire ensemble cast put in good, and believable performances; and this really helps out the film when it comes to things such as the fantasy sequences. For a fantasy sequence to really work, it needs a certain base in reality; and because of the way it's written and acted, you can really imagine these characters having these fantasies. Director Bob Clark seems to have a bit of thing for Christmas, with both of his highly rated films being set in that period. The other one couldn't be more different from this, however - the slasher picture Black Christmas! Anyway, it doesn't take much for a film to be the best Christmas film I've ever seen; but don't take that as a criticism; for this film is easily it.",

There is no storytelling like that on the radio: with reading, you work with the writer to create worlds, but with radio the writer also acts as a tractor to pull you through those worlds. There is nothing at all like radio narrative: your imagination is unconstrained, but the shape of the narrative thread is wholly out of your control.Garrison's innovation is to interest by opportunistic rambles, where each threaded episode is unresolved and arbitrarily leads to another. This works because we are charmed with the randomness but not unsettled because the settings and characters recur as familiar touchstones. The comfort of the characters and puerile moral offsets the novel narrative construction.But before that, we had a greater craftsman who resembled this only in the episodic constructions. Shepherd's novelty was to ramble but instead of a focus on making the characters and situations familiar (though they were), he focused on the connections. These connections are unlike anything I have experienced in radio or film: they are the kind of switches in subject you make in daydreaming that you cannot retrace or logically understand but which you know constitute who you really are.This is abstract, which is essential for humor, but it is as intimately engaging as you can get, which is why it can be so damned funny.Film merely adds pictures to this mix and takes most of the mechanics away from our much funnier imagination. The kid makes this work as a comedy, but not in the way that Shepherd was strong. And the screenwriter has rearranged things to take away the unlikely connections. I thought this was funny, but if you want genius storytelling, get some old Shepherd tapes.",

A Christmas story is fantastic comedic entertainment with a ton of memorable things including Ralphie's father's lamp, well I don't want to spoil the fun for you. If you haven't ever seen A Christmas story(I hope everyone has but if you haven't speak now) because it's funny, cute, and a classic. Peter Billingsly is still acting today folks, just so you know. Not only is he acting, he's producing films and directing a new film with Vince Vaughn called Couples Retreat. A Christmas story is so funny and it's no surprise that it's a classic. Because it is. I give A Christmas story a huge thumbs up and if you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you do see it. Because it's just so funny.A Christmas story: ****/****",

The same place where I saw such classics as \"Dune\" and \"Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension\". I miss that theatre, somewhat.But, to the film. The child actor who will always be remembered as Messy Marvin from the Hershey's Chocolate Syrup commercials tells us a heartwarming tale of a mid-western suburbia Christmas. The kind of America that was rife with red brick school houses, overbearing adults, large family vehicles with wood panelling (a tradition that would carry over to the family station wagon of the 70s), kids challenging dares to one another, and extended family who think of you as the newborn instead of the older kid you clearly are.It's a kind of familiar Americana for millions and millions of Americans east of the Rockies, and it resonates with certain households on the western seaboard as well (Alaska, Oregon, Washington, California) due to the universal theme of growing up and enduring the child's most favorite holiday of the year; Christmas.In short, it's a good film. Funny, witty, well shot, finely narrated by an adult channeling his youth, and overall just a finely crafted film.I really don't have too much to say about it. It's an excellent holiday piece that most families can probably wrap their heads around. For anyone whose dad thought he knew best in all things, even though he wasn't, but you loved him for it all the same, for anyone who had to endure embarrassment from an aunt or mother, for anyone whose Christmas was a mixture of traditional tree trimmings and suburban familial trials of getting along and an over protective mother, this movie is for you.In fact, even though it focuses on the US from the Atlantic to the Continental Divide, the family theme transcends nearly most cultures who embraced the 20th century and family get togethers. The comedy is good. The story is good. The characters are excellent. And the culmination at the end shows a kind of cross cultural comedy that will hit many a funny bone for those who had their Christmas dinner reservations lost in the shuffle. Remember, it's not Peking Duck, it's Chinese Turkey.Enjoy.",

Our hero, twelve year old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) has to convince his parents (Darren MGavin and Melinda Dillon) that a Red Ryder BB gun would be the most perfect gift he could possibly receive for Christmas.  Therein lies the catalyst for some pretty amazing antics & side splitting events that befall our hero.  No song and dance routines. No heavy MGM schmaltz. Just a simple tale of a twelve year old hoping and wishing and scheming his way into a Red Ryder BB gun makes this movie a real family classic.

Over the years this film has became an American classic upon it's release in 1983 the film was rarely viewed it was limited to many cities, and the masses later caught on to it's joy on cable and TV, as now the film has a 24 hour viewing on Christmas Eve all the way thru Christmas Day. What's not to like about this movie it's kid friendly anyone can watch and think back to being a kid at Christmas the excitement and joy of wanting that special gift no matter if it's an action figure, video game, football, or a special toy as in this case it's a red Ryder rifle for Ralphie! Not only does the film just have a Christmas theme it does a fine job of showing that kids will be kids, just look at the frozen flagpole scene and the fight when Ralph stands up to the bully! Everything is just perfect from the acting, script, and setting it all came together on this film. This started from the works of Jean Shepherd who was a narrator, radio voice and novelist and \"A Christmas Story\" was not a full length novel, but a collection of short essays that was greatly put together into one big movie! The setting is perfect for a holiday movie 1940's Indiana and the snow covered streets are real, no fake snow making this movie even more true, this was 1983 well before the special effects craze, so this film had plenty of realism scene wise. The screenplay and direction is well done by Bob Clark from Porky's fame as the slapstick fun and trueness combine for a great movie. The acting is top notch too as nobody could have done it better than Peter Billingsley as nine-year-old Ralphie whose never ending dream is to get a Christmas gift of a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action Air Rifle. Also Ralphie's parents are played perfect by the classy Melinda Dillon and the now late Darren McGavin a legend who saw it all during his acting days. Both are gruff and tough, but that's just concerned love in fact it reminds me some of my mom and dad as I was growing up. Remember the fear was \"you'll shoot your eye out!\" This film has a slew of calamities from snowsuit stiffness, to listening to little orphan on radio, to a cruel Santa. In the end a happy ending occurs on Christmas morning with Ralph Parker, it just brings back the kid in you so well. What more can I say just everything works together well in this movie, it's a movie that will never get old because of it's traditional theme. \"A Christmas Story\" is without a doubt the best Christmas film ever, and I know most would agree.",

            "content": "Since it came out in 1983, \"A Christmas Story\" has become a staple for viewing by many people during the holidays. It's a story told through the eyes of a nine-year-old boy, Ralphie Parker. The plot comes from a collection of stories by Jean Parker Shepherd, \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash.\" The semi-autobiographic tales recount his growing up in a Midwestern town during the depression. Shepherd also worked on the screenplay and narrated the movie. The cast was perfect for this story. Darren McGavin plays his dad, \"the Old Man\" Parker. Melinda Dillon plays his mother. Peter Billingsly plays Ralphie and Ian Petrella plays his younger brother, Randy. Scott Schwartz plays Shepherd's long-time boyhood friend, Flick. He's the kid who sticks his tongue on the flagpole in winter on a triple double-dog dare. The movie is a nice look at childhood in 1930s America away from the big cities. We see the humorous efforts a young boy would take to get his Christmas wishes known. We see an old standard treatment for boys, especially, when they used bad language \u2013 tasting of the soap bar. We see the culture of kids \u2013 the dares, double-dares and double-dog dares for challenges. There's the usual school or neighborhood bully, and we catch Ralphie in a couple of lies. One of the funniest scenes is his dad's winning of a lamp from a newspaper contest he entered. It's one of the most grotesque things, the shape of a woman's leg. It almost looks like a leg from a mannequin. Why anyone would make a lamp out of such a thing is beyond me. But, Ralphie's \"Old Man\" loved it. I imagine the overwhelming majority of viewers sided with Ralphie's mom when she \"accidentally\" broke the lamp. After more than 30 years, this movie may be losing some appeal. It's not in the vein of \"A Christmas Carol,\" or other films that are classics. Still, I keep it in my collection as an amusing story to share and movie to break out over the Christmas season.",

            "content": "Jean Shepherd was a brilliant humorist whose stories could ring nostalgic for someone who didn't even live in the era he often wrote about. His blend of sentimental nostalgia and satire was much like a combination of Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor. Shepherd had been in radio for many years and brought his stories that he narrated with his wonderful voice to television in the 70's in the PBS series Jean Shepherd's America and Shepherd's Pie. I loved watching these shows and the American Playhouse specials in the 70's and 80's that also featured Shepherd's alter-ego Ralph and his parents in The Star Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski, Ollie Hopnoodles Haven of Bliss, the Phantom of the open Hearth and The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disaster. This film is based from a collection of essays he published in the 1966 novel In god We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. Shepherd was born in 1921 and grew up in Hammond, Indiana. In the book the town is called Hohman, Indiana and takes place during the depression years. The movie moves the time period up a decade to the early 1940's pre-WWII America. Shepherd wrote the screenplay along with his wife Leigh Brown and director Bob Clark and Shepherd, like his television shows, narrates the film. It's the story of Ralphie and his family during the Christmas season. Ralphie wants a B.B gun, he finds disillusion in his decoder ring, his father wins a lamp that was probably designed for a brothel and not a family home but the old man cherishes it as if it's from Tiffany. Ralphie has a little brother he has to look after and a wholesome mother. It's not an exciting story but it's so charming and such a slice of Americana that it was destined to become a Christmas classic. It's not a teary, warm and tender typical spirit of Christmas tale but a steady paced comedy of sentimental satire. Bob Clark who had a very uneven career as a director with a couple of good films in Murder by Decree and Black Christmas and the very popular Porky's is the film's director. He directed a lot of forgettable films in his career and only had one other film of note in Turk 182 after he directed this but he came out with an excellent film here. I hadn't even heard of this when it came out in the theaters but it went quickly to television and I first saw it maybe two years after it came out. When I finished watching it it seemed like I had seen an old movie that I had seen many times before. It did go on to become a Christmas classic and I have seen it many times. I would give it a 10.",

I wonder when the last time they saw it and paid attention was. This movie sits atop a lofty reputation, which is all that it has in its favor. What is the case for this being a good film?No character is likable. In any scene when the main character is with one of his friends from school, that scene ends with one of them being abandoned by their \"friends\" to a horrible fate of some kind alone, bullies, frozen tongues, etc.The younger brother lives under the sink and is only able to eat his food when his mom tells him to act like a pig, which he does for a really, really long time (editing, anyone?)in disgusting, glorious detail. Probably that kid grows up to be a serial killer. Mom pulls little Ralphie off a kid whose nose he has just broken, and without waiting to find out what happened, leaves the other kid there lying in the snow, bleeding. Covered in blood. Really, the blood is all over his face.Dad is a more endearing character because he is bumbling and likes to drop the f-bomb around his little kids at home while he leaves the parenting to mom. And now I will anticipate a response in the defense: \"but that's how things were.\" I hope life at the time was better. This movie celebrates mediocrity. The whole goal of it is to connect to Americans because \"these things really happened to people.\" There were bullies! There were teachers, and -GASP- pranks! There were trips to the shopping mall! Creepy elves and Santas! Dorky kids who constantly wore repulsive sweaters! Dogs stole the turkey! STOP THE PRESSES. THERE WERE PINK BUNNY SUITS.Is that really funny? No episode or moment of the movie is really any more than mediocre, the humor is pedestrian at its best moments, and the movie just isn't ever remotely interesting.I didn't know whether to be more disturbed by Ralphie's fantasy about shooting imaginary black people trying to rob his house or by the \"amusement\" created by Chinese people trying to speak English; perhaps in the end it was the simple fact that all of the terrible stock characters and pedestrian humor and mediocrity and cheesy voice-overs and all the rest of it were structured around a boy's desire to get a gun for Christmas.

Now I finally have watched it with BluRay calibre, what can I say? It is a damn good family boon, a bona-fide Christmas film outshines all its contemporary duds. Set in 1940s, an ordinary American family, Ralphie is a schoolboy lives with his parents and a younger brother Randy, all he wants for the approaching Christmas is a BB gun which every adult considers it is dangerous since it will shoot your eyes out! (An utter antithesis of what I wanted when I was that age, of course, not for Christmas, for Spring Festival instead). So the film minutely recollects what has happened during this unforgettable Yuletide by a congenial voice-over from Ralphie in his adulthood, the mischiefs at the school and at home, all from Ralphie's viewpoint, which perfectly aligns with the whimsical nature of a kid's chimera. Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin makes such a dynamic on screen duo as the cool mother and the naff father (McGavin is too old to be their old man, a grandfather should be more appropriate though). What happens in the family (a piggy-imitation incentive on the dining table, the leg-shape lamp accident, the icicle misconduct, and the f-word punishment etc.) radiates great affinity towards its viewers since it is not overtly soliciting for instant laughters, rather it stays with its audiences and brings ripple effects to everyone's own memory of their most memorable holidays in childhood. Peter Billingsley, a bespectacled precocious over-thinker, does offset the abundance of epidemic smart-alecks among recent child-performances. Tedde Moore, as Ralphie's schoolteacher, whose deadpan sanctimoniousness satires the traumatizing condescendence on the nose, personally I have met quite a few in my school days. Other skits such as Peter and the wolf parody, the impatient Santa Claus with his fiendish elves in the mall, and the tongue-stuck-on-the-ice prank, all goes well without hyperbole. Bob Clark may not be a great filmmaker, and A Christmas STORY doesn't possess any unique talking point among cinephiles, but with a retrospective nostalgia, it certainly occupies a snug spot among many people's guilty-pleasure bracket.",

            "content": "\"Little Ralphie wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas.\" That was the typical printed plot description for this fatuous holiday humbug, when it first began to reproduce itself all over cable television, like some loathsome Christmas virus. It didn't sound very promising the first thousand times I encountered it, and without ever having laid eyes on the movie, I was already wishing little Ralphie a hod of Christmas coal under his tree. Since then, I have seen enough of it to know that I can't stand more than five minutes of it at a single sitting, even after several glasses of wine. That it has supposedly achieved such widespread and enduring popularity is, to me, only one more sad bit of evidence of a nation in decline. Possibly it might have some merit as a darkly satirical view of the sort of attitudes that have led to this decline, but I doubt that's what the producers had in mind. Even more problematical is why Ted Turner is so obsessed with this piece of mindless drivel that he feels compelled to run it twelve times in a row every Christmas. What's it supposed to be? A new holiday tradition, perhaps? The Twelve Curses of King Tut's Christmas? Or has he just got the damn thing crammed full of subliminals?By contrast, \"A Christmas Carol\" has unquestionably earned its place as a Christmas classic and a holiday tradition, even in an age when many people are employed under such wretched conditions that Mr. Scrooge begins to look like a benevolent boss before his celebrated transformation. Indeed, if Bob Cratchit lived in America today, and were imprudent enough to give Scrooge his notice, by the time he got his desk cleaned out and was ready to leave, he would have to fight his way through the throng of burger flippers, taco stuffers and Wal-Mart associates waiting outside the counting house to apply for his job. But I digress. Sorry. This movie has that effect. It makes one want to digress. It makes the mind wander and the hand reach for the remote.Other reviewers have found it incongruous that a nine-year-old boy would still believe in Santa Claus. That point I dispute. This movie was a product of the 1980's. Ronald Reagan was president, and judging from his economic policies, he never stopped believing in Santa Claus. Possibly little Ralphie never did, either. He might have grown up to be a stockbroker, a real estate speculator or a commodities trader. He might have even grown up to be Ted Turner.",

You can see where this is going very fast in A Christmas Story. One of the worst, if not the worst Christmas film I have ever seen.I cannot believe people call this a \"Classic\" as this movie is so terrible I actually felt like burning this movie in a fireplace. It makes me so mad that I feel people who like this movie should get coal in their stockings.The movie goes from being absolutely ridiculous and plain scary with its bad cinematography to having the most offensive message in A Christmas movie ever. Ill get to that later. But for now, let me tell you whats wrong with this movie.First off, I can't stand the narrator of this movie. I don't care if this is a \"True Story\" about him I just want to watch a regular Christmas film. Even if they need a narrator I would cast someone better to do the Voice Over. There is this kid named Ralphie (He is a cute kid, but being a cute kid doesn't mean not trying to act at all) who wants this gun for Christmas as I said before but everyone is like NO so he tries to do whatever he can to convince them.This movie must of inspired The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies for its mean spirited scenes like for example there is this one scene where these idiots tell this innocent kid to put his tongue on a frozen pole and it obviously gets stuck. In fact, he has to get some of it removed. This scene is so mean.Not to mention most of the characters are also cruel. I feel like the parents of this movie are going to get divorced in one scene but don't. There is one cruel scene where a mother forces his son to put on a bunny costume. If I were a parent I would never force my son or daughter to put something on that they don't like. I would just take it back to the store and get a refund.Even in one scene, A KID SAYS HIS DAD WANTS TO KILL HIM! What kind of entertainment is this?! Kids thinking they are going to get their heads cut off organs removed!? Who wrote this? A Mad man? A Serial Killer? Are they saying that HEY KIDS YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO KILL YOU? This made me furious.Even The Kid Ralphie doesn't deserve anything for Christmas. He swears and beats up a kid and lies! But guess what? HE GETS THE FRIGGN GUN ANYWAYS! Why is this mean spirited message in this movie? If you're bad you get what you want? I don't care if this film takes place in the 1950's where beating up bullies were brave. This kid is a brat! He is evil! He doesn't deserve anything.The movie is so stupid and ridiculous. There is one scene where I thought there was going to be a leg lamp. THERE WAS! I didn't even look at the poster or what happened! I just guessed it and my prediction was right! Leg Lamps? Mean Santa Claus? Parents Putting Soap In Their Mouthes? THIS IS COMPLETELY DUMB! Even my Mom Agrees with me that this movie is very bad. This is a warning to all Christmas Movie fans out there. If you are going to watch good holiday movies or specials then I suggest you watch A Charlie Brown Christmas, Garfield's Christmas Special, Elf and Its A Wonderful Life and Arthur Christmas. Those are movies and specials worth watching.But you know what might be worse then this movie? A SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE! 39/100 D+",

            "content": "Without a doubt my favorite Christmas film, and in my top 20, this film is timeless and enduring to anybody who was a kid, which is everybody. Both kids and adults will definitely get an inspirational and tremendous Christmas story never to be forgotten.This film gains nonstop praise from critics, and everybody else. There is no denying its one of the best films ever made. Very few people I know discredit this film because they either don't get it, or find it boring, or are too critical about it. I feel so sorry for whoever doesn't get this film. What's not to get, it perfectly covers our childhood, not just children in the 1940s, children in general! And shut up about it dragging, being boring, or not having the best editing, (which I find not true anyway) like and appreciate the film for what it is, which is a timeless classic that shows us the feelings and emotions we dealt with as children.But everything about it is great. The characters are all lovable, and you can relate to just about everyone of them. That's probably the best part about this film, is relating to the characters, thinking what they're thinking. Everything else down to the bone is just brilliant. But the point isn't being a good film, (even though it is) the point is relating us and feeling toward our childhoods as of now, and as of adults.Simply timeless! Nothing left to say that needs to be said. No matter who out there thinks this movie is stupid, (which I don't know anybody of) this film will always live on in our hearts forever. Its an instant classic that's loved by just about everybody, and is impossible to be hated on!.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed first seeing this movie as a kid with my dad. We just happened to stumble upon it one day. Upon subsequent viewings, I still enjoyed this classic. Now they overplay it a bit, I still like to catch bits and pieces of it during the holiday season as you really do not have to see the movie from start to finish to enjoy it. In fact, I could probably not tell you the movie from start to end in correct order. I know the beginning and end, however, the middle is scrambled. The story is simple enough to summon up, a boy is experiencing a typical Christmas season, this year the boy really wants to get a BB gun for Christmas. His mother is firmly against this, the movie is basically the boy going through the typical stuff during the holiday season and doing things to try desperately to get a red Ryder BB gun. He gets to fight the local bully, write an essay on what he would like for Xmas and even tries to tell Santa himself what he most desires. His family consists of an eccentric mom and dad and a little brother who has to dress in many layers of clothes for school. The movie is funny and charming and is rather simple. It features many likable characters and cute situations. It also does not get to sentimental for a holiday movie, most of them have some sort of message or overly sentimental parts. This one stays light hearted and funny throughout.",

            "content": "Intro:\nWhy do people like this film? There are so many better Christmas films. Even though I am not a huge fan of Christmas, I still love It's a Wonderful and other great Christmas movies. A Christmas Story has terrible messages, and completely missed the point of Christmas, being a film about nothing but commercialism.Why I Hate It:\nThe film centers around a kid, named Ralphie, who asked for a gun for Christmas. Completely unrelatable and random events happen in between the time of him asking the gun and him getting it.My major problems with the story lie in the fact that narrator has to explain the odvious and never shut up. I'm not completely against narration in film, but it needs a purpose other than explaining the movie, and treating the audience like idiots. A good example of a show that uses narration well, is Dexter.Now, I know I'm comparing a kid's film, to an adult show that has nothing to do with it. But I'm trying to make a point. Dexter uses narration not to tell us what's happening, but to get insight into Dexter's messed up psyche. And see the way he sees the world. Not to explain what's happening on screen. And Christmas Story had no excuse. It's not a movie for the blind, so what's the point?Also, things just happen for no reason. The comedy isn't at all funny. I mean, often jokes are ruined by the presence of the narrator. Such as, when Ralphie says the \"F\" word. Instead of having him say \"fudge\", why not have him say the actual \"F\" word? I know he's a kid, and this is PG film. But back then, they could get away with it. I mean, look at kids movies back then, they said and did all kinds of things.Also, what's do charming about this film? Tell me. Is it the message of commercialism? Because I don't. Ralphie starts out as a spoiled brat in the beginning, and by the end, he's still a spoiled brat. He went through zero change.Conclusion:\nI can ramble on all day about how this film doesn't understand the meaning of Christmas. Now, as I mentioned before, I am not a fan of Christmas. I think it's a holiday with a nice meaning, that turned itself into nothing but commercialism. And once you learn the history of it being a pagan holiday, you just have a new perspective on it.But to conclude, A Christmas Story is a horrible movie. A film that I don't understand the love for. What else can I say? Except, I don't get it.",

            "content": "It's a bit silly and simplistic, but there is something that I like about these older films, a naive charm that the new ones are missing. I like the nostalgia and I can see that it would mean even more to American men born in the 40's and 50's able to recognise their own past. I think perhaps that it loses a bit in translation to the other side of the pond here, but it's got that 'It' (1990) and 'Stand By Me' (1986) vibe about it. That element that reminds us of an easier time, when childhood was all about what Father Christmas would bring or escaping the bullies and less about computer games and Twitter. When kids didn't have to worry about anything except curfew (And the odd evil clown).I also like the narration by the writer of the original book that the film is based on, it gives it an authenticity and you can feel that Peter Billingsley's character Ralphie, would grow up to become him.He's actually a good little actor and it's a surprise to see that he didn't do much more, in front of the camera at least.The Dad was simultaneously funny and annoying, but other than that it's not a bad film.If only kids could still be kids like this, I'm sure that they'd have more fun.621.95/1000.",

His brother Randy is ever worse, whining and complaining non-stop. The kids at school also whine which was torture to listen to.This story makes absolutely no sense, why is Ralph wanting a BB gun. Of course times were different in the 1940s. But I was born in the 1980s so I don't understand this movie and the setting.So Raphie has daydreams of shooting robbers, going blind with a cane, getting an A+ in class but gets a C+ instead. Okay.Raphie uses profanity including the word Fudge. Also I didn't like the scene where the kid sticks his tongue on a pole. I wasn't even laughing and I thought it was very painful and torture to watch. I didn't like it they forced Ralphie to wear a pink bunny suit which bothered me a lot.Raphie gets attacked by school bullies and then finally retaliates against them which scared me very badly. The worst part about this movie was everybody telling him \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" including the creepy Santa Claus, Seriously just show him how to use the BB gun safely.The only good scenes in the movie is Raphie's dad fixing the furnace himself yelling and swearing and fixing the flat tire. I find it weird his dad buys a sexy leg lamp but whatever.To the TV channel companies, if you're reading my review please take this crummy Christmas movie off the air, I don't want it on TV anymore. Show better Christmas movies. Speaking of which.There are much better Christmas movies to watch. including It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol, Miracle on 34th Street both the original 1947 and the 1993 remake. Also watch Home Alone 1,2,3. Also Santa Clause by Tim Allen was funny. Also Jingle All the Way 1 and 2 was funny.The sequel to A Christmas Story 2 was not as bad as the first movie. Watch that movie sequel instead and forget that this original movie ever existed. Or better yet watch \"Santa Claus conquers the martians\".",

I think I'm sinking pretty low.I've always loved A Christmas Story. It was always one of my all-time favorites. It was always easily my favorite Christmas film. I had the perfect amount of comedy, kid-related situations, and adult humor. This movie also contains some of the most memorable scenes in film in my opinion. The Bumpass hounds, the tongue stuck to the flag pole, the bunny suit, and plenty more. It is also of course very funny.A young boy named Ralphie wants a Red Ryder Bee-Bee Gun. Everybody, his mother, his teacher, Santa, reply with the same answer. You'll shoot your eye out. Ralphie is also dealing with some bullies. He beats the bullies up. Yes, he beats them up. Anyway, finally, on Christmas his father gives him a Red Ryder Bee-Bee Gun, despite Ralphie's mother's objections. Ralphie takes the gun outside and he hurts himself. He makes up an excuse so his mother want take the gun away. In the end, the Bumpass hounds eat the Christmas turkey and the family eats at a Chinese restaurant.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas film. If you love Christmas comedies, like Christmas Vacation, and more, you'll absolutely won't be disappointed at this film. I'd recommend this film to any fan of Christmas film, and Christmas in general. My favorite scene is by far when they are going to see Santa and there is that weird kid with goggles and Santa is plain disturbing.

            "content": "why this movie is so acclaimed by the voters on iMDB. A friend bought me the tape of this movie for Christmas, and I had never seen it. I just got around to watching it, and it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do like good Christmas movies, however - The Bishop's Wife and the recent remake, The Preacher's Wife immediately come to mind - but this is nowhere near those.The ONLY redeeming value in this movie is Melinda Dillon's performance - she is always good - and she acts everyone off the screen. My complaints are numerous, but most importantly, this movie has NO PLOT and NO CONFLICT! There is nothing to keep you interested - I want my hour and a half back! What a waste of celluloid. This movie is sickenly sweet without EARNING the right to that sweetness - like \"Home Alone\" and others in the same genre do.The scene where the kid has his mouth \"washed out with soap\" is a kick in the face to anyone who ever had this done for real. Pardon me, but sticking a bar of soap in the kid's mouth isn't quite cutting it. Also the scene where the kid is bullied and teased is also quite tame compared to the real thing. Movies like this really undermine the struggles of those people who had REAL problems as children.The parents are entirely too old to have children that young, though most movies back in the 30's and 40's DID have parents that were too old. The main character is 9 years old but still believes in Santa Claus?Again I'm back to the lack of conflict. Let's see, the kid wants a certain toy for Christmas and may or may not get it. That ranks right up there with \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" - sorry for the sarcasm. Oh yes, and there's a scene where the husband gets a lamp that the wife doesn't like.\nBottom line - this stinker doesn't deserve the 2 out of 10 rating I gave it and I'm getting rid of it on eBay as soon as I can.",

I watched it again years later when it became a regular on TNT during the holiday season. I came to appreciate it more and it's now one of the most hilarious and beloved movies I've seen; it's a story about nine year-old Ralphie in 1940s Indiana, who is on a mission to get a BB gun for Christmas.Peter Billingsley did a wonderful job portraying Ralphie; his character occasionally displays this goofy, yet laughable look. His quest to get his ultimate Christmas gift-a Red Ryder Air Rifle, is a treat. From his hints to his parents and ultimately asking an off-the-wall Santa Claus for the gift is just timeless fun. Ian Petrella did great as Ralphie's brother Randy. I like his portrayal that he even as a little kid helps do chores like making his own bed and cleaning up the Christmas wrappings after opening. Melinda Dillon as Mrs. Parker is just zany and Darren McGavin as Mr. Parker is downright hilarious. With his constant huffing and gruffing to his constant wisecracks, this should be McGavin's signature role. I love the part when he says the word \"FRA-GIL-LE\" on the leg lamp carton. The tongue-on-flagpole, the soap-feeding, the Easter Bunny outfit, and the Chinese restaurant scenes are just a few moments that mixes in this great comedy. There is never a dull moment in this film; it will have you laughing from beginning to end and will have you still feel the spirit of Christmas.

One of the greatest things about this movie is that the father, who is constantly busy throughout this film whether it's battling the furnace or trying to get his car to start or any other number of task that he becomes occupied with, has very little dialog with Ralphie. Yet it is the father who in the end gets him his BB gun, he knew all along what Ralphie wanted although he never was told directly what it was he wanted. When reading reviews for this movie I am surprised that this has been overlooked. The final scene with the Father and Mother just sitting down watching it snow was the only time in the movie they showed affection for each other, not because they didn't care for one another but because like in real life they were just too busy. Finally when the children go to sleep they have their quite sentimental moment together and it was more believable than any scene in any romantic movie that has ever been made. A Christmas Story's final line sums up how truly happy Ralphie is now he has his Christmas wish. \"Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue steel beauty. The greatest Christmas gift I had ever received, or would ever receive. Gradually, I drifted off to sleep, pinging ducks on the wing and getting off spectacular hip shots.\"",

            "content": "Almost every classic Christmas movie presents ideas like family, goodwill to all and other fine things that add to our enjoyment of the season. This movie has none of those elements. It gives us a father who's a bungling idiot, his simpering, vapid but long-suffering wife, and their spoiled children. They're all clamoring for the material things they want. We are supposed to find this, and their ongoing chaos and failures, funny. By the end of the film, the main character (Ralphie) has realized that the true meaning of Christmas is what? Shooting things with his new BB gun. There's none of the nostalgic holiday spirit we used to love, nor is there any offering of how genuine, non-materialistic holiday spirit can help bring hope and joy to this world that seems to be spiraling more and more out of control. While some readers are sure to dismiss my statements here as old-fashioned or overly critical, I wonder what they can suggest that might help bring a little more heart or joy into people's lives. It's certainly not this movie.",

            "content": "I first heard of this film when the Nostalgia Critic placed this at no. 1 on his Top 12 Christmas Specials and while I didn't think a great deal of it apart from the part where Flick gets his tongue stuck on a frozen lamppost, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did because its fine mixture of amusing, touching and dark moments entertained me albeit its somewhat slow pace and parts I felt were incomplete, especially when Ralphie cries to his mother after having beaten up the bully but doesn't tell her he's a bully. The musical score is mostly nostalgic with some hints of whimsy and I liked the arrangements of 'Deck The Halls' and 'We Wish You A Merry Christmas' while the snowy scenery is stunning. The interior sets ranged from Ralphie's family household being true to the 1940s to the department store being beautiful whether on the inside or in the display window. Ralphie is a sweet and ambitious character in terms of wanting a BB gun for Christmas who has his defiant moments such as needing to have his mouth washed out with soap, beating up the school bully and refusing to wear the pink rabbit suit his aunt bought him for Christmas (although it was hilarious when he wore it) I enjoyed watching his imagination sequences such as the pixilation-style one of him trying to defeat robbers with his BB gun while wearing a glittery cowboy suit that made him look like a glammed-up Milkybar Kid, his teacher marking his class's assignments and giving him an A+ (he really gets a C+) and himself becoming blind due to soap poisoning. There were other moments that stood out such as Ralphie trying to crack his code in the bathroom when Randy needed to go, the dogs running in the house to eat all the turkey and the family going to a Chinese restaurant for Christmas dinner. The side characters were hyper (Randy in a sense and Flick), pushy (the female elf), a tad creepy (Santa), strict (Ralphie's teacher and parents), funny (the Chinese restaurant staff) or reassuring (Ralphie's mother). I liked Adult Ralphie's engaging narration and some of the dialogue, especially the memorable line \"You'll Shoot Your Eyes Out.\" The darkest moments consisted of a boy being slapped over the phone for apparently teaching Ralphie a profanity and the bully's nose bleeding when Ralphie hits him.Overall this is an underrated and heartwarming Christmas gem that has its fine blend of touching, amusing and gritty moments. 8.5/10 to round up to IMDb's 9/10 rating.",

Shot as an autobiographical 'memory' film, with a voiceover by Jean Shepherd, the story recounts young Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley) 9th Christmas, sometime around 1940. The stories are fun, mostly nice with just a touch of naughty, and include vignettes about the last days of school before holidays, bullies, tongues and cold flagpoles, visiting the department store Santa, and of course, Christmas morning.

I first saw bits and pieces of it on TV and guessed that it wasn't great, that it was probably just an average film. When I finally got to see the whole thing, I was disappointed. I found myself not caring for or about the characters, and most of the parts annoyed me. Someone else already mentioned it, but I didn't feel as though the narration sounded as though it could possibly be an elder Ralph Parker speaking. The plot, yes, is the 9-year-old's dream of getting a BB-gun as his ideal Christmas gift, though neither of his parents seem keen on giving it to him. Even his teacher leaves the same pathetic line as his parents quote, on his report on what he wants his gift to be: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" Somehow I don't think that would convince any young kid I know to change gift choices, so obviously it doesn't work on Ralph. He even begs Santa for it. I felt that this was yet another holiday movie excluding what the holidays really were about, but instead of having a cute substitute where the toys are shown alive when left alone, or how the family pulls together at the ideal time of year for it, this movie hints that this could be why the family is so dysfunctional...not that religion is ever mentioned as a solution for them. The subplots of the movie include: Ralph's loathing at receiving an pink EASTER BUNNY-type outfit from an aunt who treats him like a 4-year-old female; the parents' despair and disgust of the younger brother's finicky eating; their fighting when the mother accidentally breaks the father's award (a lamp she loathes); Ralph using the world's worst curse word then claiming he heard it from a fellow student instead of his father; 1 of his friends sticking his tongue to a frozen pole on a dare; and his finally losing his temper on the local bully who terrorizes him daily. Not even the scenes of the neighbors' dogs eating the holiday dinner and the family having to suffer through a badly-sung version of \"Deck the Halls\" in public, or the irony of the message Ralph worked so hard to decode - an advertisement - amused me. I hid my disappointment when I received this movie as a (random, not holiday) gift a few years after seeing it, but I've never watched it since. What they say about this movie is true - it will make you feel better about your family...but it will do it in an ironic way by making you grateful that your family is nothing like the Parkers. I wouldn't recommend this unless you need reassurance on that. If the tag-line \"Peace, harmony, comfort and joy...Maybe next year\" isn't a warning to you, read this and save yourself a few bad hours.",

Some great moments of hilarity and some great moments of heartfelt emotion. It may not be the deepest, most involved story ever told but it's certainly an enjoyable one.A Christmas Story is set in 1940s Indiana, centered around young Ralphie Parker's quest for the \"Holy Grail\" of Christmas presents, a Daisy Red Rider BB gun. But how can he possibly hope to receive this gift when Mom is convinced that \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" Our Ralphie, played in a spot-on perfect performance by Peter Billingsley, will not be deterred, and he schemes and plots and then schemes and plots some more. Along the way we get some amusing peeks into Ralphie's imagination as he fantasizes about just how he'll get that gun and what he'll do with it once he has it. And that's about it for plot. Ralphie wants a gun, that's it. But there is so much more to this movie than that. There are all those moments, little slices of life which may not really have anything at all to do with the plot but which always succeed in bringing a smile to your face. If you've seen the film you know the moments...the triple dog dare, Ralphie's father's \"major award\", Ralphie saying THAT word, a rather unique rendition of \"Deck The Halls\"...priceless moments all and those listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. And when things finally wrap up you realize this movie wasn't just about a BB gun after all. It's a movie about feeling, about memories, about an innocent childhood to which we all kind of wish we could return. Yes, this is a film which is rightfully a holiday treasure.",

After almost 30 years later, its frequent showings on TV continue to be a tradition; people can continue to relate to it, and be charmed, touched, and frequently laugh heartily.Humourist Jean Shepherd, who co-adapted his book \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\" with Leigh Brown and director / co-producer Bob Clark, takes a nostalgic look at his childhood in 1940's era Midwest America, when he, as a nine year old boy, coveted what he considered to be the ultimate Christmas present - The Red Ryder 200 Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle, and resorts to any and all methods to get this to happen.Shepherd himself narrates (and makes an uncredited on screen appearance as an irate department store customer) and Peter Billingsley wonderfully, memorably portrays his younger incarnation. Billingsley's own dialogue mixes well with Shepherd's uproarious, deliberately florid adult recollections. Part of what makes it so funny is the way that he recalls viewing (and exaggerating) everything as a child, right down to his frequent fantasies - being taunted with the now legendary \"You'll shoot your eyes out\" refrain, visualizing the cruel fate being inflicted upon him for the classic \"soap in the mouth\" punishment, or imagining rescuing his family from the nefarious Black Bart and gang. Highly impressive period recreation mix with lovely music (by Carl Zittrer and Paul Zaza) and the delightful evocation of all things Christmas. Highlight sequences include the Scut Farkas Affair, referring to the swaggering bully with the yellow eyes, the visit with a department store Santa (the priceless Jeff Gillen), the battle over the sexiest / tackiest lamp committed to celluloid, and the introduction of \"Chinese Christmas\" to the family.Very nice supporting performances by the hilarious Darren 'Carl Kolchak' McGavin as furnace fighting, profanity spewing Old Man and under-rated Melinda Dillon as the loving mother are also a big, big plus. I can actually remember being introduced to this movie, myself, as a child when we were treated to a viewing in school and being quizzed about it afterwards, which wasn't a bad way at all to test how well we could pay attention to details. Even now, as an adult, it hasn't lost its appeal for me, and it can continue to play to new generations for years to come without losing anything. It's an amazing, complete counterpoint to Clark's earlier, far creepier Christmas outing, \"Black Christmas\", which just goes to show how versatile the late director could be. It definitely ranks as another of his career highlights.10 out of 10.",

But everything and everyone seem to be against him, like it so often seems when you're a child.The story itself isn't that complicated, but what really makes this a Christmas classic is how they capture the essence of Christmas, as well as childhood in general. The whole film is narrated by an adult Ralphie, describing his own reactions and thoughts from the point of view of an adult, which makes all the difference. Sure, you probably weren't chased from school to home by bullies every single day, but when you're trying to remember your childhood, it sure seems that way. And thus, whenever there's a scene of Ralphie getting out of school, there's the bully to chase him back home.And the Christmas stuff also works really well. It brings you right back to those days of your childhood when you went with your parents to find a tree, or dreamed about the perfect gift, or woke up uncharacteristically early to unwrap your presents. It's full of little touches, and not just from the children's perspective. I love the scene where the parents simply sit down and enjoy the lights and atmosphere of the tree. For me that sums up Christmas perfectly.The parents are also great characters in general. There's a scene where the mother finds Ralphie's younger brother hiding in a cupboard because he's upset. She asks him if he's okay, gives him a sip to drink and leaves him there, knowing that it brings him comfort. What a great moment, and not one you'd expect at all, but which makes perfect sense.What a great film. Yeah, it's overly cheesy and the plot is pretty thin when thought objectively, but it's just about perfect around Christmas. See it come next December if you haven't already.",

It seems as though it was stapled a classic in 1983 and ever since it has become a faux paus to call the film out for just not being that good. One of the main points of the plot is to tell a story of decades past, in which it actually succeeds. Unfortunately, the only message received from such a plot line is that I should be thankful I was born much later than when this film is set in. With the plot only concerning a 1940s family's Christmas, it becomes highly questionable who can realistically enjoy the movie. If the point is to reminisce on a childhood of getting physically tortured as punishment or bullied for no apparent reason, then it might make sense. To be more critically fair, the plot is only a mixture of every possible childhood clich\u00e9, making the story a reminder of how annoying both parents and children can be. Simply, none of the characters are quite likable, between highly questionable parenting and children being children. Comedically there are some truly funny moments, but between the countless repetition of jokes and some bad writing, the feature gets old quick and the hilarity remaining cannot save the boring quality to much of what occurs. The few sweet moments that do happen are nicely written and performed, but ultimately don't feel like a payoff to anything. There's truly no message to what happens, with its lacking character development and often bad dialogue. The narration is altogether only a disservice to the plot, often explaining things not needing explanation. Still, acting is decent, likely being a highlight of the film.

Firstly, I wondered why the mother looked like she'd just stepped out of an 80s MTV video with her bushy permed hair (this was supposed to be set in 1940). Secondly, the humour was forced and predictable and not in the least bit funny, not even eliciting a faint smile.Moreover, the characters were stereotypical and unoriginal and so were the situations they found themselves in. Finally, the message it seemed to convey was that Christmas is a commercial entity, and it's satisfying these seasonal desires that counts.All In all, although the Seasonal sets and scenes were Christmassy enough, I wasn't convinced by the characters, the humour, the dialogue, situations, or indeed the time setting and the film wouldn't get near my top 20 Christmas movies, so by that criteria, I couldn't really recommend it unless you want to see what all the fanfare is about for yourself.",

Though my own childhood occurred a decade after the setting for \"A Christmas Story\", there's no mistaking the angst of a nine year old's condition awaiting the hallowed day, wondering whether a favorite gift would be waiting under the tree. The appeal of the film is timeless in it's own way, and funny in it's depiction of the foibles of youth. At about Ralphie's age, my own son tested the integrity of the old tongue on the pole trick, fortunately to no serious outcome as the rest of the family was watching from inside the house during Christmas dessert. Grandpa to the rescue with a cup of warm water, thereby saving the fire department an inconvenient trip down the road.Attempting to answer the question of whether Santa Claus is real or not would probably have been too overt a theme for the picture, so the movie's take on the loss of youthful innocence is handled a bit differently. That Ovaltine scene when Ralphie deciphers the radio message with his Little Orphan Annie secret decoder pin is one of the best put downs ever of the season's crass commercialism.All of the story's little vignettes work in capturing the innocence and wonder of a simpler era, from standing up to the neighborhood bully to the 'shoot your eye out' mentality of over anxious mother hens with their precocious children. Somehow I managed to sidestep the taste testing effects of Lux, Palmolive and Lifebuoy, but most of the rest of the picture evoked the fond memories of a childhood growing up in a small town with the kind of issues faced by Ralphie and his buddies. I even remember a friend's first use of the 'F' word, mispronouncing it in an attempt to make it sound less vulgar and offensive than it was.Just recently, I read about the renovation and opening of the original Christmas Story house in downtown Cleveland where the movie was made. A separate museum across the street is home to memorabilia from the film, though the 'leg lamp' is prominently displayed in the window of the house as it appeared in the film. Funny how a film can change one's perception of things; I now always hear the word pronounced 'fra-gee-lay'.Of course, every Christmas now the movie is shown in marathon sessions on cable, this year TBS won the honors. Because it's been so easily accessible, I've disregarded it the last few years, but decided to watch it start to finish today in a burst of holiday nostalgia. Now if only I could get my hands on a Red Ryder carbine action two hundred shot range model air rifle.",

Basically, set in 1940 in the northern Indiana town of Hohman, the narrator (Jean Shepherd) is recalling when he was nine years old, and Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) wanted only one thing for Christmas more than anything else. Everyone warns him that he could shoot his eye out with it, but he wants the official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model BB rifle with a compass in the stock, and he is to eager to wait for Christmas Day. Ralphie and his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) are being constantly bullied by school thugs Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) and his sidekick Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), making them worry if they will survive up to the big day. At school, Ralphie's teacher Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) assigns the class to write a theme about what they want for Christmas, he naturally writes about the BB gun hoping for high praise, only to get a C+ and a note \"P.S. You'll shoot your eye out\". Ralphie's next plan is to ask Santa Claus (Jeff Gillen), well a guy in the suit, for the present he longs for, but he also says \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid\". Having enough of hearing this, he and Randy are on their way home, and when Scut and Grover Dill come up to them again, Ralphie punches the bully to the ground and constantly hits him until Mrs. Parker (Melinda Dillon) stops him, leaving a bloody face. Ralphie thinks he has no chance of getting his BB gun now, while The Old Man, Mr. Parker (Darren McGavin) has his treasured major award, a lamp shaped like a woman's leg, completely broken. So Christmas Day has arrived, The Old Man is trying to get his mitts on the turkey without success, everyone has got their presents, and Ralphie opens all of them, and is devastated not to have his BB gun. But then, his father points out an unopened present conspicuously placed, it is his beloved BB gun, and he goes outside to play with it immediately, only to do exactly what everyone said he would, shoot his eye out, well hit his face. He lies so he doesn't have his gun taken away, and after the turkey gets ruined by dogs coming in the family eat dinner in a Chinese restaurant, and the film ends with Ralphie sleeping happily with his gun in his arms. Also starring Scott Schwartz as Flick and R.D. Robb as Schwartz. This film is apparently an underrated look at what Christmas is like during childhood, but it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is certainly one of the best children and family films for the festive period, a fun seasonal comedy. Very good!",

Was this OK in 1983?The film is tiring, boring, unfunny and just absolute rubbish. How on earth did this ever get such a high rating on the IMDb Top 250? It is simply beyond my comprehension that so many thought so highly of this awful film. My copy is going on eBay. Anyone interested?",

Going to see Santa at the department store and getting the boot.

The only problem? his mom, his teacher, and even the Santa Claus at the mall keep saying that he'll shoot his eye out. So all the way up til the big day, he has to deal with his annoying little brother, his dad, who curses and swears like a merchant marine, the bullies at school, and just about everyone who stomps on his fantasies about owning a BB gun.I have mixed feelings about this film. i love it for it's a good movie, but all the characters are dysfunctional and i hate it. shows like the simpsons and family guy capitalize on this because dysfunctional families are the funniest.Either way, it's a classic, finding a place alongside Home alone and the Rudolph the red nosed reindeer. you should check it out sometime.",

            "content": "I have been a fan of Jean Shepherd for a long time. I had found a copy of \"Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories\" in a used book store many years ago. Those stories spoke to me. They were about children in a small Midwestern town. They were exaggerated portrayals of the good guys and bad guys of everyday life. I went to this movie and sat down with a theater filled with seven and eight year olds and their tired, Christmas weary parents. One man used the expression which he said pretty much to himself: \"Why do you drag me to this kind of crap?\" As the movie unfolded, the naysayers began to giggle, then to laugh, and then to cry. This movie has a remarkable connection with anyone who has ever had an irrational but loving father, a kind, patient mother, and an existence slightly above the poverty level. I remember one of my chores in my junior hight years was to carry a five gallon can of fuel oil ten blocks so that we would have heat for another day. I never thought much of it. The anticipation of Christmas and all that it entailed was so important. We were generally disappointed, but there really was an excitement in the air. That anticipation that you were going to get the special thing. The scheming, the conniving, the butt kissing, that went into setting the table for Christmas day was really there. And we had those traditions, just like Ralphie. The tree, the shopping, seeing Santa, even though I knew he was the guy from the Ford dealership. I still love Christmas.As for the movie, it has so many individual delights: the flag pole, the flat tire, the lamp, the Santa Claus at the department and those hideous helpers, Scut Farkas and his yellow teeth, the Bumpus family and those horrible dogs. It's a treasure that everyone gets to partake in each year. I love it.",

I'd never even heard of a Red Rider BB Gun until I saw this movie. Another interesting aspect of the movie is Ralphie's family: although they appear to be affluent, there's a sense of the working class in their lives, as shown by the attitudes of Mom (Melinda Dillon) and Dad (Darren McGavin).

            "content": "A Christmas STORY is now a contemporary classic and although now 22 years old at this writing will play out through most of the balance of this century because it captures a quality of American life reminiscent of Normal Rockwell's early Saturday EVENING POST covers. In brief it is a Rockwellesque cinematic visualization, perhaps the first one. Any comment on this film must include mention of its writer and narrator, Jean Shepherd. It was my good fortune to have known Jean and have him help me with one of my short institutional films, NO WHISTLES, BELLS, OR BEDLAM, beautifully written with Jean's style in mind and for his narration by James Halpin.Those of us who were fortunate enough to have heard Jean Shepherd on his late night radio show on New York's WOR for years know what a treasury of creative writing issued from his genius. His narratives were always lively, engaging and fascinating. He regaled us with fabulous tales of '30s and '40s mid-west Americana and helped some of us relive our youthful dreams and achievements. Some of us boys also got the Red Ryder BB rifle for Christmas and with as much struggle as Ralphie.Jean's national celebrity came to him late in his life and as just the tip of a now lost iceberg of material that for many of us is now fading from memory. PLAYBOY'S Hugh Hefner recognized him early, however, and so did William Gaines and others. Gaines began to publish MAD magazine first as a comic book in 1952 then a humor magazine much like the 19th Century's humor magazines, LIFE and PUCK but much wilder and irreverent. Jean Shepherd's articles and stories were all memorable.A Christmas STORY is a living Christmas card and a loving tribute to the dream that is Christmas. Scenes such as the two boys waking up on Christmas morning, seeing the overnight work of Jack Frost on the trees outside then filled with apprehension over the day, running down the stairs to the living room to see the lighted Christmas tree filled with decorations, peppermint candy canes and wrapped gifts at its base, are priceless. Through the enchantment of Jean Shepherd's visions we are taken back to some of the joys and fun that we might have forgotten.To Jean Shepherd it was all just a wonderful, fun-filled parade.",

A Christmas Story changed that.I first discovered the movie, like many, on cable TV in the 80's, not long after the original theatrical run. Now, I'm a big lover of the classics, like Alistair Sim as Scrooge, It's A Wonderful Life, Charlie Brown, the Grinch, and the Rankin-Bass animated shows; but this was a lot of fun. I was laughing hysterically within minutes.The film is a wonderful blend of optimism, cynicism, nostalgia, laughs, and simple beauty. It's also a real hoot! The characters are so wonderfully genuine, and it perfectly captures the childhood longing for that perfect present.Jean Shepherd adapts his own work, which was a series of short stories, with a linking narrative, told by an adult Ralphie. The stories aren't all set at Christmas, and aren't actually interrelated, but he beautifully weaves the episodes together to create Ralphie's quest for the Official Red Ryder, 200 shot, carbine action, range model air rifle, with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time.The film is filled with wonderful characters, who all ring true. Ralphie, the covetous hero of the story, his whiny brother Randy, Flick, the gullible friend; Schwartz, the innocent victim of Ralphie's soap escape, the Old Man, eternal furnace fighter and weaver of curse word tapestries; the ever watchful mother, foe to bb gun coveting kids, but loving friend, and the terrifying bully, who isn't so tough after all.The parts are perfectly cast, with the Parker family at the forefront. Darren McGavin is wonderful as the Old Man, and Melinda Dillon shines as the over-protective mother (who is proved right!). McGavin had a long career, but Dillon was sadly underutilized. Then, there is Peter Billingsly as Ralph; a veteran of Real People and the Hershey's \"Messy Marvin\" commercials. Billingsly has the perfect blend of cute kid, but honest performance. The rest of the cast is equally good.The film is a wonderful piece of nostalgia, invoking the 40's, and the antecedents of today's rampant consumerism. It is equal parts sentiment and satire, tugging warmly at your heart, while milking laughs out of that same sentiment. It combines the Americana of the Capra films, with the irony of the 80's. So many modern holiday films come across as hollow, with false sentiment and manipulation. This film is a true work of art that depicts Christmas and childhood with pure honesty. It is greed and joy, the innocence of youth, and the revelation that those kids aren't necessarily that innocent.This is a rare film that is something more than just a bit of family entertainment. It is a milestone that becomes a reference point for generations. It has become an event, joining the ranks of Dickens, O. Henry, Dr Seuss, Frank Capra, and Charles Schulz as the top Christmas storytellers (aside from Matthew and Luke). It's also wonderfully quotable: \"Randy lay there like a slug. it was his only defense,\" \"Fragile; that must be Italian. I think that says Fragile\", Ohhhh FFFFFuuuuudddggge! But I didn't say fudge. I said THE word, the F dash dash dash word!\" \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" and so many others. Watch it and enjoy.",

            "content": "This movie from director Bob Clark has become a must-see TV over the Christmas holidays. It's about 1940, little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) only wants a Red Ryder Carbine Action BB Gun for Christmas, but everybody keeps telling him that he'll shoot his eye out. This is an idealized nostalgic look at middle America. Ralphie is not particularly heroic. He's self-centered. He's the every boy. That's why we love him. He just wants his BB gun. And how can we not love that face.There are many laughs to be had in this movie. But it always starts with licking the frozen pole. Every year, it is a gut wrenching laugh. It never gets old. Flick (Scott Schwartz) is hilarious. Just thinking about him screaming makes me laugh. The other can't-stop-laughing moment has to be the creepy Santa and his irate Elves. It starts with the elf dragging the kids to Santa and doesn't end until Ralphie lands flat on his back. This is a Christmas classic for the whole family.",

            "content": "A Christmas Story (1983): Dir: Bob Clark / Cast: Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz: Wonderfully innovative Christmas holiday account as reflected by the voice of the aged Ralphie Parker. As played by Peter Billingsley, he is nine, wears glasses, and desires a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200- shot Range Model air rifle for Christmas but is discouraged when everyone from his mother to his stern teacher to the store Santa warn that he \"can put an eye out with that thing.\" Darren McGavin is hilarious as his father, cursing out the defective furnace, but cheers up when a prize arrives in the form of the infamous leg lamp. Melinda Dillon plays his mother who places soap in Ralphie's mouth when a foul word is accidentally uttered during a tire change. Ian Petrella plays younger brother who plays in his food and struggles to mobile himself in his snow suit. Scott Schwartz plays Flick, the bunt of bullying and the sucker who accepts the dare of sticking his tongue against frost on a pole. After directing Black Christmas Bob Clark lightens thing up yet discernment advised for young children who will likely not be ready for the film's darker themes and edgier humour. Otherwise there are so many standout moments in this visually creative story that accounts one's seemingly normal yet memorable Christmas odyssey. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "\"A Christmas Story\" is a family movie in which we watch a kid who tries very hard to persuade his parents, his teacher and Santa that a Red Ryder B.B. gun is the best gift for every kid. Also we watch this kid in his day life and what he does in order to succeed on his goal which is to get this gun.I liked this movie because it reminded me Christmas of course and because of the direction which made by Bob Clark and I believe that it was not something extraordinary but a good one. I also have to say that I liked the interpretation of Darren McGavin who played as The Old Man Parker and he was very good at it. Equally good was the interpretation of Melinda Dillon who played as Mother Parker. Another great interpretation made by Peter Billingsley who played as Ralphie and he was simply outstanding.Finally I have to say that \"A Christmas Story\" is a nice family movie with which you can have a great time and I am sure that you will like it even more on Christmas time. Although I believe that is an overrated movie that's why I rated it with 6 / 10.",

            "content": "1st watched 4/1/2011 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Bob Clark): A newer Christmas classic amazingly brought to us by the same person that gave us the Porky movie franchise, Bob Clark. He directed and adapted Jean Shepherd's novel about a little boy, named Ralphie, and his qwest for the ultimate Christmas gift, the Red Rider beebee gun. The movie is definitely corny, but nostalgic, funny and dead-on when it comes to showing us Christmas from a child's point of view. The older character, voiced by Jean Shepherd himself, narrates the story from the very beginning and provides many funny moments with his whimsical quips and wordplay. Shepherd also helped with the screenplay -- which probably helped the movie as well. It's not necessarily for young kids because the movie has some adult humor and language, but definitely for the young-at-heart who remember their visions of Christmas when they were younger. The scenes sometimes are kind of splotched together -- going from one gag to the next -- but there are enough funny & classic moments to carry the movie. One unforgettable scene features a store santa, who isn't the friendliest character, with an enormous set with a built-in slide to role the kids down after their visit to the big man. This movie is definitely overplayed during the Christmas season but is a must see for those who want a unique and somewhat anti-traditional look at the Christmas season.",

I was much more familiar with Bob Clark's \"Black Christmas\". And to this day, I have not seen \"Porky's\" (the film that financed this one).Love it or hate it (and how can you hate it?) this film has so many memorable scenes -- the Chinese restaurant, the BB gun, the tongue stuck to the pole. How much this was like a Midwestern Christmas of the 1940s, I have no idea. I do like that it was filmed in Cleveland, though.If you have never seen this film, see this film. And you do not have to wait until Christmas... this film is a classic all year round. Bob Clark is still missed by many, and it is no surprise that in 2012 the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".Hard to believe that when the film first came out, the New York Times had few good things to say.

In between Ralphie's mission to convince his mom and dad to buy his gun, trouble and mis-adventures ensue. There is a nasty bully, his little brother, electric sex gleaming in the window (a leg shaped lamp), tongues and telephone poles, the neighbor's dogs, and a pink bunny outfit (THIS was the funniest part) from Aunt Clara. For the whole family. This movie always brightens up my holiday season. The one thing that ruins it is watching it when it is past Christmas. Sounds stupid, but when I was younger, I did it a lot.

That's because I'm lucky enough to watch movies that are 10/10 in my opinion. But I'm sometimes not that lucky as in Snakes on a Plane which only got 8/10. How terrible! Now on to the review that I have kept from you, the impatient review reader. A Christmas Story. This is not the kind of Miracle on 34th Street, or some Christmas movie by Adam Sandler. In fact, it's better. This movie is telling a story that happened to this boy, Ralphie Parker, many years ago. It's odd that he will remember such a thing. All days coming to Christmas, Ralphie has been wanting a B.B. gun. Now you may think, \"How old is he? He'll shoot his eye out!\" Well, \"You'll shoot your eye out\" are the words many are saying to him, even Santa Clause that is stopping him from getting this wonderful Red Ryder BB gun. There are many subplots before the big scene of opening the Christmas presents and ending up having to eat Duck from a Chinese restaurant because the neighbor's dogs ate the Turkey, and they are excellent.I enjoyed this movie and it's portrayal of how Christmas might have been like to a boy living in the 30s or 40s or maybe even 50s but I doubt that because I haven't seen a single TV (maybe I have but didn't notice it.) Wonderful movie, but I warn you, they do say \"nipple\" in this movie and they say the B word so watch out. How on Earth can they get a young kid like that to say the B word in a movie? Whatever.",

This film is still incredible and nostalgic even at my age of 28 years old. Classic moments of Randy at the dinner table, the \"fragile\" lamp scene, the getting ready for school, Flick's tongue on a pole scene, and many more that make the film unforgettable. As a kid, I always cherished watching the film because I idolized Ralphie, as well as wishing that my own father loved me like the Old Man loved Ralphie. As a Christmas movie, the film feels so much like it's dead set in Christmas season. You just get wrapped up in the holiday feeling. I have nothing negative to say about the film itself.

Everyone tells him it'll put his eye out and along the way the kid gets discouraged, even to the point that he pummels to a bloody nose the neighborhood bully who picks on him at the wrong time. It's really a \"time in the life\" of an older man reminiscing(in the wonderful voice of Jean Shephard who accentuates the pleasure of nostalgia and remembering back when)about his childhood, the parents, brother, friends, and certain moments around Christmas he can not ever forget, which live indelibly in his memory. Events covered include:The redneck neighbors' hounds which terrorize pops, the leg lamp(won by pops through a successful crossword puzzle) mother cleverly gets rid(much to the chagrin of pops)of through nefarious means, poor school chum who accepts reluctantly to prove(through the impenetrable triple dog dare)that his tongue would not stick to a frozen pole(and does), a little Orphan Annie decoder ring which doesn't exactly provide Ralphie with the results he would prefer, the nightmarish visit with Santa Claus, the outrageous layers of clothing Ralphie's brother would have to endure(barely able to walk), pops' various problems within the house(the Christmas tree lights, the basement furnace, the constant blowing of fuses), etc. The cast is absolutely perfect:Melinda Dillon as the always-worrying mother who comes through for Ralphie when he gets in the fight, Darren McGavin as the long-suffering father often a foil for misfortune(the leg lamp sequences are especially amusing), Ian Petrella as the little brother who doesn't like to eat and would prefer to play with his food(the moment where he's sobbing while hiding in a cabinet underneath the sink worried that pops would kill Ralphie over the fight is certainly a highlight), and Billingsley as the cute blond kid with glasses who endures much, so desperately pining for the dream gift which seems so far out of reach.

It's a shame I waited until director Bob Clark's recent death to finally view it but I'm certainly glad I did. I'm sure everyone knows the story so there's no point of me going into that. The four-star rating is certainly being kind since the film has several flaws but who cares? I thought the film had so many great moments that I can easily overlook the flaws and add this to one of my holiday favorites. I think what I loved most is the nostalgia factor Clark uses, which is pretty remarkable. The film has a nostalgic look and feel, which makes it hard to believe that the film was made in 1983. It has brought back many nostalgic moments for me because Clark did a terrific job in making the viewer identify with the kid and his various thoughts and feeling about Christmas. The fantasy sequences were brilliantly done as was the Christmas morning stuff. The ending with Ralphie in bed holding his gun was certainly something a true beauty and the way Clark shows off his happiness was quite touching. Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin and Peter Billingsley are all wonderful in their roles. The film is full of such small, genuine moments that it's easy to see why it's so loved after all these years. It could be the school bully, Santa's mean elves or sticking your tongue on a frozen pole. Another great thing was the laughing done by the cast. I can't recall a movie that has more genuine laughs coming from the characters, which just warms you up when heard.",

The acting of the child that plays the younger brother is so bad that it jolts you out of believing in the story.  And several of the bits - such as the winter clothes and the \"major award\" -  were so over the top that they were more phony than funny.     Some of the screenplay was elegantly written - but all the best lines are spoken by an unseen narrator whose delivery deflates the prose.  And the narrator, who is supposed to be a grown version of the child protagonist - has a voice and speaking style that is jarringly different than the young child or any of the child's relatives or parents.  It all seemed wrong.  It just didn't work for me.  Your mileage may vary.     I gave it 5/10.",

Ralphie tries to convinced his gruff dad (The late Darren McGavin) and his doting mother (Melinda Dillon) that Gift for Christmas. Ralphine starts giving his parents some hints and asking Santa Claus as well. But he has to deal with a neighbour bully named Scotty Farkus (Zack Ward). Which he, his brother (Ian Petrella) and his two friends (Scott Schwartz and R.D. Robb) has to deal with Farkus, when school is over for the day. As well for other different situations and messes that Ralphie has to deal with before Christmas.Directed by the late Bob Clark (Death of Night, Loose Cannons, Porky) made an entertaining, original Christmas comedy that become an massive cult classic during the holidays. Since the original release of the movie was a minor box office hit. Billingsley gives an terrific performance as Ralphine, since Billingsley has become an Hollywood producer and director. Although this movie does have an great cast, especially the parents, played by Dillon and the late McGavin feels like genuinely dysfunctional family.The Blu-ray has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) 1080P transfer and an fine Dolby 1.0 Mono Sound. The Blu-ray includes an entertaining commentary track by the late director:Clark and actor:Billingsley, an documentary of the film with the cast & crew, 2 featurettes, script pages (Which scenes were filmed but deleted from the final cut), original theatrical trailer and commerical about the infamous \"Leg Lamp\". \"A Christmas Story\" has become one of the best movies of Clark, along with a different holiday horror picture titled \"Black Christmas\". Which for some die-hard fans of Clark's work would make an fascinating double feature. This is certainly the holiday movie is always played every holiday, along with some classics like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Miracle on 34th Street\". \"A Christmas Story\" is a really good movie that is made more for adults than for kids. But Kids and Adults will certainly enjoy this. Based on a novel by the late Jean Shephard \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\". Which he appears in a cameo and he also co-wrote the screenplay, along with the director and the late Leigh Brown. (****/*****).",

            "content": "Growing up as a kid, there was no time of the year better than around Christmas, when you were dreaming what gifts Santa was going to give you and when magic seemed to be in the air. Adding to all this were the seasonal movies that always seemed to pop up, from cartoons to feature length films. One of these was 1983's \"A Christmas Story\". Starring Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, and Peter Billingsley, it's a movie that gets played over and over again - 12 times in 24 hours to be exact - every year on cable, and for good reason: It's that great of a film. Based off of the writings of and narrated by radio personality Jean Shepherd, it's a simple story at heart, one about a young boy named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) growing up in 1940's Indiana and dreaming about getting a Red Ryder B.B. gun for Christmas. Problem is, his mother isn't too fond of the idea at all, uttering the famous line, \"you'll shoot your eye out.\" Naturally determined to work around this, Ralphie works on a secret plan to try to hoodwink his mother, and that's where the fun begins, from a scary mall Santa to sticking a certain part of the body on cold, winter beam to see if it sticks!There are some movies that, despite not having the biggest budget or maybe even the biggest star names, seem to radiate a magic all their own. \"A Christmas Story\" is certainly one of those. From the whimsical narration of Jean Shepherd to a certain major award Darren McGavin's the old man wins (you know, the one that's a lamp in the shape of a certain part of the female anatomy), this film has Christmas magic oozing all over it. Peter Billingsley is wonderful as the determined kid to get his hands on the ultimate Christmas gift, doing everything from writing a school paper on the benefits of owning a Red Ryder B.B. gun for Christmas to asking a certain, way too scary for little kids mall Santa, which used to somewhat scare me as a kid but is now probably my favorite part of the whole entire movie. Plus, the performances of the late, great Darren McGavin as the old man, Melinda Dillon as Ralphie's mother, Ian Petrella as Ralphie's annoying little kid brother, Scott Schwartz and R.D. Robb as Ralphie's childhood friends Schwartz and Flick, and Zack Ward as the school bully Scut Farkus (\"Scut Farkus, what a rotten name!\") all add to this joyous experience. Anyone who ever celebrated Christmas a kid will get this movie, and for that reason alone, don't through life without seeing this at least a couple hundred times! Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!",

After finally watching it all the way through I must say that I have a much better impression than I had before. The movie is quite enjoyable and manages to capture a lot of memories and feelings about Christmas that I felt were lost a long time ago. This being said there is still something about the film that I can't quite touch that says to me that I am not really into it all the way.

Think about the incident of tongues freezing to lamp posts, the horrible department store Santa, or the illuminated leg-lamp or the neighbor's dogs grabbing the Christmas dinner.Speaking about production value and the value of story, this film is pretty poor; however, the humor that the film has to offer greatly makes up for this. It's turned out to be one of those must-see-films every Christmas. Some television stations broadcast it for 24 hours! I remember the first time I saw it - at the school - and there was some issue about it being a bad and adult film because of some 'strong' language and events and the fact that the title is 'A Christmas Story' but it has nothing to do with THE Christmas Story, meaning the story of Christ.",

The film also has noticeable gaps between the entertaining bits. It captures childhood spirit well, thanks in part to a reasonably good lead performance, but arguably not so much Christmas spirit. Not a bad film overall, but nothing really special. There are funnier and more touching Christmas films around.",

            "content": "So goes the lyrics to a big production number in the stage musical version of this Christmas classic, transferred so successfully that it became the first limited Christmas Broadway show to get a Tony Nomination for Best Musical. Re-visiting that show again for its Madison Square Garden engagement, I reflected on the movie which has become a Christmas perennial, showed repeatedly on cable stations every December, sometimes as long as 24 hours without going to another program! Growing up in a small town in New York in the mid 1970's where Christmas was celebrated in the old fashioned sense, I could relate to every aspect of this film which took place some 20 years before.Pretty much everyone can relate to that one present they desperately wished for when they were a child, even if it wasn't a red-ryder beebee gun. \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid!\", everybody tells him, and in the musical, there's even a huge production number where his fourth grade teacher Miss Shields sings and dances in red sequins after giving him the notorious C+. Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) doesn't sing and dance here, but she's still part of Robby's fantasies. Greeting the teacher with monster teeth attached to their own, the kids turn them in to which she adds these choppers to a collection of other trinkets she's taken away from children not paying attention to their lessons over the years. The story focuses on Ralphie's family, which includes Darren McGavin as the irritable father, Melinda Dillon as the sweet and understanding mother, and Ian Petrella as the adolescent Randy who is sort of mistreated comically as he eats mashed potatoes like a pig and is over-wrapped in winter clothes which make it impossible for him to keep his arms down. Ralphie is played by the adorable Peter Billingsley who went onto produce the stage musical version, and he truly is the dream version of the every day kid. Disciplined and polite (even if he does utter a curse word in one very funny scene), he is still a 9 year old in every sense of the word, prankish and funny, and cutely geeky. Jean Shepherd (the adult Ralphie) provides the witty narration, giving the viewer an inside look into what life was like in the mid west when tradition was everything.This film has so many wonderful moments, and even if I don't watch it every year (seeing the musical twice over the past two holiday seasons did it justice for me), I still look back on it fondly. Who hasn't experienced a nightmare visit to Santa in the local department store right before the holidays where nasty assistants and a possible inebriated fat man in a Santa suit hasn't hurried them along as the night rolls to an end? Who hasn't been humiliated by an obnoxious present by a well-meaning relative who thinks that a 9-year old would look cute in a pink bunny suit? Who hasn't wondered what it would be like to stick their tongue on something frozen? (I know that a certain member of my family actually did, and with much regret too...)Also memorable is the prize which McGavin receives from one of the many contests he's entered (nothing like a good old leg o' lamp...) and his constant fighting with the furnace, plus Dillon's reaction to the \"Chinese Turkey\" they receive when the downtrodden neighbor's dogs steal their own. Lots of subtle innuendos too about kids of this day, particularly one goggle-clad little boy in line to see Santa who declares to Ralphie, \"I like \"The Wizard of Oz\". I like the tin man!\" as Ralphie tells the woman in the wicked witch costume to beat it. While this film had a rather small theatrical release and appears to have been a sleeper of the time, it has certainly erupted into cult status, even providing an obscure sequel, \"It Runs in the Family\", once re-titled \"A Summer Story\" for VHS release. (That film is memorable for me for a sequence in which Mary Steenburgen as the mother tired of receiving a gravy boat at a local movie theater, started a riot by tossing her umpteenth one at the nervous host of the dish giveaway.) It is in that film too where the secret of the Kettle like next door neighbors is revealed.",

            "content": "The film, of a boy's Christmas when he was nine and the year was in or about 1940, is a worthwhile view. The story of Ralphie and his boyish dream, specifically telling everyone who wanted to, or didn't, that his greatest Christmas wish was to get a Red Ryder Carbine BB Gun was reminiscent of what a lot of people went through at about the same age. Ralphie's peripheral dealings in school are also familiar to a lot of those who experienced similar things in their youth. Various events like coping with bullies are told in Jean Shepherd's easygoing style, and he was a natural raconteur.Spoilers Follow: There are a few things in the film that create a jarring note for those familiar with the times. One of the other things Ralphie wanted intensely was a decoder pin for the Little Orphan Annie radio show. He finally finds an Ovaltine tin, and sends for one. After an interminable wait, one arrives in the mail, and he waits to receive the first message. He excitedly deciphers it, and the message is, \"Be sure to drink your Ovaltine.\" A commercial, he thinks disgustedly. But there's a problem: the story's bogus. The film took care to be \"authentic,\" using a large number of antique autos on its street scenes, and providing Ralphie with a genuine Radio Orphan Annie Secret Society 1940 Speedomatic Decoder Pin. It was a good choice, since the number and letter scales on the pin were at its peripheral edges, making Ralphie's fumbling to decipher the message more frantic. However, the actual messages were invariably hints about the forthcoming episode, never commercials. I've been told that Jean Shepherd once remarked that he wouldn't let facts stand in the way of a good story.Likewise, the Red Ryder Carbine. It was supposed to have a compass in its stock, and something that could tell time. I got a Red Ryder Carbine BB gun some seven years after the show was supposed to have taken place, and good gun as it was, it didn't have or need the extra items.But if you bleep through those things, it's an excellent piece of entertainment, well worth watching, particularly in the Christmas season.",

            "content": "Christmas is when kids want it all. Their favorite toy, their favorite video, no socks. Christmas morning is the most eagerly anticipated 2 hour period of the year for many, and the movie A Christmas Story shows us why. The minute the last speck of the Thanksgiving turkey leaves your plate until you wake up Christmas morning, the season of giving, but more importantly for kids (and some adults) getting, is in full swing. Anything is possible, Santa has a sleigh full of presents, just for Ralphie (Peter Billingsly) is just waiting for Dec. 24. All Peter wants is a Red Rider BB Gun, the one your mother, and every other mother in the world, tells you that you'll shoot your eye out with. Ralphie uses the days leading up to the classic 1950s American Christmas trying to find a way to get his BB Gun. He writes a theme for his school teacher, he tries to convince his parents that there were grizzly bears at his Indiana town's candy store, he even asks the big guy Santa for a gun. All requests were pushed aside with the now famous phrase \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" The scene involving Santa (Jeff Gillin) is especially funny, a scene right out of Bad Santa which came out 20 years later. Originally thought of as a failed adaptation of Jean Shepherd's book \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\" about his childhood (Shepherd narrates the movie and has a cameo appearance as an irate father, scolding Raphie and his brother Randy for cutting in line to see Santa) by director Bob Clark (infamous for the Porky's movies), A Christmas Story caught on in the mid-1990s as a holiday tradition, one cable network even devotes 24 hours Christmas Day showing the movie over and over and over and over again. The reason I think the movie has become a holiday favorite is that parents can watch this movie about a kid and his Christmas dreams and enjoy the look back at their childhood. We all knew fathers like Ralphie's (Darren McGavin) who would be a happy man if the Bears won and the furnace didn't falter everyday. We all knew mothers like Ralphie's (Melinda Dillon) who is stern with her kids, but will stick up for them when they needed it. I don't know if we all knew siblings like Ralphie's brother, Randy (Ian Petrella), but I certainly did. We still fight the same way Ralphie and Randy did to this day.

After viewing this movie only once, it instantly became my favorite Christmas Film moving ahead of \"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\" which I had watched for decades.Even though I grew up in the 50's I could easily identify with Ralphie.Parents/Santa were still giving BB Guns at Chrismas to young boys. I was 7 years old(can you imagine giving a BB GUN to a 7 yr old today)and actually don't remember even asking for a BB GUN but was more than thrilled when I discovered it under our Christmas Tree.Billingsley(Ralphie) did such a superb acting performance in this film,it still amazes me. His Facial Expressions without even saying a word were the highlight throughout the movie. The innocent look he tried to portray when he and Schwartz convinced FLICK to put his tongue on the Flagpole after a Triple dog dare yah! When Ms Shields can't get Flick to tattle on who was responsible for his dilemma.She knew it had to be Ralphie and Schwartz but how are you going to prove it if Flick won't spill the beans.Just a wonderfully entertaining Movie that doesn't really get boring anywhere in the Film. Great performances by the supporting cast also. When you watch a Film like this going on 30 years you can't really see anyone else playing the parts other than the Original Actors. I recently got a glimpse of \"CHRISTMAS STORY 2\" and just couldn't get into it with Daniel Stern playing the Old Man or any of the other non original cast members. Another instance of Leaving Well Enough alone.Anyone that watches this Film and can't come away with some kind of a good feeling or happy memory from their life probably won't like or care for anything worthwhile during their life.Sadly Darren McGavin and Bob Clark are no longer with us;but they both know what this film meant to millions of people...Excellent 5 Star Film in my book...s.m.",

I've watched it almost every Christmas season and laughed every time at the HO HO HOs and the sticking of the tongue to the flag pole. That is what makes it a classic and great movie.A Christmas Story tells the story of Ralphie Parker and one Christmas season. All he wants is one Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. One great aspect of the movie is that we relate to it. We have always wanted that one toy or something for Christmas(or Hanukkah). We didn't know if we were going to get it until that morning especially for Ralphie. But getting that gun isn't the only thing this movie is about. It's about being a kid and the daily trials that kids go through. Bullies, dares, teachers, fake radio clubs that are only advertisements. There's another way we can relate to this movie. Most of us have had bullies, dares, teachers you've tried to impress, and so on. The list goes on and on(I'm still thinking of some right now). Of course Palphie will go long distances to get that BB gun pulling every trick in the book. Along the way we meet an array of characters and we are introduced to many stories that again, we can relate to. The characters are all ones that you might have had in your life. The only one missing is the crush of Ralphie. We have the mans man dad, the forgiving yet unforgiving mom and the weird little brother that you make fun of. Then you have Ralphie's best friends which played a small role length wise but still are memorable. The narration by Jean Sheppard is one of the strong parts of the movie. The way he describes some of the situations can produce some laughs if you listen closely to it. Now to my favorite part of the movie. Christmas morning. If it's December and i'm not in the Christmas mood, this movie will but me right in it after seeing this scene. It has to be the perfect depiction of Christmas morning i've seen. Nothing else comes close to the elation and chaos of this rare moment, and of course the moment when he gets the BB gun. It puts a smile to my face every time. Memories pour into your head of Christmas' past. Of good presents and the bad ones, and just being together with your family being happy. What a great moment.In conclusion, this is a must see Christmas classic that you will see every year and will always relate to it 10/10",

            "content": "This is a highly regarded Christmas movie that gets almost universal praise. In my day-to-day life, I've never heard a single person speak ill of the film. And I love Christmas movies. So, I bit the bullet and bought a copy of the film to watch this Christmas season. I wasn't really sure what to expect, so I went in with an open mind and open heart, expecting a heartwarming Christmas tale like some of the other great Warner Bros. Christmas films (Jack Frost, To Grandmother's House We Go, Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer... the stuff normal people despised but that I can find some enjoyment in, in one way or another).\nWow, what played out on screen did not give me a pleasant experience, and I would be lying if I said otherwise.\nFirstly, Ralphie is extremely annoying. Peter Bilingsley was likely giving it the best he could given the quality of the script he was working with, but man is that character a real piece of work. Cheapened even further with the narration of an adult Ralphie throughout the film externalizing the character's thoughts at key moments of the film, the character isn't likeable. Sure, he fit the Hollywood mould for kid actors in the looks department at the time (he was a pretty face to plaster on the movie poster), but that's really all the character has going for himself. And to build the entire premise of the film around the idea that this kid wants a gun for Christmas makes no sense. It's not funny, it's not clever and it's certainly not entertaining. It's macabre and, as someone who enjoys an extremely dark sense of humour, it was still a major miss.\nThe movie is dull from beginning to end. At just over 90 minutes, it felt like it dragged on far too long, which is not a good look for a standard-length film. This is the kind of thing you can probably enjoy with the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but without that you're left with a film that everybody loses their minds over every Christmas that just doesn't hold up.\nThe only thing I can figure is that there's something in this film - some redeemable factor that changes everything - that went completely over my head, which isn't likely because this film panders directly to children of a lesser intelligence, spoon-feeding them every step along the way instead of letting the story develop naturally and allowing the viewer to draw their own conclusions. As a general film, it was bland and boring. As a Christmas film it was a holiday disaster (a \"No-Ho-Ho,\" as some film reviewers may refer to it). As a Warner Bros. holiday release... well, the commercials on the VHS before the actual movie were more enjoyable than the film. The excuse, however, can be made that it's an MGM release that Warner Bros. acquired, so it's not technically a Warner Bros. film.\nI hope they didn't pay too much for it. Thank god, neither did I.",

The leg in the window, tongue to the pole, the gifts you don't want, the school reports and the consumerism that doesn't go away till after Valentine's Day. Ralphie is essentially the every kid with all the problems. Darren McGavin is the father I'd want over Mr. Brady or even Mr. Cleaver. He's more fun, but I gotta lament for him as his beloved turkey vanishes. He should have shot those neighbor dogs with his son's Official Red Ryder Rifle ! Ralphie could then use it on those dim-witted bullies (why Ralphie and his cronies don't just ignore them is beyond me ). This is one of the best !",

Yes, not just disliked, but hated this movie. Not every critic, mind you--there is Roger Ebert, after all--but just take a look at The New York Times. That's one of the more positive original reviews (and it's an outright pan itself). My suspicion is that critics just couldn't get their heads around the fact that Bob Clark, director of the loathed \"Porky's,\" could create a work as wonderful as this one. Clark, in fact, has two masterpieces to his credit, this movie and \"Black Christmas,\" the scariest slasher movie of them all. Both have \"Christmas\" in the title, and both represent the top of their genres--nostalgia in \"Story\" and horror in \"Black.\" Clark had talent--and here is evidence as clear as a Christmas bell.Oh, and let's not forget the great Jean Shepherd, Darren McGavin, Melida Dillon, and Peter Billingsley.

The reason is that I can identify almost 100% with Ralph Parker, the main character in \"A Christmas Story\". The story revolves around 9 year old Ralph Parker and his quest to get a \"Genuine Red Rider 200 shot carbine action air rifle\" for Christmas. At every turn he is told \"you'll shoot your eye out, kid\" and along the way Ralph lives through many of the Christmas and childhood adventures and mishaps that I remember: There is the scheming to get the present you want, there is the father who swears a blue streak trying to fix a furnace that doesn't want to be fixed, there is the neighborhood bully who terrorizes Ralph and his friends, there is the doting mother always worried about you putting your eye out, there is the washing your mouth out with soap after saying a 'bad' word ( the daydream Ralph has about being blinded after the incident by 'soap poisoning' is a laugh riot ), there is the rich daydream world kids often visit while envisioning their deepest wishes, there is the, often, terrorizing visit to Santa Claus, and a ton of other identifiable childhood conditions. Whenever I watch this movie ( too many times to count ), I'm 8 years old again. There are very few movies that can pull you in like that, which is what makes it so great. The movie is perfectly cast, which is also one of the reasons you recognize all the characters in the movie.Most people seem to really like this movie, but there are a few who don't. The funny thing is they seem to object to the very things ( like children repeating the swears they hear their father using ) that make this movie so special. It's honest, that's what they don't like. They would rather watch and have their children watch the \"Peter Pan\"s and \"Cinderella\"s which sugarcoat everything and have very little to do with real childhood.If you haven't seen this movie and appreciate life like characters and situations, this movie is a have-to-see that'll also have you busting a gut laughing and get you right into the holiday spirit.",

There is the intention of representing the spirit of childhood, and indeed it succeeds in doing it for that particular country USA white middle class children, but it does it in a significantly problematic way. It is more apologetic than critical to a violent traditional society, to USA \"freemen\" ideology despite the repeating warnings \"you'll shoot your eye out\", which seem more a gag on an unimportant issue (whar the end of the story reaffirms). The simple fact of relating Christmas celebration to rifles and killing is bizarre, and could not have happened in any other country but the United States (perhaps also in Canada...). Well, that does not mean that the film has no quality: indeed, there is a lot of good dark humor, with interesting cartoon-like overacting scenes representing the boy's imagination, and the troubled but indulgent relationship between his parents is very well and ironically addressed. However, that narration with mannerisms is boring. It is also problematic that all characters are white; all but four Chinese employees in an ethnic restaurant, who appear just to be object of jokes (as a matter of fact, Chinese people had been mentioned twice before, being related once to starving and in the second time with torture).

            "content": "Every now and then, I find myself watching a film that is considered a classic, yet my parents never exposed me to it. \"A Christmas Story\" was one of those very movies. I'm nineteen at this moment, and have just now seen it for the first time in my life. Even my mother had never seen the movie before, and I could not resist making her sit down yesterday and watching it for her very first time, as well. You see, the film is charming in ways that I cannot begin to express. It is simply a film that you must view at least once in your life. Many emotions came to mind with all three viewings I've given \"A Christmas Story\": joy, hope, more joy, weariness, more joy, sadness, and then a LOT of joy to collect the ending moments. With all of that said, I'll begin my actual review.When young Ralphie spots a Red Ryder BB gun in the toy store window one day, he begins to find ways to drop many, many hints to his parents. His little ways of asking them and attempting to convince them to get him one this Christmas are typically futile, because all everyone seems to say in reply is: \"No, you'll shoot your eye out.\" However, Ralphie just won't give up on this excellent craft by the human hand--this wood-and-metal, BB-firing masterpiece! Peter Billingsly, when advertised on the commercials for the day-long re-runs surrounding the approach of Christmas day, seemed annoying. I avoided the film many times, even when the opportunity arose to see it. To my surprise, he is mostly good, but has his irritating moments. He brought the character of Ralphie to life, in my opinion. Ralphie becomes so relatable to my memories of me as a very young child. Like I mentioned numerous times above: joy constantly lit my heart during this movie. The mother, father, and younger brother actors were all fantastic, as well! Overall, the supporting cast were just as good as the lead.When it comes to the writing, I'll be honest that some of the jokes just aren't that funny, in my opinion. For example: the scenes Ralphie conjures about the things he would do with his Red Ryder BB gun are so silly that I get a little peeved by how long they tend to draw out. They are sluggish, in a way. However, these small complaints can only knock a single star off from a perfect 10 in my rating, because everything else about the film is absolutely brilliant! The events are what unravel this movie in such a genuine way that you can't help but smile to yourself. The film itself is essentially perceived through the eyes of a child, so I understand why some not-very-funny things are included with the film. Much to my surprise, the film is not just for kids; it has quite a bit to offer parents regarding jokes and situations.I also want to mention that there is a specific point with Ralphie after a long school day that literally broke my heart. It has a small bit of comedy in this scene, but the overwhelming tone of how upset Ralphie had gotten made me tear-up.Like I said before: the film is a charm.My God, what a fantastic film.If you get a chance to see this hilarious little treat, please don't pass it up like I did! You'll regret it! My rating for \"A Christmas Story\" is a nine-out-of-ten stars.God bless, and Merry Christmas!",

The super soaker 50 springs to mind one particular year.I think the Christmas message does come through in this film and its clear to me why this movie holds such a strong place to so many people especially the generationgenerations before mine.

There are numerous depictions of characters from THE WIZARD OF OZ and SNOW WHITE during the parade and department store sequences, and both these films had just been released during that time frame.I was fortunate to have grown up during the 1950s, and to have experienced the tail end of this era during my childhood.

Kudos also to the great humorist Jean Shepherd for choosing and trusting in Bob to put his gem of a Christmas story on film. Where does one begin? Well, you need a great, engrossing story to make a classic film and Jean Sherpherd's \"In God we trust...\" is perfection. His childhood recollections are \"spot on\"! It was a risk to choose Bob Clark, whose credits included \"Black Christmas\" and \"Porky's\" and who'd a thunk he'd deliver in spades! Next, and extremely important, is a good cast. Here's where the film excels. The casting is superb, from the leads to the smaller roles. Peter Billingsley is a perfect 'Ralphie' (who has been portrayed by Matt Dillon, Jerry O'Connell and Kieran Culkin). Darren McGavin is excellent as 'the Old Man' as is Melinda Dillon as 'Mom'. Both are perfect parents, strict yet loving and in the end supportive. McGavin is terrific as a short-tempered furnace hating dad. Dillon adds moments of humor, wonder and warmth. Ian Petrella steals ever scene he's in as whiny, frustrated younger brother Randy. Jean Shepherd has a small cameo role as a grumpy man waiting in the line for visiting Santa Claus. Ralphie's buddies, Flick (Scott Schwartz), and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) and neighborhood bully, Scut Farkas (Zack Ward) are also wonderful in their roles. The movie is charmingly nostalgic and anyone who celebrated Christmas as a kid should be able to relate to this film. The entire film is seen from a kid's perspective. Shepherd and Clark do such a fantastic job of capturing the trials and tribulations of pre-teen kids that it's just remarkable. Though set in the early 1940s, it so closely mirrors my childhood in the 1950s and most likely many of the following generations of kids.

Oh well, at least have a scene where he throws a big tantrum and I'd consider reviewing this movie even better, but no. He gets the gun, shoots his cheek, breaks his glasses and tells a lie.

This movie threw that away and it's hard to sympathize with a kid who lies and acts bratty an entire film.The movie was disappointing and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. The parents are so dumb, Ralphie is a brat who gets away with everything and the story (yes, it's presented in vignettes, which works in some movies, not this one) is so disjointed, and even the comedy attempts are ridiculously lame.

If you haven't seen this movie, you must. Rent it and watch it with a group or just by yourself. It's 2 hours of endless fun.",

            "content": "That's right, Bob Clark - director of Porky's and Black Christmas - helmed this modern holiday classic. And classic it is - but before it is anything else it is BROAD. Eyes roll, film speeds up constantly, dad talks in a high voice after he's bagged with a bowling ball. But it really works. Clark's nasty, cynical conventional wisdom is absolutely made for Jean Shepherd's folksy takedown of every Xmas clich\u00e9 in the book. Every scene has a payoff, and it moves like slightly clunky lightning. Having just spent the holiday with a three-year-old I can confirm that this absolutely nails the childhood thing; Peter Billingsley deserves an Oscar, and the writers throw in familiar but underused types like Ralphie's absolutely unreadable brother and a terrifying bully-wimp by the utterly perfect name of Scott Farkus. And Clark's nervous neurosis about race is kept pretty much corked until the Chinese restaurant thing at the very end, where the wait staff sings carols with lots of gratuitous R's. Can't forgive that, but it doesn't ruin it. The Santa scene is as grotesque and terrifying as ever.",

            "content": "I'll admit Chirstmas at times I saw as a child as a time for freedom of choice. It's true this freedom was for the presents aspect but still it was exciting for me because it not just meant I could have anything I wanted (well OK not all things) but that it was based on my choice alone. This is my favorite Chirstmas film of all time and yes another childhood relic of mine that I seen when I was about nine and I still watch to this day.There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said so I'll be brief. I really like the production value, they really make everything look like late 1940's small town America, the film almost looks like it could of been shot a long time ago which I feel give it an authentic feel.I like the narration by Jean Sheppard, it reminds me of the kind of narration I hear from the TV shows \"The Wonder Years\" and \"The Adventures of Pete and Pete\". Where it's gives the film a journalistic and personal sensibility.And I like the story which works because it's simplistic and really isn't much about anything. But what makes it work is that it has a Christmas atmosphere to it as well as good spirit. Despite all of the snafu that happen on the season they all still manage to have a wonderful Chirstmas.The characters are great, I really like Raphie's Dad played by the late Darren McGavin whom I remember from one of my favorite TV shows \"Koljak the Night Stalker\". This is my second favorite role from him he's a gruff, ruffled, but caring dad. He has a lot of great lines and I like that he's a guy that wants the best for both himself and his family which is something I can relate to cause who doesn't want the best. One of those things are of course that infamous erotic lamp.However my favorite character of course is Ralphie. His character I can really relate to because he's a lot like myself. I like the fact that he's kinda a writer as well as has an active imagination from the daydream sequences we see. Those sequences are really funny my favorite one is the cowboys and robbers scenario which almost looks like a light gun video game as Ralphie is dispatch Robbers whom are stationed at random places. But there also relatable because that's something we all do, sometimes if I'm really bored I imagine myself being and doing something else like being a Conan like hero slaying monsters or something. But just the simple fact that throughout the film he is trying to get the one thing he wants the most which is a Red Rider BB gun. We've all been there were there was that one thing we couldn't have for one reason or another. Now it's probably getting a video game that is Mature rated though for me it was always trying to watch a rated R action movie. And you really do feel pathos for the kid because he doesn't want that feeling of not getting what you really want for Christmas, no body does that's like eating a candy bar that you didn't really want to eat, it's not the same.And there are just lots of memorable comedic moments which are all the more funny because some of those situations can or have happened.From the infamous tongue sticking scene, what I found really funny about it wasn't so much the result but what lead to it which was the dreaded use of the dare word. It was pretty much a game of toughing the other out, I couldn't help but crack up when I saw the looks on everyones faces once the dare was delivered.However my favorite was the infamous Fudge scene which I find both hilarious and sad at the same time because there may have been a time or two where we might of had a slip up of the bad word.Well that's really all I can say, so Merry Christmas and to all a Good Night.Rating: 4 stars",

            "content": "This is a movie that I was late to. Part of it was that I heard people talking about how much of a classic it was. It was one that I had seen pieces of and knew different things, but never cared to watch it. That was until an ex-girlfriend of mine said how it was one of her favorite movies. We ended up watching for Christmas in July then. This second time watching it all the way through was with my in-laws on Christmas day since it either had been awhile for them or they watched it start to finish either.What I will say is that this is a solid movie. I don't love it, but part of that is lacking the nostalgia. It is interesting to see a look at one Christmas season in the life of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley), how quirky his family is and his pursuit to a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun. He lives with his mother, father and little brother Randy (Ian Petrella). His parents played by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin. He hangs out with is friends of Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R. D. Robb). They have to deal with bullies like Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) and his crony of Grover Dill (Yano Anaya). He also has to convince the adults around him that he can get this BB gun without shooting his eye out.It is a cute movie. I think that it does well in capturing the era well. It helps that the writer of the novel worked on the screenplay and even narrated as himself. This would be Jean Shepherd. I love the title of the novel being In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. It also wild that Bob Clark co-wrote the screenplay and directed it. I know him from the likes of Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, Porky's and one of the other quintessential Christmas horror movies in Black Christmas.As I was saying. This is well made. The use of soft focus with the cinematography helps capture a dreamlike quality. That makes sense for Ralphie remembering things. The acting is solid enough in giving these people life. I don't love this movie, but I can see why it is classic.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",

One of my favorite things about this movie was the dad's (Darren McGavin) obsession with the leg lamp. That was hilarious! And his reaction when it gets broken is unforgettable. He blamed it on his wife because she was \"jealous of it\". And the part where Ralphie beats up Flick (I think that's his name) after he's been mean to him for so long is so memorable. You almost can't blame Ralphie because I think we've all been there and felt the way he did! The ending was great. Ralphie finally got his Red Ryder BB gun!

It is difficult not to find something about Christmas that cannot be parodied. Already a cynic, the boy knows that it's all a bunch of baloney. All he wants is a certain present. He knows Santa won't be bringing it, so he is forced to use subterfuge to get his way. To find out what happens, watch the movie. But don't be fooled by the title.

Lifebouy, which apparently contained an ingredient able to nullify bad language. Ralphie's life is made a misery by that danger. He finds that nobody in northern Indiana (not his mother, not his teacher, not even Santa Claus) is able to even think about a BB gun without using the words \"shoot your eye out.\" At one point in the movie, in a revenge daydream, he knocks on his parents' door with dark glasses, a blind man's cane and a beggar's tin cup. They are shocked, and ask him tearfully what caused his blindness, and he replies coolly, \"Soap poisoning.\" The movie is not only about Christmas and BB guns, but also about childhood, and one detail after another rings true. The school bully, who, when he runs out of victims, beats up on his own loyal sidekick. The little brother who has outgrown his snowsuit, which is so tight that he walks around looking like the Michelin man; when he falls down he can't get up. \"A Christmas Story\" was released in the Christmas season of 1983, and did modest business at first (people don't often go to movies with specific holiday themes). It got warm reviews and two Genie Awards (the Canadian Oscars) for Bob Clark's direction and for the screenplay. And then it moved onto home video and has been a stealth hit season after season, finding a loyal audience. In a poignant way, \"A Christmas Story\" records a world that no longer quite exists in America. Kids are no longer left unattended in the line for Santa. The innocence of kids' radio programs has been replaced by slick, ironic children's programming on TV. The new Daisy BB guns have a muzzle velocity higher than that of some police revolvers, and are not to be sold to anyone under 16. Nobody knows who Red Ryder was, let alone that his sidekick was Little Beaver. So much has been forgotten. There is a moment when the Old Man needs an answer for the contest he is entering. The theme of the contest is \"Characters in American Literature,\" and the question is: \"What was the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?\"",

Like many artists he was always in love with the last thing he created.Despite sellout shows at Carnegie Hall and elsewhere and a top rated talk radio show, Jean never made a lot of money out of his writing. And the best media use of his talents was a remarkable WGBH series he wrote and produced called \"Jean Shepherd's America\" some of which is available on a DVD.Jean's producer for his public appearances and his radio show was a remarkable woman named Leigh Brown. Leigh had been a show jumper at competitive horse show on the circuit for years and had more broken bones and fewer teeth than any pretty blonde I knew. But her funny bone was in great shape and her sense for Jean's most commercial work was shrewd as well.Anyone who wanted to extract something salable from Jean quickly learned to go through Leigh.She had always believed that several stories in IN GOD WE TRUST (including the Red Ryder BB gun story) would make a Christmas feature that would run every Christmas for years to come and finally make some real money for Jean.She was right and they were finally able to retire to Sanibel island.

Many families have grown to love this movie throughout the year and just like mine have a steady tradition of watching \"A Christmas Story\" every Christmas for as long as it keeps showing. it is enjoyable to see Ralphie and the gang just having their fun and seeing him get what he wants and then does exactly what his mother told him-shooting his eye out.

It's very wry in its humor and at times it borders on black-comedy.

But beyond them is the supporting adult cast who know the parts they're playing and of course there's Darren McGavin who seems thoroughly enjoying himself in this silly character.The film is proof that stakes really don't matter if you're execution is done right as it makes a compelling story out of a nine year old wanting a bb gun for Christmas-while also being hilarious. And director Bob Clark does a first rate job layering the film with style which is not just simply there but actually enhances the story and overall movie.",

Everyone can take something away from this movie: the problem with childhood bullies, desperately wanting some toy that seemed like a big deal back then ---- and everybody has tried to suck-up to the teacher in the hopes that it would make life easier at home! This movie puts a skewed and funny spin on what is normally not pleasant. We can all laugh at the characters and ourselves.Nobody else could have played the dad like Darren McGavin, an old favorite for many audiences.Favorite quote from the movie - Darren McGavin: 'He looks like a deranged Easter bunny....a pink nightmare!' (Ralphie modelling his aunt's homemade present of a cute bunny costume..)Favorite moment: when years of humiliation, fear and a feeling of being short-changed by life finally come to a head, and Ralphie gets angry and beats up the neighborhood bully. And doesn't get in trouble for it, either. A rite of passage, or sorts....As a woman who enjoys her food, I would have taken a sawed-off shotgun to the Buttkuses'(?) unruly hounds after they made off with that turkey. I would have acted very differently from just quietly settling for Chinese dinner on a major holiday, let me tell you... PETA could go jump in the lake. I'm glad that some stations have marathon showings of 'A Christmas Story' during the holiday season. This has become very common with a lot of networks: like SCI-FI channel's marathon showing of 'Twilight Zone' from New Year's Eve to New Year's Day.",

I know it runs 24 hours on Christmas Day over there but here it has no presence or significance whatsoever. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't work. The irreverent vignettes of a childhood in hindsight are identifiable no matter where you're from or how old you are. The events it details occurred nearly 80 years ago and that distance makes the film keep its bite. It's an imaginative film and it's got personality. It mostly stems from its unconventional and sardonic narration of the young boy grown up who becomes our guide. The contrast gives the characterisation a strange effect, especially when it slips into present tense. Ralphie's meandering ordeals are for the most part entertaining, but the film suffers and cheapens when it opts for cartoony moments of fantasy. It could work with better execution, and although they're amusing, it's disjointed. Nevertheless, I didn't realize how many iconic scenes, moments and props came from this film so I guess that fills up a pop culture meter for me. While its nostalgia only goes so far and it doesn't seem to have the ambition to take its emotional shards to a more powerful place opting for a distraction instead, I can definitely see why audiences over the years have fallen for its smirking charm.7/10",

The movie is about a little kid named Ralph who wants nothing more for Christmas than a Red Rider Bee Bee Gun. He goes to a lot of lengths to try and convince his parents to buy him one, but the common response is that he'll shoot his eye out. He tries everything, writing an essay, asking the mall Santa but even Santa says he'll shoot his eye out. The movie focuses on a few more things though. One of the subplots is a bully that pesters Ralph and his friends constantly and another is Ralph's Dad winning a contest and getting a lamp shaped like a woman's leg that his Mom despises. It centered around the viewpoint of Ralph too, so things are sometimes exaggerated in his mind. Any little boy might also recognize some of the fantasies going through his head. Most of the things that happen in the movie could happen any time of the year, not just Christmas. But that's the appeal. It's not a cohesive plot it's just a kid living his life and leading up to the days before Christmas. It's hilarious, it's well made, I watch it every year and I recommend it to everyone else.",

            "content": "Who would have thought Bob Clark, the man behind a list of trashy and forgotten horror and teen sex comedies from the 70's and 80's, had it in him to bring this adorable Christmas tale to the screen with barely a flaw. There are very few films made in the past 2 decades or so which have been able to capture the nuance and detail of the 1940's so as to make you feel as though you were actually transported back to that period.  This, along with Woody Allen's Radio Days, is the quintessential example.I had actually avoided seeing this movie back in the early 80's BECAUSE of Bob Clark's involvement, not seeing it until Christmas '86 on Television. Needless to say I was instantly charmed and it's been part of my Christmas viewing every year since.People who hated it and registered negative comments here to do with lack of plot etc just don't get it.  It's a filmed memoir with comedic trappings and as such all the set pieces happening around Little Ralphie's quest to obtain a his Red Ryder BB Gun speaks more volumes than any three act contrived plot could possibly have done.It's all about detail, those affectionate things from the past which fleet past in everyone's life no matter the decade.  I am a child of the the 60's but the 40's have always held a fascination for me.  Things that are sprinkled around in this film, if you care to notice them, ring true from Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters on the radio to Little Orphan Annie to Look Magazine, to the Wizard of Oz characters, to the cars and trucks on the street to the snow, which even manages to look 40's.  It's Christmas as if Rockwell had painted it.But the nuances aren't only visual.  Peter Billingsley registers what must be one of the 10 most effective and affecting performances in movie history. The story needed just the right kid to play the part or else it might have fallen flat.  Just any kid wouldn't have done and Billingsley proves that some things are just destined.  The whole cast in fact is simply perfect and give memorable performances.Amongst the lighthearted sequences, there are still a couple more touching moments which are handled gently and are quite moving.  The whole scene after Ralphie snaps and whoops on the bully, and is led home by his mom rings truth in every way, from his kid brother hiding under the sink, to Ralphie's very real dread of being punished for his use of foul language. Gen Y kids will of course find this ludicrous as they pretty much come out of the birth canal these days uttering those kind of expletives, but back when I was a kid even in the 70's we didn't get away any easier than kids in the old days for swearing within earshot of adults.The payoff scene where Ralphie finally gets his much sought after Red Ryder rifle, while his dad glows, slipping back into his own childhood for a brief moment, is simply priceless.Aside from maybe the slightly overdone Santa Claus scene there is nothing in this story I would change.  It's the only Christmas movie produced theatrically in the last 50 years which can be regarded as a classic. Other lame and half-hearted efforts like Prancer, Santa Claus the Movie, and the recent The Grinch have done nothing to capture the magic of Christmas.  \nA Christmas Story stands alongside the greats - It's a Wonderful Life, The Bishop's Wife, the original Miracle on 34th Street, and Alastair Sim's version of a Christmas Carol.

No. Does it have terrific acting? It has okay acting with average dialogue. Does it have an interesting or complex plot? No. And this is what bugs me about this movie: NOTHING happens in the movie that is of any importance. The movie ends where it begins with nothing being accomplished. So is the movie a classic? Sure I guess you can call it a classic because most movies that are classics are cheesy. Is it entertaining? Yes mildly so. The movie is successful in the fact that it feels like a Christmas special and does portray the hecticness of Christmas fairly well.

For whatever reasons, this is one that just slipped through the net here. I don't ever recall seeing it on tv growing up. I'd be surprised if it was never shown, it probably just doesn't air much because nobody has ever heard of it. I only saw it for the first time a few years ago, on a streaming service. I was amazed that here was a really popular 1980s Christmas movie, yet i'd never even heard of it!It doesn't really resonate with me as much as it no doubt does to many Americans, but it's a fun watch. Not sure when exactly it is set, i'd guess sometime around the 1940s. I suspect the main reason it wasn't shown here much (if at all) is the story revolving around a BB gun. I think BB guns were a \"thing\" here during WW2, i've seen tv and movies set here around then where kids were playing wit them, but probably were frowned upon in the 1980s if not actually illegal. We're all used to hunters (Elmer Fudd etc) having guns, a 9 year old kid with a gun is probably a step too far for family tv. Of course, it could also just be that nobody here eats meatloaf, uses lifebuoy soap or about a hundred other things referenced that are almost completely American. It's hard enough to get nostalgic about things that stopped being a thing 30 years before you were born, but even harder when they've never been a thing in your country ever!Whatever the reasons, it's a bit of a shame this film is largely unheard of here. Be sure to drink your ovaltine is hilarious. No idea if that was an actual thing, but it's the type of dirty lowdown trick companies play on kids!

A grandmother who still knits a full body bunny suit pajamas for a nine year old child but not for his younger brother? Those type of pajamas are for toddlers and infants. No sane person would make them for a kids even at the age of six. But yet we are led to believe that the grandmother is so senile that she still thinks Ralphie is still 6 years old when he is nine in the movie. How about the parents stepping in to tell the grandmother to stop making those pajamas because the kid is too old for them and she is embarrassing him. That would be the realistic thing to do. But do they in this film? No. They seam to enjoy embarrassing their own son by forcing him to wear them. Or how believable is it to have a nine year child still going to a department store Santa, sitting on his lap and ask for a BB. Gun? Not very. Worst yet, no department or mall would ever allow their Santa to put his foot in the face of a child to push him down a slide. They would have faced a ton of law suits. Another absolutely unbelievable part of the film was Darren McGavin as the father \"The Old Man - Mr. Parker\". He was way too old to be married to Melinda Dillon \"Mrs. Parker\" and still be called a young couple in the film. He looks like should be having Grandchildren or Great-grandchildren instead of his first round of offspring. Yes, I understand this story is presented through the distorted lens of a child viewing his parents as old. I just think that if you can spot the dye in McGavin's hair, the director carried the exaggeration to far and broke the willing suspension of disbelief. I never bought for a moment McGavin as being the father in that family. The mother is not that much better. A woman who has a husband who has swear words pouring out of his mouth freely as water flowing over the edge of Niagara falls but yet is shocked when one of her sons eventually starts using the same language he had picked up from his father. Come on! Even Though nonsense words are substituted for the real swear words, it is clear what was really meant that the father was saying and what Ralphie was saying. The F word and it is not \"Fudge\". The father doesn't think his foul mouth isn't partly the blame? Also the bit of the mother separating the two boys fighting but not stopping to see if one boy is alright when she sees that one boy has a bloody nose was a bit far-fetched. How many mothers you know act like that? Not many. Ralphie was just plainly stupid. He should have known better at his age not to swear in front of his parents. Here is another piece of stupidity by Ralphie. After being told how dangerous BB rifles were and was told not to place the target in front of a metal surface because BBs ricochet off of metal, what does he do? He places the target on a lattice in front of a metal fence where the BB goes through the target, through the lattice and hits the metal fence and ricochets back and hits Ralphie in the glasses on the first shot. As for the story and the jokes, the story was predictable and the many of the jokes were ether not funny, or just plain flat. Every plot point was televised a mile ahead of time. I mean I knew from the from almost the start that Ralphie was going to get his BB. rifle and shoot his eye out in the end. I knew the tongue was going to stick to the flagpole. I knew that the mother was somehow going destroy the leg lamp. As far as the leg lamp gag went, that was not that funny in the first place and got old faster than a particle traveling at the speed of light. The story is so bereft of content that a group of animators made a 30 second parody of it that covers every important point in the story. If the story can be condensed into 30 seconds, it means that there is not that much content in it in the first place. That can be viewed at http://www.angryalien.com/aa/xmas_storybuns.asp .Oh, what a lovely messages this film sends out. Like, for instamce, if you get in trouble blame, it is okey to it on a totally innocent kid in order to get yourself out of trouble. Or how about that mean Santa Claus so much wants to get rid of kids that he will put his foot in your face. Wow, I would just love my kids to see that. NOT!",

Shep later said he wanted a more sardonic, anti-nostalgic edge to ACS akin to his stories, complete with out-of-tune music in spots (which PHANTOM used to the right effect)--too bad that got muted. It's worth a look, sure, but it won't make me forget Shep's Christmas Eve reading of the original Red Ryder story (\"Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder Nails the Cleveland Street Kid\") on WOR, let alone PHANTOM.

Peter Billingsley had a cherubic face which helped sell alot of the scenes. The best part of the movie for me was the narrator, Jean Shepherd. His voice was perfect, and had a comedic tone to it throughout the movie. His voice-overs were well written, and the narration gave \"A Christmas Story\" a uniqueness.

It's hard to believe that the director of the smash sex comedy \"Porky's\" (Bob Clark) directed this, and it's even more hard to believe what a terrific job he did. This is far and away Clark's best film. \"A Christmas Story\" is wonderfully told and beautifully acted. Peter Billingsley is the whole show here as Ralphie in one of the best film performances by a child actor. Melinda Dillon (\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Harry and the Hendersons\") is very good as Ralphie's mother. But the real scene stealer is Darren McGavin, who's a hoot as Ralphie's father. Just get a load of the way McGavin delivers his dialogue at times throughout this movie.

I just don't like how a character can narrator though out the film, just freaking speak, but in this movie it didn't annoy me, it actually worked for the film, because Ralphie (Main character) put a mans voice in his head just to sound cool and that is just what a kid would do, oh and he also day dreams, just like a kid.The good thing in this movie: The character's in this movie are so funny and so remember-able, the bully in this movie you know \"You gonna cry?\", yeah that kid, he was fun. The acting from everybody was really good, even the kid actors did good, nobody did a terrible performance. This movie celebrates Christmas like mad, just like Home Alone 2.

A major bomb when first released, kids of the 80s such as myself found it on cable year after year and loved it.  A straight-forward plot, kid wants a bb gun for Christmas, is juiced up by a ton of memorable scenes that really don't involve the holiday, but are priceless nonetheless.  The double dog dare, the leg lamp, the bully who finally gets his, and on and on.  But of the Christmas related stuff, they throw in everything you remember or have gone through.  Or depending on your age, you still may be going through it, all that anguish over getting the gift you want.  Terrific performances abound, Gavin as the high strung father who swears like a cartoon character, Dillon as the sympathetic mother, and though billed third, Billingsley is great as Ralphie.  Even at a young age, he gave totally professional line readings and facial expressions, with the trademark scene (in my mind) the charge back up the Santa slide to ramble off a hilarious request.  Really too bad that he didn't go on to a better career.  And I may as well admit, I still get a tiny tear when that final gift is unwrapped.  The music in the scene is subtle but real touching to bring out how special the moment is for the kid.  The biggest reminder of how much of a favorite this is of mine is whenever I hear the melody to \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" I automatically think of the closing credits of this film.

            "content": "There are homes in America and the UK where even slight criticism of this Holiday classic would have the eggnog kicked out my hand and me being kicked out the house. The story is brilliant, a Proustian memoir from both views, the writer as a child and how he now sees Christmas and what really matters. It is a classic, the Red Ryder BB Gun could be Castle Grayskull, or a Barbie, or Megatron, Nintendo DS, iPad. The story is an ingenious one. The movie really does have heart, derived from the fact that it is based on a true story and its wry family over commercialism message is something that raises it above SPielbergian schmaltz. The film's miscasting, however, is drastic and it never really recovers from this. RalPhie, Peter Billingsley, is so automaton in this as to come across borderline autistic. In a decade where Corey Feldman, Sean Astin and other, better, child actors were out there, Billingsley's acting is such that it seems the camera ceased rolling every five minutes to give the boy a nudge... or make him do something. Billingsley doesn't even really have the abilities a child extra should have, with the kids essaying Scott Farkus and Flick blowing Billingsley out of the water. Darren McGavin is way too old to be the Old Man, ironically. Was his wife twelve when he married her at forty? Imagine Bill Murray in this role, whom they could've hired at the time for a reasonable fee, or even Rick Moranis? McGavin doesn't just seem to act angry, he looks Permanently P***ed off to even have been cast. Melinda Dillion as the mother is noteworthy and overall the casting of the family should have been built around her. There are excellent moments of observational reflection from childhood, but it is Jean Shebherd's writing that saves the movie and ties it together. It is to be commended for that.No doubt that when Zemeckis remakes this as a CGI fest, maybe the last in his motion capture Christmas trilogy, this might work, but the casting and anachronisms detract from the whole.You can all tell me to fuuudge off now.",

There are many subplots to keep things interesting, but it ultimately revolves around the family. I initially wasn't too interested in watching this movie, but when I saw it was in the IMDb top 250 I figured I'd give it a try (you know, to nick another one of the list). It won me over.Stylistically, it feels like a home video. The characters are all easy to relate to, and Ralphie brings back fond memories of childhood. The narration is an interesting touch. We see this simple, normal kid on the outside, but hear his complex inner thoughts in adult English. The daydreams are also great, especially the ones involving his teacher. The film definitely has its moments... the Farkus encounters were priceless. The comedy was mostly fresh, although I admit a few of the jokes struck me as lame or clich\u00e9. I guess it depends on personal taste. The overall message left me a little befuddled at the end. I suppose it is one of those things you need to grow up with to appreciate fully.All in all, the movie is good at what its meant to be: a Christmas film which a whole family can watch and enjoy together.

            "content": "If you were a middle class kid growing up in the late 40's with a traditional stay at home Mom; a Dad who swore like a sailor, was a FORD man, and thought he could fix anything and had an opinion about everything - you had to like this movie. Some of the scenes seemed to be right out of my own life. Like first time my MOM overheard me say the BIG word, and actually wondered where I had heard it. Why from my old Man of course. I wonder if my Mom EVER listened to the OLD MAN?I wanted a BB gun and never got one for Christmas. Why not? Because my Mom said exactly what Ralphie's Mom said - \"you'll shoot your eye out.\" Unfortunately, that was one time my old Man gave in to my Mom. The Christmas tree purchase - right out of my past. My Dad who was by nature a tight wad, always would loosen up when it came to the Yule tree. Of course he always thought he won the haggle. I had a younger brother just like Randy. He wouldn't eat his peas either. He would smash them up and spread them around the bottom of the plate. In the pre-TV era, there probably wasn't a kid who hadn't sent away for something advertised on the Radio. We listened to the Lone Ranger, Sgt King of the Northwest Mounted police and when Mom wasn't paying attention, listened to the detective shows.We used language like double dare, and double double dare, although to this day, I'm not certain what it all meant. I went to a school that looked a lot like Ralphie's. Back then, most of us walked to a neighborhood school, so we had fights with older boys who were bullies, and one time in a fit of blind rage I hit one of them with a lucky punch and he never bothered me again.Then there was the question that had near theological aspects. Was there really a Santa Claus? It seemed obligatory to fool our parents, and some of us fooled ourselves \"just in case\" it was true. After reading some of the negatives, it appears that a generation gap exists. It is probably hard for anyone who grew up in the 60's to understand what Christmas meant for our generation. Getting presents was something that happened once a year, and if you were lucky, maybe you got a birthday present. The average home in those days was about 1000 square feet and there simply wasn't room for all the \"things\" we now put in our two car garages and rented space. As a grandparent I have come to accept the fact that this generation thinks Christmas comes once a week. As a movie, this is something everyone can watch and enjoy. The narration of Ralphie's thoughts is terrific. Dillon and McGavin are perfect forties parents. Some of Ralphie's imagination may seem corny to the younger viewers, but before TV and video games, I think we as kids had more imagination. I know I shot many an imaginary bad guy out my bedroom window with my imaginary gun. This has become a Christmas \"cult\" film because it keeps its focus on how kids saw Christmas. It's not religious, its not about adults or a love story. Unlike other so called Holiday films, such as \"It's a Wonderful Life to \"Christmas in Connecticut\" or Chevy Chase's movies. This film captures an era just as Dickens captured his era with \"A Christmas Carol\". I think this film represents what Christmas meant to kids like no other film ever made.",

Most of it is a revolting mish-mash of cutsey-utsey, cloyingly sentimental, corny, weepy mush (who wants to cry at Christmas?). And don't even start me on the Christmas \"comedies\"! The whole thing is enough to turn Mary and Joseph into Scrooge.Thank God for films like A Christmas Story, A Christmas Carol (1951, with Alastair Sim), and Scrooge (1971, with Albert Finney). Oh, yeah. And the Charlie Brown one. They are the ONLY Christmas films I bother to watch. Actually, I watch them every year. Heck, watching them every day is better than even reading the synopsis of the new stuff once a year.This film is funny, endearing, and REAL. There is at least ONE thing that lucky old codgers like me can identify with in this gem. No weepies, no tacky sentimentality, no dysfunctional families, no over-the-top, tiresome \"comedy\" (going on a trip and leaving your kid Home Alone on Christmas? Seriously?!)So a big thank you to Jean Shepherd, Bob Clark, and all the film cast for bringing back the real magic of Christmas: Christmas itself. God bless you, guys. Every one.PS: don't listen to the 1 *reviewers. They're all a bunch of Grinches who don't know a good thing when they see it. I bet they all loved E.L.F.",

For those that hate it, their hearts may be two sizes too small.This movie is a classic due to its ability to hold through the test of time. It captures an innocence that is no longer portrayed in family Christmas movies (some dumb cluck listed that Die Hard is a Christmas movie, showing how rednecks regard the holiday joy).  For the ones who hate it, they mostly hate it because they don't know the point of the movie, showing that they won't allow their inner child to enjoy it.  The movie stands out from other Christmas films, because it shows Christmas through the eyes of a child, rather that an adult character, a family struggle or third person.  Granted, the narrator is the child grown up, and remembering that year in his life, but he remembers his thoughts about his struggle to achieve that one present that meant more to him than anything else.  Think to when you were a child, and there was one Christmas that you wanted something more than anything else in the world, so much so that you bribed your parents, cleaned your room, wrote letters to Santa, hit up your grandparents, and any other angle that you could think of to get that gift!  If you can remember that Christmas, and what that gift was, then that is why you would love this movie, because you can identify with Ralphie, and his quest, you can remember your own childhood longings at Christmas, and that will bring you into the movie, and bring the movie into your collection.I give it a 12 out of 10!

The film is seen through the eyes of a 9 year old boy named Ralphie Parker. Just like most children nearing the holiday season, Ralphie shares a common obsession for a gift. But the only roadblock he faces is the fact that he wants a BB gun. This film is packed with memorable and heartwarming scenes. One unique aspect of \"A Christmas Story,\" is that almost each and every character has their own special moment in the movie. One of the many reasons this movie is so loved and sought after is because Ralphie is such a relatable character. I admit that even I have shared a common need for \"Thee,\" Christmas gift and I'm sure that you, yes you reading this, have had that same feeling. Weather its the old man winning his \"Major Award,\" or even smart assed Schwartz sticking his tongue to the flagpole, \"A Christmas Story,\" is sure to keep you laughing and is able to find a special place in everybody's heart as one of their favorite movies of all time.",

Well, the movie is about a kid Ralph 'Ralphie' Parker (Peter Billingsley), who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Set during the 1940's Ralphie runs into the problem that his mom thinks he will shoot his eye out. During the film it has Ralphie trying his best to succeed. Though can he do it?With this story being also a reflection of childhood, as it unfolds in first person, the flick was all right. Filming wise was a little cooky sometimes, but was decent. The acting was good, but sometimes they had to act too overdramatic. Though that does give the flick some flavor.I would say this film is only good if one is interested in a Christmas satire.

However, to me, this movie seemed very shallow and therefore missed any true Christmas atmosphere that it could have contained.It really is the motif of this film that is a turn-off to me.  I can understand that you would enjoy the film if you identify with Ralphie's childhood experiences, but from my perspective, the whole atmosphere of the film just seemed bleak and empty.  My feelings could best be summed up by saying that I thought this was a rather dark film, more dark than Christmas-y.  The parents seem shallow and are nothing more than parodies, and the brother seems to be a whimpering non-character.  Individually, the characters are funny, but the sum of the parts fails to make a whole; the characters are defined by nothing more than their comedic antics, and there is nothing more to them.  The sheer lack of realistic and meaningful interpersonal relationships in this movie makes it feel hopeless, in spite of its comedy.  Not even Santa is jolly!  Visually, although capturing some atmosphere of the era, the film just seems monochromatic.  Overall, it just seems impoverished when it comes to rich characters or visual lushness. If the film had but one or two meaningful characters or places to redeem itself, it would be far more tolerable.  I realize that this is a comedy, but the main reason that I do not like this movie is that I find the atmosphere and the taste of the humor depressing.  In fact, I don't understand why people view Ralphie's childhood as blissful and sweet, because it simply doesn't come across that way to me.  Moreoever, the idea that it is a Christmas movie is sortof incidental and gets lost in the plot; it could have easily been about a boy's birthday or any other gift-giving occasion, because other than spartan Christmas imagery and the Santa scene, there is little in the movie that is actually relevant to the holiday.\nIf you identify with Ralphie's childhood experiences, or appreciate the cynical, sarcastic humor, you will probably like this film, but if you agree with me, it will just leave you feeling icky.",

Unceasingly irritating, in the writing, direction, acting and the camera work. Now, I truly understand that we all can't appreciate any given movie but in this case I wonder how it's possible that the people who gave it 9 or 10 stars, the majority, are living and experiencing the same life experience as I am? This movie displays fraud, fraudulence and manipulations of creative endeavor for what end? I'll answer the question: Shepherd was in his early sixties when he came up with the idea for 'A Christmas Story'. He had made a pile of money but probably wanted to secure a lot more with old age pressing him. So he does, in its way, something brilliant: An overly sentimental 'Christmas story' that has incredible satiric and contemptuous bite to it. But he disguises it as sentiment! Voila! He pulled it off. He made the squares he so held in contempt buy into this dose of Norman Rockwell gone wild. And if anyone reading this disagrees with the content of the review and wants to actually follow through on seeing if there's any truth to my comments, then do some homework and listen to his brilliant radio monologues. Shepherd was one talented angry observer and A Christmas Story is the exact opposite of what he talked about and was during hundreds of hours of broadcasting.",

            "content": "I remember this movie being released back in 1983 in movie theatres and I also remember that it did not play too long in theatres and had come and gone so fast.When I watched this on cable two years later,I realized and learned why it did not play too long.This movie practically is a huge mess in itself that it is not even funny.IMHO,this movie is not even funny at all.It does not even survive on a \"So Bad.It's Good!\" level.It bored me to death.Instead of laughing,I was yawning throughout hoping for something to arouse my ability to chuckle.Nothing happened.Oh well! This whole movie is nothing but over 90 minutes of senseless profanity and bad acting that it does not even arouse interest.After a promising start,the whole movie rolls downhill and does not even recover.Plus,the premise of a kid wanting THE perfect gift is reduced to WORTHLESS trash as the kid does whatever it takes to get his way.What was MGM thinking when they agreed to fund and release this movie in theatres?Not only that,how could this movie receive a PG rating by the MPAA with all of the senseless profanity?This film should have received an R rating for all of that.Not only that,in some communities,some people who took their kids to see the movie actually stormed out of theatres demanding their money back after they heard all the obscenities uttered by the child actors and adult actors.None of these parents could not believe that a holiday movie dubbed as a \"Family Movie\" could have all of that.That is why the movie did not last very long and caused such a media storm that was unheard of for a so called \"Holiday Themed Family Movie\".I only watched the film on cable because it was directed by Bob(Porky's,From The Hip)Clark.I like Bob Clark.He directed two of my favorite movies of the 1980's,which are the ones described in parenthesis in between his name.My feelings for Bob Clark have not changed but this movie was the WORST movie of his career.That is why I give it two stars because I can not give one star to a Bob Clark film.He would later redeem himself with many other good films released in the years followed.But this film,it's a film that he should have thought twice about before taking the helm or even think of having a screenplay written.Overall,this is the WORST holiday movie ever made.This movie is so bad and boring that it truly belongs in the trash bin.If you want to watch a holiday comedy,watch Jingle All The Way,which is a very FUNNY movie that never goes stale with every viewing.This movie should have \"Avoid At All Costs\" written all over it because that's how bad it really is.Avoid it if you have not seen it.",

I remember the anticipation, the sucking up just this short of outright begging, and the day of days itself arriving and waking up to a new snowfall which arrived Just In Time.  I remember the real tree, the yards of lights practically shorting out the electrical system in the house, watching the snow fall while the radio plays, the bales of fake icicles that had to be swept up.  I also remember being a kid again; single file lines to everywhere, waiting for recess or (longer still) the final bell to go home, and, unfortunately, being mercilessly tortured by a bully until I snapped and pounded the tar out him.

Peter Billingsley (best known before this movie as Messy Marvin from those old chocolate syrup commercials) is precocious as Ralphie, and Melinda Dillon is good as Ralphie's mother.  But the real genius was the casting of Darren McGavin (a hero of mine since \"Kolchak: the Night Stalker\") as the old man.  About 60 years old at the time this movie was made, he was a little old to be playing the father of young children.  Still, to a kid Ralphie's age, a 40-year old man might seem as old as 60.  An inspired choice.BY the way, the screen play for this movie was based on several chapters in Jean Shepherd's \"In God We Trust - All Others Pay Cash\", which I also recommend very highly.",

His mom, his teacher, and Santa all agree he shouldn't get one, because \"you'll shoot your eye out!\" That's the main story.The Story has too many subplots. The subplots are so \"sub\" that they have nothing to do with the main story. Some of them last only one scene; others last several scenes. These subplots include his parents' feud with each other over a lamp shaped like a leg, Ralphie and his friends at the frozen pole, Ralphie having a swearing problem, Ralphie and his friends fighting with Scut Farkus, and others. Some of these subplots have a certain element that connect them a little bit, but the Story overall really took no talent to make it.Whoever-it-was that wrote this Story is not talented. The Story overall is *spoiler* Ralphie wants a BB gun, and he gets it at the end. What 8-year-old has written something almost just like that? Whoever-it-was that directed this Story is not talented. He didn't do anything to make the above Whoever-it-was' writing better than it was.Is this a classic movie? Maybe. But how did it become classic? I just don't know. It's not very big budget, it didn't make very much in earnings, and the humor is very minimal. Maybe the humor is a lot if you don't care about cleverness. All of the humor is stupid humor. You don't have to be smart to come up with it. I don't know much about all of you, but I laughed very little in the movie.On the positive side, I do like that it is quotable (although the only quotable lines are \"You'll shoot your eye out\" and \"You're starving people in China\"), I like the part where Ralphie is imagining shooting bad guys coming to invade his house (a little), and the part where Chinese guys are singing \"Fa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra\" (although this was not as good as I thought it was).I give it 3/10, and that's being generous.",

            "content": "A Christmas Story is a holiday film about children yet for adults. While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmas-themed classic, adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated, polysyllabic narration of Ralphie, filled with nostalgia and lucid memories, and the soft, high-pitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word. The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film, but a character wholly outside the story, reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes. Yet he is the heart of the film, the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Claus and a BB gun - it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke. To that end, \"A Christmas Story\" is a timeless masterpiece.A Christmas Story tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he searches for the golden, upheld idol of all red-blooded American boys: A Red Rider Air Rifle spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it- including an essay, a trip to Santa Claus and more. The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family - his irritable, foul-mouthed father with a good heart, his whiny brother Randy, and his sweet, all-American mother. It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes, but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film. The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story. He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment, Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing - only to have Billingsley note in his awe-filled, high-pitched voice that \"I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun. It's very good for Christmas.\" Most of humor is similar - the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Jean Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also, there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season - it's a movie everyone can relate to. There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power. I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child - in this case, the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously, A Christmas Story is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane or even It's A Wonderful Life but it is up there as one of the most cherished holiday classics ever made. It simply excels at its simple goals, and comes together as an extraordinary entertaining piece of cinema.9.5/10.",

The scene in which his mother has him show her \"how the little piggies eat\" grosses me out. That's why I rate it an 8.However I thoroughly enjoy the other characters. I like the idea of a time when using \"cuss words\" was considered shocking and wrong. Some have criticized the Santa scene. However it was Ralphies memory of it rather than what \"really happened\" As the Parkers are leaving the store we see \"reality\" and Santa is nice. I think Peter Billingsley did a great job in the lead role. Likewise for the other actors. When watching it is important to remember that the story is Ralphs memory of that Christmas.

The movie itself is based on the point-of-view of Ralphie Parker played by Peter Billingsley who does a fantastic job of portraying a kid who just wants one thing for Christmas, a `Red Ryder Air Rifle.' \t`A Christmas Story' is another Christmas movie made for the Christmas holiday centered on the secular and purely non-religious view of Christmas. But of course what has corporate America not touched. This film is all about the longing and desires of a kid who has not learned what Christmas is all about. To him it is about Santa Claus and how many presents are under the tree, but what kid doesn't think about that. There is no mention about the real meaning of Christmas or the birth of the baby Jesus. The only way one would find the name of God or Jesus in this movie would be through the comical yet offensive profanity of Ralphie's father Mr. Parker (Darrin McGavin). Mr. Parker's flagrant use of profanity seems to get little Ralphie in a lot of trouble, as any little kid always repeats what he hears, Ralphie seems to say things the other kids his age have never even heard before.\tNon-the less, the movie is very entertaining offering insight into Ralphie's mind and what he is thinking. Getting into the mind of someone who strives to get what he has always wanted, doing whatever he can to get his air rifle. \tI give this film 7, out of 10 stars. It was enjoyable to watch, although sitting through it again would be torture. The characters are lovable and do a great job of acting out people who are consumer driven to get that they want for Christmas. I recommend this movie to anybody who loves classic Christmas movies.",

Somehow director Bob Clark of PORKY's fame, and Jean Shepherd, the gentle radio humorist, made the perfect team to bring this nostalgic evocation of the great American yuletide celebration to the screen. Somehow they managed to capture the crazy quilt of joy and heartbreak, tedium and fantastic flights of imagination that make up the lives of children, and they did it with a marked lack of saccharine and a healthy dose of satirical humor besides.Peter Billingsley is remarkable as Ralphie, as realistic a little kid as you'll ever see in a movie. His friends, his rivals, even his little brother are equally convincing. The adults fare well too, particularly Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin as Ralphie's parents. The latter's towering portrayal of The Old Man, feared furnace fighter and master of profanity, is easily one of the funniest dads in cinematic history. Other delights: spot-on period production design, clever music cues, and Jean Shepherd's own voice of narration -- wry, expressive, wistful, and funny as all get out.If you haven't yet seen this, do yourself and your family a favor: buy the DVD and make it a holiday tradition.",

It was still worth a chuckle, but it's not a movie that holds up to repeat viewings.Around 1999, Turner Broadcasting got hold of this movie, and had a BRILLIANT idea: \"Hey, why don't we air this movie twelve times in a row on Christmas?\" A more bizarre and nonsensical programming decision has never been made.And yet, here we are, in 2006, and every blasted year, they still run a 24-hour marathon of this one movie.WHY? There are literally HUNDREDS of very good Christmas movies out there. Dozens which are infinitely superior to this gormless masturbation of inane reminiscence. TBS could spend the 24 hours from Christmas Eve to Christmas dinner showing Prancer, The Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street, or any of a hundred other movies--and that's not even going into the religious films they could show. And yet, against all logic, they roll out twelve back-to-back iterations of THIS.They have effectively run this movie so far into the ground, its vaunted snow is melting from the heat of the Earth's core.",

Most of the film centers around Ralphie, a boy obsessed with the idea of receiving a Red Ryder BB Gun as a Christmas gift. The story entails his visions of what exactly the gun would do for him. The defense of his family as a prime example. It contributes the strong belief children have in Santa Claus and the affect that has on them. Christmas brings the kids excitement and hope, in a rustic, 1940s, mid-western town that depicts these hopes through an American dream. The parents, the hard-working father, the home-making mother, together trying to make their boys Christmas wishes true. With humor and style, it finesses the mind into a tale of unparalleled American normalcy and desire. It takes over a perfectly painted idea of Christmas and America and sends the viewer into a whirlwind of jokes, ideas, folklore, and tales that build into the great overall tale that is told throughout the film.",

            "content": "It seems that American conservatives in the 80's and 90's have fallen in love with the \"golden era\" of the America they want to save: those innocent and charming 40's and 50's. While they tend to overlook the underside of those eras, their nostalgia seems well intentioned. This delightful film from humorist Jean Shepherd's stories will probably please them without offending.The main plot line is young Ralph's scheming to get a Red Rider BB rifle for Christmas. He must overcome the resistance of adults, all of whom feel it is too dangerous a toy: \"You'll shoot your eye out kid.\" Ralph is growing up in 1940's Indiana and the movie consists of a series of episodes from that one magical Christmas season. I particularly like this movie because it indulges in the nostalgia for that era without ignoring its limitations and absurdities.The nuclear family is alive and well, although the parents do fight on occasion. Christmas is just as commercial as it is now. The Higbee's department store Santa induces screams of terror in some children (I have seen this played out in malls myself). The Little Orphan Annie Secret Circle is exposed as little more than a marketing ploy, one that does not even fool Ralph. In short, Shepherd walks the fine line between reliving a magical time from his childhood, and being able to view it from a wiser, more critical stance. Shepherd clearly laughs at and loves that time in his life.More importantly, the film really captures what being a kid is like. The episodes just have such a ring of truth that they are still compelling today. One example: Ralph is helping his father change a tire but he drops the lug nuts on the side of the dark road and says \"Oh, fuck!\" He is then interrogated by his mother, squeezing Ralph to tell where he learned such a word. Ralph learned it, of course, from his father, a master of profanity. \"He worked in profanity the way some artists worked in oils or clay. A true master.\" But Ralph knows he cannot blame his father and so he names the first classmate that comes to mind. Was I the only child who learned to swear by hearing his father hit his thumb with a hammer?There is another scene that seems pulled directly from my own childhood. Christmas morning arrives, and Ralph opens a present from his aunt. It is a bunny suit, with ears and rabbit faces on the feet. The gift is awful and humiliating, but Ralph is ordered by his mother to model it. This scene alone is worth the rental fee. Ralph laments that his aunt thinks \"that I was perpetually four years old, and a girl.\" I never received a bunny suit but I did receive some gifts just as bad.The sets and cosutumes are perfect, and the voice-over (by Jean Shepherd himself) lets us into Ralph's world without being suffocating. The acting is wonderful all around, and the writing is delicious (Shepherd co-wrote the screenplay). Entirely suitable for families (even the \"F\" word is never actually spoken) and young children.",

I grew up in '50s (not '40s) Indiana, and I used to wonder if my nearness to the time and place made me love this so, but I've shown it to goths and death rockers and anyone else I can get to sit still for a couple of hours, and the strongly positive reaction has been almost universal. (But hey, I don't like guns and I don't eat turkey, but I sympathize with Ralphie and with The Old Man, so why should I be surprised?) The only thing I've ever found off-putting about this movie is the extent of the voiceover narration, although Shepherd's prose and his readings of it are so good that I can't complain much. I think what I like best about this film is its honesty. The dialogue rings true, and the acting is first-rate. I'm not only transported back to my childhood and what it felt like to be a kid, but I'm also reminded that I'm not too far different in some ways even now.

Some people find that funny but I find it unimaginative.There is a scene where the Ralphie character is in a room with his Mother and both of their bodies are facing to the right but Ralphie is looking over his right shoulder to the left of the camera for two seconds before, presumably, someone off screen indicates to him that he should be facing forward as his Father is coming into the room.Santa and his helpers in the department store are so impatient and ill-mannered that they wouldn't be tolerated in 1940 let alone when the movie was made.I had not one laugh during this film and kept thinking I don't want to see anymore of this and that perhaps it gets better because so many people like this movie.I have to rate this as one of the worst films I've ever seen.Stick with Home Alone as it is entertaining and has some genuine laughs.",

It's simply a movie that we can all relate to, if only for the anticipation of receiving that one special gift on Christmas morning. The humor is plentiful in this classic; Jean Shepherd knows how to expose how everyday events can be funny. There is a certain innocence in the film, probably due to the fact that it's being told from the viewpoint of a 9 year old boy in 1940s Middle America. Every one of the cast performed well in my opinion, the movie feels older than it is (only 20 years old as of this year). To sum things up, I can watch this movie numerous times during the holiday season (just got my yearly mega-dose, thanks to TNT), and I can honestly say that it never gets old. I'm even thinking of getting the DVD version sometime in the next year, that's how good a movie this is.

For this reviewer it was `Maybe when you're older' Well, 13 years later and still no Barbie Jeep.  For this reason, A Christmas Story really hits home with a wide variety of audiences.  Between a plot line that everyone can relate to, music that's very familiar and timeless and the huge generation that it relates too, it's almost impossible to dislike this movie. \tThe annoying whining little brother, the extreme father who gets you what you truly want and the mother who is always there to fix your boo-boos. There may not be a representation of every character in every family but there at least has to be one of these types.  That's what makes this story relatable to almost every person on this earth.  Also, the humor in the story and the burning heart's desire for that one toy in the world that would make you happy for the rest of your life are things that are common amongst people.  Life before mention this reviewer wanted the hot pink Barbie Jeep so she could `drive' around the neighborhood and catch up with friends.  Well, it never happened but this reviewer remembers that aching in the pit of her stomach from wanting it SO bad and the sadness of thinking that no one would ever get that for her.  Every child has gone through that it's just a natural part of growing up. \tAnd who has never seen Peter and the Wolf?  This is a classic cartoon that everyone has seen and has a VERY distinct `soundtrack' so to speak.  So using the classic melodies that have no words (which also adds to the timelessness of the music) is a smart idea for the different bully situations and etc. that occur in the movie.  Especially when Farkus (the bully) is walking up to Ralphie and his buds and then all of a sudden the `wolf' music plays, the eerie music that makes a person feel like something bad is about to happen.  This music adds depth to the story and wells up feelings within the audience. \tFinally, this movie is set in a time that many people were born in.  Many people are born all the time but nothing like the baby-boom era has ever repeated.  This said not only is the movie relatable but a LOT of people can relate to it.  Who wouldn't want to return to their childhood memories? Being 6, 8 or 10 years old were the best of times; no worries, you're starting to figure things out in life and play mates galore. Life was GREAT!\tSo it's been mentioned about a thousand times but this movie can reach out to every person in some way or another, the music is timeless and it's set during a time that a large audience of people can relate to.  A Christmas Story is a movie that every person should see even if they are at the risk of `shooting their eye out'.",

One of the reasons why these scenes are so effective is because they are somewhat exaggerated, yet very believable at the same time.

I believe they were on a summer vacation but I can't remember the name of the movie. I remember watching it as a little girl. It had the same narrator. I believe it had the same father. They were traveling in a car and stopped at various places. One scene I remember is a antique or flea market. I also think they stopped on the side of the road for lunch. I would really like to find out the name of the other movie. Can anyone help?",

Just hope my review is seen amongst this FORREST of \"good reviews\", which is kind of annoying.How do I start this...???Okay, I did like it when the bully got beat up - I enjoyed that, and I believe all bullies should receive a similar beating. I remembered that scene thoroughly when I viewed this film at a very young age at someone's house, I can't remember.But strangely, that's it. I remember NOTHING else about this film.I think this flick is mostly popular amongst people because of the \"nostalgia\" factor, not really because of the excellent writing, directing, or even the acting. \"Nostalgic\" doesn't mean \"better\" - it just means you're more attached to it.Almost everything else in this flick was just WEIRD or AWFUL. Why's the dad always a bad, crude example to his little kids? Why does he suggest they buy a lamp that's a lady's LEG??? Shouldn't that cause psychological damage in your youth?? WHY do they try to include the F-word in a Christmas, I repeat, in a Christmas film?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? When that scene happened, I felt like I was watching a completely different movie! The kid with glasses was socially awkward, also his brother, who stuffs his face in his food, and somehow it's \"funny\"??And what was with all the \"I want this gun, I want this gun\" business going on with this kid, but when he meets this weird Santa Claus, he can't give one sound of what he wants?? Why did the Santa in that shop have a wide-angle lens ??? Was there a point??Who calls the fire department when a kid gets his tongue stuck to a telephone poll??? I refuse to believe anyone can be THAT stupid. No big deal! Just use hot water to pour on the pole, problem solved!I think this film should to switch places (ratings, attention, hype, etc.) with the 1970 Christmas Carol musical \"Scrooge\".That film had effort, comedy, great acting, great music, writing, and spirit!So no this film shouldn't be considered or called a \"Christmas Classic\" 4/10 - little good, so much bad.",

A little child's toy gun is a small price to pay, but with parents, teachers, and even Santa insisting that he'll shoot his eye out, Ralphie's hopes surely dampen. \nThe feel of the movie is a lack, with Christmas coming and families rejoicing you see a light-up-leg lamp, and a child stuffing down oatmeal. While the movie still sticks to the same old bullies and pathetic little brothers, it also adds minimum humor, and corny situations. \nThe main character, Ralphie, knowing that he has very little hope of receiving his gift, goes into little blurbs of imagination where the viewer is bored with pathetic acting and nothing short of senseless babble. Dragging on for over an hour, the parents show little remorse and old-time parenting while Ralphie gets into a typical boyish fight.  Washing a little boy's mouth out with soap couldn't be less entertaining. \nOn a scale of one to ten (one being the lowest) this movie rates a four. The silly plot and barely ferocious ending leave something to be desired. Little kids who seriously neglect any action on the television screen may love this movie, while those who actually pay attention find it not only lacking, but completely irrelevant to the season.",

            "content": "This is not a sunny Southern California Christmas Story.  Rather, it is one for all who lived during the 1940s north of the Mason-Dixon Line in any of the small towns from the East Coast to the Mid-West where there is an old-fashioned town square with one department store where everyone goes and an old-fashioned `Santa' parade where the whole town comes out to end up standing in a long line for their children to sit on Santa's lap.You would not know that this film was set during the time of World War II. Except, if you looked really close you would see that the tires on Mr. Parker's car are bald.  There is no mention of wartime rationing or the lack of items to purchase because the country is at war during this time frame. I guess this 1983 film suggests that people were not `thinking' about the war.The film is a telling of the pleasant memories of 9-year old, 4th grader, Ralphie Parker (played by 12 year old Peter Billingsley) who only wants a `Red Ryder' Carbine Action Two-Hundred Shot Lightning Loader Range Model B-B Air Rifle for Christmas.  Ralphie shares his bedroom with his 1st grade little brother, Randy (played by Ian Patrella).  Somehow, Raphie must get the message to his parents that this is the one present he is dreaming of for Christmas.Mr. Parker known only as `The Old Man' is played by then, 61-year-old Darren McGavin (AKA: Carl Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974-1975) TV Series) Today, Mr. McGavin is 79 years old.  However he was playing the role of a father, maybe in his early 40s?  Mr. McGavin is a very talented and funny actor. Can you imagine growing up with a father who is this \"nutsy\" all year long, let alone during Christmas Time?Mr. Parker is married to Mrs. Parker played by Melinda Dillon whom today is 62 years of age.  Ms. Dillon (AKA: Close Encounters of the Third Kind - 1977) was at the making of this film 44 years old.  And, yet, Hollywood was able to \"pull it off\" pairing her with a movie husband who was 17 years her senior!  What goes on during this movie is hilarious.  We have an audience of 1,000 people in a classic films revival laughing out loud to scenes so good that they don't need a TV sitcom laugh track for people to know when it's funny. There is the classic method of the actual author, Jean Shepherd, speaking as an adult, unseen, talking over the film, telling the tale of himself as a young boy, as he remembers it.  This technique would be copied later during the successful TV series, The Wonder Years.We have events in the life of Ralphie that we can all relate to.  Being bundled up like a mummy to go out into the snow to walk to school.  We have an elementary school built in the 1920s of red brick with old-fashioned school desks and cursive writing samples along the chalkboard.  We have that schoolmarm teacher who towers over young 4th graders and likes to make the kiddies write theme papers.  We have that kid who takes the \"triple dog dare\" and gets his tongue stuck on the cold metal school flagpole.  We have those older school bullies whom wait before and after school to scare and intimidate the younger students for their own amusement until one boy can't take it any more and fights the older boy.  We have the boy who wears glasses and finds ways to break them.  We have children who dream up excuses to try to explain away their misdeeds to their teacher and parents.  We have the children whom (there is no TV during this era) lie on the floor and stare at the console radio and listen to the weekly radio program while waiting for the secret Orphan Annie decoder device to arrive in the mail only to be disappointed by the weekly secret message.  We have authentic furniture of the era and old two story \"granny houses\" with wrap around wooden porches \u0096 no modern ranch style homes in this town.  We have the trip to the Christmas tree lot and selecting a tree that we take home tied to the roof of a 1930's car.  We have standing in line for hours waiting to sit on the lap of the one department store Santa and the disaster that ensues during that encounter.  And, where does your family have Christmas dinner when the turkey is ruined?  In short, we have all the nostalgia of a young boy, your parents or grandparents, whom were born during the Great Depression and grew up during a great World War.  And these are just a few of the memories you may remember if you were a child during the 1940s.   \nChristmas time is only the vehicle used to tell this story.  Imagine being a young boy growing up all year long in such a household as the Parkers? There must have been \"wall-to-wall\" laughs all day, every day!Does Ralphie ever get his much-wanted air rifle for Christmas?\nI saw this movie in a classical renaissance 1,500-seat movie theater on a huge screen.  Try to see it that way, if you can.  Otherwise, ask to rent it at a video store!  Yes, this film is a \"9\" with Siskel and Ebert's Two Thumbs Up rating!",

The movie is about a little boy who wants a red rider bb gun more that any thing else in he world for Christmas but he is continuously told that he will shoot his eye. This does not discourage Ralphie for he has plenty of back up plans. And when even his ultimate plan, Santa, fails he becomes depressed and seems not to want to do any thing and when Christmas comes and there is no bb gun his father asks him if he got everything he wanted he replies almost then his father tells him to look behind the desk he does and finds another present he opens it and it is in fact his prized red rider bb gun  he runs out side to try it out and fires once hitting a metal target and the shoot bounces off and hits his glasses the final irony of the movie.This movie is genius in both the writing and acting aspect. The writer created the scenes and the jokes, but without the actors to play those scenes correctly the movie would not be nearly as funny. This movie is an American classic and one that is synonymous with Christmas. I would give this movie and A+.",

It is a timeless story because the setting is just that, a setting, not the premise of the story, as it could take place in any era, but it just so happened to take place in 1940's America. The narrated nature of it makes it feel more dream-like and surrealistic than historical, as Ralph daydreams about reality and certain moments have a prolonged, slowed down, or sped up quality to mirror the frantic or traumatic nature of certain events.

This movie, set in the 1940's, is what A Christmas Story is about. A boy named Ralphie played by Peter Billingsley who tries to convince his parents that a BB gun would be a great gift for him and it is indeed safe. He assures them he won't `Shoot his eyes out', Ralphie tries to overcome the challenges to get this gift.Even though this movie is predictable, it does have some notable scenes to mention.  One of the scenes is when Ralphie's Dad receives a lamp in the shape of a woman's leg as a gift and becomes very intrigued by this gift. Another scene is when Ralphie's friend gets his tongue stuck to a metal pole. Some of the scenes though were not very entertaining, for example, when Ralphie's family went out to dinner and they got stuck listening to bad Christmas Carolers. The acting overall was not bad. Peter Billingsley did a good job as playing a boy that would do anything to get his BB gun. Darren McGavin who played Ralphie's dad was believable portraying the man of the house.There are definitely better Christmas movies out there that show a better meaning for Christmas instead of just a boy wanting a gift. There are also better plots to some Christmas movies that are more creative, but overall this movie is pretty entertaining and not a bad movie to see once in awhile.This movie is 6 out of 10 stars.",

            "review_title": "At once a loving tribute and gentle satire of Christmas in the 1940's",
            "content": "When director Bob Clark was making \"A Christmas Story\" in 1983, he probably didn't know that it would go on to be a classic -- that 20 years after the fact, there would be cable TV stations that play the movie round the clock on Christmas day. As far as he knew, he was just converting the popular written and spoken work of Jean Shepherd, whose essays often dealt with his childhood in the 1940's Midwest.Culled from a number of different pieces by Jean Shepherd, and a few inventions of the director and cast, \"A Christmas Story\" is comprised not of a single story, but a number of Christmastime vignettes featuring the same family, all with a common element running through them (whether in the background or foreground). That element is quest of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley), one of the family's two boys, to receive the ultimate Christmas gift: a Red Ryder BB gun, or as he calls it, \"an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle\".Ralphie is absolutely obsessed with obtaining the BB gun. He leaves Red Ryder advertisements in his parents magazines, he fantasizes about saving his family from robbers, and even seeks out Santa's help when him mom tells him \"you'll shoot your eye out!\" Ralphie's quest is so important to him, his desire so strong, that the viewer can't help but identify with him, even if the Christmas present they once wanted above all others wasn't a BB gun.The narrative structure employed by \"A Christmas Story\" is not uncommon -- the most well-known example, apart from the movie itself, is \"The Wonder Years\", a TV show about a young boy narrated by his adult self. The juxtaposition of young Ralphie's actions with old Ralphie's words and thoughts makes his quest seem even more all-important, and creates not just a little hyperbole on the behalf of the elder Ralphie's memories.\"A Christmas Story\" is sweet, but it is far from saccharine. From Ralphie's constantly swearing father (a man seemingly ahead of his time) to the bitter \"Battle of the Lamp\", the film takes turns satirizing and paying tribute to life in the 1940's, especially during Christmas.If there is any reason that \"A Christmas Story\" has risen to stand with such movies as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Miracle on 13th Street\", it's because it is honest. The movie pulls no punches (except perhaps in the case of a certain word that isn't \"fudge\") and doesn't try to paint an overly idealized or cynical portrait of the era at hand. By using the actual memories of author (and in the movie, narrator) Jean Shepherd, \"A Christmas Story\" is infused with enough life and relevance to make it worthy of being a Christmas classic.",

A few are; one, with the neighborhood bully, Scut Farkus, and his little toad, Grover Dill, chasing Ralphie and his friends around before and after school, and, two, good ol' `triple dog dares' that result in having Schwarts getting his tongue stuck to the flag pole at their elementary school.

I'm sure glad I didn't judge the movie by the trailer. My son loved the movie, but I'm sure I loved it more. I can remember seeing Christmas toys in the store windows in Dayton's Department Store (now Target Corporation.) I never pushed my face against the window like Ralphie's brother, but I sure saw a lot of other kids do that. I still can see the frozen snot. And that was just one of the scenes from the movie. They went on and on, and every one so dead right on that I sometimes found myself sniffling. The school could have been my elementary school in south Minneapolis. The neighborhood bully was a neighbor kid. I beat him by not fighting. It absolutely drove him crazy. But I sure cheered Ralphie on when he beat up Skud Farkus. I had a Little Orphan Annie decoder ring, even though Tom Mix and Jack Armstrong usually got my dime. The house where Ralphie lived was exactly like so many of the houses I visited. The attention to detail was marvelous. And the scene where Ralphie puts down the toilet seat and Mom lifted the lid on a pot on the stove was mind-bogglingly funny. By the end of the movie I was heartbroken it was over and I immediately started to send or take my friends. Everyone had the same opinion. It was a classic. That's probably why I've watched it about a hundred times over the years. I expect I'll see it a hundred more before I go.",

It's full of little vignettes that are familiar to almost all audiences and evokes certain feelings about the holiday. It's a movie that draws from particular stereotypes of Christmas to create and atmosphere that everyone can relate to in someway. It speaks to all people, young and old, and is a great holiday movie for everyone. \t \tThe great part about this movie is how it almost secretly pokes fun at Christmas. It exploits all the stereotypes of Christmas in America in the Post Depression era. The child who becomes obsessed with a gift; the family's relationship and how they interact with each other; and many other realities that add to the `Christmas Experience'. I definitely recommend that you pay close attention and try to spot certain elements that may be stereotypical, or familiar to you.\tThis movie is filled with both hilarious and poignant moments. The children cast in this movie are very good choices. They're very believable and have good comedic timing, especially the young star that plays Ralphie. He embodies the spirit of every child during the holidays. He's full of mischief and ulterior motives, which I think, is present in all children in some form or another.\t`A Christmas Story' is a fun little movie with some serious underlying tones. I recommend it, even if you're not a fan of the usual Christmas movies. Check it out, but make sure to watch it with a critical eye and pay close attention to the satire. You won't be disappointed, I don't think. If so don't blame me, I didn't make the movie.\nOverall grade for `A Christmas Story':               C+",

            "review_title": "THE Christmas Classic",
            "content": "Thanks to TBS' annual 24-hour marathons, watching \"A Christmas Story\" on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day has become a household tradition for many. Choosing this film as the must-see holiday classic for the Big Day is a well-deserved honor. The movie has a wide family appeal and joyous warmth that wholly captures the Christmas spirit.Set in the 1940s, but released in 1983, \"A Christmas Story\" is riddled with nostalgia. Nevertheless, even kids watching today can appreciate the movie's acute grasp on a child's wonder surrounding Christmas. Much of that keen portrayal comes from Peter Billingsley's timeless performance as Ralphie Parker, a nine-year old boy eagerly awaiting the holiday in a small Indiana town. This season, Ralphie has his eye on a very particular gift: \"an official Red Ryder carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time.\"While Ralphie has his heart set on the gun, it seems as if everyone in his world is against him finding it under the tree on Christmas morning. His mother (Melinda Dillon), teacher (Tedde Moore), and even \"Santa Claus\" himself (Jeff Gillen) warn him that he'll shoot his eye out. It is Ralphie's top priority to convince them otherwise. Through Billingsley's performance as well as Jean Shepherd's narration as an older Ralphie recounting the story in retrospect, we come to deeply identify with the young protagonist, remembering the excitement and anxiety one feels as a kid approaching December 25th.However, the movie is about much more than a boy with an ideal Christmas gift. It is filled with episodic escapades between Ralphie, his family, and his friends. Through these side-stories, the film offers some of its most iconic sequences - Ralphie getting his mouth washed out with soap for swearing; Ralphie's mom and dad (Darren McGavin) fretting over a scandalous leg-shaped lamp in their window; and, of course, Ralphie's friend (Scott Schwartz) sticking his tongue to a frozen metal pole on a bet. While the Red Rider BB Gun gives the story direction, it's the copious deviations from that direction that have become so flavorfully memorable. It does not follow a generic Christmas movie structure, but creates its own by combining humorous originality with heartfelt familiarity.In chronological history as well as audiences' minds, \"A Christmas Story\" occupies a space between the classic Christmas movies such as \"It's A Wonderful Life\" and \"Miracle On 34th Street,\" and more contemporary additions such as \"Home Alone,\" \"The Santa Clause,\" and \"Elf.\" It possesses the humble simplicity of the former group, but also the vivacious energy of the latter. Maybe it is because of this central location that it continues to be so relevant, beloved, and accessible.Nonetheless, credit it still due to the wonderful child actors (both Billingsley and Ian Petrella, who plays Ralphie's little brother, Randy), a lovable script and voice-over from Jean Shepherd, and imaginative directing from Bob Clark. Because we've all seen \"A Christmas Story\" so many times, its magic can easily be taken for granted. In reality, though, this family-comedy could have gone unnoticed if initially taken in the wrong artistic hands. Its success is the product of soft yet masterful creativity, which keeps us tuning in year after year.",

All Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) wants is a bb gun, but no one thinks it's a good idea and they all give him the infamous one-liner \u0091you'll shoot your eye out'.  He tries almost everything he can think of to persuade his parents and even Santa Claus that he should get a bb gun for Christmas.  He tries the reverse psychology technique on his mom, he writes a paper about how great bb guns are for his teacher and him and his little bother Randy (Ian Petrella) go to the mall and wait in an enormous line to talk to a very impatient Santa Claus.  This movie is a true reflection for many of us who wanted that special toy around the holiday season.  I thought that Billingsley had great comical timing for such a young age, which really made the movie fun to watch.  I also like how there was more to the movie than just a boy trying to get a toy for Christmas. The movie showed bullies that picked on Ralphie and his friends, an overprotective mom, and there was a funny scene where Ralphie slips and accidentally says the f-word and later gets his mouth washed out with soap. These scenes were all very funny and made the characters seem real.  I liked how Ralphie's family wasn't depicted as being perfect and that they all had their differences, which kept the movie from being corny.

Yes, it can be said that it is a fantastic family film, but with a plot completely circled around corporate `America', and an annoying little brother to boot, this movie is not one a viewer could see more than once.This movie is circled around the fact that `America' has completely deserted the true `Spirit of Christmas', and left in its place the idea of \"presents, presents, presents.\"  Not once in this movie did the religious side of Christmas show through, instead, it only showed Ralphie desperately trying to receive his perfect Christmas gift.  This proves the fact that people have truly turned Christmas into a `Hallmark Holiday.'Ralphie's little brother is meant to add humor to the movie, instead he only further contributes to the attitude of  `I want!'  On Christmas day, it shows him eagerly reaching for his presents.  This is a good example of a child's point of view, but it goes to far when he loudly shouts, `This is MINE!  This is MINE!' when looking at each of his gifts. \nOverall, this movie is an okay film to watch as a one-time experience\u0085 but this reviewer would not recommend a second viewing by any means.

There are some hearty laughs in this movie, but for the most part, it's evokes pleasing grins and rememberences of the happy days of youth. The casting is so perfect that I couldn't conceive of anyone else in the roles. Having Jean Shepherd as the narrator adds the perfect touch. Daily life was so much simpler back then and it seems like everything was appreciated so much more. This movie doesn't have all the bells and whistles of today's releases - it has only humor, charm and nostalgia. Ralphie's face in the final scene is a reflection of my own at that point.   This is a true Christmas treasure!",

Watching his father's joy at sharing a parent child tradition does add to the final payoff.A Christmas Story is certainly worth taking the time to watch, maybe new viewers would do well to not get too hyped up before their first time viewing it.",

            "content": "Once again, American cinema has succeeded in making yet another materialistic Christmas classic.  \"A Christmas Story\" is a great flick for any family.  Filled with quirky characters, humorous anecdotes and good family fun, it's a shame for anyone to miss it.\n\"A Christmas Story\" puts the spotlight on Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) whose sole desire for Christmas is the coveted `Red Rider Air Rifle'.  Of course, the sassy little vixen he calls `mom', expresses her negativity towards the idea with the simple, but crippling phrase of `You'll shoot your eye out'.  From that point on Ralphie as well as the audience is thrown into an obscure network of scheming, deceit, and mind games as he tries to break down his mother's objection and somehow obtain the prized Red Rider Air Rifle. \nIn the simplest of terms, this is a fun movie.  The elaborate and embellished conflicts Ralphie faces in the film are complimented by Jean Sheppard's narration.  His voice and tone provides the audience with a clear glimpse of Ralphie's inner monologue (what he's thinking at the time), which at times is very random and funny.  By combining the two, Sheppard and Billingsley kept a fluid motion to the film by literally illustrating audibly and visually, which supplied the audience an explanation of what was going on in the story every step of the way.\nThis film had more than its fair share of kooky characters.  But the kookiest of them all was Ralphie's family, The Parkers.  Talk about a bunch of loose screws, it's never a dull moment when the Parkers are around. You've got Mr. Parker (Darren McGavin) the temperamental leader of the pack who likes to pick fights with just about any inanimate object the house has to offer (especially the furnace) and has got more curse words than 50 Cent, Eminem, and Ozzy Osbourne combined.  And don't forget Mrs. Parker (Melinda Dillon), the eccentric housewife who is (sad to say) the glue that holds this family together.  Last but not least, we have Ralphie's kid brother, Randy (Ian Petrella), who is the whiny little brat who refuses to eat, but instead play with his food, unless coaxed by Mrs. Parker to imitate how a `little piggy' eats his dinner\u0085Which generates a hearty chuckle as well as puzzles both the on-screen family and the live audience.\n\"A Christmas Story\" is a movie everyone can relate to.  It's an amusing depiction of the craziness all families dispense during the holiday season. Despite some of it's cheesy and sometimes-stereotypical scenes, like the `talented' group of Christmas Carolers at the Chinese restaurant (LAME!!!), overall the movie had great entertainment value.  The series of vignettes and daydreams provided by Ralphie kept the action and storyline far away from ever reaching a stale moment, which in turn helped boost the movie from receiving honorable mention, to BRAVO!  This movie is for everyone, especially if you're a Christmas enthusiast looking to get in touch with your inner child again.  Go watch this movie!\n\"A Christmas Story\" deserves a B+",

Probably the most memorable scene was where Ralphie got so fed up with Flick laughing at him and making fun of him that he beat the crap out of him. I think we've all been there!

            "content": "`A Christmas Story' is such a great example of a typical all-American family during the Holidays and for so many families, it is custom to watch this movie every Christmas Eve or Christmas day. It's so famous that even some television networks have 24 hour marathons for it during Christmas Eve. But what makes `A Christmas Story' so worthy of being ranked number 140 out of the Internet Movie Database's top 250 movies? What makes it a family favorite for so many? This movie revolves around a young boy (Ralphie Parker, played by Peter Billingsley) in the 1940's during the Christmas season. More importantly, the movie revolves around the fact that his only desire for Christmas is to receive a Red Ryder BB gun. Throughout the movie viewers follow Ralphie on his quest to persuade his family, teachers and even Santa Claus himself to get him the Red Ryder. But the only reaction that Ralphie gets is the all too well known, `You'll shoot your eye out'. Probably the most discouraging, but most memorable parts of the movie, is after Ralphie freezes up when meeting the impatient, in store Santa. As Ralphie realizes his mistake, he stops himself from going down the slide and tells Santa what he wishes for with astounding speed. After he tells Santa what he wants, his eyes seem to brighten up, and he smiles a smile that could melt anyone's heart, yet all Santa replies with is the famous, `You'll shoot your eye out kid'.        One of the best things about this movie is the `Wonder Years' style of narration.  It seems like there's no other way that this movie could have been done. Also, everything in the movie fit the time setting even though it was made in the 1980's. One of the coolest things was seeing the Wizard Of Oz characters running around the store as Ralphie and his little brother were waiting to see Santa. That really helped in making the movie more realistic, along with the costumes and music, everything seemed so right for the 1940's.          So maybe it's Ralphie's character, or maybe it's his family. But something about `A Christmas Story' really brings out the kid in everyone, maybe that it is why it is such a famous film. It could also be the feeling that the viewer gets when they see that Ralphie does get his Red Ryder. But one thing is for sure, this movie will always be a favorite for many and an American classic. This viewer gives it a 9 out of 10.",

Sentimental memories of watching \"A Christmas Story\" with my brothers is one of the many joyful things I associate with Christmas.

            "content": "In this humorous comedy directed by Bob Clark; Ralphie who is played by Peter Billingsly, his father \"Old Man Parker\" played by Darren McGavin, his mother \"Mother Parker\" played by Melinda Dillon, and a host of other wonderfully entertaining characters including Ralphie's brother \"Randy\" played by Ian Petrella, are pulled into Ralphie's hysterical journey to get the Christmas present of his dreams...A Red Rider BB Gun. From beginning to end this comedy is filled with moments that take you back to your own childhood. This story will pull you in as you take a trip down memory lane with Ralphie, Mother Parker, Old Man Parker, Randy and Ralphie's friends Flick and Schwartz. Along the way there are shootouts, dares, fights and a nontraditional Christmas dinner which all culminate into a great story. Unlike Jingle All the Way where Jamie Langston played by Jake Lloyd is waiting for his father to deliver his dream gift but not actively pursuing it, Ralphie is leaving nothing to chance and will use any means at his disposal to convince everyone around that the only gift worth having this year is a Red Rider BB Gun. One of the other great things about this movie is the Voice Over Narration done by Jean Shepherd who tells the story as an adult Ralphie. Jean does a great job of adding a different dimension to the film by warmly and humorously filling in history, gaps and information. Between his voice over and the special effects that help us to get into the Christmas spirit with cold and snow, this movie is definitely a winner.",

I fast forward through that.I thought the cast was very good especially the parents and the boy who had the lead role. There were many 9 year olds in the 1940's who still believed in Santa or who were starting to doubt but not ready to give it up yet. The character of Ralphie was the oldest child so had no older siblings who might spoil the belief for him. There was no TV then. Kids were allowed and encouraged to remain kids for longer. This was just after the great depression so perhaps parents wanted to prolong the happy, innocent child hood. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously. It is meant to be fun and it is fun.

Yes, in 1983 everyone making mainstream films made these assumptions (that everyone is hetero) but the complete absence of gay people is something that doesn't impress me as a gay person. Imagine if your people were consistently erased from film and television and you grew up, watching \"family\" entertainment that erased you from existence? The closest thing to a gay character is the bit part with the boy in line who likes the Tin Man and the Wizard of Oz. We're used as extremely tiny bit parts, as weirdos, and that's it.(Let's not pretend that Hollywood didn't know gay people exist. The entire underlying plot of All About Eve is about how gayness is evil and heterosexuality (heterosexual marriages in which women abandon their careers) is pure. The Children's Hour was about how sad, but necessary, it is for gay people to kill themselves. One of the very earliest American films, prior to homophobic censorship codes, showed two men dancing with a violinist playing. So, no, just because it was 1983 isn't enough of an excuse. We exist whenever someone wants someone to kick in the eye.)* That said, this film is just breathtakingly great from start to finish. The casting is perfect. The acting is flawless. The writing is fantastic.If you haven't seen the film you need to. It's nostalgic, funny, and heartwarming.*The opposite of this is seen in current television, where banal stereotyped gay characters are pretty common as more than bit parts. In this film, would it have ruined it for the Ralphie to have a second brother, one who is gay? No. It wouldn't have ruined the film. It would have made gay kids like me feel a lot happier when watching it with the family every year, growing up. I would have felt like I was valued and didn't have to lie about myself in shame, which I did at the time because everything told me that was the expectation.",

I collect them as well as Christmas sit-com episodes so that I can indulge in sentimental viewing to get me in the mood for the hot cider and chestnut season.  I saw A Christmas Story without high expectations, so I don't think I was expecting some masterpiece. I just don't get it.  My childhood was similar enough to Ralphie's, but I just don't can't get wrapped up with the story. A movie like this wants the audience to sit back and relax on a sentimental journey through nostalgic memories, but I get distracted by details I wish I could ignore. I realize the parents personalities and actions are exaggerated in Ralphie's eyes, but both Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon strike a false note in their acting, and while Ralphie looks like he lives in the 40s (or 50s), the parents look like they're living in 1983. I know I shouldn't get down on the producers for the limitations of a low budget movie, but how much more effort or money would it have taken to find period clothing for the parents and and do something with the mother's hair that resembled the styles of the time instead of an early 80s Stevie Nicks perm? This all sounds petty, especially since the movie does have its heart in the right place, but I just can't sit back and lose myself in this movie.",

But don't let that put you off this is a great treat for all the family. Unfortunately Its not well known this side of the pond unlike America where watching it is as tradiontal as turkey for Christmas dinner a situation which could be rectified by a channel showing it or by it's release on Blu-ray or DVD over here which sad to say is all rather unlikely due to the fact that its more of a interpretation of Christmas more familiar to Americans than us but we this side of the pond should enjoy Its available as either a us DVD or Blu-ray import It's sure to put you in the festive mood but most of all it's very funny .I highly recommend it.",

The movie is already rather popular and in some families it is a tradition to watch it every Christmas.  Anyone can see why it would be so popular too; it has great acting, it's hilarious, and it's a believable movie.  It's not one of those movies where everything is stuff that would never happen to anybody in real life.  Most of the things happening in the film are ordinary things that might happen to anyone.The acting in \"A Christmas Story\" is very believable.  Each actor/actress really makes their character seem real.  Every now and then Ralphie has a daydream and in those daydreams the acting is extremely fake and cheesy, but it is meant to be that way!  The actors/actresses are acting cheesy on purpose.  Seeing them act badly in Ralphie's daydreams and then seeing how they act throughout the rest of the movie helps the viewer to notice just how good and believable the acting jobs really are.  It separates the good from the bad.  The acting in \"A Christmas Story\" is just overall awesome!The music in this movie is, at times, rather unique.  It can be interesting too!  The music changes a lot throughout the movie.  Sometimes its music that is purely instrumental, sometimes its Christmas music, and other times its music being played on a radio by one of the characters in the movie. Most of the time though, the music fits what's happening in the scene.  The way music was put into this movie is wonderful and without it the movie wouldn't be as good as it is.There were no fake backgrounds or buildings in \"A Christmas Story.\"  It was all real.  The houses were real, the stores were real, everything was real. It was as if someone was walking around with a video camera taping the actors.  That's the way all movies should be, unless they are cartoons, of course. \"A Christmas Story\" is a great Christmas movie that is well worth watching and well worth owning.  It provides the viewers with entertainment and a big amount of laughs.  This isn't a movie too easily forgotten just like the line from it \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"",

This is a movie that relates to the people that were little kids and even adults during the time this movie is based on. This film starts out with a few young boys looking through the window of the most popular store. In this window every year around Christmas time the store puts up all of the things that bring little kids eyes to awe. The store sells things that every kid wants but most of all is a RED RYDER BB gun. \tThere is this little boy named Ralph and he wants one of these RED RYDER BB guns really badly. Though everyone he asks tells him that he is going to shoot his eye out. This film is mostly based upon the time when the biggest thing someone would own would be a stereo. It is more of a classic film then anything else, as through the movie Ralph the oldest son and his friends are bullied by these two boys. But that does not really bother him the main thing that bothers him is that everyone tells him no, to the one thing he wants most for Christmas the RED RYDER.\t He goes to school and comes home every day but that's not the regular scenario. His teacher gave the kids in the class an assignment to have a theme which is what they want for Christmas. This gives Ralph a chance to show the teacher how well he can write and that what he wants is not bad. But Ralph gets a C+ on it and is crushed, not only for the grade but because what the teacher wrote ( you'll shoot your eye out).\t Then on the way home Ralph and his friends are yelled at by the bullies, but this time Ralph cracked, he started hitting and hitting the bully. Then Ralph's little brother had to go get his mom just to get Ralph off of the bully. Well while Ralph was hitting the kid, he was saying a few cuss words, and he continued saying them while his mother was approaching. Ralph, his mom and brother went home and Ralph went up to his room and at dinner his mother told his father that he had gotten into a fight and his father did not get upset at all. \tRalph and his mom and dad and little brother went to the shopping center Ralph and Randy went to see Santa. Ralph told Santa that he wanted a RED RYDER for Christmas but then Santa said `that he would shoot his eye out'. So everyone that he has asked or talked about the RED RYDER said `that he would shoot his eye out'. \tOn Christmas and Ralph opens all of his gifts and then sits down on the couch and his mom and dad ask him if he got everything he wanted. He said ` almost' then his father says `what's that over there behind the desk' then Ralph gets up and goes over and opens it. What to his dismay was the RED RYDER that he wanted all along. He hurries up and goes out side and he shoots it and it comes back and hits his glasses, but didn't hit his eye. He makes up a story about an icicle and he is never questioned about the BB gun. \t \t I feel that this movie is wonderful not only for the adults but for the younger kids as well. It has comedy and everything that a good movie should. Not only that but the kid gets what he wants in the end, that's what every young person wants to see.",

When he would turn the paper in he would day dream about the teachers response to it and once he snapped out of it the teacher said `you'll shoot you eye out!' just like his mother ( Melinda Dillon) had said also when she asked Ralphie what he wanted.

So now Ralphie is guessing that he isn't going to get his BB gun, on Christmas day he frantically looks under the Christmas tree to find it not there, instead he gets a pink bunny outfit.

The plot of \"A Christmas Story\" is relatively simple, basically it's a young boy (Ralphie) doing everything in his power to obtain a Red Rider Air Rifle.  His first attempt to receive one for Christmas fails when he mentions that's is what he would like to his mother.  The response he gets is one that is less than desirable, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Next he thinks to ask Santa, \"the head honcho, the big man, the connection\", again his attempts fail.  Finally he thinks to write about the perfect gift in his school assignment, but when he gets the paper back his teacher, as well as everyone else, makes the comment \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"\n    Overall this was a good movie.  Key scenes were Ralphie talking with Santa and Ralphie receiving the bunny suit from his aunt.  Both scenes showed the comical side of Christmas, satirizing peoples feelings toward the holiday season.  This movie is good, clean entertainment for the whole family to enjoy.  With its portrayal of the holiday season, everyone can relate to the plot, which is what makes a good movie.",

It was uplifting and encouraging for all of us, especially friends who have loved ones in the military who have suffered loss of limb (and more!) and still find hope, in part due to motivational films like this one!! There is a strong message of courage, perseverance, and hope throughout!! We also enjoyed the child actors - both were excellent and it is encouraging to see home-schooled children make a \"splash\" in Hollywood without stooping to bad-words and disrespectful attitudes as the catch for drawing viewers! Although the young boy character, Sawyer, begins the movie with a troubled attitude and dislike for school, we watch his interest and passions evolve throughout the movie, which leads to an attitude improvement toward his Mom, as well. Really, every actor performance was top-notch, in my opinion! We recommend this film for everyone!!",

It is definitely part of our family Christmas movie canon.  In 1984 as I was surfing through some channels (no remote control), I turned to HBO in time to see the beginning of the \"flag pole\" scene.  I was entranced.  This movie is definitely about american family nostalgia and culture.   Phrases like \"You'll shoot your eye out\", \"Don't give me that look\", \"You're going to get it\" and others just resonated with me.  While the movie is set in the 40s, there were many completely familiar elements even for someone who grew up in 60s.  While my four kids truly enjoy the movie, I think some of the notions appear quaint perhaps dated.  Walking to school, sitting in the living room to listen to a radio program, BB guns, department stores, old-fashioned school bullies and one car families to name a few are becoming increasingly alien to middle class american youth.  The father played by Darren McGavin and the Mother portrayed by Melinda Dillon are perfectly cast.  The narration by Jean Shepherd provided the exactly right accent and pace to the story.  This is a amusing and pleasant tale about a caring family's \"adventures\" (no kung fu, stunts, or special effects) leading up to Christmas in a time before TV, malls, video games, walkmans, web surfing, DVDs, and cell phones when the pace of family life was just a little bit slower than it is now.",

It seems like a significant detail to overlook, when everything else is so period-perfect. Ralphie's teacher sports a more typical style. Mrs. Parker looks like she got a cheap home perm, and then stuck two barettes in it. In any case, it's a movie we look forward to every year.",

The screenplay, based on the work of humorist Jean Shepherd is totally believable in its depiction of mundane middle-class Midwestern life. The father figure for example, (portrayed brilliantly by Darren McGavin) patriarch of the Parker family, is larger than life in young Ralphies eyes, yet bumbling and simple all at the same time. The story purposely dates itself in terms of setting, which only helps to strengthen the nostalgic Americana time-long-past feel of the picture. Make no mistake the phenomenon in the re-playability factor of this film is in part because of the dysfunctional Christmas Story for which many of us can all relate, but there is a real human spirit in the story, a quest for the seemingly unattainable, and a sense that many of the trials of which we endure and cherish as people, are the greatest stories of our lives.",

Christmas time is a wonderful time of the year and has to be one of my favorites. The cheer, the season, the friends and family, the gifts, and of course everyones' favorite: the music. However this is not a review of the Christmas Season, but of the movie A Christmas Story. You all know the one. The one that plays one repeat on TV during the whole day of Christmas and you know right there might actually be its problem. Oversaturation! This movie has been scene a million billion jillion zillion times and will be seen that many times more, but maybe there is a reason for that. It is a classic. It is nostalgic. It what Christmas tradition means. It has the visit to Santa. That one gift you wanted for Christmas when you were a kid more than anything else in your entire life. Christmas tradition is what this movie is all about and that is okay and that is what makes it memorable in our hearts. We can all in some way relate to the movie if we look for it.Now this movie is not without its flaws, not only is it over-saturated, but it is not really with the times. Your parents might say that that is what Christmas was like when they were young, but it has been many years and with that time there has been more change than ever before. We have made advances in technology in leaps and bounds making for a different Christmas experience than one portrayed in the movie. In the end this movie is all about tradition and if this movie is part of your Christmas tradition than continue to have yourself a Merry Christmas.Flaws: Oversaturation and not really up with the timesStrengths: It is a classic, it is traditional, and fills you with timeless laughs",

It doesn't have the warm holiday glow or old-fashioned nostalgia of Wonderful Life or White Christmas, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; this film occupies a category almost by itself.There are some who have expressed a distaste for the film, and I imagine it's for many of the same reasons that some didn't care for The Grinch in 2001.  If you watch this film thinking it's about Christmas, or about a BB gun, or to be funny in the traditional sense, you will probably come away disappointed.  However, if you just sit back and take in what is given to you, it is almost certain to draw you in with its charm.The basic premise of the story is that Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) is on a quest to get a prized BB gun for Christmas.  The true shine of this film is in the details that surround it.  The story is narrated by an adult Ralph (voiced by Jean Shepherd, who also wrote the book whereupon it's based, In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash), likely a brainchild for the Wonder Years format.  And he tells it in fine form, giving the events of an 8-year-old boy the visage of an epic story, which to a boy that age, things like BB guns and bullies and radio programs (50 years ago) were indeed the foundation of the world.Adding to this winning formula, hilarious yet common occurrences pepper this film with humor: boys flash-freezing their tongues to flagpoles, having one's mouth washed out with soap, sending in vouchers for secret decoder pins, the overactive imagination of a child, the taboo of dirty language, hideous clothing your aunt made for you... each with their own punch line which I dare not spoil here.What makes this everyday brand of humor hilarious are convincing performances by Billingsley, Ralphie's mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin), the idyllic Midwestern setting, the nostalgia of the 40s that perhaps has drawn in older audiences more than younger... it just FEELS like a typical American family.  Relating to these characters is critical to making the subtleties of this film effective, and I think it is pulled off splendidly.Today's moviegoers may prefer The Grinch or Christmas Vacation for yuletide humor, and both are fine films in their regard, but I find myself without fail laughing harder at this quiet surprise than either of those.",

The casting is perfect with Darren McGavin as the crotchety but lovable father, Melinda Dillon as the beautiful, fun-loving, and long-suffering mother, and Peter Billingsley as Ralphie. Billingsley is  every 9-year old American Boy, with his overactive imagination and dreams of  a  Red Ryder BB gun. This film has many funny moments, and some poignant ones too. But what makes this film work is its authenticity. Whether its Ralphie imagining himself going blind from \"soap poisoning,\" his little brother's terror of sitting on Santa's lap, or  the scene where he confronts the schoolyard bullies, every  scene rings true. The narration by the story's writer, Jean Shepherd, is an added bonus. It's a gem! P.S.  To all you Grinches who hated this movie, why don't you go and watch another Tarrantino flick.

It simply never gets old and the impenetrable web of BB Gun mania instantly gets me in the Christmas mood.Most people have already said most of what makes this movie great, the instant identification with the characters regardless of generation. In fact I beat up the neighborhood bully on a snowy day in a manner eerily similar to the Scott Farkus affair. And Ralphie waking up on Christmas morning is exactly as it happened in my household, not the wide awake `oh golly look what Santa brought us.' but the slow waking up and the realization that it was Christmas a few minutes later. But the greatest aspect of this movie is that it never bogs down in sentimental sweetness towards the end. I remember seeing Home Alone when I was much younger and while I liked the initial scenes of Kevin's mayhem the whole family thing bored me. The same problem occurred with Elf. Not here, it remains hilarious throughout while still retaining its realism. Throughout it all Ralphie's old man remains the foul mouthed furnace fighter, he doesn't suddenly become a saint he simply gets Ralphie a BB gun. Ralphie doesn't learn a lesson in charity or Christmas magic, he nearly kills himself and then lies to his parents like so many kids have done with their favorite dangerous toys. And because of this when Ralphie finally gets his Red Rider BB Gun it's almost like I'm getting the gift, that moment is probably the only time a movie has brought me to tears of joy.Watching this movie makes me wish egg nog was in stores year round.",

I love the main characters in the movie which is played by Melinda Dillion who plays the mom in the movie. and Darren Mcgavin who plays the dad in the movie. The movie is a comedy, classic. Melinda Dillion did a great job as the mom. Darren Mcgavin did a great job paying the dad in the movie. Ralphie does have a friend in the movie, which is Flick. The Teacher in the movie did a great job in the movie. Also i love the music in the movie. In a Christmas Story to my opinion there's a little magic in the movie. but, I can't tell you. Also if you haven't seen a Chrsitmas Story then you need to. I highly recommend a Christmas story to anybody. Watch out they do say a lot of bad words in the movie.",

            "content": "We watch the movie A Christmas Story every year and always notice new details we missed the year before.  As a person that grew up in the same town Jean Shepherd did,(Ralphie in the movie), Hammond, Indiana, I can tell you every detail in the movie is true to the location and era which it depicts. I am a little younger than Jean but call still recall vividly a lot of the images brought forth in the movie. I became so caught up  with the movie and the book from which it comes I began researching actual locations at the Hammond library. Jean lived in the 2900 block of Cleveland Street not far from where I grew up as a child in the 6400 block of Monroe Street in Hammond.  The house is still there but looks a little different than the one depicted in the movie.  For you book readers, Flicks Bar is actually near Jean's house and is located on Kennedy Avenue just south of the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad overpass.  Goldblatt's Department Store was in downtown Hammond where the Santa scene takes place and was torn down several years ago.  I have a brick from the building in my basement.  It is strange but there is a family not far from where Jean's house is located that displays one of Hammond's finest outside Christmas displays called Peteyville.  Much of the display brings back the joy of Christmas's of that era.  Another strange fact, we have friends at our church that bought the house that Jean's brother, Randy, lived in for a period of time.  Harding School is about 4 blocks to the east of Jean's house and has a flag pole in front. He simply walked east on Cleveland street which dead ends at the school playground.  It looks almost exactly like the school in the film although it is was not filmed in Hammond, Indiana.  They went to great lengths to find very similar matches.  The movie is a true classic and a must see for anyone who grew up in northwest Indiana in the 40's or 50's.  It truly represents the golden days of our childhood, a time that will never be lost thanks to Jean's witty and heartfelt story.",

He tried out all the stories on his improvisational radio show on WOR, New York, before working them into the novel on which the film is based. When he was doing the radio show, \"Flick Lives!\" signs appeared on New York walls and subways. Unlike most Christmas fare, the nostalgia has a satirical edge to it that keeps it from being too sweet. The performance by Melinda Dillon as the mom seems dead on to me, as does Darren McGavin's work as the dad. Classic moments include the tongue stuck to the flagpole and sad fate of the glowing-leg lamp. And of course we all know that if you get a BB gun for Christmas, you will indeed shoot your eye out.",

But by relenting some years to watch it after all my favorites had been seen, I have to admit that it has grown on me to the point that this past post-Thanksgiving season I actually ordered myself a DVD copy for my holiday movie collection. Now I will look forward to watching it each year. *** What totally surprised me however was that there was a follow-up to this movie about Ralphie and the Parkers but which takes place the next summer titled: It Runs In The Family (also titled early on as My Summer Story). Being made 11 years later (1994) all the actors are different but for one heartwarming tie to A Christmas Story; the adult Ralphie narrator (also again writer/producer) remains Jean Shepherd. That plus a homage to the original early in the movie draw you right in. If you liked the original then I'd guess you will want to see this followup, with all its antics, frustrations, and silliness. I liked Charles Grodin and Mary Steenburgen as the parents and although it was a struggle for me initially to warm up to another young actor as Ralphie, he grew on me by the end of the movie. Interesting fact is that Ralphie and his younger brother Randy are played by two of the younger Culkin brothers; Kieran and Christian. I will probably want to add a copy of this to my collection if for nothing more than the tie to the original. Grab some popcorn and watch were the Parker family take you the following summer.",

One of the biggest is that it provides an antidote of sorts to the saccharine overdose one can suffer from watching too many Xmas movies. Okay, so it isn't \"Citizen Kane.\"  It seems to me, though, that those who negatively critique this film are missing the point and expecting too much. It's FUN.  It's silly. It's not intended to be a serious film.  Films shouldn't always have to be deep statements on the human condition or be accurate and convincing in every detail to be enjoyable.  And it defies imagination how someone could say that \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" is a great holiday film, and then so openly badmouth this flick.\"A Christmas Story\" views the holiday through what seems to me a typical kid's-eye view.  Ralphie Parker is the kid's Everyman, positively aching for The Big Day to arrive, using every ploy, no matter how ridiculous (Grizzly bears near Pulaski's Candy Store?) to get his coveted BB gun.  I particularly enjoy Ralphie's little daydreams; the outlandishness of a nine-year-old's fantasies is well-depicted here.Though the world presented is a little bit of a caricature, much of the film's view of childhood and Christmas strikes home.  It doesn't present a sugar-coated, romanticized view of childhood, a big plus in my book.",

This movie is based in the 1940's, but entails the same exact feel; every child has felt during Christmas. This movie brings out the true essence of the Christmas joy. The main character is a young child by the name of Ralphie, his adult figure narrates the whole movie as a serious of memories of the Christmas he get his Red Rider BB Gun.  Through the narration we too see and experience all of Ralphie's childhood memories. Most every American child can in some way relate to the excitement and experiences Ralphie is going through on the weeks before the big day. The movie starts out with Ralphie looking through a department store window, and being in awe of the rifle that sits in the fake snow. The movie then flashbacks to the 9 year old Ralphie's attempts at getting his BB Gun.This movie doesn't only encompass the exact feel of the American Christmas but is very funny. From the Chinese carolers to the leg lamp, to the famous line `you'll shoot your eye out', this movie keeps coming at you with very subtle realistic comedic situations. Randy is the perfect picture of the little brother. Randy and Ralphie have the perfect relationship as brothers; they can hate each other at times and some times feel sympathetic towards each other. The father is a stubborn set in his way character that I just love. The mother is a loving yet not submissive wife that has so many qualities most people can see in there own mother.  Ralphie's friends are smart mouth yet very normal kids.This movie brings everything together perfectly and touches on every part of ones Christmas celebrations. With absolutely clever comedy added to every aspect of the movie. Most importantly it brings in the Christmas feel better than any other Christmas movie out there. It's a movie everyone can relate too. My father for example one year wanted a BB Gun for Christmas, and when he finally got it, the first shot he took he ends up shooting himself in the cheek. The fact that his name is Ralph makes this story even weirder. Probably your experiences aren't so closely related to the movies, but most everyone can relate to either going to the department store to visit Santa, or running down the stairs Christmas morning with a huge wide eye look. If you need to get into the holiday spirit I guarantee A Christmas Story will help get you there. When I watched it I couldn't wait to go get our tree or start opening presents Christmas morning.  This movie truly does bring the holiday spirit to a level in which we all can relate and enjoy.",

Admittedly, I don't see it every year and think the TBS marathon is a little much. But this is the only Christmas movie I know of that has recognizably human characters with all their frailties and character flaws but makes you love them nonetheless.

If you want to see a really gross and unwatchable Christmas movie, try \"Bad Santa\" for cryin out loud! \"A Christmas Story\" is pretty low-budget, but that becomes part of its scrappy charm.

            "content": "This is an extraordinary movie. This movie brings back childhood memories in many people childhood. It doesn't matter what race you are, I think many people can relate to this movie.  When I was young, like Ralphie, I craved a particular toy at Christmas that I wanted very badly.  In Ralphie's case, it is the Red Ryder Rifle.  I wanted an Easy Bake oven which could bake little cakes and cookies. Mom, on the other hand, was afraid that I would get burned or accidentally set the house on fire.  No debate of safety would change mom's mind.  When the teacher asked us to write about what we wanted for Christmas, like Ralphie, I wrote about the one thing I really wanted, and had no real chance of getting - the Easy Bake oven.  I did not get a bad grade, but she did note it.  Her exact words were, \"Quite a gift.  Please be careful, those things are dangerous.\"  Attached was a Fire Drill pamphlet. Needless to say, the Easy Bake oven was history, never got one.  This is definitely a good movie to watch when you want to drift back in memory to the 'Good old days' when Christmas had true meaning.  The generation today have swayed very far from its meaning.  Children get gifts and toys every day, so, when Christmas come around, to many, it's just another day.  Give me the good old Christmas or the 'Ralphie' kind of Christmas any time.",

            "content": "An incredibly charming and hilarious Christmas movie suitable for all ages. This semi-autobiographical story by Jean Shepherd (who also does the voice-over of grown-up Ralphie) recalls an idyllic childhood in middle America in the innocent 1950's. Ralphie is a ten year old boy bent on getting a Red Ryder Daisy Air Rifle for Christmas. His mother is equally determined that BB guns are too dangerous - \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" But it's not about the BB gun. Loaded with off-beat humor and quirky characters, this story celebrates family life and the perils and misadventures of being a kid. No matter where you grew up, or when, you will identify and commiserate with Ralphie's travails - and those of his long-suffering parents - in this Christmas treasure. It has become as much a part of my Christmas season as Bing Crosby and decorating the tree. Add it to the must-see list!!!",

The bell rang. Flick: Don't leave me! Come back! Come back! Ahhh. The mother reminds me of my mom too. When she dresses the little brother in his snow pants, I thought of my mother.

Perhaps my underlying problem is that I never wanted a BB gun -- nor any other type of gun -- and to this day don't understand the appeal. So I cannot relate from the get-go.

The scenes that people keep describing as silly or unkind are that way because the story is told just as Ralphie remembers it years later.  Sure, a department store Santa isn't likely to kick a kid down a slide.  But a kid who's desperate to get his Christmas wish (and who sees everything as an obstacle to his goal) is likely to remember it that way.  The great thing about the movie is the warm way it evokes nostalgic simplicity.  For those who complain about the lack of a plot, anything more complicated would undermine the purpose of the film.Anyway it's a great movie, and those of you who hate it should think back on your own childhood then give it another try.",

I don't understand why people bash this movie, it is a great little movie (without any big-name actors).  This movie has been a tradition in my family for many, many years ever since it came out twenty years ago. I remember watching this movie on TBS and TNT every Christmas Eve and Day. I don't know why TNT runs a twenty-four hour marathon (i.e. playing it over and over twelve times on said holidays), but it is an yuletide classic that gets you in the spirit of Christmas.  Every Christmas Eve, I go to my maternal grandparents house for the annual Christmas party.  After we get through eating dinner and opening gifts, I would go into their bedroom, turn on the TV, tune it to TNT and watch it, no matter what time it is or what scene it's in!  What I am worried about is that TNT might wear out the tape it is on (they probably dub the contents of the tape onto a new one every year, I don't know!).  On Christmas Day, I open gifts, go to my paternal grandparent's for Christmas lunch (steak & baked potato), open more gifts, and watch the movie, no matter what time it is on or what scene it's in just like before!  And if that is not enough, I own the movie on tape and when it's not on TBS and/or TNT, I just stick in the tape and let it play through!  When I wear out the tape, I am getting the Special Edition DVD and play it to my heart's content (can you wear out a DVD?)!

            "content": "A Christmas Story is one of Hollywood's wonderful contributions to our Christmas tradition. The genius of the story is that it pokes fun at our very egos, vanities, and material lust, (and that other kind of lust!), while keeping everything within the confines of an All-American household of young Ralphie and his baby brother, during the \"peace and love\" Christmas season at that.Every day in Ralphie's life is a day dominated by urgency and angst,. Even using the bathroom to use his Little Orphan Anny decoder ring becomes a frantic battle for Ralphie, because of course his baby brother needs to use the bathroom AT THAT VERY INSTANT. (Uhh.. who among us hasn't resented having their secret code-mission territoriality invaded by lesser beings using such commoner excuses??) \"Jealous of a plastic lamp?\" Ralphie's mom says, after smashing the lamp her husband (\"the old man') has idolized as the symbol of his middle-aged virility restored by the magic of Christmas time. Notice carefully: She IS jealous of the sensuous sexuality evoked by the lamp. It is only when her husband says \"Yeah, you're jealous that I won a MAJOR AWARD!\" that she regains her composure, and is able to dismiss her sabotage of his \"major award\" as the (his) over-the-hill folly that it really is. The movie keeps jumping back and forth over this line of sexual identity, prowess, and respect afforded to us by society based on those elements. Just watch the interchange between mom and dad when Ralphie is forced to wear Aunt __'s infamous pink rabbit outfit. (\"My aunt labored under the mistaken perception that I was eternally four years old, and had been born a girl.\") Here it is MOM who is on the ridiculous side of the sexual identity argument (\"Oh Ralphie, you look adorable in that!\"), and her husband who comes to Ralphie's rescue. Ralphie knows that if any of his friends ever saw him in that outfit, it would make the rest of his schooldom an eternal hell - who among us hasn't been vulnerable to such a social disaster forced on us by forces beyond our control?) Even avoiding the doom of having to wear the insane pink rabbit outfit, Ralphie and his friends have to run the gauntlet of schoolyard bully Farkus and his toady sidekick. When (in a blitz of fighting frenzy) Ralphie turns the table and whoops Farkus, the fight is stopped by his Mom, and later Ralphie's brother hides in the cabinet under the kitchen sink, Randy terrified that \"Dad's going to kill Ralphie\" (for fighting). Mom placates Randy by offering a glass of music and leaving him in his under-sink cubbyhole, and that evening downplays the fight, winning Ralphie a commutation for his pending sentence (of doom, from his dad, for fighting). Ralphie says, \"From that time on, my relationship with my mother changed\" - no longer an emasculated little rabbit-girl, Ralphie is now her little warrior man-child. (But note: the emasculating pink-bunny outfit scene actually comes later in the movie.)That is the genius of the movie- Ralphie betrays his friends to be beaten up by Farkus, he exhibits serial cowardly deceit, denial, plotting and scheming - but HE WANTS THAT RED RYDER BB gun, and will FIGHT the forces of evil to get it: including his mom and teacher (both dressed as witches scoffing at his lack of virility in the \"cheesy acting\" scenes), and of course Ralphie battling \"INSENSATE EVIL\" in its most pure form, picking off (shooting, killing) Black Bart's insensate gang while his mom and dad cower under the kitchen table. These cheesy scenes are the Cream Topping of the movie (please forgive the mixed gastronomical metaphors!) - Ralphie may be a child, but his \"Dead Eye\" virility whoops the evil Black Bart's gang, secures Mom's safety, and dad is grateful, even if he has been demoted to cowering under the table.Greed, lust, \"unbridled avarice\", humiliation, abject terror, the terrifying drunken Santa Claus - these aren't children's themes, these are adult themes! Yet through the magic of Christmas, the magic of childhood, the MAGIC of Hollywood, we can poke fun at these human flaws, and thereby poke fun at ourselves. Chirstmas is about REDEMPTION, about a helpless infant conquering the sins and flaws of this world, and this wonderful movie captures that \"TRIPLE DOG DARE\" magic . Even as our lives are beset by fears, chaos, uncertainty, and insecurity, yet our innate, innocent (if scheming) childhood goodness triumphs over all. Bravo for Hollywood! Bravo for Christmas! Bravo for childhood!",

I never get tired of this movie no matter how many times I see it and I don't care if I watch it in Spring or even Summer, it's still one of my all time favorite movies!",

I went as far as recording it.  Not to watch it over and over, but to find out who wrote it.  Just listen to the common saying: The book is always better than the movie.  It's based on In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash and the general works of Jean Shepherd.  He wrote most of the funny chapters for Playboy Magazine, it tells you below the copyright notice.  I have yet to buy a copy to see if he still writes for them.  I just found this ironic because most of the chapters are rated PG and not XXX.  Anyway, don't buy the movie, instead, do yourself a favor and buy the book.  It's just as funny, but more clever.",

There were several occasions when I was tempted to turn it off, but so many people are such fans that I thought I'd continue. Surely the good part was coming. (It wasn't.) Outside of the overtly racist Christmas caroling at the Chinese restaurant, there wasn't anything I remotely enjoyed about it. (Yes, I found fa-ra-ra-ra-ra to be funny) But at least I don't have to be the one guy that didn't see it. So there's that.",

Yesterday my Daughter, grandson and I went to the St Catharines, Ontario Museum which is on Lock 3 of the Welland Canal and take a tour through their vaults where they have the original Red Ryder BB gun, with cardboard  box, that was in the movie A Christmas Story. This was partially filmed in St. Catharines in 1983. It was really neat to be able to touch (with with gloves on) a great piece of history! We were lucky enough to have local press there and my Daughter and grandson made it into the local papers holding the gun. The museum said they only give this tour once every 5 years, so we felt very fortunate!",

Saw the scene where Ralphie breaks his glasses in the process of testing out his Red Ryder. I would swear there was a scene in that section of the movie where Ralphie kills a bird, but that scene did not play. The next thing you know, the parents are cuddling by the fire and the kids are in bed. Ralphie is dreaming of his adventures and that's the end of the movie. I would swear there was a scene cut out, maybe for TV? Does anyone think I'm right about this? Love the movie, it will always be one of my favorites at Christmas time.",

It really shows what Christmas used to be which made me realize how far this country has gotten to really appreciating the spirit of Christmas. I won't give any part of the movie away because so that you can better appreciate the movie the first time you see it; however, it is quite funny. The movie itself is funny but the narration adds to the humor. This movie is a classic and it is no wonder that this movie has become so popular as well as all the figurines that go with the movie. If you love this movie as much as my mother and I do, you will be a fan and before you know it - you'll be collecting the figurines too.",
