            "content": "So here it is, the landmark film which ushered in the Nouvelle Vague, introduced Francois Truffaut and his screen persona Antoine Doinel to the world, and changed the direction of cinema for ever.  And an impressive piece of work it is, too.     By 1959 the process of film-making had atrophied (artistically, at any rate).  Stale and stagey artifice was the norm, and for the upcoming generation of film-makers and critics (Truffaut was both) a new way of conceiving cinematic art had to be found.  In this, his feature film debut, Truffaut found it.     This is cinema verite at its freshest and best.  The film looks like a documentary and absolutely drips with kitchen-sink candour.  A handheld camera follows Antoine around his parents' flat and we get to peer in on the grimy, cramped and oh-so-ordinary minutiae of a humble little life.  \"Don't forget the garbage,\" Antoine is repeatedly told, and Truffaut certainly doesn't.  He pulls off with resounding success the seemingly impossible feat of making the mundane seem entirely absorbing.     \"C'est peut-etre un question de glandes,\" suggests a teacher as we see the adolescent Antoine go quietly off the rails.  Paris (or more accurately, that part of Paris bounded by Montmartre and the Gare du Nord) is wintry and stark, the unlovely and prosaic environment in which Antoine functions - or fails to function.  Truffaut wants, inter alia, to deflate the \"April In Paris\" myth so virulent in the 1950's.  He succeeds mightily.  Antoine is disaffected.  Parents, home and school are all inhospitable and the sleety, foggy streets south of Pigalle convey Antoine's alienation admirably.     Deadpan humour is a powerful weapon in Truffaut's armoury.  Antoine's inept note-forging, the outlandish excuse which he gives for his absence and his long-suffering look during his mother's reminiscences are all nicely done and raise a chuckle.  The bird's-eye view of the P.T. class, shot with a rooftop camera, conveys wordlessly the comedy of the rapidly diminishing line of pupils.     A punch and judy show is filmed from inside the performance canopy, looking out onto the audience of small children.  Their total lack of artifice is delightful to see, and underscores Truffaut's point - candour is beautiful, staginess is unacceptable.  As Antoine's father frogmarches him along the street after the typewriter debacle, bemused passers-by stop to stare at the camera.  Not only is this disarmingly honest, it is also profound.  Cinema should exist, as it were, inside the camera, not in elaborate sets.  Antoine rides in the spinning drum at the fairground, the camera fixed rigidly on him, allowing the onlookers to dissolve into an undistinguished blur.  The camera IS Antoine's subjective self.     The performance of 15-year-old Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine is astonishingly good.  He is natural and engaging, and his soliloquy (delivered to the psychologist) seems an incredible piece of work for so young an actor.     A long, long tracking shot accompanies Antoine as he runs away from it all, and is intended to convey, by the very rhythm of his breathing, the internal subjectivity of a child who has been let down by his parents and his society.  The final freeze-frame, with no histrionic fireworks, no resounding words and no tidy denouement, closes the film on a note of immense emotional power.  Antoine is alone.",

            "content": "Every day life, however 'real' and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's \u0096 films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.After viewing Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows', I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. Nothing is cut and dry in 'The 400 Blows'. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a 'so what' feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel's life \u0096 anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of 'The 400 Blows', it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut's cinematography in 'The 400 Blows' is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like 'An American in Paris'. This is Paris from a Parisian's perspective \u0096 and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian \u0096 the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about 'The 400 Blows' and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'The Four Hundred Blows'.--Shel",

            "content": "THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut - France 1959).Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) has troubles at home and at school. Ignored and neglected by his parents, his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken a secret lover. Added to this, his school teachers have written him off as a trouble maker and, with luck seemingly never on his side, it is Antoine who ends up getting the blame for bad behaviour. Finding refuge only in his love of cinema, Antoine soon finds it necessary to break free and discover what the world can offer outside the confines of everyday life. I have always struggled with the labeling of this film as one of the pivotal entrances in the \"Nouvelle Vague\". Since Jean-Luc Godard's \"Au Bout de Souffl\u00e9\", who uses a completely different approach to film-making, with his restless jump-cutting and endless references to pop culture, Truffaut presents his case clear cut, as realistic as possible. But this was something completely different from the way American films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far. No iconic trouble makers like James Dean or Marlon Brando, just a realistic portrait of a twelve-year old boy sliding into isolation. The very idea alone was something novel, seldom depicted in a way like this. Much of the praise must go to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who never even seems to be acting. His every movement, thought, expression come across as completely natural. Truly, one of the most remarkable performances of such a young actor I've ever seen. Watching this over 40 years after it was made, it all looks deceptively simple, with Truffaut's perfect integration of music and image, location shooting on the streets of Paris and the naturalistic performances. Truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as in Godard's work. This was for instance the first French film to be shot in widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1), which required much planning on Truffaut's part, with some surprising results. In many scenes we don't see the other person Antoine is talking to, which gives the viewer the illusion as if Antoine is almost talking directly to the camera. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud would continue his role as Antoine in four more films by Truffaut, \"Love at Twenty\" (1962), \"Stolen Kisses\" (1968), \"Bed and Board\" (1970) and \"Love on the Run\" (1979).Camera Obscura --- 9/10",

            "content": "The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine's life.As Antoine, Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine's character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.The story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.",

He briefly runs away from home but then returns (or is returned...). After a while he ups the ante and turns to petty crime...Interesting drama. It also has its lighter side. There are many moments of comedy - the scene with the gym teacher taking the class for a walk was priceless! However, hardly the classic this is made out to be. Directed by Francois Truffaut, this is regarded as being the vanguard of the French New Wave movement. But it really isn't THAT good. It is hardly profound - the plot is a few weeks/months in the life of a early/mid-teens boy. There is no big realisation at the end, or plot closure.Even as a character-based film it is not fantastic. Yes, you feel some empathy for and engagement towards the boy but he is more villain than hero. (The adults are hardly saints either, I might add).Worth watching though, as it is a reasonable story, and to see what all the fuss is about...",

            "review_title": "Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package",
            "content": "As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into \"raising hell\", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan (who has a minor role as a schoolmate) is amusing for his Satchmo-inspired rendition of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island's Tattoo, Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat, but Truffaut's emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker, even at this stage of his career, make this essential viewing.",

            "content": "The title of the film is The 400 Blows but it is actually an expression for 'Raising Hell.'Made in 1959 in a cinema verite style. This is the full screen debut of Francois Truffaut and an example of the French New Wave. It was a critical hit.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood teenager in Paris who constantly gets into trouble at school and an at home. Doinel is based partly on Truffaut himself.Doinel finds school boring, does not get on with his teachers who usually catch him telling lies including an embarrassing one where in a panic he tells that one of his parent has died.At home he is alone a lot as both of his parents are working. His glamorous mother (Claire Maurier) seems to have little time for him. He gets on better with his father (Albert Remy) who is more playful but as the film progresses, he is actually the step-father and you also learn that his mother is having an affair.Doinel wants love but his step- father seems too weak (he suspects his wife is cheating) his mother too busy but he seems happiest when she does give him attention such as towelling him down after a bath.Doinel and his best friend Rene get into all sorts of scrapes and petty crime. Several times Doinel runs away from home and sleeps rough.He gets caught stealing a typewriter from his stepfather's workplace and comes into the attention of the police, social services and the judiciary. At the end he is sent to a young offender's institute that he also runs away from and onto a beach to what looks like an uncertain future.However Truffaut would re-visit Doinel over the course of his directing career.Watching this film it becomes apparent how much this influenced the British New Wave in the 1960s. So much of this film reminded me of Kes by Ken Loach with its naturalistic acting styles.Just look at the mischievous scene where the sports teacher takes the class for a walk around the streets of Paris and the kids disappear few at a time. Then there is the very naturalistic scene at the Punch & Judy show where the much younger kids are enjoying themselves.The city is a playground but when Doinel is living rough it is also oppressive and scary.Of course as time has gone on the shock value of the out of control adolescent has been lost with newer, more franker films.The French New Wave also had a different way of telling stories in the cinema that someone like me brought up on a diet of junk Hollywood blockbusters might not always appreciate. The film can be a little too wayward and loose.However the final freeze frame of a boy fulfilling his dream of seeing the sea but still alone and lost is regarded as a classic. Apparently this is the first time a film ends in a freeze frame.",

            "content": "I first saw this film around three or four years ago for the first time. I had watched it late at night, and I was very sleepy after it ended. I was rather ambivalent towards it. To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I had even heard of it before I rented it. And I don't even remember if it was my first film by Francois Truffaut, either. I have seen two others, The Green Room, which I didn't like all that much, and Shoot the Piano Player, which I loved. My guess would be that I saw The Green Room first, then looked up what else Francois Truffaut had made, and which ones were considered his better films.Anyhow, by some route I rented The 400 Blows, and, as I said above, it left me unaffected. I went to bed afterwards without thinking much about it. It was only a couple of months later that I realized how good it was. The memories came flooding back one day when someone mentioned it to me. I have had similar experiences with La Dolce Vita and Casablanca, among others. As I thought more and more about it, I realized just how great it was.Still, I never went back to it until now. I am strange in that way. There are some movies, some of which aren't even that good, that I will watch over and over again, alone or with friends. There are other films which I know are great, but that I never feel I have time to revisit them (there are always more films to be watched). The 400 Blows is one of those films, unfortunately. I don't know why. I have even considered purchasing it several times. I never did. So when I saw it tonight, it was like seeing something brand new.I remembered only a few of the most memorable scenes: the carnival ride (followed by Antoine catching his mother with a strange man), the whole Balzac sequence, the psychologist's interview, and, of course, the famous final shot, the freeze-frame of Antoine Doinel looking into the camera. After this time, I will probably remember everything a lot better and a lot longer. The first time, when I was ambivalent, I had time to forget before I finally grabbed hold of those fading memories.Why is this film special? Because it is the perfect example of childhood caught on film. I don't think there is anyone who could watch it without thinking that it rings true. Every piece of film that deals with a similar subject falls behind this one. The only one that I can think of that comes anywhere near is Federico Fellini's _Amarcord_. Jean Vigo's _Zero for Conduct_ is also very interesting, and probably influenced this film a lot (I know Truffaut was familiar with it, but that may not have been until after this film came out). Antoine Doinel is such an endearing character. I hope that sometime soon I can procure and see his other filmic exploits. And I really need to see more Truffaut in general. I'm far behind with him. Well, The 400 Blows deserves a 10/10, no doubt. It is easily one of the best films ever made, and one of those films that any knowledgable person would include it in a list of films that are absolutely necessary for a student of film.",

            "content": "This classic and unforgettable movie with amazing freshness catapulted Truffaut to international acclaim , dealing with a the trails and rebellious of 13-year-old Antoine Doinel . He is a rogue French schoolboy , starred by an adolescent Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud , being the first of Doinel series , following : L'amour \u00e0 vingt ans (original title) or El amor a los veinte a\u00f1os (1962) , a Short titled Antoine et Colette (1962) , Stolen kisses or Baisers vol\u00e9s (original title) (1968) , Bed and Board or Domicile conjugal (1970) , Love on the run or L'amour en fuite (1979) . The downtroddem , neglected and rebel teen Doinel delves into a life of petty crime . Antoine (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is often in trouble at school , especially with his French teacher 'Petite Feuille', (Guy Decomble) and doesn't get along with his parents (Claire Maurier , Albert Remi) , particularly his mum . While his friend Ren\u00e9 suggests that they play truant . Both of whom often skip school to go to a funfair attraction park or to carry out tiny theft . Antoine and Rene are suspended from school , they go gallivanting around the town. Unless something drastic changes in Antoine's life, he is destined down a path that will lead to nothing good, which is more problematic as he gets older. Instead of going to school, Antoine along with his friend Ren\u00e9 go to the cinema, play pinball, and visit a huge amusement rotor , a real funfair attraction . The following day Antoine tells his teacher that his absence was due to his mother's death; unfortunately his parents show up at school .Then he briefly runs away from home but then goes back . Things go wrong when Antoine to get money steals a typewriter from his father's office , being trapped by a janitor. It is quasi-autobiographical account of 13-year-old Antoine's bleak odyssey through family life , reform school whose precarious permanence is questioned and getaway . From the Vanguard of New Film-Makers Comes an Extraordinary Motion Picture . The Best Directed Picture Cannes International Film Festival 1959 . Angel faces hell-bent for violence.Still one of the cinema's most sensitive , perceptive forays into infancy , it is intensely stirring but never mawkish , as Truffaut reveals an actual complicity with the rebellious teenager , being Fran\u00e7ois 's first major motion picture. Shot on location in Paris in almost-documentary style and with a casually vivid eye . An increasingly compromised and attractive work in which Truffat demonstrates his narrative skills , being infinitely better than other self-indulgent films towards the end of his career . Fun for spotting the guest appearance of such Nouvelle Vague French luminaries such as Jacques Demy , Jeanne Moreau , Jean Claude Brialy , Jean Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut himself .Thought-provoking and engaging finale when a juvenile-court judge sends him to an observation centre in the countryside, from where he runs away, and doesn't stop until he reaches the sea , there takes place the frozen image of the boy face ; is it point of no return or freedom ? .Truffaut was seeking a young actor able to play Antoine Doinel, a troubled adolescent, in his first feature film \"The 400 blows\". Jean-Pierre was tested among a hundred other candidates and proved so amazingly spontaneous and so gifted for improvisation that not only was he hired but he would go on to play the role in four subsequent Truffaut semi-autobiographies concluding with \"Love on the run\" (1978), a unique experience indeed. Well starred by the boy Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud with a long career along with Truffaut , Leaud is not everybody's cup of tea for sure, but will remain an important name in film history. Thanks to Truffaut he was introduced to the other stars of the French New Wave, mainly Jean-Luc Godard for whom he would appear in eight films and one TV film, and gradually became their icon. As an actor he can be adored or hated for exactly the same reasons: he is one of those rare players that directors let improvise his dialogue, which gets on certain viewers' nerves while it fascinates others . The same is true for his very personal staccato diction and elocution and his many mannerisms, the most obvious one being his way to run his hand through his long hair. This is a semi-biography of Truffaut himself , in fact the French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut began to assiduously go to the movies at age seven similar to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud and he was even a great reader but not a good pupil . He left school at 14 and started working. Furthermore , the movie is dedicated to Andre Bazin , aged 15, as he founded a film club and met Andr\u00e9 Bazin , a French critic, who became his protector. Bazin helped the delinquent Truffaut and also when he was put in jail because he deserted the army .It displays an atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel , Truffaut's usual musician . As well as an evocative , adequate cinematography in black and while and documentary style by prestigious cameraman Henry Decae . The motion picture was competently directed by Truffaut , being one of the greatest and most influential of his films . His main themes were passion, women , childhood and faithfulness . His films gets several references to the American cinema, as Truffaut was a fervent moviegoer, such as : Johnny Guitar, Bogart, and his idolized Hitchcock . In fact , he was a big Alfred Hitchcock fan and defined him as his master . In 1953 Truffaut published his first movie critiques in \"Les Cahiers du Cinema.\" In this magazine Truffaut, and some of his friends as passionate as he was, became defenders of what they call the \"author policy\". In 1954, as a test, Truffaut directed his first short film. Two years afterwords he assisted Roberto Rossellini with some later abandoned projects . The year 1957 was an important one for him: he married Madeleine Morgenstern, the daughter of an important film distributor, and founded his own production company, Les Films du Carrosse; named after Jean Renoir's Le carrosse d'or (1952). He also directed Les mistons or the brats (1957), considered the real first step of his cinematographic work. His other big year was 1959: the huge success of his first full-length film, 400 blows (1959), was the beginning of the New Wave, a new way of making movies in France. This was also the year his first daughter, Laura Truffaut, was born. From 1959 until his death, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's life and films are mixed up. Let's only note he had two other daughters Eva Truffaut (b. 1961) and Josephine (b. 1982, with French actress Fanny Ardant). He also directed thrillers and intrigue movies such as \u00a8Shoot the piano player\u00a8 is one of the best of his suspense movies along with \u00a8Farenheit 451\u00a8, \u00a8Mississippi mermaid\u00a8 , and \u00a8The Bride Wore Black\u00a8. Truffaut was the most popular and successful French film director ever.",

            "content": "Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carn\u00e9's Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine's friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine's arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother's mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir  looked at it, in fact is closer to L'Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir's La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cin\u00e9ma d'auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut's life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine's life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend's idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: 'My mom died!'The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on 'normal' life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine's object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine's run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",

Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.Compared to the innovations of \"Hiroshima mon amour\",which features a brand new form,and a new \"fragmented \" content,\"les 400 coups \" pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior \"Jules and Jim\", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.The topic=stolen childhood  had better days,before (Julien Duvivier's \"Poil de carotte\" ,Luis Bunuel's \"los olvidados\") and will have after (Maurice Pialat's \"l'enfance nue\",Kenneth Loach's \"Kes\") I do not want to demean Truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer \"Jules and Jim\" \"l'enfant sauvage\" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)\"l'argent de poche\"(as academic as \"400 coups\" but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche \"vivement dimanche\".",

At the time of its release it was hailed as an important film and subsequently proved to be immensely influential in the context of the French New Wave.The semi-autobiographical story concerns a Parisian adolescent (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) who attempts to escape problems at home and at school by delving into a life of petty crime. Unfortunately, he never receives more than a temporary respite from his predicament and frequently ends up deeper in trouble. The script is fairly loose and strives for realism above all else.Enforcing Truffaut's aim of realism is the group of actors that he assembled. L\u00e9aud indisputably carries the film, at once delivering an authentic performance while also showing a maturity beyond his years. While not quite as impressive, the supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid, perhaps none moreso than Guy Decomble as Antoine's antagonist at school.Truffaut's direction is exceedingly well-handled, not to mention impressive for a debut feature. The film also sports attractive cinematography and a lively score by Jean Constantin.Indeed, the film can scarcely be faulted for any flaw in its construction or execution. Instead, my tempered enthusiasm is the result of feeling a certain amount of detachment from the main character. Naturally, this sort of objection is largely personal so your mileage may vary.",

Antoine Doinel (played superbly by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud in the lead role) has strict, unfaithful parents, and a harsh, oppressive teacher, and falls into delinquency because of his unhappiness. He lies, steals, skips school and runs away from home, and soon ends up in a juvenile delinquency centre.Truffaut's inspiration for this film came from his own depressed childhood, so he bases Antoine on himself, including in terms of appearance. Being a 'New Wave' (a cinematographic movement of the sixties, involving directors who believed Hollywood films were too lavish and unreal) director, Truffaut always used a real location for the film, including breathtaking shots of Truffaut's native Paris. He also made a cameo in the film in the style of Hitchcock.Delinquance is the key theme here. Antoine, who is a character who believes in liberty and freedom, and the way he is always locked up is repressive for him, and this provokes a constant need for him to be out.Trying to make a realistic and moving film was Truffaut's aim, which, by watching this film, I realised that he had done amazingly well. Also, by combining humour and drama too, we have the defining French film of the 20th century. A black and white film that is full of colour. Bien sur, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.",

It was much like the experiment in art nouveau in architecture seventy years earlier. I suppose that every art has cycles which begin with a collapse of the passion in artifice and a resulting call to the spontaneously natural.In this case, we have a camera acting as a selfaware human voyeur. There is no story: we simply enter and leave one life at arbitrary points. There is no drama, instead the `natural' drama of life. There are in fact none of the theatrics traditionally used to exaggerate so that things convey as real. The philosophy here is that REAL is real.Seeing this film again after my first viewing 35 years ago shocks me at the naivete of both Truffaut and myself then. I still celebrate nature, but I no longer believe it can be found in a zoo, where someone like Truffault can walk me through, pointing out what he thinks is interesting.Film, I believe, is something new still. Something that is beginning to change the way we conceptualize the most basic elements of life. Our bodies have stopped evolving, and that evolution has shifted to the level of tropes -- some in visual grammar -- that act selfishly to embed and promote themselves. Part of their defense is to periodically prompt us to believe that film is a mere window to reality. But that notion always collapses.This film is important because one can trace that collapse of induced naivete from its beginning here to an end. A complete cycle, whose final end I might place in Malick's ` Thin Red Line.' (`Moulin Rouge' likely begins a cycle on the other side.)",

            "content": "In viewing Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows for perhaps the fifth time, I finally began to realize its true greatness. Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is the boy's name. He is resourceful, quiet, and does what he can to get by. At home, he has a struggling relationship with his parents, especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests, always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner, although he is not really attached to him. However, both parents share common traits: they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend Ren\u00e9 convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but Ren\u00e9 assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with Ren\u00e9. The two boys stay at Ren\u00e9's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices. Just like life itself.",

            "content": "Francois Truffaut's first feature, and like many first features it's semi-autobiographical. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. As Joyce advised, \"Wipe your glosses with what you know.\" There are only two cautions to be observed. One is that your first story, about yourself, doesn't turn you into a moral paragon. The second is that, having gotten that initial material out of your system, you have the industry and talent to go on to other things -- not necessarily less personal, but less heavily invested. Truffaut managed to rise well above his beginnings.Jean-Pierre Leaud is the boy of about twelve who lives in a shabby and cramped apartment in Paris with a mother who, though she sometimes tries her best to act otherwise, doesn't really want him and never has. Leaud's father doesn't mind the kid, but things are tough. Both parents work. The mother is being unfaithful and the father is distant.So Leaud begins to get into trouble at school. (And what a run-down, working-class school it is.) He writes graffiti, gets caught, gets punished, but seems to learn nothing from it, nor from forging a note excusing his absence by claiming that his mother has died. He winds up running away from home, stealing a typewriter, getting caught, and sent to an \"observation camp\" where he's subject to tough love and interviews by a social worker. He runs away from the camp too and the last scene is of Leaud chugging along a wide strand, splashing through the tiny waves of icy sea water.Truffaut doesn't give Leaud easy excuses. He's gone through tribulations, certainly, but so have many of the other kids in his class. And at least Leaud wasn't sexually abused as a child -- the kiss of death in movies these days. But his story isn't one of a born delinquent either. He takes no pleasure in destroying things or in hurting or disappointing others. He exploits nobody.And the parents themselves aren't evil or weak. Their foibles are recognizably human. His parents only rarely indulge him but they never beat him. The boy may live in a bare apartment with cracked walls and not enough furniture or heat, but so do his mother and father, so they're subject to the same physical stressors.In fact, there's nobody in the whole movie who is entirely evil or entirely good, despite the fact that the film is in black and white.There is a vein of comedy in it too. Their language teacher is trying to get them to pronounce English correctly. \"Where is the girl?\", he asks one student in clear and precise tones. \"At the bitch,\" replies the student, and the teacher explodes in a volcano of insults in French -- and he stutters! Overall, what you're most likely to get out of this film is a sense of Truffaut's abiding pity for the human condition. Take the Punch and Judy show that we see a couple of dozen young kids watching. The camera pans slowly across their faces, and we see them laughing and yelling -- and we see their misshapen heads, their diminutive chins, their crossed eyes, and those ears that kids of that age tend to have, like African elephants sticking out from their skulls, all ready to flap with excitement. You have to love kids to love that kind of ugliness.The style is grainy and documentary with only occasional touches of art that are noticeable enough to call attention to themselves. Two kids sit on a bench in a wintry garden and talk about their hated parents while the camera deliberately lifts itself to a syrupy statue above them in which a loving mother is kissing a cherub.And that last shot -- a freeze frame of Leaud on the beach at the end of his tether, unable to go forward into the sea, unable to retreat to the camp he's just escaped from. The image is still and Leaud is captured staring into the camera lens, waiting, as it were, for the audience to judge him. We, the jury.Truffaut was one of the New Wave of French directors, most of them formerly critics for a French magazine. (They gave us the term \"film noir.\") Jean-Luc Goddard was another. But I think Truffaut leaves Goddard in the dust. Goddard is far more fashionable because of his on-screen pyrotechnics. He up-ended the grammar of film, as if to say, \"Look at me, Ma!\" What he did to editing alone was what Sinead O'Connor did to the Pope's photo. And he was political in the right way for the time. But he lacks Truffaut's essential humanity or, let's be honest, his humility. Maybe it's just me but compassion seems a more evolved emotion than aggression. I wonder if Truffaut ever read Rousseau.",

The latter was a loose term joining together a group of mid-century French film makers that took upon as their goal to talk about current subjects, to experiment with the film medium and to ground it in reality through real locations and modern subject matters.And keeping that in mind, it's easy to see why this film become such a cornerstone for them. It tells about a young Parisian school boy Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), who struggles in every area of his life. His parents heap both scorn and misunderstandings upon him, his school work barely passes muster, and he spends most of his days partaking in minor crimes and misdemeanours. The film doesn't really have a traditional story arc. Doinel doesn't learn that much, his circumstances don't really change. Rather the whole film has the atmosphere of the inevitable in it as Doinel's life slowly spirals deeper and deeper into ruin, culminating in the last haunting shot of him staring directly into the camera on a deserted beach, silently crying for rescue.And yes, the film has a rather gruff feel. It seems like they simply set up the camera, shot the scene and excited the room. Which of course is the ideal of New Wave, but takes some getting used to from a viewer more familiar with mainstream film media.Still, it's a beautiful film in its own way. Personally I appreciate the ideal it represents more than I appreciate it as a stand-alone film, but I'm still glad I saw it.",

It is a magnet - wherever you go you move towards it - and a totem.  This sequence is transposed later, when Antoine goes to the funfair, and rides on one of those moving cylinders, like a zoetrope.  The comparison is deliberate - Truffaut is situating his film in film history, declaring his intention to start again, to get back to first principles, to a time when moving pictures was a medium of possibility, before it was bogged down by genre and the studio system.  this zoetrope has a transformative power - it takes a character from neo-realism and abstracts him, turning him into a figure in a Grand Guignol, crawling in eternal circles.  But, from his point of view, it completely transforms the outside world, from a thing of oppressive solidity content to stare in powerful distance, to a formless, unstable mass.  This sequence crystallises the power of Truffaut's film, its freedom and its concern with entrapment.  It charts the decline into imprisonment of its main character with a style of buoyant liberation.  So while Antoine is trapped in this barrel, he is also offered a new way of looking beyond those merely content to look on from the outside.'The 400 Blows' is the first masterpiece of the nouvelle vague, that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema from stagnation as an art-form, just as it declared that it was an art-form (hmm, a connection?). It's a cliche now that Truffaut was the least innovative of the New Wavers, and yet it's still surprising that a film built so classically (moving from Paris to the countryside; balancing the opening school scene, with its barred doors, with the closing borstal scene etc.) still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare in the cinema (e.g. Jean-Pierre Leaud as an actor laughing with the crew as Albert Remy breaks an egg).  The first viewing of '400' is such a rush you'd be forgiven for thinking that it, like 'A Bout de souffle', was made up on the spot, and it is only on subsequent viewings that you marvel at Truffaut's formal control, the rhythm of his camera movements and editing, the consideration of his compositions. \nThat image of spinning round a fixed pole is the one that haunts me.  Just as the decline of Michel Poiccard in the Truffaut-scripted 'A Bout de souffle' is figured as a car running out of steam, so Antoine is forever running in circles, brought back to a fixed point, having gotten nowhere. To move is to live - that is why the final freeze-frame is so frightening: Antoine has usurped the Eiffel Tower, has become the centre of the spinning top - he dominates the closing frame, just as the opening ones were empty (of humans).  But at what cost? - has he simply wound down into inertia?: the subsequent Doinel films would suggest so.  (that closing beach scene, in which Antoine seems to be running against moving, phosphorescent sand, also alludes to another great work about a young artist and his city, Joyce's 'Ulysses' and its chapter 'Proteus')Although the film rarely shoots directly from his point of view, the style is an exuberant expression of Antoine's sensibility.  Antoine is ambisexual, still seeking his identity, just before seeking sexuality - early on he sits at his mother's dressing table, his face splintered by the triptych mirrors; later he steals supplies from the ladies' toilet.  This embodying of subjectivity in objective style is what saves the closing third from de Sica-like sentimentality and manipulation: we are rarely outside Antoine's head, people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them.  Only twice is his sensibility intruded on - when he is caught bringing back the typewriter, the captor creeping his point of view; and the interview with the faceless psychologist at the borstal, filmed as if behind a double-sided mirror, the feral animal penned at last.'The 400 blows' is revered as a moving, melancholy picture of misdirected adolescence.  It is sometimes forgotten that most of the film is pure comedy, delighting in gags, digressions, bits of business.  For much of the running time, you envy Antoine - what joy it must be to be young and in Paris, swashbuckling in the schoolyard, truanting in the city, smoking cigars: his family situation is no worse that most, at least he has friends, a roof over his head, and can read Balzac. Antoine is a bit of a clown: all clowns eventually settle down, make the right choices at crucial moments in their lives.  Antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices and finds himself locked up, descending the various levels of institutional hell.  His often amiable and/or witty parents are no more evil than he is a saint, although an educational system that asks kids to simply copy down 'great' poems (a Sisyphean task in one ink-blotted case) is clearly wrong.  Georges Delerue's score - romantic, exuberant, tragic, bittersweet - ranks with the three greats ('Vertigo', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg').",

This movie was the first one directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffault and is a landmark of the Nouvelle Vague, a French style of making films initiated by Truffault and Godard. This movement has produced low budget, but high quality movies, using a small crew, hand camera and free screenplay, with lots of creation and improvisation.

Spellbound, we see them giggling as children do, then looking frightened, then relieved but then perplexed and turning to their friends, then themselves spellbound by the magical scenes and scared and amused and relieved all over again. The force of the feeling that we are truly relating to the kids before us is for the brief duration of the minute or so of celluloid is amazing. One wishes, of course that the rest of the film was the same. There are other sequences of note but for the most part I was so uninterested in the various activities of stupid children and even more stupid adults that my exasperation was almost too painful to endure as the stupidity of the institutions is finally revealed. Never a fan of Truffault I was prompted to see this (for the first time!) after seeing the boy in the lead, Jean-Pierre Leaud who I had watched recently as an adult play film director in Olivier Assayas' Irma Vep (1996).

Perhaps it's also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period, at also a different country and culture but personally I couldn't really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie he's doing some things that I can't see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie, at the same time. It's not showing things and people as just black and white, good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to 'survive' in this world. Whether or not you like it, you sometimes have to do things you know you're later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life, or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really, since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. It's an original but also risky approach to the genre, that in this case did work out, also really thanks to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie, by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, that just didn't really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffaut's way though, since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him, though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "A very relaxed and natural look at growing up in the life of Antonie",
            "content": "Antonie Doinel is a typical young boy living in Paris. His mother and father are rather distant and pay him little attention when he is around the house. Fed up with school he decides to just skive off and spend the day hanging around, playing with his friends in the local theme park. It is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father. This marks the start of a chain of events that see him getting into more trouble both at home and at school.Although I have written a rough plot summary, I must note that I think this film is more about Antonie than it is any more traditional narrative. The film follows Antonie through the troubles he has in his young life, always painting him as a realistic character \u0096 never too simplistic so as to be totally likable (what child is!?) but not a brat like some kids are in American movies. This is crucial to the film because it is so observational that it could almost be a documentary due to its style. This is down to the natural direction from Truffaut, a skill that is only helped by his excellent use of the locations, in particular the streets of Paris. Although his story is extreme in its fate, it is still engaging and touching to see Antonie's story and be involved in his young struggles \u0096 whether it be school, distant parents or a lack of direction in life. The complex feelings around this time are well delivered, right down to the ambiguous ending where we are not told how Antonie actually feels.The playing from Leaud is excellent and I only wish that more child actors would be like him; natural, confident, vulnerable and convincing in front of the camera. He is well supported by people like Remy, Maurier, Decomble and Flamant but the film is his and I was very impressed by his performance. Of course, aside from him the other star is Truffaut himself and (as well as a cameo) his direction is great, natural, intimate and painting a convincing world for this story to occur within.Overall this is a small little film that succeeds in making the life of Antonie be very interesting and engaging. The plot may require the story to go beyond the day-to-day experiences of most of us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks to a great combination of a superb and natural performance from Leaud, the direction of Truffaut and the great use of locations throughout.",

            "content": "In general, it's very rare to see a film made before 1970 or so that offers a convincing picture of everyday life. Which makes this film by Francois Truffaut, dating from as early as 1959, all the more impressive. 'The Four Hundred Blows' is simply remarkable, with its naturalistic dialogue (laced with black humour) supplemented by the very subtle musical score (also a rarity in films of this vintage), imaginative camera work and an incidental construction that have set the template for just about every notable piece of cinematic realism made since. The point is that \"naturalism\" does not come naturally; and Truffaut was light years ahead of his peers in imagining how a portrait of the real world (and the feelings of its inhabitants) might be created. Having re-watched one of my favourite films recently, Shane Meadows 1999 effort 'A Room for Romeo Brass', another story of troubled boys in dysfunctional families, I find myself amazed how much more in common 'The Hundred Blows' has with that film than with its contemporaries.Truffaut also gets a fine performance from his young leading actor Jean-Pierre Leaud. If I have one criticism, it's that the film's ending seems slightly premature; we see a boy whose life is collapsing, but he is yet to recognise the fact. The film is almost like a prelude to a later, unseen tragedy; but the absence of sentimentality or melodrama are to be commended. A landmark film, still fresh after 45 years.",

Despite our good intentions, I'd say we were both too immature to get it.12 year old Doinel is a pretty good kid by today's standards. He's at the stage in his development where his youthful desperation can devise quasi-criminal diversions quicker than his yet-to-develop conscience can reject them. He has no comprehension of repercussions or other people's emotional interest in his whereabouts. Doinel live via a series of lies and self-complicated situations, and the parents depicted have their own deceits; secret trysts, facts they'd rather not acknowledge, etc.. The message he has to parse is that his poor choices are unacceptable but his mothers are to be swept under the rug. Making this movie sweeter is the sheer mildness of the problems which lead to his parents disavowal. With his characteristic care-free, neutral viewpoint, he'll never be able to play ball with his mom & step-dad. The mother here is an essay in self-serving abuse, but it's parents that have the power in 1959 and so Doinel has to callously be sent away. Jean-Pierre Leaud is such a charming natural in front of the camera that I can never forget this performance. His audition tape suggests, as has been confirmed, that major portions of Antoine Doinel are Leaud's personal qualities shining through. Like a parent, you don't want him to grow up, because life has a way of stripping away the pure qualities of childhood. Adulthood might bring maturity but it can never equal the naturalism and comfort he feels.* His performance made me think of some greater goals in life than where you end up. I wish I was this comfortable as an adult. The calmness with which Truffaut lets a scene and a shot play out is refreshing.*And sure enough the featurette Antoine et Collette from Love at Twenty pursues Doinel onto shakier ground. It's a mixed blessing. Truffaut knows we don't want to let Doinel go, but watching him become gangly over-serious and awkward as he negotiates love poorly is painful. \"Doinel loses his confidence\" is not the place I wanted this character to go.",

The main protagonist is a boy, who was faced with a lack of understanding by his own family and teachers at school. His French teacher is the embodiment of terror and incomprehension. His mother and stepfather, because of work and irregular life, do not have time for her only son. The boy began to run away from home and deal with petty crimes...The story is incredibly realistic, clear and honest. Deviation from the traditional narrative is more than obvious. Mr. Truffaut has introduced realistic social and family situations. These situations have offered insight into one emotional confusion and painful agony. It is difficult to describe with words. The boy leads an inner struggle, that moves him away from the school and parents. The story contains some of the director's autobiographical moments and intimate experiences from his youth. Because of that, an image of Paris and a musical score are quite sad. Certain critiques of education or perhaps social incompetence is the point of this movie. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud as Antoine Doinel is a realistic and simple character. The boy, who does not provoke sympathy. A vulnerability and naivety of his character are amazing. His honesty, while a psychiatrist attempts to fathom reasons for his discontent is almost heartbreaking. His support is Patrick Auffay (Ren\u00e9 Bigey) as his best friend and accomplice in the crime.Claire Maurier as Gilberte Doinel is quite superficial and deceptive character in the role of Antoine's mother. Albert R\u00e9my as Julien Doinel is a confused and unfulfilled Antoine's stepfather. Guy Decomble as Sourpuss He is an indifferent and insensitive teacher.This is a small and very interesting masterpiece. Very important drop in the French New Wave.",

His mother is sleeping around and he knows it. His father is an ineffectual boob who is terribly in love with the woman who really doesn't have any respect for him. They treat the boy OK. When they are angry with him they are probably justified. He is getting a good education and he is \"betraying\" them. There are great scenes on the streets.

            "content": "I've seen this film about five times over the last twenty-five years.  As narrative, this film is quite boring.  I can never become involved with or care much for its characters.  It is a depressing picture of a twelve-year-old boy who is trapped by parents and teachers, by public school, and by reform school.  An American film about this subject in 1959--the year of this film--would either have tried to squeeze a tear from the audience's eye or would have tried to arouse the audience to action, and would have been presented to the audience as a sensational expose of juvenile delinquency.  This film just presents its story in a straightforward, objective, slice-of-life manner.  I think that's why it's so depressing.Since I know Truffaut is a fan of Hitchcock, I thought some of the narrative line might have grown out of an episode Hitchcock often related--how his father had him locked up in jail overnight as a youth to teach him a lesson.I feel this film is worth more as an historical item than as entertainment. For this reason, it should be taught in film courses and will have a certain impact on young, first-time viewers.  Historically, it's important (1) as a film that helped form the French New Wave; (2) because Truffaut went on to become an important film director and this film is autobiographical; (3) as the first of the Antoine Doinel series, Doinel being a cinematic semi-autobiographical figure for Truffaut.  Actually, I have been bored to varying degrees by all the Doinel films and find Jean-Pierre Leaud, who plays Doniel in \"The 400 Blows\" as well as the other films in the series, to be a nincompoop.The technique in this film is very like the Italian neo-realist films, especially a film like \"Open City.\"  It's shot in low-contrast black and white, it's shot in actual locations around Paris; it presents a slice of life.Despite all I've written above, I've seen many Truffaut films that I've liked very much (Shoot the Piano Player, Jules and Jim, The Soft Skin, The Bride Wore Black, Mississippi Mermaid (complete version), The Woman Next Door, among others) but not the Antoine Doniel films.",

            "review_title": "Childhood Opposition towards Authority",
            "content": "In the late 1950s, France began to resurface in popularity with cinema thanks to the innovative French New Wave. With so many films coming out from creative minds who started off as critics, these films would be lauded for their unique editing tricks, stone cold tones, and long panning scenes that detail a character's actions for as long as needed. One of the most well known auteurs during this time was Francois Truffaut, who made his debut sixty years ago with The 400 Blows. In addition to being a revolutionary film about a rebel child going against his authority, this feature marks the first appearance of Truffaut's alter ego Antoine Doinel, a character he would use in a few other works later on in his career. As they always say, create what you're familiar with, especially if the protagonist is based off of you.The basic synopsis of this film is that the misunderstood adolescent Doinel struggles living in Paris with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious attitude. Possibly the film's biggest theme is the world of a child crashing with the authoritarian adult world, which is evident in Antoine's escapism from both school and his dysfunctional family life. His personal life consists of a mother who is consistently concerned with poverty and a presumably well mannered stepfather who never seems to be connected that well to Antoine. Neither parents have much patience to really analyze his feelings, hence how they'll simply just assume his actions before really knowing any proper context. At school though, he is constantly seen as a troublemaker, with the teacher always on his eye and even catching him as a liar, leading to Doinel skipping classes. With everything that happens to the poor lad, it only brings Antoine further back from societal norms and into his own path.In addition to the character's conflicting views, Jean-Pierre Leaud offers a good blend of juvenile snark and emotional displeasure that perfectly fits Antoine's detachment from the real world. One particular scene in the third act where Antoine answers detailed questions about his personal life was completely improvised, adding in to the raw complexity that a child can face when misunderstood or disrespected by those who should be caring for him more. This isn't to say Antoine is without blame, as he still misbehaves and lies to get around those who oppose him, but his goal of escaping his depressingly mundane life is one several can relate to. The shear distance both the parents and even school staff are at from the boy is enough to remind him of how cynical the world can be through vague justification. Once Antoine gets in trouble, he is sent off to a detention house, only to run far away from land at the end, but to what avail?This isn't to say the whole movie is gloomy in tone, as there are still moments of levity and humor to balance out the mood. Some scenes include classmates acting immaturely, to Antoine and his friend Ren\u00e9 visiting amusement parks, to even the stepfather deciding to treat the whole family to a movie after one of Antoine's mistakes. Although the stepfather's intent may be out of overindulgence, the other aforementioned events capture the spirited misadventures children may get into when deciding to explore what's around them. Not to mention, the way the film utilizes certain camera shots helps emphasize the actions of Antoine and others more so than dialogue ever could. Whether it'd be a long pan, tracking shots or even dissolving from one depressing shot to another, they all remind us that we're experiencing the life of Doinel by seeing it more than hearing about it.By capturing how the real world can crumble down on the innocence of childhood, The 400 Blows still stands as a landmark feature that could only come from the mind of someone who experienced harshness in their life. Had Truffaut not have grown up in a life filled with unkindness and disdain, then we wouldn't have had a film that stems away from childhood nostalgia to bring up childhood resentment. For every escapism fantasy we love to endure, it's always healthy to create realist fantasies that detail the cruel nature of harsh upbringings without over exaggerating or talking down to those who went through what Doinel faced. If you're into older arthouse foreign features or you'd like to see a distinct take on growing up in the world around you, then by all means give this a watch. Even if it may be too cynical for your taste, remember that this is a subjective view from the mind of someone who lived differently from you.",

            "content": "\"Les quatre cents coups\" or \"The 400 Blows\" is a French black-and-white film almost exclusively in the French language toothat was originally released back in 1959, so it has its 60th anniversary this year. And even if it was written and directed by Francois Truffaut, one of France's most known, I am a bit surprised that it was seen and rated by so many people here on imdb as it is not too far away from the 100k amount. Anyway it probably also has to do with the high rating and maybe to a lesser extent that Truffaut's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar and lead actor L\u00e9aud at a really tender age scored a BAFTA breakthrough nomination losing out to the recently deceased Albert Finney. Anyway, it runs for 100 minutes approximately and takes us into the life of Antoine Doinel, a boy who is not getting the love he is seeking from his mother or stepdad and as a consequence ends up doing some stupid stuff. Nothing too serious honestly, so the film is not really about the main character messing up, but the circumstances around him being so messed up. He confirms that he does not love his mother and things are probably not too different with how she handed him to her own mother during his early years and near the end the meeting between the two at the corrective facility is really telling because clearly the closeness between them is missing completely and it is a really cold situation emotionally despite the woman not having seen her son for a while. She also does not mind pushing annother disappointment into his son's face right away when she tells him that his \"father\" could not come. Luck is also a major component here. When the boy decides to skip school without telling anybody and fake a doctor's note, he runs into hiw mother making out with another man, which certainly did not make things better between the two. But this situation alone shows how messed up their entire existence is and there is probably no lovely happy ending to be expected. So the ending is as happy as it could be I suppose with the boy running away from the facility and at least he gets to see the sea, something his mother stated actually earlier and it is clear that she is not entirely indifferent towards him. Also obvious during the scene when his stepdad is really mad at him because of the fire incident and still you could argue she stands a bit up for her son there because she is scared of him saying something about the affair, but I think it is not just that. There is affection from her for her son, but real love probably not.Nonetheless, I must say the film never really won me over, especially in the sense that I cared for the main character and what is going to happen to him next. This also had to do with the supporting characters who were mildly interesting at best or just completely forgettable like the other boy for example with whom the main character goes on his stealing spree that involves the typewriting machine and even if he brings it back, there is no redemption for him. Still, even if Truffaut and L\u00e9aud did not maange to win me over with this one here story-wise, apparently they did so with many others back then and still today because L\u00e9aud turned into a star and lead actor for many years afterwards and also he made many many movies with Truffaut as he grew into an adult, also a long-running series where he plays the same character. That one I liked more than this one here, although it is really difficult to compare because this one here is completely drama with at best very subtle jokes at times. The other one is almost exclusively comedy. But yes this here is drama. I read a title explanation includes 400 jokes or something like that, although not the French original, but this clearly does not fit anyway, probably a bit tough to get the actual meaning across. I am not too fond of the title anyway, I personally thought it would be like blows or lashes for the boy because what he did, which would have been even more exaggerated than everything else he had to endure as punishment in here because honestly what he does is not too severe at all. It's stuff we have all done. There is a guy on one occasion in an outfit that looks like nun's clothing and they greet him with Ma'am and so on, so this is basically the level you can expect. I think the beginning and end were probably among the film's better parts, the middle really bored me at times though I must say. It's not L\u00e9aud's fault though, he did fine overall and I can see why people like him, even if I think his talent and recognition value shine even more during his later works with Truffaut. All in all, I give this film a thumbs-down and I am surprised how little it did for me because in general I like French films, also old ones, so maybe this one here is the exception that confirms the rule as we say here in Germany. Watch something else instead.",

He is tired from running, he has come a long way in both the run and from the start of the film, no emotion except for being tired, he could not fit in any of the societies offered to him.

            "content": "An idiomatic translation of the French title of this movie, Les quatre cents coup, would be something like \"Raising Hell,\" understood ironically. Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel, played very winningly by Jean-Pierre Leaud, doesn't suffer \"400 blows,\" although he does get mistreated quite a bit, and he doesn't mean to raise hell or to be a problem to his parents or society. He's just a boy being a boy. Unfortunately his mother (Claire Mauier), who is more like a wicked step-mother than the boy's biological mother (although she is that) would like to be rid of him so that she can spend more time pursuing her hobby, which is adultery. His cuckolded step-father (Albert Remy) is no help, although he seems to care more for the boy than his mother. And the institutions of society, as represented by his school, the Parisian police, and the social services people, seem intent on turning poor Antoine into a criminal. Truffaut ends the movie at a spot where it is still far from clear where Antoine is really headed, but we can guess that his spirit will be undaunted.Some have called this, Francois Truffaut's first feature, realism, but if it's realism, so is Charles Dickens. This is an extended slice of life, a coming-of-ager stopped before the boy does become of age, and in this sense original. Truffaut paints everybody but the boy and his best friend in such a negative hue that we cannot help but identify with Antoine. This is not realism, but it doesn't matter because this is a splendid film, perhaps not as great as some have claimed, but very much worth watching because of Leaud's fine performance and Truffaut's original and charming presentation of Paris in the 1950s. In one sense Truffaut makes the City of Light a child's playground, and in another, it is a repressive, indifferent monolith. Antoine's transgressions--ditching school, telling lies, stealing from his grandmother--are trivial. But Truffaut wants to make sure we don't misunderstand so he has the boy get into trouble for (1) having a magazine passed to him in class, (2) unconsciously memorizing Balzac (he is accused of plagiarism by his fascist teacher) (3) returning a typewriter, which admittedly he had lifted, and (4) lighting a candle in honor of Balzac (which starts a fire).My favorite scene is the one with the psychiatrist in which we hear her questions, but the camera stays on Antoine. His candid, eminently reasonable and entirely sane answers to her questions demonstrate that he is a completely normal, even admirable boy, and that it is society and its stupid adults that are off the mark.The faces of the children at the Punch and Judy show are wonderful and the sequence of Antoine running and running so gracefully and seemingly with little effort symbolizes the longing that all children have to be free.While I think this famous movie is perhaps a little over-rated, I can tell you that if you haven't seen it you are in danger of being labeled a cinematic illiterate.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

I love the simple style of this film, and I think it adds to its charm. The story is can even be painful to watch as one sees all of the things that happen to Antoine. I think that the reason for the strong emotions embedded in this film is that it is semi-autobiographical.

It delves into child psychology and remains engaging for most of the time. It is highly structured in its narration with a nice flow maintained aside a beautiful portrayal of Paris streets it captures.But overall it has its disappointments which gives reservations to place it in the position of \"The Bicycle Thieves.\" First of all the film ends inconclusive. It raises some issues on childhood problems concerning the schools and families, which isn't resolved. The problems raised feel single dimensional and on its way fails to make a compelling watch though technically it feels flawless along few endearing performances to admire.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

They don't act like little adults or stupid human beings. Les 400 Coups is sure the best picture ever made with a child. It's also the first movie of master Truffaut and probably his best work, along with Jules et Jim.  But Truffaut will have a very bad idea after that: make other films with the same kid growing up, become an adult.  The problem is that Leaud will grown up to be a pretty bad actor.  He's great in this movie, probably because he never think, at that time, that he will become an actor.

Well, it did improve some with the second watching--particularly since I have also seen the rest of the \"Antoine Doinel\" films. But, was it \"great\",...not really, though it still was a very very good film. There is very little negative about it other than the occasionally poor sound track. As many New Wave films are supposed to have a \"home-made\" quality about them, much of the time this wasn't a problem. But, there were times when the amateurish quality of the music was distracting. Also, a smaller complaint was the abrupt ending, though this is only a small complaint since the director returned to his alter-ego in follow-up films. When all seen together, now THAT is a fascinating thing-and something I recommend you try to do if you see \"The 400 Blows\".",

PLOT? THEME? PSHAW! LET'S FILM AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND & ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples' heads.

But don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review.Anyway, if you like French literature, you will HATE this. People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Or maybe they have read the lyrics to The Doors songs, and they think that's profoundly moving. Whatever floats yer boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived. Nice try, Truffles. But you're nowhere near the ballpark.Avoid this film like an aids-infected syringe.If you're the type of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA).If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Worhol.

His mother (Claire Maurier) shows no interest in the boy, nor does his father. He retreats home every day sullenly and sits on his bed, daydreaming.Beautifully filmed and still poignant after all these years, Truffaut's masterpiece is a moving and engaging study of youth that continues to retain its significance today.

His home life Is dysfunctional, he's disenfranchised with his school life and his teachers don't understand him. He's un-loved by his parents, especially by his un-caring mother, who didn't want him the first place. He's constantly skipping school and lying to his teachers and parents. After numerous Instances causing trouble, he steals a type writer from his step-fathers workplace, which proves to be the final straw. He winds up In a juvenile detention facility, where he doesn't fare any better.Watching this film I was constantly reminded of Tony Richardson's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Which came out a couple of years after this film, and was clearly Inspired by It. It's clear to see the Influence this film has had on Cinema. It's a wonderful piece of work, despite this being Truffaut's debut, he crafts a highly accomplished film. The technical side of this film such-as the lighting and direction are expertly handled. The film also contains a wonderful screenplay, there's not a single dull moment In the film, every scene feels Important and necessary. Truffaut takes his time to flesh out every character In film.

            "content": "In the 50's, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut worked as a critic with a rather defiant and resentful attitude toward traditional \"popular\" filmmaking. Yet even old-school directors like Cocteau or Clouzot said they never experienced such intensity on the big screen after they saw \"The 400 Blows\". Truffaut dared to challenge reciprocity and got unanimous praises from his peers and beyond, acknowledging the historical magnitude of the film, maybe the French \"Citizen Kane\".I guess there's just something about movies made by young directors; Truffaut was only one year older than Welles when he made his directorial debut, young enough to remember the most ungrateful part of boys' lives when they are old enough to take it seriously but too young to be taken seriously. Truffaut embraced the innate freedom of his age and never regarded childhood with nostalgic eyes, deeming it as a period of entrapment and submission to the rules of adults. Interestingly, Truffaut adopted the same rebellious approach to film-making, rejecting cinematic conventions of a plot, protagonists and villains for something that would tunnel the viewers into the truth of life rather than providing an escape from it.The French New Wave was a tsunami of creation that changed the face of cinema. Just like Jean-Luc Godard with \"Breathless\", a new generation of film-makers would explore cinema as a form of expression prone to improvisation, a freedom of tone, anything but codified tropes, it was Godard who said that the best way to criticize a film is to make one, that's to their credit. But unlike Godard, I doubt Truffaut made this film for the sake of challenging conventions or to make something \"pivotal\". And for one thing, I happen to share Jean-Pierre Melville's feeling that the New Wave had a huge influence on American Cinema, but the auteur thing was a bit overplayed in France, and the magic was lost in the 60's.So I'm not interested in 'auteur' Truffaut but 'rebel' Truffaut, his youth was exactly the same as his counterpart in the film Antoine Doinel: school troubles, delinquency, absent parents etc. Cinema wasn't just a vocation; it was a survival move, an escape from the path that was awaiting him, a rebellion within the rebellion. There's something in Doinel that reminded me of \"Cool Hand Luke\", a propensity for 'leaving', the classroom, the place, it's not just rebellion, but like the title suggests: \"raising hell\", which is the real meaning of \"400 blows\" but the word \"blows\" might render the idea that the kid is going to take many hits in his life, which is actually less misleading than the French title, sounding more like childish fun.And Antoine Doinel takes the hits and keeps moving forward, it's not \"Rocky\" though, Doinel has no specific goal, he lives from day to day, he doesn't think of the consequences, which is the essence of youth ennui. \"The 400 Blows\" happens to be an immersive character study in the life of a boy who's abandoned by his parents, his mother spending many extra-hours with her boss, and her father who's not the brutal type, has given him a name and a roof, but not what Antoine truly needed: a guidance, a meaning, anything. Antoine comes home eats, takes the trash down and goes to sleep. And the awful state of the house plays almost as an alibi for Doinel's mischievousness.But Truffaut's directing never needs to be intrusive to make us root for Antoine. We just see his background and get it. It is very fitting that, of all the \"Simpsons\" characters, it was Nelson Muntz who paid tribute to the movie as he was a character whose sordid background was unveiled in the later seasons and is perhaps the closest to Doinel. Doinel isn't even a bully though, and at the first scene, he's the unlucky kid who picks up the sexy calendar just when the teacher raises his eyes. The tragedy of Doinel is that before taking the path leading to delinquency and (who knows) crime, he's just a kid who doesn't care enough about his life to contemplate the idea of becoming a bad boy.The only escapism he finds is with his friend (Pierre Auffray), a fun moment at a zoetrope (a wink to \"Strangers on a Train\" and Truffaut's idol Hitchcock) and movie theaters, were Doinel drops the picture of Harriet Andersen from Bergman's \"Monica\", cinema was an escapism for Truffaut as well and the builder of his dreams. The film is a slow escalation to the point where the parents finally give up and put Doinel in a detention center less out of anger than disillusion, because he would escape anyway. Once again, Truffaut never shows the parents as the bad guys, even the kid doesn't blame them, yet we know he's hurt, deeply.Truffaut loved Doinel but was so worried he would grow up during the making, Leaud's answer was that both he and Truffaut had sickly souls, they would never grow up. Truffaut loved the answer and it sealed their collaboration, I wasn't a bit surprised that some scenes involving Leaud were improvised, this is not the improvisation for-the-sake-of-it like Godard would use to show off his revolutionary talent, it's improvisation to capture the truth of the moment, and this is perhaps the best compliment I can give the film, it is truthful, and that final shot is the perfect culmination of a story where you dare to dream of a happy ending but the word \"Fin\" seems like bars of a prison entrapping poor Antoine.The film is dedicated to Andre Bazin, a former critic, co-founder of Cahiers du Cinema who died in 1958. \"The 400 Blows\" is the pivotal encounter between a message, a feeling and a young talent, at the right time and the right place. To label it as New Wave starter is too reducing, especially since the film is deeper and more penetrative than Godard's \"Breathless\".",

With \"The 400 Blows\" he delivers a disturbing story about a misunderstood and uncared-for 14-year old, immersed in a cold-shoulder world of erratic pleasures and pains. The main character, Antoine, seems to be singled out for every kind of exaggerated discipline. A disagreeable school teacher indulges in sending pupils to the corner, or slapping them for silly transgressions. At home Antoine never knows what to expect. Will he be treated to the movies today, or yelled at and told he will end up in a Military Academy for being \"difficult\".Truffaut's unflinching realism points at the fact that we live in an adult-run world, where children have to follow all rules and orders, even if such directions may change without notice or cause. Antoine is in a \"catch 22\", where no matter what he may do will result in some kind of punishment. Minor offenses, which many will not consider very serious at all, are blown out of proportion.Without giving away any more of the story, it is obvious that here is a kid who has been dealt a pretty rotten hand. Even if Antoine's story is on the extreme end of a scale, there are surely millions of people who can relate to a life like his. Adults can be very unfair, especially when using children for their convenience, to cover their own wrong actions, or simply to seek a scape goat or whipping-boy to relieve their frustrations. The film is testimony to the fact that some people should not be parents at all.A big winner at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, \"The 400 Blows\" is a landmark piece of International Cinema, and by many critics' accounts ranks among the finest films ever made. An added treat is the extensive black and white camera-panning of the back-streets of Paris. See the city the way the milk-man sees it at day break, and you can appreciate how the working class lives. You can then understand how much more difficult life is for the children of those who work hard for a simple living. This is a must-see Classic, highly recommended!",

The film consists not of a narrative arc, but of a series of episodes lined up like dominoes, where the choices and consequence of one sequence have obvious implications on the next. Whether you were more the delinquent type in school or not, there's an innocence to Antoine Doinel that makes it difficult not to connect with his experience. Skipping school, running away from home, talking back to the teacher, lying to adults - none of these applied to my childhood, but I also didn't grow up with a cheating mother who found me annoying, a mostly spineless father and teachers more interested in discipline than trying to understand any misbehavior. Although Antoine's choices are ultimately his own, there are so many ways his childhood course could have been corrected, rather than the route his parents and teachers chose to correct it. His desire to avoid and run away represents a universal yearning to escape people and systems that fail us. By the end of the film, we recognize that his choice to act on that impulse shows bravery, not a rogue avoidance of a path to redemption.Truffaut does lots of interesting stuff with the camera in this film, but it's that purity of story that makes \"The 400 Blows\" a classic. He also has this cynical sense of humor that complements the more dramatic notes and harsher truths of the story. We sense Truffaut's own impishness in the way he depicts Antoine's day-to-day exploits and his attitude toward the adults in the film.The desire for freedom almost poetically fits with what Truffaut brings from a filmmaking perspective to his feature debut. From long tracking shots to the visually unforgettable spinning centrifuge carnival ride sequence, the film occasionally takes these moments of respite from the narrative to let us sit with a particular feeling or emotion. Often, there's a humor associated with these moments too. He even tries a few transitions and camera tricks that by today's standards feel dated or cliche, but the spirit remains.Nevertheless, style feels secondary to story in a way that it doesn't with the films released in close proximity to it including Resnais' \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" and Godard's \"Breathless.\" Those films touch upon some interesting themes and ideas, but \"The 400 Blows\" will connect with a wider audience and should resonate for many more decades into the future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's \"Bicycle Thief\"? Or anything by Hitchcock?So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie'. Sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.",

            "content": "\"The 400 Blows\" is a drama movie in which we watch a young boy whose parents do not pay the appropriate attention to him and leave him many times alone. This has as a result for the young boy to go into some crime actions which will have a very important to him but also for his parents.I really liked this movie because it shows us how important is for young children to have close to them their parents and how this can influence not only the way they think and act but also the way the see things around them. I also liked this movie because of the nice written plot and of course the direction which has been made by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. In this movie I believe the best interpretation was Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's who played as Antoine Doinel and he was simply outstanding. Another great interpretation made by Antoine Doinel who played as the teacher of French.Finally I have to say that \"The 400 Blows\" is a must see movie and it really worth the time that you are going to spend on it. That's because it shows us the importance of the parents for children but also the importance of the school and the teachers. It also shows us how teachers and general school can influence children to go on with their life and what impact it will have also in their lives.",

            "content": "The 400 Blows (1959) **** (out of 4) Francois Truffaut's tale of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a young boy who is misunderstood by his parents and teachers. He starts off with a few small outbursts but as those around him begin to turn their backs on him, Antoine's crimes grow a bit more serious. Films about out of control youths were common in the silent era and they were extremely popular in the 30s and 40s thanks to The Dead End Kids and films like WILD BOYS OF THE STREETS. The genre got even more popular with REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and this here led to countless rip-0ffs but what's so amazing about THE 400 BLOWS is that Truffaut was able to take something we've seen countless times before and do something fresh and original with it. I thought the most important thing about the picture was the realism that the director brought to it. I thought the screenplay itself was excellent because it was very truthful to the subject and also very realistic. In most movies you have one thing that happens, which leads to a \"big\" scene of something worse happening. That's not really the case here because the events happen in a way that just comes across as true. There are small things that go nowhere. There are minor things that get turned into something bigger. There are fun times with the parents and bad times. I thought the entire film had a terrific flow to it and especially when you consider how many times we've seen this type of thing before. The performance by Leaud is certainly another thing that's very important and especially because there's not a single frame where you believe you're watching an actor. Instead, Leaud makes you believe that you're seeing a real kid struggling through these important years of his life. Claire Maurier as the mother, Albert Remy as the father and Guy Decomble as the teacher also add wonderful support. I certainly wouldn't call this one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly a very important and impressive one that manages to make you think about one's actions when it comes to children.",

This movie was dedicate to Andre Bazin, a film critic who died in 1959 and also helped Truffaut when he deserted the military.

            "content": "The 400 Blows is a film that every teenager must see. When I was 14 (Antonie's age in the film I suppose), I hated everything. I hated school, I hated living with my parents, and I didn't want to be subordinate to society on the whole. To put it simply, I wanted to just get out there and live my life instead of being picked on by school teachers and essentially be an outcast amongst my peers, who were spoiled rich white males thinking with their you know whats instead of their brains. Antonie Doinel is a character who used his mind and what did he get? He was sent to reform school. He possesses the traits of every average adolescent male. He wants to expand his mind (he reads Balzac), doesn't do his work, riles up the teacher, doesn't really get along with his parents (although his father seems to have more vested interest in the boy), defaces classroom walls, and looks at and defaces pinups. Quite simply, his character is one of the most complex to ever be created.In short, The 400 Blows is about an unwanted teenaged boy who submits to the world of petty crime when the rest of the world has turned his back on him. There's an interesting line that Antoine's father says to him at the beginning of the film. The boy is running back from the grocery store with flour for his mother and he runs into his dad coming home from work. \"Always running son, eh?\" And that's what we see for the full 99 minutes of The 400 Blows. Sure, Antoine is actually running (especially at the emotional climax) but he's psychologically running away from the very people holding him back from breaking out in the world, be it his parents, the authorities, and so forth. There is so much other things that we see that cannot be fit into this review. Antoine and his friend Rene skip school one day and go around town. Antoine goes into a gravitron, which is an amusement park ride that spins around in circles. And that's what his life is doing: he may enjoy the ride for the time being, but he's ending up where he started from.The film is not without humor, though. One cannot help but laugh when Antoine tells his teacher after skipping class that his mother died. \"Personal preference obviously,\" his father says in response to the mother venting about such news. Also, Antoine's letter to his parents explaining why he ran away sounds like an adult wrote it, but there is some humor to it. \"We'll discuss all that's happened\" it says. Even Antoine getting expelled from school after plagiarizing Balzac is pretty humorous and he decides not to go home and live with Rene. They end up stealing little things such as posters, clocks, and they go to the movies. However, when he pinches a typewriter from his father's office, that's the end of his little rebellion. He is sent to a correctional facility (and this is an emotional scene, as the boy is placed in a police wagon and cries as he takes a look of the streets of Paris at night). Perhaps the most emotional scenes take place in the final portion of the film. Antoine is placed under psychiatric evaluation, where he reveals he was born out of wedlock and his mother wanted an abortion (this is hinted at in the beginning when he runs in on a conversation between two old ladies talking about forceps and a Cesarean section...perhaps they were indeed talking about an abortion procedure. Antoine feels uncomfortable around this conversation and we can see it). He can't see Rene when he visits, and his mother tells him he's on his own (although I wished Antoine would've told her \"I hate you\").After briefly listening to a young delinquent who was caught trying to escape, Antoine decides to do so and bolts during a soccer game. We just see Antoine running, and running, and running. There's no music at first until he gets to the ocean. Truffaut pulls the cameras back and we see an endless horizon, endless opportunities for our young protagonist. The musical score plays and this is where I continue to get misty eyed with every viewing. Antoine, who has never seen the ocean, runs within the current, but has nowhere to go. The film ends in the famous freeze frame with a closeup of the boy's face. Either he's been caught, doesn't know what to do, or this mimics the mugshot sequence that we saw before he went into the correctional facility. The ending leaves a lot to the imagination, but there's one thing that cannot be imagined: The 400 Blows is easily the most touching film I've ever seen. I don't think I'll see another one quite like this.Everything seems to lock into place here. The acting superbly executes brilliant dialogue. Truffaut has some innovative camera movements (the darkening of the corridor while Antoine takes out the garbage and the final shot are examples of this) throughout. The musical score is beautiful. And, France isn't portrayed as this very romantic country. No, it is dark, it is gloomy. This is the dark side of this very storied nation. Here, Francois Truffaut tells his story to the viewer. When I first bought 400 Blows, I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd pick it up because 46 years after its initial release there was still a lot of critical buzz around it. I'm glad I spent the 30 dollars on this film, easily my favorite of all time next to 2001: A Space Odyssey.I only have one complaint: I wish I'd have seen The 400 Blows when I was 14. It probably would have saved my life more than the music I was listening to.",

            "content": "The film, which is a classic of the Nouvelle Vague, starts with street views where now and then the Eiffel tower can be seen in between houses, but it does not get any more romantic than that because for the rest of the movie we only get to see a Paris of urban canyons, close quarters and uninspiring classrooms.Mr. Truffaut tells us the story of a 13 year old boy who is growing up in Paris in the late 1950's. Being from a humble background the boy's childhood is quite troublesome because the parents see the boy more as a nuisance and a possible source of even more troubles in their own lives. It is not the story by itself, which is overly impressive, even though it may have been unconventional then, but the rather unsentimental way, in which it is told. This makes the movie quite realistic but also touching.Especially the performance of Jean Pierre Leaud as the boy Antoine Doinel is just great. Antoine shows a very boyish behaviour, which is characterized by a certain sadness for being usually the one to blame, but the vitality and carelessness of youth are still there and not yet broken. Also Rene, his best friend from school and son of a rich family, comes across as a real rascal.Despite all, Antoine does not really live in a terribly bad family situation without any sympathy, but after having been caught for stealing the typewriter from his father's office he is abandoned all too fast and sent to a reformatory.The film ends with Antoine fleeing this institution. In a long shoot we see him run through the countryside until he eventually reaches the beach. As we know from a conversation between Antoine and Rene seeing the sea has been a long desire for the boy and so his last view into the camera shows both delight and fear.To me that's a great open ending. Can dreams still come true for Antoine or will he have to pay a high price for his obstinacy?Also be aware that from a today's point of view the movie is almost historical. The story by itself is still up to date but when seeing the cars that were in use in France at the time it feels like diving into a foreign world.",

Today, you'd probably need permission slips, but it's definitely worth the effort. No dubbing or subtitles were allowed - so we had to see a \"pure\" French version. This was in keeping with the classroom rule forbidding any English be spoken as soon as we went through the classroom door. Nobody understood French well enough to get much of the conversation in the film, and there was no discussion following the film. But, no discussion was necessary.You understood all you need to know through visuals and vocal inflections; and, the French version is likely be more engaging to a schoolchild stuck in the classroom. It can be timed to end at the closing bell.Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut really shows Jean-Pierre Leaud how to run like hell.Many critics point to the cruelty of the schoolteacher and ineffective juvenile facility as main points administering the \"400 Blows\" of the English title. But, the one \"Blow\" mattering is the one inflicted by parents. It's no secret that the Father isn't the boy's original dad. That's not a problem in itself (and, neither is her affair), but it will be, here. More serious is the problem of Mother. In early scenes, the boy longs for Mother by sitting in her make-up chair. Next, he overhears older women discussing bloody childbirth. And, when he needs an excuse for school truancy, he says his mother died.

            "content": "\"The 400 blows\" was the first film of what later would be called the \"Nouvelle vague\". To put it more precisely it was the first film of a \"Nouvelle vague\" director. Seen nowadays the film is much less innovative than for example Jean Luc Godard's \"Breatless\" from the next year. More in general the \"Nouvelle vague\" directors are in my opinion more connected with each other being ex colleagues of the film periodical \"Cahiers du Cinema\" than being a stylistically homogeneous group. There are great differences between directors such as Jean Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Louis Malle and Francois Truffaut. By the way for Francois Truffaut the Cannes festival of 1959 was a complete victory. A year earlier he was banned as an unwelcome, too critical, film journalist and now as director he received the grand prize.\"The 400 blows\" is about a rebellious high school student (Antoine Doinel played by Jean Pierre Leaud) in whom there are many autobiographical element of Francois Truffaut himself.In some reviews I read comparisons with \"Zero de conduite\" (1933, Jean Vigo), but the film reminded me much more of \"Christiane F, Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo\" (1981, Uli Edel) which I saw not so long ago. In comparison with Christiane 20 years later the rebellion of Antoine (for example stealing a typewriter) is unimaginably innocent, but the interesting question in my opinion is the extent to which the rebellion can be attributed to or explained from the situation at home.In this respect Antoine has a more convincing story than Christiane, who \"only\" does not like the new friend of her divorced mother. A story he tells at the end of the film to a psychologist in one of the best scenes of the film. The POV of the camera is that of the psychologist so that we look Antoine right into the eyes.Earlier I said that \"The 400 blows\" was not the innovative film one expects from \"the first nouvelle vague\" film. It is however a very good film (thanks to both Francois Truffaut and the very natural acting of Jean Pierre Leaud), with numerous memorable scenes. I already mentioned the monolgue of Antoine to the psychologist at the end of the film. Also worth mentioning are the following scenes.The introductory scene when the camera travels through Paris, the Eiffel tower always in sight. At the end of the introduction the camera finally reaches the Eiffel tower.Antoine catching his mother on the street with a lover, drawing him to the conclusion that she is not only grumpy to him but also cheating on his stepfather.Antoine getting arrested after stealing a typewriter and especially the ease with which his parents hand him (and his further upbringing) over to the authorities.Antoine going to the cinema (his second home) and (being an adolescent) stealing a tantalizing poster from \"Summer with Monica\" (1953, Ingmar Bergman).Very famous (and contrary to the rest of the film truely innovative) is the ending scene. Antoine has escaped from the reform school and runs until he reaches the beach. The sea prevents his further passage and a moment we think that he will run right into the sea. At that moment he turns his head, looks right into the camara, the camera zooms in and the image freezes. It is to the spectator to interprete the facial expression of Antoine.This ending scene is however not the end of the character of Antoine Doinel. Francois Truffaut and Jean Pierre Leaud would make 4 other films using this character ((\"Antoine and Collette\", 1962) (\"Stolen kisses\", 1968) (\"Bed and Board\", 1970) and (\"Love on the run\", 1979)).",

            "content": "Francois Trauffaut's early (and considered generally to be auto-biographical) work \"400 blows\" is as relevant today as it was nearly half a century ago, and as universal. Despite medical advancement, sad stories of an unwanted child from an unwanted pregnancy unfold everywhere, all the time.The excellence of this film is in the way it handles a subject matter that is so common that it's very difficult to touch an average audience, let alone the cynics. And yet, \"400 blows\" tells the story in such a simple, honest way that you will sit up, pay due attention and respect, even if it doesn't break you down in uncontrollable sobs (which can sometimes be achieved through cheap contrivances).Nor does it paint a skewed, one sided picture of a life with nothing but misery for the 12-year-old. There are good moments such as when the family of three goes out to enjoy a movie just as any ordinary family would, as the step father is a reasonable and loving man who treats his \"acquired\" son very decently, almost like his own. But it is precisely these good moments that make the bad that much more poignant.There are neither total villains nor complete angels in this film. People are people as we know, that we can identify with, in other words, ordinary. They are often selfish, bullying, despicable, but not without moments of genuine goodwill. Antonie, our 12-year-old protagonist, is how any 12-year-old would be like, capable of mischievous actions but not burdened with the rejected spirit that a life of vicissitudes would have given to an adult. While we may feel sorry for him, he is too young to feel sorry for himself. Most illuminating is the interview with a psychiatrist towards the end of the movie. Observe how he answers all the personal questions in such a matter-of-course, honest way, with no uneasiness or hostility. It is most interesting, and a little ironic, that his innocence is accentuated when he talks about his sexual experience, or rather the lack of which, to be exact. \"But some of my friends have done it\", he hastens to add, a very natural thing to do, to show that he is not entirely ignorant. Then he goes on to talks about an abortive visit to a brothel (when the one prostitute who usually agree it \"do it\" with very young boys is just too busy) with the most genuinely innocent smile on his face.It is not seeing what the boy is (a juvenile delinquent, though not a particularly bad one by today's standard) but contemplating what he could have been that breaks the heart.",

            "content": "Like many artists and writers, director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut began his career with an autobiographical piece based on his unhappy childhood. Sometimes these works are just self-indulgent ways for their creators to exorcise their personal demons\u0097and sometimes, like Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows,\" they go far beyond that. This movie allows those of us who were never young hellraisers like Truffaut or his protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) to understand him and discover the universality of his story. The way that Antoine's family alternates between loudly arguing and pretending that everything is happy is very recognizable. So is the way that Antoine is stuck somewhere between childhood and adolescence and expected to take responsibility for his actions, even though the adults' rules don't make sense.\"The 400 Blows\" is basically a character study of Antoine, a lower-middle-class Parisian boy. Occasionally, his willful disaffectedness reminded me of a French Holden Caulfield, but he lacks Holden's cynical, superior attitude. The movie shows us that other characters think of Antoine as a rage-fueled delinquent, but that in reality he is an aimless youth who always chooses the wrong moments to act defiant. L\u00e9aud gives an amazing performance that perfectly matches the movie's tone: sympathetic to Antoine's plight, yet resisting the temptation to make him into a downtrodden victim. I have seen a few other Truffaut films, and one of the things I like best about his style is his skillful use of long wordless sequences, often set to music. \"The 400 Blows\" is full of these, conveying everything from the joy of skipping school and going to the movies, to the panic and exhilaration of a spinning carnival ride, to the poignancy of riding through late-night Paris in a police van. The famous, marvelously ambiguous ending tops them all. This innovative style was groundbreaking in its time and started what became known as the \"French New Wave.\" But \"The 400 Blows\" is not just a bag of cinematic tricks or an arty, inaccessible critics' darling. Instead, it's a wonderful movie about childhood, highly recommended for its lyricism, its emotional range, and its sympathetic but not sentimental look at a misunderstood boy.",

            "review_title": "An Unadorned, Pure and Personal Debut Feature for Francois Truffaut",
            "content": "This unadorned, pure and personal debut feature is one of the most profoundly relatable tales ever made about a young adolescent, because we can all identify with it to some extent. It shows the defenselessness of being a kid. Nothing you do necessarily sobers an adult. Influenced by Truffaut's own early life, it shows an able boy growing up in Paris and seemingly diving foolhardy into a life of crime. Adults see him as an agent provocateur. We are afforded some of his personal time alone, as when he lights a candle before a small tribute mausoleum to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking straight into the camera. He has a comparable countenance at other times in the film, which is shot in black and white in Paris in a frigid season. He always has the collar of his jacket unfolded against the wind. Antoine and his delinquent friend have so much character in their young faces, and that is perhaps the most immediate force behind the final shot.I like how, when he's among his friends, Antoine betrays the feelings of inadequacy with which his everyday life endows him. He is played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who has a kind of downbeat disengagement, as if his heart had undergone complicated pain long before the film began. The 400 Blows, with all its clarity and sensitivity, is in a class by itself despite being among the establishing films of the French New Wave. We realize that it materialized straightaway out of Truffaut's heart.Little is done in the film just for impact. It's guileless, and when it isn't it's still seamless. Everything complements the effect of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with the conditional love of his mother and stepfather in a cramped space where they constantly seem to be wringing out of each other's way. The mother is a blonde who likes tight sweaters and is troubled by financial need, by her exasperating son, and by goings-on with a man from work. The stepfather is a pleasant enough guy, complacent, and handles the boy in a fond manner even if he is not very close to him. Both parents are away from home a lot, and neither has the composure to pay enough attention to the boy. They assess him by appearances, and by the accounts of others who do the same.At school, Antoine has been categorized by his teacher as a nuisance. His fate is not lucky. When a pinup calendar is being snuck from desk to desk, his is the desk behind the teacher finds it. Sent to stand in the corner, he makes faces for his classmates and writes on the wall. The teacher orders him to take back the incendiary defense he has written, as further strong- arming. Here is one that's the story of my life: He feels too preoccupied to finish his homework and instead of returning to school without it, he plays hooky. His story is that he was sick. After he skips again, he says his mother has died. When she shows at his school, apparently revived and deeply angry, he is pegged as a liar.Truffaut's film is not a lament or as hard-hitting as a social melodrama. There are a few instants where you find yourself laughing in quite the same way you would during a Billy Wilder movie. One moment in particular, which you might go as far as to call a sight gag, shot from above the street, shows a physical education teacher leading the boys on a routine run around a few blocks in town. Two by two they scramble into truancy, until the teacher is the leader of a rank and file of only two or three boys. There is a wonderful mostly wordless runaway bout with Antoine and his delinquent friend, who's afforded such freewheeling freedom that he has a daily life that thrives on impulsive chaos and spontaneous theft, which of course infatuates our angry young hero. The most relief in the film comes after one of Antoine's dumber screw-ups. He lights a candle to Balzac, which sets the shrine on fire. His parents put out the flames, but then, because one supposes they happen to be in a decent mood, their frustration turns into a dismissive bygone, and the whole family goes to the movies and laughs the way home.There is an ample amount of movie-going in this movie itself, with Antoine's intense face hypnotized by the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself fled to the movies whenever he could. The cinema saved Francois Truffaut's life, he apparently pointed out frequently. It took a student flirting with crime and gave him something to love. If the New Wave is the turnstile between classic and modern cinema, and quite a lot believe it is, then Truffaut is the participant whose films perpetuated the most earnest and personal passion for film-making.",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to just get \"away from it all\" in life, go joyriding in stolen cars, steal stuff to keep your fantasy thriving, all while dealing with constant contradictions of authority and goal-makers? That's pretty much what I got out of this movie. There was excellent, whimsical acting by all the cast (mostly out of the kids in the classroom), great direction on little nuances that the lead boy, Antoine, felt like doing, and excellent cinematography showing the depth of where poor choices can lead you (and oppositely, the grandeur of the openness of hope in a stress-free society). The story was typical of any boy trying to understand what everything means in life while still under the roof of his parents, who constantly lie to one another and live a dramatic lifestyle between each other.One the other hand, though, nothing was really learned after Antoine experiences his version of remorse for his actions. In fact, he doesn't really grow up at all. It's almost as good as half of a movie. I think the film was just trying to show the consequences for a life gone awry, made possible by the lies he told, by what he stole, and how he treated supervision and authority, which, in my opinion, isn't a grandiose story to tell at all. It's pretty understandable in anyone's life that's been raised well. So I lack to see the fervor in which some might enjoy the story or the film as a whole.I think the replay value of the film is low. The score was amazing, with his own complex theme and everything. Again, the technical aspects were there, but the experience of Antoine's was not much of one.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Cited as one of the films that begot the French New Wave, this one cuts straight to the nerve if you were ever mis-understood or felt isolated as a kid (and who wasn't?). Knowing that it's a semi-autobiographical presentation from director Francois Truffaut makes it all the more poignant. Truffaut was a troubled youth and (like many of us) used his love of cinema as an escape, and to provide hope for his future. His mentor, the famous film theorist Andre Bazim, died just before this (Truffaut's first) film was released ... it bears a dedication to Bazim.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays 12 year old Antoine Doinel, a boy who just can't get a break at home or school. Labeled a troublemaker (the film title translates \"to raise hell\" or \"to live a wild life\") by a lazy, cruel teacher, and treated as a lost cause and unwanted burden by his tight-sweater-wearing mother (Claire Maurier, over 80 and still acting today) and stepfather (Albert Remy). Antoine's days are spent reading Balzac, watching movies, and dreaming of escape. A couple of unfortunate incidents spiral out of control and he ends up first in jail and then in an \"observation center\" for troubled kids.The beauty of the filmmaking is evident in most every shot ... and there are some amazing extended takes. The overhead scene of the PE teacher \"losing\" students as they jog through the city is humorous and insightful. The puppet scene in the park is an extraordinary long take of kids' innocent and mesmerized faces, and the extended shot of Antoine running through the countryside is a cinematic first. Above all of that is the famous ending shot - a zoom in to freeze frame of the young boy caught between land and sea (past and present).Truffaut and Leaud teamed up for four more projects featuring the same character, Antoine Doinel. In 1962's Antoine and Colette, he finds first love. 1968 brings Stolen Kisses and true love. 1970's Bed & Board has Antoine getting married, and finally 1979's Love on the Run brings divorce and life after a failed marriage. Other than the \"7 Up\" series, I can't recall a movie character being tracked in real time for two decades in multiple films.The French New Wave also included directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Remy (who appears as a policemen in this movie). These filmmakers used realism to tell their stories at a time when Hollywood was using icons such as James Dean and Marlon Brando to express rebellious youth. This makes for an interesting comparison and fun analysis. Whatever your preference, Truffaut's first feature is clearly an exciting development for cinematic history.",

This young boy is Antoine Doinel, (Jean-Pierre Leaud) who is a rather rebellious young man in school and causes all kinds of problems with his teachers. Antoine steals money from his parents, skips school and pals around with his friends who are not much better than he is. This young man proceeds to almost burn his apartment house down and is constantly hearing his father and mother fighting among each other. One day, Antoine cuts school and sees his mother kissing passionately another man on a Paris street. This story clearly shows what can happen to a child who is not really loved and has mental problems trying to fit into society and has no ambitions to better himself in life and is always looking for any easy way out of the routine of living.

            "content": "This is a film that doesn't have to tell you that it cares deeply about its very young hero (anti? Don't believe so but you could convince me if you tried) because Truffaut has the confidence in what the moving image can do that he can show us how Antoine behaves. I think that's the key thing to this film and why that dedication to Andre Bazin is, for what it's worth, earned as far as what Bazin was all about as a critic as a proponent of the Neo-Realist movement in Italy and elsewhere, and his lessons the Cashiers critics took to heart.If you can depict people in an honest light, and using real locations and places like the office with the typewriters, or the amusement park ride, the movie theater or that puppet show with all those innocent faces (could one or more be another Antoine who knows), or that truck with the prison bars taking the boy off at night with his hands wrapped around the bars - getting this right was what Truffaut had to do, and he does it with a degree of vividness that could be tender if it all wasn't in a world of harsh and crushing people... the adults.It'd be easy, or maybe easier, if Antoine was just some psychotic or sociopath kind of kid, or if he fell in with the wrong crowd. Truffaut doesn't let his kid off so easily in either way: Antoine is aware of what he's doing, but what I connect with so strongly is that feeling as an adolescent that everything matters so greatly and that consequences build to where dramatic things will happen. The difference of course is what ones does with that; I didn't run away or live in a printing factory overnight, but did I ever get caught cheating on an assignment or skip a class and try to make it up?Well, maybe less said the better, but the point is this is what every kid does through to one degree or another of that rebellious age, as limits are presented and may be/need to be pushed through. But there's no sentimentality, even as the parents are tough but in their way loving (ie when they go out to the movies after the fire scare with the candle, or mom trying to relate with her own rebellious times as a child). The filmmaker didn't have to show this, but he does and it makes things all the more difficult and tragic when Antoine goes a step too far and it can't be taken back... at least, that's how a 12 or 13 year old may process that.It's empathetic because it's so raw, amusing because it embraces how everyone tries and sometimes can get away with things (my favorite sequence where the kids two by two just melt away from the line the gym teacher has them on in the streets), and because Leaud understands that simply being and behaving as a kid would - when he's interviewed at the prison the way his hands fidget and he doesn't always look on, I mean, if you weren't that way sometimes as a kid, whatever gender or class, I don't know what to tell you - and the episodic nature of the piece allows the story to ebb and flow, that it isn't all certain to be doom and gloom... until the typewriter anyway.But ultimately Quatres cent coups is so powerful and unforgettable because it's about how one loves and processes the lack of it, or what happens when a misguided but decent hearted boy can't reciprocate. I loved this at 19 and love it even more in my 30s. I imagine me in my 50s and 70s will find more to chew on.",

            "content": "Sometimes it is best to view a film with no expectations. Without thinking one way or another about how the production will turn out, there always leaves an element of surprise, be it good or bad. That is how I felt when I began watching Truffaut's The 400 Blows. I was not expecting it to be good or bad. I was just expecting to view it with an open mind, something that is rare for me.The 400 Blows was an interesting watch. Having only viewed a handful of French cinema titles, I was drawn into the differences between this coming-of-age tale from another country as opposed to the coming-of-age tales that are typically seen in America. When it comes to America, a coming-of-age tale usually has a great deal of sex, drugs, or both. There was little to none of these two elements in The 400 Blows. I appreciated the fact that Truffaut took time with characters rather than blatant salaciousness.What I appreciated most about The 400 Blows was its pseudo-documentary style. There's a scene early on where lead character Antoine is told to get out of bed. Antoine does what he is told. In most films, the director would cut as soon as the character is out of bed. However, Truffaut continues the scene long past that point with Antoine changing clothes. It is times like these that the audience almost forgets that they are watching something fictional and feel more like they are watching a documentary on someone's life. This is a style that Robert Altman would later perfect (Altman was still mainly directing television at the time of the release of The 400 Blows). Adding to the feeling of a documentary is the use of sound. There is music, there is in almost every movie, but the use of music is so low-key and soft that I hardly noticed it. One of my nit-picks with a lot of old and new films is the overuse of a loud, overbearing score that despite the intention, actually takes away from the emotion that is supposed to be taking place on screen. There's a certain amount of elegance to the way that the music is used in Antoine's story. It never takes away from the proceedings. It feels organic and welcome. There was a movie I loved when I was younger called Joe the King with Val Kilmer. The plot was nearly identical, there were several homages to The 400 Blows (which I didn't get at the time), and it was just as effective. If I were to go back and watch Joe the King now, I would probably find it nothing but a mere knock-off of The 400 Blows. I'm a comedy guy. I generally don't like watching movies that leave me feeling depressed after viewing them. My overall feeling of The 400 Blows could best be summed up with a quote from a character in the picture itself: \"It wasn't funny, but it had depth.\"",

            "content": "It's those little extra touches that make Truffaut's work rather special and so appealing. The film depicts memories of school life in the early part of last century. A frustrated schoolmaster bellows at an unruly classroom as he seeks to maintain discipline and the schoolboys mimic him behind his back. Antoine (Jeanne-Pierre Leaud)seems to be the unfortunate one who always gets caught and is punished accordingly. I was surprised to find that the schoolmaster did not resort to physical violence. Caning was rife in my day.Home life for Antoine gave little relief from his problems at school and his mother was more interested in her secret love affair than help for her son. Antoine's chores at home included setting the table for the evening meal and putting out the garbage can before bedtime. It is said that Truffaut based his story on his own early life.In one funny little episode a teacher guides a group of up to 20 students (all trailing behind him)through the winding streets. Every little while two or three students drop off from the end of the line and dart up a side street. It is rather comical to see the students disappearing while the teacher is quite oblivious to his shrinking numbers and continues to walk ahead with just two students at his side.Students are always short of money (particularly if they want to enjoy themselves in the amusement arcades) so Antoine and his friend steal money from the public toilets. They also resort to an occasional cigarette which makes them feel really grown up! It's little details like this that will revive memories for all of us.As for the ending....some may think it is rather abrupt. I like to think that it is a moment in Antoine's life where he has come to another \"crossroad\" and where a decision has to be made. How Antoine resolves it is left entirely to my imagination. Trust Truffaut to provide an enigmatic ending!",

That being said, Antoine is certainly a human character. In attempting to escape from his parents, he has to do some terrible things. He steals and gets caught for it, spending a night in a prison cell.The final shot is one of the most beautiful and uplifting I've ever seen. I never imagined that the pure simplicity of a tracking shot following one boy running away to the beach could evoke so much emotion, but it made my heart swell up immensely. In fact the entire film is phenomenally shot. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. I found the entire picture incredibly relatable. Antoine's interactions with his parents felt so much like some of the experience I've had with my own in the past. It really felt like the scenes were taken right out of my past to the point of it being eerie. But that only helped me relate to Antoine even more.The young Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's performance is extraordinary. He completely became Antoine to the point where it was impossible to tell that he was even acting. It felt like we were just following this young boy and watching his natural reactions. This is a truly rare gift for actor's four times his age, so that just makes his work even more impressive.

(1959, French, R, 94 min Directed and co-written by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut with Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, Claire Maurier, Albert R\u00e9my). `The Four Hundred Blows' is idiomatic French for raising hell.  Which I found to be a strange title after someone explained the meaning.  No one in this movie is really raising hell nor forcing hell on others.  Antoine Doinel (L\u00e9aud) is a 14 year-old Parisian boy and a superficial view of his life is not idyllic but hardly hellish. His mom (Maurier) isn't the most attentive person in the world.  She is busy with a lot of things besides being a mom.  She has a lover, a fact about his mom that isn't a point of pride with Antoine.  Antoine has a stepfather (R\u00e9my).  Again, not the most attentive of parents.  Antoine isn't a good student.  All in all it's not the easiest of lives but nothing worth raising hell about.  And the hell he raises, isn't that big a deal.  He skips school.  He gets caught stealing a typewriter.  (Actually he gets caught returning the typewriter when he finds out he can't fence it.)  Antoine ends up in a reformatory and escapes, ending up on the shores of the North Sea. In what has become a relatively famous scene from French cinema, Antoine turns back from the sea and looks straight into the camera. \nWhat's intriguing and very good about `The Four Hundred Blows' is Truffaut's story telling techniques.  It is a very straightforward telling of a few events.  The camera often holds on a subject for a very long time.  In one scene, a police or school psychiatrist is questioning Antoine and the camera never moves from his face. Truffaut is very matter of fact about the events of Antoine life.  There are no really bad people in Antoine's life.  It doesn't seem overly traumatic that he skips school, sees his mother with her lover, or that his parents agree to send him to a reform school.  In the final scene on the shores of the North Sea, we see a confused and sad young kid.  Is he going to lead a life of raising hell, a life of stifling boredom, or will he accomplish greatness?  Truffaut doesn't tell us and it made me want to see the sequel.  Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with `The Four Hundred Blows.' `Love at Twenty', `Stolen Kisses', `Bed and Board' and `Love on the Run' continue this semi-autobiographical story of the young Parisian.`The Four Hundred Blows' is available on video.

            "content": "Please, allow me to describe this movie with two overused idioms without blaming me that I use clich\u00e9s; The 400 Blows is a movie that avoids mawkish melodrama, and has a story that is often imitated, but never duplicated. Because, honestly, I haven't seen any movie in my life that deserves these two phrases more than Les Quarte Centre Coups!In his directorial debut, Truffaut gave us a very sympathetic, and beautifully heart-wrenching story of a troubled young boy that you can easily tell that it came out of the legendary filmmaker's heart. I don't say that because this movie is, quite literally, the director's autobiographical story, but because it's impossible to relate to a protagonist such as Antoine Doinel so much like this unless his story is told by someone who really put his heart into this masterwork.We see Antoine as a class clown and troublemaker student, then we see him as a thief. He is also a liar, and above all that, his character is very stoic. So it's very clear that this character doesn't ask for sympathy, neither the movie, in its first act, wants us to empathize with and feel for Antoine.Nevertheless, and as I mentioned above, The 400 Blows is, in fact, a very touching and heartbreaking movie, but how it can be so with such a hateful protagonist. Simply, because Truffaut wittily builds sympathy in the audience by displaying both his misdeeds and the reasons he commits them that are also more than enough to justify them. But both the free technique Truffaut used to unfold the movie's plot, and the freewheeling use of the wide-screen frame also added up to the experience, and made the movie exceptionally engaging and relatable.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud would go on to a major career in films, but in this movie he gave a truly outstanding performance that I think is one of the best child performances I've seen ever! As the bad qualities of Antoine are displayed on screen, it was necessary that the actor who plays this character would be very talented so he can prove that Antoine is actually a poor down-on-his luck kid, and it's his uncaring parents are those who are responsible for making what Antoine is. And L\u00e9aud's expressive and honest facial expressions, and genuine and authentic acting were perfectly adequate to convey all that.However, Francois Truffaut did tend to our feelings a little bit at the end of the second act by using a sensitive score and showing some emotional moments that added an extra layer to Antoine's character, which is his sensitivity. But he didn't do that until he really became totally sympathized with Antoine due to the misfortunes he suffered from. That said, I think that could have happened more gradually.I found the second act a bit hollow, and I think it would have been more captivating if it was richer. But, this very act really grew on me after the movie's final act. I don't want to delve deeper, but there are some similar heart-wrenching moments the two final acts share that became more stronger and meaningful at the third act. In fact, they turned out to be quite disturbing and overwhelming, and made me say; this is how to cause a catharsis in the audience!The real major unforgivable issue I have with this movie is how Antoine's mother's feelings for him changed a great deal halfway through the movie. I understand what Truffaut wanted to do with the story, and why he shifted her character like this, but that didn't work for me at all. I think this shift made Gilberte an extremely problematic character instead of serving the plot. Also, I think by doing so, Truffaut had wasted a great chance to make this character more compelling, and therefore, made the plot more complex, considering the vital role Antoine's mom play in his character arc.That being said, these flaws can't take away the greatness from this bona fide classic that you can tell it has inspired many filmmakers today. It's also one of, if not the best movie that explored the troubled adolescence. And it, unquestionably, marks one of the most impressive directorial debuts in cinema history!(8/10)",

It's a picaresque tale that is refreshingly free of a moral. We don't necessarily watch the film to see that the young boy eventually sees the error of his ways; we watch simply to see what will happen to him, because we care about him. Truffaut gets his audience to feel for the boy exactly what the society in which he lives doesn't -- compassion -- and which, more than anything, would likely be most effective in convincing him to give up his delinquent ways.And there's that wonderful closing shot, the freeze on the boy's face, careless and free, qualities that the audience recognize as luxuries only the young can afford.Grade: A+",

No false dramatics here, no dopey comedy, no idiotic stereotypes--instead performances that touch the mind and the heart, scenes that stick in the mind (all those kids ditching the self-absorbed gym teacher as he snakes them through Parisian streets!), and a famous conclusion that still poses the same question. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Sometimes, we like to be surprised, and this indeed is a pleasant surprise. The 400 Blows is a very odd name and intact bears no real meaning with respect to content of the movie. But, The 400 Blows is a great film in a way that very few films are. There is a climax scene in which Antoine Doniel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) just runs to the ocean. There is a reason and it is that he just wanted to see the ocean. So, this film is not one that has a great story and is not even a deeply moving film. It's a film that most of us relate to as this is a film that has a child's tormented and troubled childhood. The film is more like a fictional documentary and a journey of a 12 year old boy, who is tormented by his teacher, plans to leave home, find that his father is not the original one. It's a great concocted film and a very deeply layered one. And all kudos to the director Francois Truffaut who is given us a very typically French film that has lot many subtexts and reflects the turmoil of an era and also speaks volumes about the sensitive minds of kids. Acting by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud is outstanding and even by other kids is superb. But it's Jean who steals the show all the way by making the audience sympathise, empathise and move with him. Francois Truffaut gave us one of the finest films on Kids and he must be saluted for that. The good things are the cinematography, the costumes and the art direction. Wow, they all were supreme and the cinematography specifically, built up a mood that even I felt related to the child and he seemed so close to me. Easily one of the best French Films, I rate this 5/5 and a must watch for all those who are into some serious film making. A film is not typically about a story, a beginning, a end and the interval bang, it's a poem or a journey and it can be anything. Some like it, some will not but good stories are bound to get some serious appreciation. I thank Truffaut for giving me this wonderful Film.",

The characters are easy to understand and relate to, the story as well. Nothing wrong there. However, it was mostly the way the film was shot that ruined it for me. It's full of long, metaphoric, unimportant shots that really just confused me rather than appealed to me. I often wondered just when is Truffaut going to end this overly-long shot, not out of suspense but out of frustrated boredom. Overall it's a simple, sad story that will leave you sad and confused. I respect it for it's craftsmenship, but it's not even remotely entertaining or thought-provoking.

Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud),is an attractive troubled adolescent who chooses the cinema and to read Balzac as escapism,imagine how far away this boy is from our time of predominant `video games'.Also was interesting the black and white cinematography and to see a different Paris from the 1950s.Every great film has its unforgetable moments (like Mouchette's night in the woods,). I can choose three or four in this movie ,but I prefer two great ones: Antoine watching through the  back window of the police van while this is moving away(also Antoine in jail pulling his turtleneck over his nose).The other emblematic scene is the last one:Antoine Doinel escapes, and the great moment when he rushes, arms open, toward the sea, savoring his freedom, is captured by Truffaut in a memorable freeze frame.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud brings a natural performance of tenderness and quiet desperation.

            "content": "I'm a little hesitant about rating and reviewing Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows,' as my first viewing was a rather dysfunctional and muddled affair, one of those moments when you wish that DVD technology had never been invented as a substitute for the perfection of the cinema screen. A remarkable feature-length debut from the revered critic-turned-director, Truffaut's touching and funny portrait of juvenile angst proved one of the pioneering films in the French New Wave. Just a few days ago, I decided to attend my university's film society for a showing of the film, but, inconceivably and unforgivably, the screening was started a full thirty minutes into the picture, and, due to a wearisome technical fault, we missed a further ten minutes in the centre of the story, including the moment when young Antoine reveals himself to have never seen the ocean, a remark that proves extremely significant once we arrive at the conclusion.Fortunately, I had a copy of the film back at home, and promptly viewed the scenes that had been neglected, allowing me to better appreciate the intricate depths to which the film explored its characters and their respective situations. Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) was born out of wedlock, and practically abandoned by his parents to live with relatives. After several years, Antoine returns to his resentful mother (Claire Maurier) and his kind, if inadequate, stepfather (Albert R\u00e9my) to hopefully commence a normal lifestyle, but, driven by the discomfort of his uneasy home relationships, Antoine descends into a life of mischief and petty crime. When his misbehavior becomes overwhelming for his strained parents, Antoine finds himself in a correctional facility for juvenile delinquents, and, despite the institute's strict disciplinary action, he still finds himself yearning for \"a life of his own,\" to be completely independent of his elders, and to live unrestrained by their narrow-minded restrictions.L\u00e9aud, in only his second film appearance, is wonderfully natural in the main role, portraying Antoine's tortured confinement \u0096 stemming both from society's restrictive disciplinary system, and his stagnant family relationships \u0096 with poignant, and often funny, enthusiasm. He would reunite with Truffaut on a further four occasions between 1962 and 1979 to complete the story of Antoine Doinel's life. There's little doubt that 'The 400 Blows' is at least partially autobiographical. Truffaut himself never knew his natural father, had a detached relationship with his mother and frequently found shelter in his love for cinema. During the film, Antoine discovers a passion for the French novelist and playwright Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, whose successful career was borne from a life plagued with personal and professional difficulties, his willful nature often squandering his attempts at business success. Always thirsting for independence from those who dictate rules to him, Antoine relates easily with Balzac, even building a candle-lit throne to the author, but his word-for-word \"homage\" is mistaken for plagiarism by his short-sighted school teacher.The film's final moments are rightfully celebrated for their touching and poignant ambiguity, as Antoine escapes from the juvenile institution and proceeds towards the ocean, which he has never seen before; his arrival at the rolling waves representative of that almost-unattainable independence of which he was so desirous. In a single, extremely smooth long-shot, Antoine ambles across the sand, always moving forward but seemingly getting nowhere. As he finally kicks at the breaking surf, Antoine pauses, perhaps uncertain of his path from here. Having acquired his goal of independence, he suddenly finds himself alone and purposeless, a small boy playing dolefully in the water. Antoine turns his back to the ocean and faces the audience directly {does he see his pursuers approaching in the distance?}, and the camera zooms in on a captured frame of Antoine's face, his soft, inquiring eyes asking us what he's supposed to do now.",

            "content": "The beauty of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is not found in terms of its technical merit (even though, in technical terms, it is still a brilliant piece), but in the heart and soul of the film, the shear love with which it was made. Truffaut said time and time again that the cinema saved his life, and you get the impression that the only way he felt he could repay his sanctuary was by committing himself to it. He did so in many ways! Not only did the auteur commit his time to movies, by being a lover of film and a critic, he soon became a director, producing this inspired masterpiece. Perhaps, that is what makes it a masterpiece. The film truly is inspired; inspired by Truffaut's life, his passion for cinema, and his theories about how films should be created. The result is amazing! Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, is a misunderstood young boy, trying to keep his head above water, despite being caught up in what seems to be a predestined downward spiral. His teacher and his parents do not trust him, and he knows this. Seeing no trust to betray, he does whatever he can to try to compensate for how miserable he is treated. His mother (Claire Maurier) is busy working and trying to be a housewife, despite an affair she is having with another man. His father (Albert Remy) seems nice enough, but loses his temper when he is disappointed in the young man. Because of an already-existent lack of trust the parents have for their son, everything he does is perceived as wrong. No one ever takes the time (not his parents, certainly not his despicable teacher) to actually look at the boy, to determine whether there is any malice in his actions, or if he is simply a misguided little boy, searching for something he cannot describe or define. This is Truffaut's gift - He allows us to look through the screen, to see this young man, to study him, maybe for only one hundred minutes, but we are given the time to see the truth in this child that few probably ever saw in the young, tormented Truffaut. To miss this film is to deprive yourself of a rare cinematic experience!",

            "content": "Whenever the phrase 'French New Wave' gets mentioned, among the few films that someone thinks of, one of them will always be 'The 400 Blows'. This film is the one that made the 'French New Wave' movement famous all around the world. This movement revolved around the internalisation of a confluence of influences and then the execution of something unique, real and personal with the help of those influences as well as new revolutionary ideas. While watching 'The 400 Blows' one can see the dedication to realism in terms of shooting on location which can be found in Italian neo-realism, one can find a fluidity in the camera movement that is reminiscent of Hitchcock and Max Oph\u00fcls, one can find the precise use of lighting to make the shadows prominent in certain scenes similar to film-noir or German expressionism, one can also find a bit of poetic realism reminiscent of Renoir and Satyajit Ray. But Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut elevates the film from being a merely experimental piece of work paying homage to his influences to a greatly touching piece of work through the tender treatment of characters, intimate exploration of themes and expressive editing techniques which make his film as personal as can be.The film's opening credits are accompanied by a montage of tracking shots in the streets of Paris with the Eiffel Tower being a constant presence. Through this creative choice, Truffaut instantly establishes the setting of the film. This maybe a personal story about the troubles of a young boy, but it is also a film about the disintegration of the French urban family structure and the deterioration of parental attention and guidance. Antoine' parents, though not being complete monsters, seem not interested in their child's life. Antoine also gets constantly victimised at school due to the overt dictatorship of the teachers. A character at one point in the film remarks about the mysteries of what goes on in Antoine's head. The tragedy is that no one tries to understand his mindset. Antoine gets burdened with limitless housework and is deprived of the freedom that he constantly seeks during the film. Although this has a Dickensian quality to it, Truffaut never undermines the fact that Antoine truly does engage in questionable activities which gradually proceed to petty criminal acts. He merely tries to view everything from Antoine's perspective to understand the reasons and the scenarios that could've driven him to such actions.The pursuit of freedom is a very important theme in the film. There are a number techniques through which Truffaut underlines this. There are constant images of bars and fences superimposed over Antoine to express his thematic confinement. The interiors of Antoine's family's apartment are made to look particularly claustrophobic which makes the cinema verite scenes on location in the streets of Paris look very refreshing. Truffaut uses appropriate music very creatively at just the right times to underline emotions. The editing is creative and was revolutionary at the time. There are long takes, rapid dissolves and some frantic cuts(there is a remarkable cut from one panning shot to another) that accentuate Truffaut's inventive directorial ideas. There is one particular scene in the film, where Antoine walks down the stairs to dump the garbage which blew me away due to the subtle and intricate details that Truffaut inserts at every moment of the scene. From the sudden appearance and disappearance of the French National Anthem on the radio in an adjacent room to the flickering light when the garbage is being dumped, the whole scene is masterfully directed.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud is almost pitch perfect as the young Antoine. He has the most expressive eyes. There are moments where his voice modulation, his eye movements and general mannerisms are almost absurdly convincing for a first time child actor and of course Truffaut deserves credit for getting such a layered performance out of him.'The 400 Blows' is a film which richly deserves its accolades and acclaim. It is a deeply personal film that tries to understand the world from the perspective of a young boy who has been deemed a lost cause by his family and the society. The fact that this is a loosely auto-biographical piece of work, makes the film as a whole as well the last few moments of the film extremely poignant.",

This film is neither. Truffaut's main goal in making this film was to show the uncontrollable downward spiral of one boy. We are shown this through the boy \"Antoine\" eyes. Whether reflected in multiple mirrors at his mom's vanity or from the bottom of a spinning carnival ride, it is his view and perspective of the world that we see. The adult world is conspicuously absent except for the occasional villain or incompetent who happens to pass through Antoine's life. This film is shocking today, with our modern views on decency and political correctness. It was not designed to shock its audiences at the time. The idea of a child being disposable is a lost concept in today's world. The end of the film is especially important in the fact that Antoine, alone on the beach, could be interpreted as having reached his end. He has, throughout the film, sunk lower and lower no matter how hard he tried to better himself. By the end, we are led to believe he has reached his end, both figuratively and literally. My feeling is that instead of despair, he is faced with hope. The beach represents not an end but beginning, and one of limitless possibilities and a chance to begin again. This film is a timeless story of hope and the possibilities of redemption. Truffaut's style is modern and creative for its time. He stays away from stylized techniques that would have only dated this film. If this film was in color, I feel that an audience of today would have a hard time differentiating 400 Blows from a modern movie.",

Indeed, the astute social critique leaves the viewer with long lasting impressions. But the boy's plight will ever remain the single most potent symbol in my memory of the vindication, liberty, freedom, and inevitable alienation humans undergo in their lives. Definitely a movie I would like to see again and again, if not to enjoy the beauty of the filming, but at least to remind myself the predicament of life.",

His mother and stepfather are portrayed as preoccupied and uncaring, and the schoolteachers are hostile, impatient and inept, but the kid himself is no angelic Oliver Twist.  A lazy student, he plagiarizes his homework when he isn't cutting classes altogether, nearly burns down the family's apartment due to his thoughtlessness, and steals a typewriter out of his stepfather's office during one of his prolonged absences away from home.  Amazingly, Truffaut manages to blend a great deal of charm and humor into this sad situation, and the city of Paris becomes practically another character.

            "content": "'The 400 Blows', Truffaut's debut feature film, marks the beginning of his screen persona, Antoine Doinel; it's one of the most noted films of the French New Wave, and one of the most intriguing stories on adolescence. The most brilliant aspect of it is that it doesn't have a particular agenda, and just lets us witness everything going on in the life of a misunderstood teenager as it is. It's the thoughts and acts most teenagers go through, maybe in different ways. I think, most people would relate to Antoine at some level or the other.It's the story of a misunderstood child who faces trouble both at school and home, and tries to escape both these places. He senses neglect at home, and and his taste and talent being ignored or (misunderstood) by the teachers doesn't help either. Lack of affection is the main cause for most mischief and rebellion at that age.The background score is mesmerizing, and it really sets the tone of the movie from the beginning credits scene showing us entrancing visuals of Paris - beautiful, innocent, yet rough like the main protagonist. The wide-angle camera is used quite effectively (it's 1959).The acting is terrific. It's said that Truffaut auditioned hundreds of teenagers before finalizing on Jean-Pierre Leaud, with whom (he said) he found many similarities of family neglect, talent, mischief and rebellion. Jean-Pierre is incredibly talented and charms us with his acting; the shades of innocence, fear, rebellion and curiosity are portrayed quite adeptly by him. His monologues with the counselor are quite captivating. He goes on to play Antoine Doinel in four other Truffaut movies.Most memorable scenes from the movie include: The 'Wheel Of Death' scene, which is actually the first scene in the movie that completely fascinates and thrills you. The single shot of the kids on a morning jog with their PE teacher, where they bunk the class by slowly detaching themselves from the main group; it's incredibly amusing. Antoine's sessions with the counselor. And of course, the beautifully-shot open-ended climax scene.(Note: The film's French title comes from a French idiom \"faire les quatre cents coups\" which means \"to raise hell\", but I can't figure out why they went for the literal translation for the English Title; it doesn't make any sense at all. In short, it's a terrible and misleading English title, and has got nothing to do with the film.)",

Within reflective, meditative, and a little sentimental long takes, Jean-Pierre Leaud keeps running, running, running, he turns around on the beach, the motion stops precisely at a very vulnerable moment, and the picture zooms-in to Leaud's face.Made in the midst of the French New Wave, the film's cinematic technique is comparatively conservative.

            "content": "This film was naturally one I knew nothing about from its recommendation in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I was hoping of course knowing that and seeing critics give it five out of five stars that it would live it to this good reputation, from director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (Jules et Jim). Basically twelve year old Antoine Doinel (BAFTA nominated Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is the boy growing up in Paris during the early 1950's, misunderstood by his parents at home and at school tormented by his insensitive French teacher (Guy Decomble), and to get away from both these problems he frequently runs away. He finally decides to quit school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarism, and to finance his plans to leave home and get away from everything he steals the typewriter from his father Julien (Albert R\u00e9my), but when he finds out he has his son arrested. Antoine spends the night in the police cell locked up with prostitutes, thieves and hardened criminals, and being interviewed by a judge his mother Gilberte Doinel (Claire Maurier) confesses that Julien is not the boy's biological father. This causes the young man to be placed with other troubled children in an observation centre near the shore, this is his mother's wish, and his unhappiness is brought out during his probing by a psychiatrist, and we see these troubles told in fragmented monologues. Antoine is then one day playing football with the boys in the centre, and under the fence he manages to escape and reach the ocean, which he had always wanted to visit through his life, and the film freezes and zooms on the face of the boy as he looks directly into the camera. Also starring Patrick Auffay as Ren\u00e9 Bigey and Georges Flamant as Mr. Bigey. Young L\u00e9aud gives a very good performance as the boy who runs away from the things he hates and causes trouble for others, it is an interesting choice for the debut film for director Truffaut as it is very close to autobiographical, I admit that I couldn't fully agree with the five out of five star rating from the critics as at times it could be complicated and I couldn't follow it, but as a film I can see it is a most worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Good, in my opinion!",

The central character, Doinel, is played well, and is likeable, but hardly a master criminal, and certainly doesn't descend into the life of violence the tag-lines would have you believe. Good acting, stylish direction and likeable characters aren't enough to classify this as a masterpiece though. As coming of age dramas go, this is hardly groundbreaking. I didn't dislike the film, it simply failed to grab me. I sympathised with Doinel, and found him to be an enjoyable character, although his story seemed to fumble along with very little meaning or direction. If you are looking for groundbreaking, Los Olvidados is more \"punchy\", and states its case far better. Not being from France in the late 50's it is difficult to say exactly how realistic this is, though I am guessing it is pretty accurate for the time. It's certainly worth checking out, but ultimately it is overhyped, and falls short of the expectation one is given. All in all, an enjoyable, if unremarkable story, that is charming enough in it's own way, with an above average cast, though it is ultimately, somewhat forgettable.",

            "content": "The 400 Blows (1959) :French Cinema's attempt in New Wave Drama succeeds in what it intends to do, but what else? Nothing. By the late 50s not many cinema industries were keen to try new storytelling style and different fashion in filmmaking except for some Foreign Language industries. Italian films successfully explored this New Wave filmmaking and French cinema too did very well considerably. This attempt of French Cinema focuses on a child therefore his innocence doesn't harm the content but it also doesn't give it a chance to become hard-hitting. The 400 Blows is film is about a young boy, a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. Nothing in his life seems to be going good or at least favourable hence he never even tries to be become a good boy. That's all The 400 Blows has in it's pocket and that's everything you need to know. Looking at the intention of the writer and Director this film successfully reaches it's destination with no loo breaks and almost no mistakes but is it really enough in New Wave Cinema? I personally expected something really thought provoking and out of the line from this so called New Wave cinema but except for technical accuracies the film doesn't have anything in storyline to offer. In my personal opinion this film does not deserve a place in IMDb Top 250 Films list. We have so many better deserving films out of the list. The acting, the screenplay and the technical aspects of the film are notable. Direction of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut is almost superb. I loved how he explained the boy's life from every aspect of his life. Every aspect was unfolded one after another and very smoothly. The negative portion is mainly in the climax which could have been dramatic or at least thoughtful in some other way. Overall,. A Nice attempt to achive something out of the box but nothing upto the hype created by some Critics and IMDb users.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

Are some movies considered great because they made their mark during an earlier time when their form was considered new and daring? What if the same movie were made today? Would they receive the same recognition? Another reviewer states that Truffaut makes the mundane entirely absorbing. Watching this movie today I came away thinking that it was pretty much just mundane. I really didn't get much out of young Antoine Doinel's (Jean-Pierre Leaud) plight except that he was a directionless kid who was headed the wrong way in life with no one to apply the brakes. There wasn't a single role model he could look to in order to keep him on a straight path, making his descent into delinquency unavoidable.But did that really have to be? Another person in the same situation might have found a way to rise above those circumstances to be a stalwart student and a good citizen. It does happen all the time, maybe not the norm, but it does happen. It's my understanding that this was a somewhat autobiographical treatment by Truffaut, so if his young life was marred by similar circumstances, then one would congratulate him for rising above that situation. But taking us through this exercise with no conclusion seemed like a pointless one to me.",

            "review_title": "A picture about flight - but where to?",
            "content": "\"Les Quatre-Cent Coups\" is arguably the French filmmaker Truffaut's most personal film, borrowing a great deal from own experiences and people around him or circumstances Truffaut could identify with. The English translation of the title unfortunately doesn't reflect the ambiguity which is prevalent in French, where the idiom \"quatre cents coups (du diable)\" refers to \"impish pranks\" or \"pieces of mischief\" and beatings at the same time. The emphasis does not lie on the latter in the original intention, thus setting the picture in a better context. Be it as it may: Being the first feature of Truffaut after having started out as a film critic, he knows exactly what he wants to do with the material, and it shows as he embraces realism in Paris of the 50s and 60s - real life, everyday people, situations as they happen, right until the minuscule details.What you get with \"Les Quatre-Cent Coups\" is not a big epic story, it's small things put together. It's a progression, a chain of consequences where cause is followed by effect, with pieces here and there adding to the downward spiral that draws Antoine Doinel more and more into it. He is a boy with hopes and dreams, trying to cope with his life the best as he can given the cards dealt to him on his spinning ride, reacting in a young adolescent's way to counter them, making mistakes, yet also attempting to correct them, nevertheless ending up running, running, running - where to? Truffault just poses the question in intense imagery, unusually long, slow and poetic scenes, with wide children's eyes starring back at the viewer, photographed in splendid black and white. An emotional journey not to be missed.",

            "content": "Voil\u00e0\u0097the New Wave has reached the shore. At times dazzling and tragic, Francois Truffaut's bleak look at French society and juvenile delinquents is markedly different than other films of the era. While some directors were looking outward at America or making edgy films, Truffaut explores the interior life of Antoine Doinel. Antoine Doinel\u0097played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who reprises this role in later Truffaut films\u0097is a misbehaving boy. At school, he is caught passing a lewd photo of a woman. He is without remorse, playing tricks behind the teacher's class (played by Guy Decomble from Melville's \"Bob le Flambeur\"). He is the class clown in a rigid school where any malfeasance is not tolerated. The schoolteacher pauses his lesson and says, \"Poor France, what a future!\" When he skips school one day with co-conspirator and sidekick Ren\u00e9, he sees his mother kissing a man. This man is not her husband. She sees him, he definitely sees her, and the two scurry away. A jazzy score quickens the melancholy pace of the film, matching the mood and pulse of Paris quite nicely. It's not a stretch to assign this film social critique status. At two points in the film, teachers lead children on forced exercise walks on the streets. In pairs of two, the children break apart from the group unbeknownst to the teacher until none remain. Truffaut\u0097a rebel who created Doinel as a two parts himself one part his friends\u0097is poking fun at the establishment. The nation's future\u0097its children\u0097are rebelling against the rigidity and discipline of their elders, the teachers. It's not loud, it's not overt, but it is happening steadily. This tension between the older generation and the younger generation defined the New Wave directors and drives this film. Understandably, many critics think this film champions cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of sorts\u0097the severity with which juvenile delinquents are treated. I tend to agree. Doinel is sent away without so much as a fair seat at the table. He is mixed in with petty thieves and worse. The plot of the film is irrelevant. Doinel cannot sit still because he yearns for adventure and cheap thrills\u0097arcade, movies, 'Gravitron' ride\u0097and his truant behavior catches up with him. Eventually, he is shipped away to a reform school where he is to straighten up. Doinel is the soul of the film. He is not a bad boy. He is a real boy. Marcel Moussy and Truffaut wanted to paint a more realistic, complex portrait of a boy (with a mind, a heart, and often conflicting emotions), and they have succeeded brilliantly. He knows right from wrong. He just can't be bothered. He sets the table for dinner, then steals money. He gets a thrill out of breaking the rules. But he has a conscience\u0097he can't get the professor's harsh voice out of his head. When Doinel plays hooky, he overhears another woman talking at the bakery about an unwanted child. Doinel pauses to listen, then winces. In some ways, Doinel is the product of his parents. His mother is strict, serious, unwavering. But his father\u0097with whom we emphasize\u0097is funny, loose, and proud of Doinel. He knows Doinel stole his Michelin guide, but he would rather hope for the best than outright accuse him. Truffaut has an eye for domesticities and quotidian life. The relationship between his mother and father is similarly strained. Their marriage is so familiar, they are both weary of it. When disputes arise, we see Doinel wrapped in his sleeping blanket on his mattress, listening. The plot quickens when Doinel admits to a shrink that his mother wanted an abortion, and it was his grandmother who convinced her otherwise. The catch: he made up that last bit, and ad-libbed the whole interview. This powerful scene\u0097in which Doinel is speaking actually to Truffaut because the actress wasn't available\u0097has outlived 400 Blows. He fidgets, he shrugs, he uhhs\u0097L\u00e9aud *is* Doinel. Chilling. Like other films of this era, all shots are taken at real locations. Henri Decea, the cinematographer who is as much of a staple of the New Wave as Truffaut and Godard, provides a revealing capture of a child without seeming condescending, too close, or too far. We are invited into Doinel's world like a silent co-conspirator, a witness to his every act, capture, and punishment. This film is at once marvelous and poignant. Even if you elect not to see the movie (a mistake), you must catch the last scene on YouTube. Doinel has escaped the confines of his reform school, and runs to the sea. The final shot of Doinel is \"as famous as the Odessa steps in Battleship Potempkin, or the snow globe from Citizen Kane\" according to critic Richard Neupart. A must-see for any film major, buff, or appreciator. If you liked this film, you should consider Truffaut's earlier work Les mistons.",

And by likable, I don't really mean \"likable\" so much as a character everyone identifies with in some way. He is the rebel with a cause, a 12 year old who isn't so bad behaved as he has very bad timing. When a centerfold is passed around class, the teacher catches him with it. When he creates a shrine to his idol the poet Balzac, it catches fire.I have not seen any of the other \"Antoine Doniel\" films, and I don't want to. It was probably a mistake to make any more - the film ends perfectly as it is, and its better off left alone.Doniel lives in a small, cramped apartment with his two parents who are constantly yelling at each other. He occasionally gets along with the father, but more than often he is treated unfairly by both. The film follows him through many misadventures, that go from skipping school and running from home and stealing a typewriter. By the end we're cheering him on and no film manages this better.I'd rather not write any more about \"The 400 Blows\" (or \"Les Quatre Cents Coups\" which is short for a French idiom - \"faire Les quatre cents coups\" \"to raise hell\").

Antione's stepfather is a decent sort but seems more interested in auto rallies than in Antione and his mother is preoccupied with the family's state of near poverty as well as with an extramarital affair. As Antione drifts toward juvenile delinquency the movie achieves it poignancy from our being able to see so clearly how this tough, independent, spirited kid comes to his undeserved fate. Between the neglectful parents, the despotism of his school masters, and the unsparing harshness of the justice system, Antione is bucking some heavy odds. He gets by with very little - the thing that finally lands him in a correctional institution is his being caught *returning* a typewriter he has stolen from his father's office.Many often criticize a movie with the comment that, \"I didn't like any people in this movie.\" It will be the unusual person who can say this about \"The 400 Blows.\" You are immediately drawn to Antione and identify with him throughout.As captivating as the filming is (it's actually shot in widescreen, unusual for a 50s movie), it is L\u00e9aud who really carries this. He is so believable that you can't help but be awed by his performance. His interview with the psychologist is outstanding for its realism.The musical score is near perfect. I can only describe it as producing a feeling of hopeful melancholy.The final several minutes are enough to send chills up the spine and anyone who appreciates this film will never forget the final freeze-frame.",

            "content": "This movie bewilders me. It may be that I'm just a stupid American, but I really just don't get 400 Blows. Everything I've read about this movie has been a total rave, but I just couldn't stay interested. I'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier, may I'm just not \"sensitive\" or \"artsy\" enough, but whatever the case is, I hated this movie. The story itself isn't bad; it's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason, so I didn't always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough, but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. The plot isn't even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending, by the way, was completely over my head. It's way too artsy for me, and I just didn't get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just didn't end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now, I'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, I'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap. Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his\u0085 unique decisions. As it was, I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life.",

Then, there was interval of more than 40 years, during which I never watched it, though not forgot. Recently I bought DVD and saw it again. I got the same huge impression. But now I have understood the cause of it. It is not only the greatness of Truffaut, excellent photography of Anri Decaee, charming musical score of Jean Constantine, performance of wonderful children Jean-Pierre Leaud and Patrick Auffray. All these were not enough. But, in addition to these qualities of the movie, I had a strong feeling of identification with Antoine, and that identification had come because many facts and events of my childhood were coinciding with what had happened with him. Even surroundings of my childhood was almost the same - not in Paris, but in one of the greatest capital cities. I think many people on whom the film made so strong impression had that sense of identification.The tragedy of J.P. Leaud is that he came to perfection TOO EARLY, at his teens. But one who had come to perfection stops his development. In other movies of the A.D. circle (Stolen Kisses and so on), he is, IMHO, incomparably weaker than in the first film. So, the endearing boy - Antoine Doinel of the 400 blows - became for J.P. Leaud a kind of a monster, with whom he had to contend all his life, and whom he could never overtake, not mention to leave behind. Genius in his childhood, he lowered to just a good (sometimes not so good) actor in his adulthood. A learned artistic craft of his later films could never substitute the freshness and vitality of the 400 blows.",

Set in early 1950s Paris, The 400 Blows is an expertly crafted character study of a young adolescent who's often misunderstood by his peers &, after being left with no attention, delves into a life of petty crime.Wonderfully directed by Truffaut, the film not for once loses its grip on the viewers' attention despite featuring no definite plot or offering any sort of redemption in the end. It's a careful observation of how even the smallest of events sometimes end up playing a significant role in shaping an individual and its black-n-white cinematography makes sure that the film never ages out.Coming to the performances, this is Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's show from start to finish & to say that he did a fine job in capturing his character's essence would be a massive understatement for it's a performance that's nearly flawless. On an overall scale, The 400 Blows remains one of the most notable works of French New Wave and is a treasured gem that offers an unapologetic, honest & nostalgic reflection of adolescent life.",

With his debut film, Truffaut created one of the greatest paeans to childhood and Paris committed to celluloid. The camera and director are absolutely punch-drunk in love with everything they lay their eyes on. It's an incredible experience. Truffaut would go on to make more competent films (this is very much the work of a young man) but none would ever match the energy and unbridled joy here. There would be moments when he came close, but nothing would top this film. There's so much to shout about--Antoine Doinel smoking, the schoolboys sneaking off as they are led through the streets of Paris, Antoine stealing milk, Antoine talking to the psychologist, and, of course, the closing shot as Antoine faces the sea. It's a superbly brilliant closing moment and the perfect finale for this film. I really cannot say a single negative thing about 400 Blows. It's magnificent. I also cannot say a single negative thing about its director. Truffaut is my personal favorite of all the directors that developed out of Cahiers du Cinema. By far. He has a humanity that Godard lacks, and he's simply a more interesting filmmaker than Rohmer or Bresson or Melville. He's wonderful and so is this movie--a Romantic ode to childhood that steers clear of the sentimentality that often bogs down American films dealing with a similar subject. It's simply brilliant.",

The film is a poignant, but equally breathtaking reminder of the fact that children will be children, and that without support from the adults in their lives, they will lose direction despite the best efforts of their own peers.

            "content": "This is the first film by legendary French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut that I have seen. Finally. I read that this was one of Truffaut's first films,if not his very first. Furthermore, \"The 400 Blows\" holds an important place in French film history as the film that ushers in the Modern Era of French cinema. It is vital to keep these facts in mind as we review this film.On the surface, it is actually just a film about how chronic parental neglect leads to juvenile delinquency, a topic oft-tackled in many films. But as the pioneer in Cinema Verite, \"The 400 Blows\" is remarkable in its most original approach (at that time, at least). The ordinary life of a low-income family in a small apartment is portrayed with an almost documentary feel. We follow the lead character Antoine Doinel as his ordinary school mischief leads to truancy, leading to running away from home, gradually leading to actual thievery and eventually, to jail. We see how the adults (his parents, teachers, authorities) around him react to his behavior. It is all very realistic. Of course, we have seen this style a lot of times by now. But keep in mind that this film was the FIRST to do it.For me, the best part of the film was definitely the lead actor Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud. He is very natural as he goes through a tumultuous adolescence as experienced by his character Antoine. It seemed like he was not acting at all. The highlight of his acting is that scene where he was being interviewed in the corrections center. His delivery of those lines was appropriately nuanced and felt. There was none of the affected artificiality that mars a lot of child performances at that time. I read that L\u00e9aud would reprise this character in three more Truffaut films, so I hope I can also get to see those in the future.",

Well, we all know the Academy can crash sometimes.By asking if this is Truffaut's Halloween, I am not suggesting a horror film, although some would consider the pervasive juvenile delinquency in our society to be a horror.I would not tend to describe Antoine, the 12-year-old main character of the film as a juvenile delinquent. He is more just stretching and spreading as he finds his limits and comes of age. He does this in an atmosphere of constant bickering by his parents, and finding out that his mother really didn't want him, and that she is having an affair. All this could, in different circumstance, create a Michael Myers character.Truffaut presents a film that, while devoid of startling action, keeps us transfixed as we observe the mundane life of Antoine.

I may not have been as completely insane in some of the stuff I did (as this little boy clearly was) but I was still similar to him. Especially with all his scenes in school; I've had teachers that randomly single kids out even if it wasn't completely their fault. This kid definitely had a rough couple of years though.

            "content": "To not have a mother's love is one of the most heartbreaking things in life. Antoine Doinel is an example of a kid who, on the surface, has a stable home life \u2013 with a roof over his head, a decent school, and parents who look out for him, albeit with them sometimes taking turns as one or another is often out at night. However, as the movie progresses, we get glimpses of just how difficult the young man's life is \u2013 his mother's infidelity, overheard arguments, and their careless comments. The way Truffaut slowly reveals the details is masterful, which is all the more impressive given this was the director's first film. Doinel is played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who at 15 was taken under the 27-year-old Truffaut's wing as a kindred spirit of sorts, and he turns in a remarkable performance \u2013 natural, honest, and highly realistic. We see him acting out in school, cutting class, and getting into trouble. Even when he does try to apply himself, reading Balzac, it ends wrong at home, with the candle he's lit in a small shrine of sorts starting a fire, and at school, where out of inspiration he paraphrases Balzac so closely that he gets an F for plagiarism.There are many great shots, and the film is beautiful. The street scenes in Paris. A swirling centrifugal carnival ride. The shot from atop a tall building, which follows a school teacher as he leads the kids down the street, only to have groups of two and three of them peeling off along the way to get into mischief. Little children watching a puppet show, with rows and rows of faces reacting with such natural animation, and unmistakably telling us of their emotions. The interview with the psychologist, shown from her perspective, as Doinel answers her questions about why he lies and steals in a straightforward manner. That's a very powerful scene, and one that really ties it all together emotionally. This film will impact you. Its ending leaves the young man's fate unresolved \u2013 just as in life. He's at a crossroads of sorts. He may get into further trouble and spiral, becoming a criminal, or he may be saved by a passion for something, as Truffaut himself was with cinema, or by his inner good nature. We certainly hope for the latter, but can't help but worry. Put up with by his stepfather but unloved, a nuisance to his mother and deep down unwanted, labeled a bad kid by his teachers and put into the system \u2013 these things go deep into his core. In a non-cloying way, the film explains why some people turn out as they do, and makes us want to be more understanding and kind.",

            "content": "One of the best-loved and most memorable of all French films, Les quatre cents coups established Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as a great film director and launched the acting career of Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud.This is a poignant story about the life of a young teenage boy who seeks escape from his loveless, lonely existence by committing minor crimes and creating fantasies.  We now know that the film is a semi-biographical account of Truffaut's own troubled childhood.  He too lived with an adoptive father and a mother who resented having a child.  (Truffaut himself was born in secrecy, to avoid the scandal of a birth outside of wedlock, and parcelled off to his grandmother for the early years of his life).  Indeed it is difficult to see where the autobiography ends and the fiction begins - a characteristic which is noticeable in virtually all of Truffaut's subsequent films.  It is probably Truffaut's intimacy with the subject of his films that imbue them with such warmth and humanity and guarantee their emotional impact.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud was cast by Truffaut himself, having advertised the role. There is an uncanny similarity between the two men, both physically and in their mannerisms. L\u00e9aud became Truffaut's friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for a substantial part of their careers, with Truffaut reusing the character of Antoine in a series of films spanning 20 years.  Indeed it is difficult to watch L\u00e9aud without seeing something of Truffaut in his performance.  In Les quatre cents coups, L\u00e9aud plays the part of the unhappy teenage boy \u00e0 la perfection.  His futile attempts to please his parents, his empty fantasies, his loneliness when he takes to the streets of Paris - glimpses of a broken childhood that immortalises the young Antoine as possibly one of the most sympathetic figure in French cinema history.Henri Decae's black and white photography appears the perfect medium for Truffaut's wistful tale.  Location filming is used extensively, creating an impression of expanse and freedom which depicts what the young Antoine is looking for but which is constantly denied him.  The scenes when the young boy is ultimately confined in a police van being driven the night streets of Paris have a deeply tragic poignancy.  The final shots, with Antoine apparently finding his freedom on a vast expanse of beach, but leading no where but to the open sea, are similarly very moving.Decae's photography and Truffaut's script are very well complemented by Jean Constantin engaging musical score, having a child-like simplicity that seems to underline the futility of Antoine's aspirations for a better life.Les quatre cents coups was instantly successfully when it was released in 1959, winning Truffaut the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. It was one of the first and most influential films in the New Wave of French films.  It was and remains a popular film all over the world, but especially in France.  It is - simply - a masterpiece.",

Even though he tries to satisfy the demands of both of these institutions the improved solutions that he thought up in childish naiveity lead to fatal consequences. once he is classified a troublemaker by his teacher and parents there is no escape from the process where at its end family and educational system arrange his deportation to a working camp for juvenile delinquents.Truffauts approach to the subject becomes clear in a scene where dozens of little children excitedly follow a puppetshow, pointing out how children all react alike to a well intended input from the grown up world, at the same time indicating that children enter the world with a pure mind and soul and consequently showing how grown ups settled Antoines fate as a juvenile delinquent.without clumsy sentimentality but a very sharp sense for Antoine's in the beginning uncritical and naive perception of the process of his criminalization during that he gradually develops an understanding for what is happening to him, Truffaut depicts the drama that culminates in the final scene where Antoine runs away from the working camp to the nearby sea as an attempt to escape from the criminal identity and emotional pain imposed on him by parents and educational institutions.Truffaut more or less portrays his own youth in this movie.

            "content": "The introduction of Francois Truffaut into cinema is The 400 Blows, a marvelous insight into the profile of a teenage Parisian boy unable to connect himself to his surroundings and the responsibilities required of him. He cannot focus at school, he dislikes his home life and his parents' constant bickering, and he has an uncanny knack for getting into troublesome situations. This story arc is based in part on Truffaut's own childhood, only to be saved by the cinema and its open invitation of stability and security.While being widely considered as the starting point for the French New Wave, a watermark moment in film history, this film at its most basic level is essentially the story of a young boy attempting to find the place in which he fits most comfortably. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the film is Jean-Pierre Leaud's face, which is so simple and understandable in its emotional tone and perception that we are never once aware of him as an actor portraying a role. He is this character of Antoine Doinel in every sense. Truffaut also was able to showcase his genius of genuine film-making. A devoted defender of the auteur theory, no other director made this theory more believable. Every shot, every camera angle, every scene bursts with the excitement and joy of film; this is a most rare characteristic. This is certainly a Truffaut film; no one else could instill such rhapsody of life and living. Despite the downbeat material, there is a remarkable sense of a new beginning. Indeed, this was a new beginning for Truffaut's life. And we are more than happy to go along for the ride with him.",

            "content": "French director Francois Truffaut made a stunning directorial debut with the deeply moving The 400 Blows. The film tells the story of Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood and neglected adolescent as he devolves into a life of petty crime. He has a depraved upbringing, living with his parents who only seem to notice him when he gets in trouble for things that are constantly blown out of proportion by his hateful teachers. The only place Antoine can find refuge is with his delinquent friends who, being much more fortunate than Antoine, don't suffer the consequences of their actions like Antoine does. The film is a meaningful look into the life of the adolescent and growing up under subtly harsh circumstances. His upbringing isn't outright brutal, but it is quietly cruel in a way that creeps up on you and you only realize the kind of terrible things going on in retrospect. Thus Truffaut creates a very real and very human tale that doesn't dote on the easily accessible aspects of a story like this.I've always felt a bit of forced tension in Truffaut films. I've never been able to fully believe a film of his and I only see the character interaction as ways to get the psychological study points across. The 400 Blows is different, however. I really felt something during this film. It is a film that will keep the gears in your head turning as you absorb its deep complexities and its clever nuances that drive home points that aren't right in front of your face, but they are there subtly. Truffaut constructs the storytelling in this film brilliantly and our exposure to the study of a child's psyche is delivered with tasteful moderation. Nothing feels forced yet everything has meaning. It is something so skillfully construed and is something that a lot of films today fail to do. They drive their meaning too forcefully and it becomes too overbearing, while Truffaut quietly slips you the hidden meaning under the table rather than spoon feeding you.The tone of The 400 Blows is strikingly different for a film as old as this. It is very sincere and quite dark. The film has an atmosphere of touching sincerity that won't immediately make your heart cry out in anguish for the characters, but when you think about it and you absorb the events of the film you realize how heart wrenchingly sad they really are. Plus, Truffaut's quietly haunting camera work makes the film all the more calmly depressing. It is a somber film that doesn't throw anything at you, but you know that there is a deep sadness growing within the film that comes to fruition after the movie is actually over. It's a strange sensation, but very noticeable if you take in the film correctly.I feel like The 400 Blows is a film that gets better with age. I'm not doing cartwheels about it right now, but I can see how its intelligence will grow on me until I see this film as a masterpiece. I can only assume these things and only time will tell. But I still have enough insight to call The 400 Blows an fantastic film.",

Sorry boy, it is not your entire fault: your school mates also want to run away from those 'chaotic' kind of teachers and miserable classroom. You are not the only one willing to do it, although your brightness looks like missing from your head-box and it is probably in your 'bollocks'. The educated ones once said: \"the apple does not fall far from the tree\", so Antoine darling, do not expect too much from this life, because it was your mother who drew your path since she gave you birth. What is more, did not you see her kissing that disgusting guy whilst crossing the pedestrian crossing? She does not give you money, she is not even interested in what you are studying at school... What kind of mother is that!? Yes, but do not forget to throw the garbage away...Ah, right, I understand. Only when you missed things up she comes to you and says \"if you do this, I will give you that\". Oh, come on! But even so, after all your 'minor effort' in Honor\u00e9 de Balzac to get better marks, here comes the other nuts scatterbrained tutor and throws away all your effort. Even I would not make any effort to study in that case.However, remember that you have a treasure, which name is 'Ren\u00e9'. Such a lovely friend, always helping and giving the most accurate advice. What a bad luck at the end, though, when he could not visit his friend Antoine, after a long journey with the bicycle. But, at any rate, Antoine is a good kid. When he has to take away the garbage he does it. When he has to study, he also does it. Even when his tutor tells him off and orders him to clean or do anything, he is listening! Let us not forget that after stealing the typewriter, it was him who decided to go back and leave it from where he took it, and it was not his Chicken-Ren\u00e9-friend. I truly believe that Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut wanted to show us the 'lack of child guidance' combined with the unhappy home life, Antoine's mistakes and his behavior towards the consequences. This movie reminded me of both Billy Elliot and Forrest Gump, given the fact that all characters are running towards desperate destinations, in a crucial time of their lives. I enjoyed the movie and the French expressions, but I disagree that this movie is better than Ben-Hur (1959) or Strangers on a Train (1951).",

It's not very shocking or surprising now but it must have hit hard in 1959. Even though I saw everything coming I kept watching. The black and white cinematography is stunning, Francois Truffaut direction assured and Leaud (who was actually only 15 at the time) gives a great performance. Despite the story the film never becomes maudlin, preachy or sad. It's made pretty clear that Antoine will survive despite the way the adults treat him. Also it perfectly captures the innocence of youth and the way they act. Supposedly this was the start of New Wave cinema. Well-done and worth catching. It DOES bog down a little during the last 30 minutes but everything before it is great. I give it a 7.",

This was a truly well made movie that I think is Truffaut's best and most personal because this film was inspired by his early life of which I am pretty sure that as a teenager Truffaut might have done the same things that the Leaud character did but I don't know yet, and this movie I and critics alike think that this movie is one of the best movies of 1959, as well as one of the best movies ever made.",

            "content": "The 400 Blows is a patient adolescent character study which is unassuming, but has lots of depth to consider. Every scene in the movie showcases Antoine's fundamental struggle: he has good intentions and is creative and intelligent, but is impulsive and bold and is painted as a troublemaker everywhere. More than anything, he wants to be free. The cinematography does a great job of highlighting the contrast between the constricting home life with the limitless open Paris streets. When he has freedom to choose what to do, he is happy, but his choices are constantly hampered by authority figures. He feels unloved and caged in by the expectations of his parents, and he is tired of disappointing them despite doing his best to be good, so he decides to live on the streets. His school teacher is a similar authority figure who only sees the bad in Antoine, and who Antoine ends up avoiding. Both his teacher and his dad complain of him not confiding in them, failing to understand that the things he loves are being away from the constriction of their authority. He cares a lot for his friend Rene, in large part because their friendship is out of choice rather than the obligation he feels to his parents. When Rene and his mom come to see him, he is overjoyed to see Rene, but devastated when he leaves and his mom enters. The final scene shows Antoine getting to see the ocean for the first time, and ends on a freeze frame of him with a contemplative look. What will he do? How can he live happily in the world? I interpreted the film as a critique on the way society limits people's potential and happiness. Antoine usually does what's expected of him (putting out the trash every night, for example) and when he doesn't he's either embarrassed (getting distracted from his homework and skipping school as a result) or atones for it (buying the flour for his mom). He is street smart and a quick thinker, and even when he steals a typewriter he puts himself at risk by choosing to return it. None of these attributes are noticed by anyone except the audience, and by the end Antoine's life seems destined to be one of mishaps and crime. The film's style is clearly one with a heavy emphasis on realism, as we see the trademarks of Italian neorealism popping up here - the long wide tracking shots as Antoine moves across streets, the footage shot in the city itself, and the patient slice of life tone of the film. I really loved this film because I found Antoine's plight so easy to understand and relate to - kids often have good intentions and just want to explore and see things, but needless limits and expectations are placed by authority figures (here, the education system and parents) which leave the child unsatisfied and wanting to be free that much more. This is a movie that makes me want to spend more time with it and dive deeper into it, because it has a lot to explore and consider.",

If you wanted to be honest, you should say that it's simply a complete mistranslation of the original French title. The film follows a schoolboy who smokes, steals, shams and skives his way through life, surrounded by apathetic adults entirely uninterested in either raising him right or treating him like an actual individual with wants and needs. Youth is often ignored and this film is keenly aware of that. It isn't overly dour, but it is a rather bleak portrayal of one kid's rocky childhood. Thankfully, there are moments of levity sprinkled throughout and the story's underlying sadness never becomes overbearing. It's more of a melancholy that clouds the overall affair, one which crafts - or at least bolsters - quite a few poignant moments. The piece is very well realised in that it does feel like a fly-on-the-wall look into its focal character's life. Its realistic aesthetic boosts the effectiveness of its down-to-earth narrative, as do its no-frills yet convincing performances. It isn't overly concerned with plot, but it doesn't feel aimless. In fact, it's almost a movie of two halves due to the way in which it unfolds. Regardless, it's always entertaining, whether traditionally or otherwise.

            "content": "I've not really ventured into French New Wave cinema before so this celebrated film by Francois Truffaut was something of a new experience for me. I found it to be a quirky and episodic yet curiously involving movie, one which gets progressively darker as we follow the progress of young tearaway Antoine Donel, played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud.He lives in Paris with his mother and as we later learn, stepfather in a less than salubrious flat. He's something of a latch-key kid, both his parents work and we see the gradual disintegration of his relationship with them which culminates in their abandoning him to the French penal system for a petty crime involving of all things a typewriter.It's quite shocking to see how France treats young delinquents, posing them for mug-shots, putting the boy in a holding cell with adult criminals and subjecting him to physical violence for the mildest indiscretion. I'm reminded of the similarly harsh treatment which was handed out here in the U. K. at the same time in what were called borstal schools, a practice thankfully long since abolished.Before we get to that point, we get to roam the poor streets of Paris with Antoine, sometimes accompanied by a like-minded truanting school chum. Shot in naturalistic fashion, these adventures at first seem light-hearted and almost carefree and we naturally sympathise with a young lad with a troubled home life who just doesn't fit in to the prevailing system of the day. Antoine doesn't bemoan his lot, indeed he resists the clear opportunity to improve his situation at home after he catches his mum having an affair in broad daylight where he could easily have held this over her to better his treatment.Yes it's a little shocking to see such a youngster smoking, drinking and stealing but we're also shown that he loves literature, Balzac in particular as well as the cinema to where we see him escape.Young L\u00e9aud is remarkable in the role of Antoine, reportedly a portrait of the director as a young man. The complete lack of sentimentality, use of actual location shots of Paris, long-takes sometimes involving improvisation and the frank subject matter depicted all combine to demonstrate a new and different approach to film-making echoed perhaps in the emerging social-realism of British cinema, with its so-called \"kitchen-sink\" dramas.It all culminates in that wonderful, defining freeze-frame final image, demonstrating Antoine's defiance of the world. Clearly we haven't seen the last of this boy and so it proved of course, with Truffaut following his character and indeed actor down the highways of his life in a number of subsequent films.",

            "content": "In 1959 a pair French films were released that became the twin pillars of the New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), and were instantly hailed as classics. One, Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (A Bout de Souffl\u00e9), was a bad film, and the other, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows (Les Quatre Cents Coups), was a good film. Neither, however, can really be called great cinema, despite their reputations. That said, Truffaut's film is far better than Godard's because it mostly avoids overt clich\u00e9s, even as its screenplay- its weakest element, written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussey, often bogs down in anomy. Like Godard, Truffaut shot his film in black and white, and indulged the real world, as well as doing long takes, to try to feign naturalism, even though these were often outcomes of necessity not choice, borne out of lack of financing rather than artistic vision.While both films achieved a feel closer to cinema verit\u00e9 with these technical contrivances, neither could really be thought of as narratively innovative, for Breathless is a string of unsubverted clich\u00e9s while The 400 Blows is a rather familiar tale of misspent youth. It is, in a sense, an updated and less colorful, if not watered down, Charles Dickens tale transplanted across the English Channel. Also, the film's hero- the lower class fourteen year old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), who sleeps in tattered pajamas- claimed to be Truffaut in this autobiographic film, is quite a bit less colorful than Dickens' young protagonist con men. Even though he is constantly in trouble, and called a thief, arsonist, liar, and plagiarist, these are clearly things almost all young boys do in their formative years, with few ever becoming major criminals. The 400 Blows is merely a good film with some great moments- like Antoine in the Gravitron or when his gym class starts thinning out as they jog with their teacher. Yet, its flaws highlight why most schools, movements, or -isms fail. They do so because they naturally must break free from the artificial constraints such ideas and ideals impose. Delimited art is generally bad art. And this film's formlessness, plus some corny moments as a single tear in Doinel's eye as he is taken away in a prison truck, doom the film from reaching a greatness it may have attained with a better screenplay and more experienced eye behind the camera and in the editing room. But, it is a worthwhile film, nonetheless, which held out the potential for later and greater works. That's more than many first films, New Wave or not, have ever done, and something Antoine Doinel may embody, if never achieve.",

It appeals to the kind of men who were or are selfish delinquents, or who wanted to be. It appeals to men who were misunderstood by the people around them, and who blame others for their misfortunes, even though they themselves were at least partially responsible. Truffant only made this film to wallow in his own preciousness, and it appeals to people who do the same, or to people who love being pretentious and don't care to have their own opinions about things.",

            "content": "Film journalist and critic Francois Truffaut became disenchanted with the films of the late 1950s. He held great admiration for Sir Alfred Hitchcock (whom at this time was shooting 'The Birds,') and Akira Kurosawa (working on 'Saga of the Vagabonds.') Both of these directors displayed technical innovation, enthusiasm and interest-captivating techniques in the production of their films. Truffaut believed in the ideals of the theatre scholar Bertolt Brecht who claimed that stages (and ultimately films) are not exclusively for the entertainment value. Audiences wanted to feel involved and learn from the experience - films had to be rational (at least to a degree) and hold some validity in the real world (this is not fully applicable to the recently created 'Children's films.') I agree that a boring film is not a 'bad film' for it can be educational purposes or to display interesting cinematic or technical achievements. Brecht would argue that \"when an audience enters an auditorium, they do not merely discard their brain in the Foyer.\" With this I certainly agree - films with little or no explanation, evoke limited thought and interest from the audience - whilst a film or stage performance which is over-explanatory renders the imagination obsolete.\nThe key is sustaining equilibrium - something that Truffaut manages beautifully. The cinematography and scenery were magnificent, the acting was apt for this warm film and yet the story is deliberately vague in various parts and punctuated with humour, which I for one certainly did not expect in a 1959 family film. There is no surprise that this writer became a director and an actor in a hope to alter the face of cinema for decades to come.",

It was interesting to see the Antoine character struggle to survive out in the large city all the while ditching school, being neglected by his parents, moving from home to home and acting as a rebel to the world. This generated the audience's sympathy and made them intrigued in finding out what Antoine's next move in each day of his life would be.Overall, it is a dramatic and beautiful film with a sad, melancholic music score and a deep, mind-numbing story in which you will find entertaining.Grade B+",

It paints such an accurate view of life; the pain, the awkwardness, the loneliness, and the love. The first time I saw it was on Bravo a few years back. The film felt so contemporary to me, that it shocked me to see it was made in 1959. Jean Pierre Leaud gives a devastating performance. Its strength lies in the fact that he's not playing a cute, lovable boy, but a true teenager. This might be the first time a director did not condescend to its child actors. (Truffaut, along with Spain's Victor Erice, remains one of the best child directors in the history of cinema). The cinematography is incredibly sophisticated, and yet approachable by anybody's standards. I have read that Truffaut regrets using the Jean Constantin score, but IMHO, it works to this day. It gives the film an emotional punch, particularly through the final frames. I know I will never grow tired of praising or watching this film. It is simply the best.",

            "content": "This is the story of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) in his school, in his home, in the streets of Paris. This is the story of a boy entering in a new world, for him, leaving his family behind. Every time Antoine is at a different place we see more of his personality and every time he is at a different place he is doing something that of course will bring consequences. In the school he does a bad thing to later be at home thinking in the things he needs to do in order to repair the things in his school to later be near the school thinking in how he could forget to do those things. The film begins with the typical problematic kid at school and soon we find that Antoine has his own preferences at home. Is clear that he has a better relation with his father (Albert R\u00e9my) but everything will change soon. The main problem is that everything is like a secret between family members. There is not that thing called trust, not from Antoine to his parents and neither from the parents to Antoine. On the other hand we have his best friend Ren\u00e9 (Patrick Auffay), together with him Antoine will began to have his life in the streets of Paris. For a day they leaved the school tools in order to have a fun day by going to the movies and some other places. During that \"fun day\" we will watch not the beginning of all the problems but sure the beginning of a new stage for the Doinel family. Sure Antoine was doing a bad thing so as his mother (Claire Maurier), both discovered the other, nobody said a word. Now everything changes and now at Antoine's home you even feel sorry for Antoine's father. That day the mother of Antoine died but just for Antoine. But also the mother is quite worried and now suddenly she is very kind with Antoine. Their case can be resume in once act: the mother needs to make an offer to Antoine, you know if he makes a good work at school she will give him money. Obviously that's a problem, a clear example of the problems of Antoine at school but also is a clear example of how the mother wants to resolve the things. Of course everything is a secret between Antoine and his mother so if the kid does a bad thing that will annoy his father the kid will have the protection of his mother since she knows everything is for the school. Eventually Antoine will make a work that is not what the teacher asked and also that will have some strong consequences so now the escape is the only thing in Antoine's mind and what's he eventually will do. In short, Antoine's mother became \"good\" with him so her secret can stay like that but the deep problems never changed. One of the many reasons I loved this film is that it is unpredictable. One day you see Antoine working for his school project and the other you see him living in a friend's house. By the end you know that maybe the entire story is somehow predictable since you see how was the relation between Antoine and his mother even before he was born so you see that this problem was somehow old and maybe some good things cover it a little but after all we always watched a broken family and in the end we just watch a kid running and running\u0085This is just my first Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film and I'm just realizing about the fact that there are more films about the character Antoine. Now I really want to check those films. On this one Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud did his screen debut at the age of 14. He did such a terrific and realistic work with a character that is just great and unique since in the film we watch him as the troubled kid, the film lover, the unwanted son, the loved son, the tramp, the friend, the prisoner, the runner. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud steals the film of course however everyone else did also a magnificent and realistic acting work. Many claims that Antoine is not a likable character but I'm not one of them, I mean I loved the character and probably my favourite parts of the film are when he is in the streets of Paris but that doesn't mean that there are some \"weak\" parts in it. I loved every shot of the film, in short.Finally, this film is very important so sooner or later, as the film lover I suppose you are, you will want to watch it. But in this case we have not only an important piece of cinema but also a marvelous piece of cinema. It is a unique film, a masterpiece, etc. Since I don't speak French sorry if my title is bad written, I wanted to write: A marvelous film of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.",

Not that living ordinary is a bad thing, it just means that everyone in life has this sense of sonder that may correlate with one another, it is real, it is beautiful, and boys (especially in their teens) do weird things when they're alone.Antoine Doinel is bright and curious but his environment is against him; teachers (Institution) who criticize him without consideration, parents (Family) who are distant like a generational gap, and authorities (Law) that has no care whatsoever to the youth for order. Having a friend like Rene is a blessing because you know they'll be friends for life and they share the same ideals. It is also fun to watch them roam the surroundings for adventure.Antoine isn't necessarily a sympathetic character, he's wild, stubborn, he used an excuse that his mother died for missing a day at school, stealing his grandmother's money just because. L\u00e9aud is amazing in this because you sympathize with him. The gazes to nowhere, mannerisms and the improvisations at his age at the time is genius. Raw talent and the realness of his portrayal should be a principle for authenticity in real life or actors who are willing to grasp it.The techniques that Francois Truffaut has done here is a pleasure to experience. The comical scenes with the kid getting ink all over his notebook and the dispersion of the students one by one. These takes are well earned and hilarious. The seamless and clean long takes of Antoine running is an awe and the freeze frames (the mugshot and end frame) is incredibly striking, you get the idea that those frames were directed at the audience.This movie is about freedom, in every sense of it. Antoine never seeing the sea in his life, finally reaching it, and it is a dead end - what's next for him?",

So realism or neo-this and neo-that, I don't care: this film is certainly well made however.The first thing that should be said is it's well paced: we're not given a moment of respite or any time to think about what's missing, it's just hard-hitting events and news, all sequenced in a very fluid and solidly crafted development. Dialog is good, all characters well written and, of course, realistic as this is the main goal of this production: to deliver a tale that rings true in its every breath but that provides poetry and strong deeper meaning to that daily struggle. The film isn't so much a metaphor or such as it is an ode to the roughness of the real world. It's completely ruthless, it's harsh, but not oppressive...just like life is.The kid playing the lead character, a then fifteen year old L\u00e9aud, handles his protagonist's part incredibly well. And it's telling in and of itself a child however talented would understand and take to the role so spontaneously well: his character is the child many of us have been, a symbiotic mixture of mischievousness and innocence that makes us incomprehensible and unbearable to the world around us.Very lyrical, symbolic ending - that may or may've not inspired a Stephen King as he was writing one of his most famous pieces (brought to the big screen in the mid 90's) ?..\nStrong film: 8/10.",

When his antics finally attract the attention of the police, they decide that maybe some time in juvenile detention might not do him any harm so off he goes - but he is not there for long! It's an episodic story that raises laughs and heckles in equal measure. You cannot help but like this tearaway. It's not so much that he wants attention (though he certainly does), it is that he is has initiative. He is bored; bored of his constantly rowing parents, of the teachers who don't really care about him. He is mischievous, he likes having fun - especially with his pal \"Ren\u00e9\" (Patrick Auffay) with whom he has a few escapades and even lives for a short time. Theft is a serious matter but somehow when he pinches a typewriter from his dad's office - one that doesn't work, by the way, it has to make you smile. The ending features one of these scenes from a film that you will never forget.

            "content": "This is the fist chapter of the saga of Antoine Doinel, performed in a masterly manner during a long period of his life (twenty years) by the surprising Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, followed step by step by the pygmalion Truffaut during the whole course of his full physical maturity, beginning from the actor's early years.The present movie deals with the topic of unquiet and misunderstood adolescence, clearly inspired by Edmund' character, the young boy who lives in the destructed Germany doing all kinds of work in Rossellini's \"Germania anno zero\". Antoine and Edmund are two young human beings at the mercy of the waves, without any help or control, living on the fringe of society, unable to cope with the hypocrisy of grown-up people that guess they are no good for anything. But differently from Rossellini's character, Antoine is endowed with more resolution than him. Furthermore, the will to succeed will help him a great deal in his life, especially to come unsmirched from the manifold difficulties of existence, because he's a stubborn boy who prefers the real thing to the phony stuff and doesn't want to give grown-up people the satisfaction of knowing that their choices have worked on him.With the same incomparable style you expect by an author that has made him beloved by many cinephiles far and wide, Truffaut describes the portrait of a restless young man yearning for freedom, in open rebellion with his familiar environment and with the whole adult world. Scenes from an unhappy existence, outlined in the script with sometimes disenchanted frankness, clearly following the inspiration of autobiographically conceived ideas, while the repeated use of long focal length lens during movie shooting conveys an anonymous sense of uneasiness.The rebellious character Antoine Doinel, unamenable to discipline, is included in a metropolitan context described in a very impersonal way, plunged in melancholy and echoing a meaningless platitude, according to a disenchanting, strictly objective conception of the reality. Truffaut doesn't \"ask\" us to identify with his subject, no wonder his psychological motivations point out to us in a disturbing way the complete downfall of individual certainties as far as the difficult route to adulthood is concerned. The purpose of this generational conflict created by him is to prove that boys aren't guiltier than adults; both of them in his opinion are victims of a society whose uneasy feelings spread over their lives with undesired consequences.",

So this is considered to be a classic, and a centerpiece for discussion in film school. In this regard, I must be ignorant. This is a classic movie, this is a good movie, but I guess I just don't understand what makes this such a big deal for film students. It is a great story about little Antoine doniel who drinks, smokes, steals, skips school, lies, and runs away repeatedly. There is no moral question directed at the viewer it is just his life, and it has been hard but not terrible, like many people's own experience, and so we are not there to judge. The character is revisited throughout truaffot's career in several films, he even uses the same actor Jean-Pierre Laud. Pretty impressive considering the films span 20 years and he started at age 13. I recently reviewed \"you can count on me\" in many ways this film reminded me of it, in the sense that nothing is over played but we get to understand what goes into shaping someones life. I am looking forward to seeing the further adventures of doniel, and letting you my one reader know my self important opinion. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "And the thing is, it's not only the parents who set the 12-years-old-or-so kid on his path to destruction (destruction that they've also condemned Antoine to and one that could have been avoided). It is the whole society. From the school teachers and the principal to one of his classmates and the police officers, everyone makes his situation even worse and proves to have an old-school lack of understanding towards his emotions, his needs, his person.One scene that pops first in my mind when I think back about the movie is the scene where the little boy writes a letter about the bitter episode of his grandpa's death. He has just recently read Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and found that a passage from the book perfectly resembles his feelings. Of course, he doesn't understand yet what a quote is or maybe he does but still uses Balzac's words as they express more than he could say. The teacher doesn't seem to understand that maybe he wasn't ill-intentioned and calls him a plagiarist on a nervous, authoritarian tone. Then, he sends Antoine to the principal, so he can be once again be punished (grounds for his father's decision to send him to juvenile hall, after he has previously run from home in fear of being punished). This is not the most frustrating scene to come, but I'm not going to reveal anything else.I don't know much about the French New Wave yet, but if ''The 400 Blows'' represents the beginning of the movement, it is a great achievement in cinema's history. It is moving, it is both heartful and hurting and has a certain childhood nostalgia feeling to it. This is the second movie from Francois Truffaut that I've watched (the first being Fahrenheit 451) and I can confirm this man hasn't disappoint me so far.A 9,9 out of 10 from me.",

            "content": "It becomes so easy to get caught up in extolling the virtues of any of the \"greatest films ever made\" to the point where the extollers begin to forget the essence and point of the film itself. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is as definitive an example as any. Consistently topping critics' lists and credited for effectively spearheading the movement known as the French New Wave (along with Godard's Breathless), the most important thing to remember about Truffaut's seminal work is that, far from being designed to be an awards-lapping masterpiece of art cinema, the film was spawned by autobiographical sentiments so anarchic and countercultural that they would sneer at the notion of any such pretension. And this is the true beauty of The 400 Blows \u2013 that it feels so wholeheartedly honest that there is no sense of trying to cater to any particular audiences at any point, naturally making it paradoxically all the more refreshing, delightful and compelling. 'Delightful' and 'distressing' are sentiments consistently courted by every fibre of Truffaut's film, as he refuses to pigeonhole himself within the confines of autobiography, morality tale or any sort of genre. Fusing the gritty aesthetic and stark, lived-in locations of neorealism with boldly cheeky and irreverent cinematic flourishes (cameras consistently slyly pacing about and brazenly cheerful musical interludes, as if winking at the audience whenever the mood threatens to become excessively dour), Truffaut proves just as adept at capturing the free-spirited joie-de-vivre of youth as articulating the socializing forces which can far too easily twist childhood into a downward spiral of acting out to being branded a societal criminal. Harshly criticizing Antoine's clueless parents and excessively disciplinarian school system without quite devolving them into cartoons bereft of authenticity, Truffaut equally resists exonerating Antoine himself of any responsibility for his actions, but fervently insists that we understand rather than judge Antoine, with the hope that such clearly delineated concerns could prove preventable in future real life contexts. Nonetheless, while a bitter undercurrent colours the film, there remains veritable magic throughout, particularly associated with the cinema and the sea, but such perfectly spaced out moments are enough to leave the viewer departing the film wiping tears of poignant happiness rather than social anxiety from their faces. If nothing else, the film merits its accolades for extracting arguably the best performance from a child actor in cinematic history from Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud as Antoine. Appearing to live rather than play his part, L\u00e9aud invests Antoine with a remarkably vibrant yet precariously subtle energy, his most inconsequential gestures belying volumes of character information and authenticity \u2013 the sheer joy he exudes when attending the cinema with his parents, and of course his infamous haunted stare in the film's enigmatic final freeze-frame demonstrate a masterful talent already in full force rather than merely developing. In support, Claire Morier delivers a mother figure who, despite being effectively loathsome, the viewer still yearns to love, as her moments of attempting to positively connect with her son offer incredible weight and nuance which eliminate the fear of her descending into a stereotype. Furthermore, Albert R\u00e9my equally toes the line between inciting love and hate as Antoine's father, constantly caught between sparkling dry humour and selfish, sporadic criticisms towards his son and wife alike. Finally, Guy Decomble's militant teacher may come across as a terrifying overstatement, but probably one that eerily speaks to a child's sense of how such a figure would come across, and Decomble, pitching his performance between credible and filtered through a child's perception, is uncomfortably effective. Flawless technical work and exhaustingly poignant emotional resonance aside, Truffaut's The 400 Blows remains at heart a scrappy, defiantly jubilant ode to childhood, and thus proves more memorable as such than as incendiary social commentary. Either way, it is abundantly clear that a film that defies pretension and inaccessibility so vehemently yet is still such an abiding classic deserves to be seen by one and all. New and old viewers will be wishing by the end that they could go on running alongside Antoine, whisked away in his cheeky, heartsick countercultural defiance, for eternity. -10/10",

            "content": "Les 400 coups did not strike me as a work of staggering genius.  Perhaps it is the naturalistic approach of the film, the type of approach that does not beg to be called \"genius\" but \"realistic\", that inspires many to call it a masterpiece.  The problem with calling it that is it makes you want to analyze and take apart the film, but it does not reward those who do, if what they're looking for are complex themes or keys to deeper meanings.  By creating the world of young Antoine, the hero of Truffaut's film, in a very lifelike way, the film bypasses dense symbolism and other such artistic ploys for a truly realistic feel.  Example: Antoine's family.  In a film wanting to make clearer statements about humanity, there would be more consistency shown in the characterization of the mom and dad.  As is, they can be rough, they can be loving, they can be dysfunctional, they can make a loving family - they are complex like normal people, forcing us to sometimes reconsider how we feel about them.This film interested me in the way it showed us the troubles a young boy can go through, but is that what it is about?  Antoine's problems can be traced not only to the school system and his parents but also himself.  I don't think this is a bad thing, it just means the movie is not about how a criminal develops, it's about life and people and how they can develop in general.  It's a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life film skillfully created and filled with very interesting moments (the classroom, life as a runaway from home).  It has nice cinematography, good acting, a good score, and it is certainly a worthy debut for its director.  However, it is does not blow you away, so do not come with preconceived notions of what it must be like considering its fame.  Let its interesting moments impress you and enjoy it for what it is.One final note: the very interesting ending provides a great topic for discussion after the film is over.",

            "content": "'The 400 Blows' (original title: 'Les Quatre Cents Coups') is a nice film directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. This is one of the defining movies of the French New Wave, which was influenced by the Italian neorealism.The title 'The 400 Blows' might cause some confusion, leading one to believe that it is about corporal punishment or crime. But it's not. While the English language title is a straight translation of the french language title, the meaning is another ball game. The french language title is part of the expression \"faire les quatre cents coups\" - which means \"to raise hell\".This french motion-picture is especially significant for its director, as it reflects events of his own life and even his friends's lives. So, it's a semi-autobiographical film (Truffaut saw on the character Antoine Doinel a lot of himself). Besides, the film lets us know the unfair way how juvenile offenders in France were treated back then.The story is about Antoine Doinel, a common teenager in Paris, who is seen by his parents and teachers as annoying and as a rebel. We do feel for him and I'm pretty sure that many of us can (or could once) relate to him at the same age.It's a film which simplicity is all about, with a simple plot and no major surprises. But it's beautifully filmed and done, real, human, sensitive, dramatic and, to a degree, poetic. It is also very convincing in portraying the adolescents's conflicts and crisis of existence. It also demonstrates how times were so different and how people had much more liberty at the time. Completely different of nowadays's pressures which we are so prisoners of.Another beauty of the film is on the settings. Through the adventures of the two kids, it takes us ourselves to the streets of Paris (even if only by screen), without forgetting to mention that the first minutes are an excellent opening, showing images of the heart of the city (as if we were traveling by train, car, motorcycle or even bike), near the Eiffel Tower and even right next to it. On this, I'd like to make a comparison: it shows a lot more of Paris than 'Before Sunset'. What a difference, there isn't even comparison! I know they are completely different films, but they both take place in the same city. I always thought that 'Before Sunset' shows very little of Paris. They were \"lazy\" on that one. But not with this one.The final part of the film is also especially beautiful, showing Antoine running away to the ocean (which he always wanted to experience), reaching the sea's shoreline, running into it, then turning back to the land. It's as if he is hesitant and at the same time determined to go as far as he can. Then the camera zooms in and \"freezes\" his face looking straight to the camera like he is breaking the 4th wall.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud is great as Antoine Doinel, as well as Patrick Auffay as Ren\u00e9 Bigey (Antoine's best friend). The kids have the best performances.",

Inspired by Truffaut's own early life, it shows a resourceful boy growing up in Paris and apparently dashing headlong into a life of crime. Adults see him as a troublemaker. We are allowed to share some of his private moments, as when he lights a candle before a little shrine to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking directly into the camera. He has just run away from a house of detention, and is on the beach, caught between land and water, between past and future. It is the first time he has seen the sea.\"The 400 Blows,\" with all its simplicity and feeling, is in a class by itself. It was Truffaut's first feature, and one of the founding films of the French New Wave. We sense that it was drawn directly out of Truffaut's heart. Little is done in the film for pure effect. Everything adds to the impact of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with his mother and stepfather in a crowded walk-up where they always seem to be squeezing out of each other's way. At school, Antoine has been typecast by his teacher (Guy Decombie) as a troublemaker. As the movie rolls on more and more, it leads to more trouble and eventually to a downward spiral: He and a friend steal a typewriter, he gets caught trying to return it and is sent to the juvenile detention home.There is a lot of movie-going in \"The 400 Blows,\" with Antoine's solemn face turned up to the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself escaped to the movies whenever he could, and there is a shot here that he quotes later in his career.

I know it's nowhere near as obscure as 1900 or The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, but it is much older than either of those, which could quite easily have been a recipe for disaster.Thankfully, it wasn't, which is great because I really didn't feel any great loss at not being able to cover either of those two aforementioned films; I mean, I'd never even heard of either of them, but The 400 Blows? Come on, I was a film student until very recently. I've probably seen that final shot more times and been forced to put more thought into it than my own reflection.And I'm happy to say that although it could have easily borne the burden of me getting sick of it, I didn't. I certainly think it's a little overrated for reasons I'll get into in a bit, but all in all I do believe that it deserves its place in this collection.I feel like in some ways this may have been a progenitor of the \"nothing film\" I've railed on in the past, where writers (for some reason unfathomable to me) think it's genius to write a film with no real plot for the sake of realism. And to be fair, that may have had some merit once. As in, literally one time. The first time someone did it. I don't know when that was, but regardless, I don't see the point in doing it more than once.I don't think it would be quite accurate to label this a \"nothing film\", but it definitely has some of the same DNA, such as scenes that don't really add anything to the plot and instead focus on the tone and setting, an ending that feels less like a conclusion of the narrative and more like it's just been cut off, and focusing on working-class characters.The reason I like this film is because it feels as though it has much more of a purpose behind these things, namely to give the sense of showing a chapter in Doinel's life (I suppose that there being a few sequels to this does retroactively help with this feeling though), and the ending feels more like a cliffhanger than an arbitrary point where they ran out the budget.Plus, this film didn't just straight up forget to have a plot, and what do you know? That makes it much easier to make your viewer give a single toss about the character they're watching! Who'd have thought?And on that note, I find Doinel to be a pretty compelling character, even if a lot of his motivation/backstory is only revealed right at the end, which does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity. And if there's one thing I'd say this film does near flawlessly, it's how it depicts childhood, specifically that feeling during childhood where you're convinced that all the adults are out to get you. Plus the performances are all incredible, including all the kids.I do think that some of the dialogue sounds like an adult's words coming out of a child's mouth, and it would have been nice if the whole subplot of Doinel's mother cheating actually went anywhere...and I guess you could argue that some scenes are a little pointless, but putting that aside, this is an absolutely gorgeous look at someone's childhood.It's also really well directed and shot, proving that Truffaut knew what he was talking about when he coined the auteur theory, and has a very unique soundtrack, which I don't usually see people bring up in relation to this.So you know what, this is the second film from the 50's in a row that I do get the hype for. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised when most of the big budget, studio produced films I'd seen from that time weren't all that great. Maybe not much has changed after all.",

City of God, although far more violent and horrific, comes to mind, as it is also shot in a near-documentary style, with young children and few professional actors. These films seem unremittingly honest, showing life the way it is, or the way it can be for some unlucky people. Ordinary film plots, with beginnings, middles and either happy or sad endings, are not realistic. They are attempts to make sense of life, but life isn't like that. In fact, like somebody said, life is just one damn thing after another; and so it is in this memorable movie. A child can only have a series of experiences, and doesn't know enough to make considered judgements or take balanced decisions. This movie takes the child's point of view.",

An adolescent with a troubled background is bent on fun and mischief. Such loose and barely controlled upbringing unravels leading to crime. Shot in black and white, the film moves at a brisk pace barely letting up where action is the name without sacrificing the Euro atmosphere and look. Good directing and acting make the film standout highlighting Truffaut's eminence as one of the foremost directors in film. Despite these the film loses some steam towards the middle where one too many unnecessary scenes dull its edge. A compelling film on childhood, friendship and man's experiences and place in society, this is one flick that can leave quite a mark.

His mother is either a prostitute or very promiscuous, his father is ineffectual of disciplining his son, or even mentioning his wife's betrayal.The film, shot is black and white, and situated in Paris, presents the frenetic escape of a youth - alienated at once by his bizarre parents, and his malignant teacher who displays only revulsion at the child's expressions.Accused of plagiarism la gar de 400 coups escapes to a wealthy friends house, where we encounter yet another disinterested parent, preoccupied with his career.La gar de 400 coups is eventually sent to a school for delinquents, where the isolation of his situation trembles from the screen. A lost child, in a world of promiscuous mom's, deadbeat dads, and uncaring adults. What form of solace can be found among those often \"blows\"? The plot is not structured into acts, indeed, it progresses like weight accumulating on an overladen beast of burden. We wait for the collapse. We also cannot totally sympathize for the gar de 400 coups - he is shown to be a thief - repented only for the lack of a sale - we see him read Balzac, and dream big.No, he is not a humanist, spawning wisdom from some future novel - but one of us, caught in the trenches of this terminable battle against the forces that oppress us - be it our mundane jobs or our unfaithful wives. The child, and THIS IS THE TRAGEDY - has glimpsed this bleakness, and his only consolation is two feet in the sea.He has traveled the earth, and found nothing but vacancy - moral, existential - it's up to you.

            "content": "A 13-year-old Parisian boy, Antoine Doinel, neglected by his derelict parents, spends his days skipping school and sneaking into lots of movies. His life is on somewhat of a downward spiral as teen angst catches up with him and he begins to be seen as only a trouble maker by the adults in his life. Antoine runs away from home, is a failed thief and suffers through believing he is in the right as he continues to do wrong. Living in between arcades, abandoned factories and Paris flats he sees the city as opportunity and hope, but his vision is still only that of a child.The films most analyzed shots involve Antoine after he has run away from the detention home and ends up on the beach. Truffaut ends the film on a freeze frame with Antoine looking into the camera. He has finally made it to the sea for the first time in his young life and he is seemingly caught between past and future.This will not be the only time Leaud will play Antoine as he and Truffaut will have a long collaboration. Leaud will play the on screen youthful biographical Truffaut through four more films. The most notable is Stolen Kisses. However, none of the films come close to this first feature of Truffaut. This film was his release and breakthrough of the French New Wave.The film is simple movie making, while at the same time showing layers of feeling and longing for something more. Jean-Pierre Leaud is stunning in his role and his innocence breathes right on the screen. The film, at times, almost takes on a feeling of documentary because of the vividly personal scenes. The story is told with deliberate measure.At the beginning Antoine is living with his mother and stepfather in a elbow-room-only flat. They are literally stepping over one another. The mother (Claire Maurier) is attractive beyond her means while the stepfather (Albert Remy) is doing is best in a bad situation. Both struggle in their own way to keep everything together but nothing keeps Antoine's trouble from their doorstep and their over the top reactions.Once Antoine has hit the streets adult hope is lost and he is at the mercy of social services. While on the streets Antoine hovers around trouble and close to disaster. He goes to the movies a lot which is clearly a force that he uses to stave off the tragedies that come his way. There are times when he is genuinely happy but the cold chill is always there threatening to break through his jacket with turned up collar - his shield against the bad over his shoulder. This film is Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's savior from himself. His ability to bring his wild child story to the screen with such feeling and honesty has made him a directing legend and started the New Wave from classic to modern French cinema. Like Antoine, Truffaut was saved by movies and once this first and legendary film was made by the time he was 27 years old, he would never have to look back on that bad kid except through a lens.",

Basically, a young boy tries to live a wild and out-of-control life due to his poor conditions at home and school. One of my biggest dislikes of the new wave is the minimalist way they try to portray story, plot, and emotion. While this movie still doesn't have the highest-concept as far as plot goes, the slice-of-life they choose to take here is an interesting one. The boy in the movie turns to increasingly worse crimes. The whole time he does, the fantastic acting by the kid playing the character has me rooting for him. Even though some of the things he's doing are cruel or wrong, I find myself hoping he'll escape his horrible home life or school life, or find some way to rise above it. The camera work was pretty well done in some shots too, considering the budget. The long shot of the boy running down the road was nice - a really smooth, one-take scene. I also liked the unscripted interview dialogue between the psychologist and the boy. The ending fell a little flat, but overall this is a fine movie, and one I wished I'd watched first for the new wave.",

A poetic but also very sad tale of a young boy and his troubled life. It is a classic movie! However, I don't think it is Truffaut's best film as I am aware of many do believe. Truffaut (1932-1984) was perhaps THE director in the entire history of motion pictures that was able of, truly and profoundly, conveying love as an idea or an emotion on the silver screen. I know that he was not the only one who achieved making great love stories, but perhaps only he knew how to do it the best way. And that brings me to my reason for not regarding this as his best film: I think it lacks that kind of true emotion and sentiment that shines so bright in his later films.

Tragic as the story is, it still keeps this charming, luminous allure, like a breath of fresh air in the shape of a movie. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's performance is nothing short of fantastic. Yet it's exactly on his casting for the part that I would like to comment. On the one hand, the choice is perfect - he IS Antoine Doinel, he lives and breathes this part as if it were his own life. On the other hand, the lead was obviously supposed to be a charismatic actor with a charming personality, able to make the audience feel for him. And that he does incredibly well.. but in fact, Antoine-Jean-Pierre is even TOO good. He is supposed to portray a troubled boy falling deeper and deeper down the social scale, and that in reality is a way darker, uglier sight than the one we see. L\u00e9aud conveys a strange sense of well-being and invincibility even in the hardest moments of Antoine's life, which renders the movie even more \"watchable\", but at the expense of psychological accuracy. I also find it hard to believe as a spectator that someone as heartrendingly adorable as this child could suffer such amounts of neglect and abuse from the grown-ups who surround him. The scenes with his family who couldn't care less about him come across as slightly unconvincing at moments. It's hard to imagine a mother so cold or a father so ruthless in the face of the exceptionally charming little human being that is L\u00e9aud-Doinel. Yet it's probably this uncanny supernaturally natural charisma that gives us a sense of hope at the end of the movie and a feeling that in spite of everything that has happened at the end of the day he'll do well.I gave it 9 out of 10, and am still in doubts, 'cos it could have been a perfect ten. Still, as great a movie as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to everybody. In a few words - pure cinema at its best.",

There are only three filmmakers who do not make films to either make money, garner artistic achievements, or even out of some truly pure and long harbored dream. There are only three men who made films because they were born to, because this world gave them no other choice. People who were meant to stand behind the camera, to tell a story, and to live 24 frames per second. Prodigies, immortalized by celluloid, there stand but three born geniuses of film. Stanley Kubrick is one of them, Orson Welles is another. And so is Francois Truffaut. Truffaut in particular strikes an interest with me personally, if for no other reason than he too was a film buff, and like me fanatical when it came to the ones he loved, and often times tyrannical when it came to the ones he detested. Before Tarantino was hailed as the film buff triumphant, before Martin Scorsese's obsessive lists came to light, there was Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, there was Francois Truffaut. Now I have neither the time nor the patience to scribe the depths of his fanaticism, but believe me, I'm fanatical, you may too think yourself something of a radical cinephile, but when it comes to Truffaut's love for the cinema and obsession with the screen, we all seem like Michael Bay fans. He was the critic triumphant, but damn was he a brilliant writer. You can tell by reading his early writings, particularly his Portrait of Humphrey Bogart or an essay titled God Bless John Ford, to pages upon obsessive pages articulating the lengths of Orson Welles and the brilliance inside of him, or his assessment of Jules Dassin's 1955 crime masterpiece 'Rififi', he talked about films in a way I'd never heard. Films touched him, deeply. They moved him, and captured his soul, and he was thankful each time the lights dimmed and the film started, he was thankful for the baptism that moving pictures gave him. His film debut was to be titled Les Quatre Cent Coups, or The 400 Blows. The 400 Blows in an intimate, private, autobiographical, and improvisational account of misunderstood youth, and the adolescent innocence of petty crime. The film features child actor Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, in a performance of a caliber so immense, no child actor has been able to scale it's weathered boundaries. It is a pure tale, both heartbreaking and undeniably heartwarming, it is a film that not only looks beautiful, but is beautiful. It is one of the best stories ever told, one of the most personal accounts ever reproduced from one's own life for the silver screen, and it marks Francois Truffaut's salutation to the wonderful world of the cinema. The screens were his conquer, and he knew had to do it. To scale the highest peaks. He was born to. The world gave him no other choice.",

            "content": "Has there ever been a better first film? Film enthusiast, critic for the influential French periodical Caheirs du Cinema (\"Notebooks on Cinema\"), and author of the auteur theory, Truffaut had already left a permanent impact on the cinema before he ever stepped behind the camera. As a critic, Truffaut passionately railed against what he considered the staid state of French cinema. Rather than critique from a safe distance, Truffaut entered the fray and changed cinema through iconoclastic example. He would become one of the leaders of the French New Wave\" (\"Nouvelle Vauge\") which rejected traditional cinematic technique and subject matter.After seeing Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil,\" Truffaut was inspired to channel his love of film into a directing career. His first film is a cinematic treasure and is an indisputable part of the canon. Want to begin your own cinema appreciation journey? Start here.Like many a first time novelist, Truffaut looked to his own past to create an autobiographical tale. The film's subject Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) would reappear in four Truffaut films each time played by the same actor. Antoine's story is very similar to the director's own life. A fatherless child, Truffaut was passed around from family member to family member then eventually reclaimed by his birth mother and stepfather. His guardians would tire of him, irritated by his delinquency, and hand him over to state custody and incarceration until he reached adulthood. Doinel, like Truffaut, would also spend a brief and and troubled stint in the French army.\"The 400 Blows\" opens with an uninterrupted tracking shot that travels down a Paris street and escorts us into Antoine's world. It's an elliptical moment that will later be repeated in reverse when Antoine is taken away from home to become a ward of the state. It also prepares us for the film's continual restless movement. Doinel is always on the run away from home and school and onto the streets of Paris. This tracking shot is accompanied by a jaunty theme that increasingly becomes more sad and wistful. In these simple opening moments we are given clues to the arc of the entire film.Like the film's musical theme, the first moments of \"The 400 Blows\" are playful. They resemble an \"Our Gang\" comedy as a classroom of pre-teens engage in mischief and are confounded by ruthless teachers and malfunctioning ink pens. Antoine, in a classroom full of goofballs, is repeatedly singled out by his teacher for correction and punishment. This continues at home where his mother and father are constant critics of Antoine and rarely offer positive reinforcement. Doinel, unhappy at home and at school, chooses truancy and constantly attempts to run away from his troubles. Antoine's early experiences, forced marching by gym teachers, running from authority figures, being confined by exasperated by adults, are later repeated in the more sinister setting of juvenile detention. In the film's haunting final moments, we glimpse toddler wards of the state placed in outdoor cages during recess at the juvenile detention facility. This, disturbingly, mirrors an earlier scene of adult prostitutes staring out from a holding cell as they await sentencing. \"The child is the father of the man.\" Antoine's mishaps are amusing at first, but as he is buffeted by adults at every turn, we begin to feel sympathy for the boy followed by pity and finally hopelessness. Doinel is an unwanted child. No wonder he runs. He is always a problem, never a blessing. There is, however, a brief respite for Antoine when he goes to the cinema with his parents. For Antoine, as for Truffaut, the movies offer a magical escape and a momentary chance for happiness.\"The 400 Blows\" is a warning for parents and caregivers. It shows how neglect and constant negative reinforcement necessarily leads to a troubled adulthood. We are impacted by the tale, but not lectured. The film's final moments are haunting and leave Antoine stranded and alone. As he once again runs away from confinement, Truffaut keeps Doinel trapped in the frame. Antoine is moving but he is always in the center of the screen. He is running away, but still confined. And as the film reaches its conclusion, the film freezes on Antoine's face, trapped with nowhere to go. It's a disturbing moment and creates a feeling of hopelessness in the viewer.If you haven't seen \"The 400 Blows\" do so as soon as possible. A masterpiece deserving of the superlative.",

The best part of the film is Truffaut's camera work which is nothing but superb.

He turns to a life of petty crime and running away to escape his problems only to find he is too young for the streets of Paris.

Antoine lives in a one-bedroom apartment in 1959 Paris with his mother and step-father. Neither appears to care much for or about Antoine, and he's a trouble-maker at school. He skips school for awhile, and ends up in a jail for a petty theft. After wondering what they were going to do with him during the summer recess, his mother and step-father have an inspiration -- let the police keep him in custody.The movie is full of subtle and not-so-subtle clues about Antoine: his step-father gave his mother money to by sheets for his cot, but they were not purchased; Antoine's pajamas are torn; he reacts angrily to his peers and his teacher, shouting threats and calling them names. L\u00e9aud is marvelous as the miscreant, showing the hurt Antoine feels on a face that hides his emotions. \"The 400 Blows\" is the best character study I've seen, and it has the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.

It has to be one of the best overall acting performances that I've seen from a cast and one of the best individual performances I've seen in Antoine Doinel. It made me feel like I was watching a documentary of real people at times. The story is not uncommon now, 60 years later, but it is still easy enough to follow and complex enough to keep its viewers engaged. The camera work was also great, particularly in the final 10 minutes or so. The only problem that I feel the film has is that it feels older than it is. I don't think it stands the test of time that same way some other films from around then do. For example, the films of Fellini, Bergman and Hitchcock that came out around this time hold up better, in my opinion.",

The 400 Blows against the classical Hollywood film clich\u00e9s (in a good way), and it's episodic and somewhat documentary-like cinematic techniques help to create the authentic story of a 14-year-old boy. The protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is viewed as a trouble-making teenager among the adults. Actually, Antoine lives an unhappy life dealing with his verbally abusive mother who is having an affair with a man from work, and his kind and friendly yet not deeply attachable stepfather whom he initially considered as his biological father. His departed grandfather is the only inspiration in his life. His luck is not good. At his school, Antoine has to deal with an uninspired teacher who always doubt his talent and pictures him as nothing but as a \"troublemaker\". To make a matter worst, he skips school, and lies to his parents and teacher. Receiving unprofessional reputation from his school teacher, and all the negligence from his parents force him to get the statuses of a liar, a dropout, and a theft which eventually lead him to the juvenile detention home. Delinquency is the key theme in this film. Antoine believes in freedom, and he is constantly planning to escape from being locked up. Using real locations in Paris, and having unprofessional actors with some improvised dialogues define the cinematic reality in this film. It is realistic, yet it has a moving story in which Truffaut skillfully plays around with the camera to add colors to this black and white film; extremely long shots in Antoine's' running scenes, a high aerial shot of the boy jogging scene, and a series of close-ups and deep focus shots will draw the audiences in the middle of actions as well as into the main characters' mind.",

This movie is superb on all levels: acting, direction, cinematography, script and the music! Watching Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's character \"Antoine\" develop on the screen totally captivates me. Antoine is a rascal and creates his own problems, but he is a product of his environment: he is rejected by his mother and his stepfather. In their eves, he cannot do anything right. He sees them as rank hypocrites. He has no role models to follow. His teachers are crass and demeaning to their students. As the result of these influences, Antoine is forced to carry a burden that is too much for an adolescent to bear!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes B&W movies that showcase the aforementioned qualities. This movie shows the \"other side\" of Paris that movies like \"An American In Paris' ignore. \"The Four Hundred Blows\" is a great example of realistic, gritty cinema that packs a gut-wrenching wallop! There are no glittering sets, well-dressed ladies or men, or high-flying songs in this movie. I have worked with children like Antoine, trying to keep them in school. \"The 400 Blows\" is a great movie because it causes the viewer to care about Doniel and his fate.***** out of *****",

Miller's research (at about the time this film was made) revealed that raising children to be \"farm animals\" had been a cultural norm in Northern Europe for centuries.Truffaut and Moussy knew it wasn't occasional or just \"here and there,\" and that it was a pandemic in the working class of their time. \"You've been so hard on him,\" his phlegmatic (and codependent) father says to his mother. \"He's always a problem,\" says the self-involved, sexpot madre.To them both, however, he's little more than an inconvenience in their lives.

            "content": "In 1959, the world was introduced to a man who would become considered one of the pioneers in the art of filmmaking both in production and in theory, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Truffaut made his debut with The 400 Blows, which is widely seen as his best film and one of the greatest directorial debuts of all time. The film tells the story of Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who is an adolescent boy growing up in Paris. Antoine is an incredibly misunderstood boy who is continuously believed to be a trouble maker, and eventually ends up committing petty theft crimes due to neglect and resentment. The film's story draws from many of Truffaut's own experiences as an adolescent in Paris. Antoine's sadness, desire, and ambition are all reflective of the early life of Truffaut.Right from the beginning, we get the feeling that this is a very personal film from Truffaut and is drawn directly from the heart. In the opening credits there is a dedication to Andr\u00e9 Bazin, a famous French critic who served as a father figure to Truffaut and attributed to a lot of his beliefs. Given knowledge of Truffaut as a person can advance ones knowledge in understanding the personal significance for him. One in particular that is very interesting is when Truffaut claimed that cinema had saved his life, and that this was something he has shown in all of his films. The parallel in The 400 Blows is a scene in the middle of the film when Antoine and his parents go to the movies. It is one of the few moments in the entire film where there is no conflict, neglect, or resentment between the family and shows the cinema as a sort of escape for Antoine. Anyone who has ever felt a sense of neglect in their home can probably relate to this, not necessarily because of the cinema aspect, but simply in principle. One detail in the film that is interesting is the comparison of the two different views of Antoine; the vision of him as a troublemaker from his parents and teachers, and the sympathetic feeling that audience has for him as we see him more as a misunderstood boy. Antoine always seems to be caught at the wrong moment. Whenever the boys are doing something in class that is troublesome, Antoine is the only one who seems to be caught. In one scene where he is writing a French essay in class. Antoine is a fan of French novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and makes an homage to his work in the essay, but the teacher sees it as plagiarism rather than homage. The film's title actually refers to the negative view others have of him as the French translation of the title means \"to raise hell\". He is a boy of curious and independent thought and filled with sadness and neglect that happens to always be seen in a negative way.Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud gives an excellent performance as Antoine that will leave you quite surprised with the then fourteen year old actor. L\u00e9aud's performance is so honest and sincere that it is what makes the character of Antoine feel even more real to the viewer. The scene towards the end when Antoine is speaking to the psychologist is perhaps the most honest in the film, and the feeling of sincerity in it is some of the most powerful I have seen. Throughout the film, Antoine ends up giving into a life of petty crime and even briefly goes to a facility that resembles juvenile hall. He steals a typewriter, lies to his teacher at one point, and is even seen smoking in one scene, but it's L\u00e9aud's innocent filled performance that shows the audience that Antoine is not just this troublemaker that he seems to be, but was rather forced into that direction. Without this part of the portrayal, the audience may simply think that he is as bad as everyone believes.The 400 Blows is a masterful work of the art in cinema and is best representative of nearly everything Truffaut tried to capture by making films. The heart, passion, and principle are so strong in this film and they are used in such a way that only a truly talented filmmaker could do. The film is also a shining example of the Auteur theory that was proposed by the film's dedicated person, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, as well as his contemporaries which included Truffaut. The theory tells us that it is the director who is the true author of the film. Not the studio, not the screenwriter, not the actors, etc, it is the director who gives it it's human story and power. Truffaut shows us the wonderful significance of the personal story in cinema.",

This movie is then turned into a sequel by Truffaut himself, and emphasised the beginning of the nouvelle vague, which is believed to have truly began one year earlier, by Claude Chabrol. Being the first movie directed by Truffaut, and if enframed in its time, it's quite impressive how it turned out so forward and full of character. 7/10",

Even if the French school and justice systems are not anymore what they were at the time of \"Les 400 coups\", questioning is aroused. Plus though sometimes a bit long, it's often funny.

Jean Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a troubled and misunderstood adolescent who has problems at school, lacks attention at home and gradually spirals into a life of petty crime. I was confused by the title until I learned that it is a straight translation of the French but misses its meaning; the French title refers to the expression \"faire les quatre cents coups\", meaning \"to raise hell\". The striking contrast between the (rare) happy times Antoine experiences with his parents - (his happiness being almost painful to watch in light of its rarity), and the ugly scenes where he is berated, neglected, or physically punished are crafted perfectly. Although the central theme is rather grim, there are wonderful bursts of humour, innocence and adventure throughout The 400 Blows. Antoine is clearly distanced from 'regular', happy children and nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where he and his best friend, Renee, played by Patrick Auffay, are planning Antoine's 'running away from home' in a packed auditorium of children watching a Punch & Judy-like show. As the camera pans around the small children's faces we can see how utterly absorbed they are by the show while Antoine and Renne stand apart from the crowd, only absorbed by the difficult tangle their lives have become.The 400 Blows sometimes gives one the feeling that a mere string of unfortunate events are solely to blame for how Antoine's life turns out but his dysfunctional home, defiant nature, yearning for independence and contempt for authority play a big role too. This is a beautifully made, intelligent, absorbing movie and I cannot fault it one iota.",

I think it is somewhat of a synecdoche of what society at large instills in people nowadays. It is very difficult to tread outside of the very well-delineated lines our superego has drawn for us. Antoine seems to be spiraled into this vertiginous voyage of soul destruction on almost a whim. I think it is symptomatic of our culture to \"lend\" our views of the world to the children, stating how they should feel and act, while not allowing their free expression of emotion. It is tragic, yet it reveals the parents' own unresolved issues and their need to project their own unwanted aspects into their kids, in whom they can exercise a more strict control. So, in the end, children not only have to carry the burden of their own emotionally chaotic and ever-changing inner world, but they need to shoulder the brunt of their parents' failings as well; perhaps this was best exemplified when Antoine's parents demand that he take the garbage out, they need to remind him that in the final analysis he is responsible for dealing with everybody's waste. What ensues in someone who has been so brow-beaten by life, without ever having their own emotions validated, is that they doubt the reality of their emotions, and encapsulate themselves into a protected world that is numb to any further assault by the world, what Sidney Klein would term an \"autistic cyst.\" The destruction of all that is externally good is symbolized when he is being taken away in the police wagon, the tears he sheds represent the death of emotion in itself, in a cathartic manner. When the end rolls around, even fantasy cannot save him. He approaches the ocean and when he sets foot in the water, her starts to walk sideways and eventually turns away with an emotionless face\u0085 the world has nothing left to offer him. His mother also plays out her own intrapsychic dynamic very well; she suffers between the pull of her id and her superego; her id is represented by Antoine, since he was conceived out of wedlock, and he is the personification of her rebellious side. Society (including her husband) puts demands on how her child should be reared, and since he represents such a powerful force in herself, a selfobject coruscating with a lust she perhaps wishes she could reclaim, there must be hell going on inside her head. She eventually succumbs to the oppressive punitive superego, and the only way she can eliminate her pulsating id is to eliminate her contact with its concrete representation, her son. She isolates her affect and summarily casts him into the destructive world that in essence destroyed her as well.",

            "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's, \"The 400 Blows,\" (1959) is an excellent character study of a youth living in poverty in Paris, France during the 1950's. Truffaut pulls many experiences from his own adolescent life to construct a very real telling of a troublesome young boy scorned by his teachers and parents because of his unquenchable thirst for exploration, excitement and what his superiors see as insubordination when it comes to society's rules. In under two hours Truffaut is able to tell the story of a troubled kid in Paris and subtly relate it to his own feelings about Cinema and its place in society at the time. Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in a small poor house in Paris under his mother and step-father's rules. After several examples of how Antoine is treated by his parents and his instructors, he decides he must run away in order to be happy. After being caught and sent back home a few times, he meets another boy with similar goals as him and the two go on a crime spree throughout Paris. Eventually, Antoine gets caught stealing a typewriter and is sent to the juvenile detention center to be rehabilitated. After only a few days he escapes the juvenile center and runs toward the sea in hopes of freedom. The film ends with a poignant freeze-frame of Antoine's face after he turns away from the sea and it is here that Truffaut freezes these characters and their story in cinematic history. These are characters forever locked into this particular story. Truffaut is drawing attention to the audience's knowledge that they just watched a film. The most important aspect of this film is not necessarily the story or characters themselves but rather the cinematic conventions that the film follows or breaks. You can compare Antoine Doinel to cinema itself in the way Truffaut see's the art form. He see's it as a young boy trying to be free and not follow society's rules. 400 Blows is a long desperate run away from conformity and to the freedom of the sea. Truffaut once said, \"I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between.\" He uses freeze-frames, fades, dissolves, and jump cuts to inform the audience that they are watching a film and in doing so he and his fellow colleague's practically created the French New Wave style. For all the things that 400 Blows says about society at the time, especially French society, the film's comparison to cinema itself, and the invention of a totally new cinematic movement, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut led the way for his contemporaries and himself to create new original films away from the traditional ideas of what a film had to be. The film went on to earn the 27 year old director the unique distinction of Best Director at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and has forever changed the way movies are conceptualized and produced. One of the original auteurs, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"400 Blows\" raises hell in the cinematic world and has gone down as one of the greatest films every made.",

Starting off with our protagonist Antoine Doinel misbehaving in class and then expanding the story out into a truly remarkable film about what is essentially child abuse \"although I imagine the culture in 1959 France, and 2013 Britain are two whole different things... but what makes this film truly remarkable is its young star. Once you set eyes upon his daring, yet cheeky behaviour, you begin to see why he has an apathy for life that no child in my personal opinion should have. What is going on here is the whole \"Nurse Ratchet\" scenario really brought to form by 1976 by \"one flew over the cuckoos nest\", the format is very similar, with everything the adults doing to help the child just pushing him further and further from social obedience. The shots of him seeing his hometown drive out of view at the end had me in complete hysterical sobbing mode, and with good reason... The cinematography is just as alive today as if it were made today in black and white, yet, the same thing can't be said for the setting... Its absolutely amazing to see what Paris looked like in 1959, its beautiful and (even in b&w, which people should stop complaining about... and subtitles) this serves up as one of the best international movies of its time. The acting is very rarely wooden and over the top, and never from our main character, I can quite safely say that this film needs to be broadcast more. I would pay a lot of money to see it on the big screen... I just cannot bring myself to criticise this fantastic gem of cinema! Hello out there to my fellow geeky film lovers... its up to us to keep classics like this in the limelight... <3",

Like Hitchcock was the master of Suspense Truffaut was the master of Real Life Drama. Just like Jules and Jim, Stolen Kisses and Day for Night the people and the things they do are so real, you feel like you could almost walk in and talk to them. And Truffaut found a way to make Real Life as funny and dramatic. But this is his best film, because Jean-Paul Leaud gives one of the best preformances I've ever seen.",

            "review_title": "Gorgeous movie, ingenious for its time",
            "content": "\"The 400 Blows\" is a not-so-good literal translation of the original French title, which is an expression for \"acting rebellious, unrestrained\". It is the behavior of a child, Antoine, who's the protagonist. All throughout the film, he's tormented by the incomprehensible distance with the adults' world. Like most children, he feels disconnected from his surroundings, from the true reality of facts. He cannot foresee consequences, and whenever he finds himself facing them, he gives them no important significance.\nIt may sound ridiculous to hear, but children are more directly connected to the truest nature of the world we live in. Antoine cares more about getting in touch with the world by struggling to get a living out of it, instead of sitting at a desk for years. Whenever he gets in trouble, even if it's something trivial, he sees no other option but leaving home.\nThis movie is about innocence, more strictly children's innocence, but it doesn't mean the grown-up audience is forbidden from relating to the movie. The movie feels so close to real life, it follows the characters in the most common of times and makes them extremely fascinating. It's possible that Truffaut gave the movie this realistic atmosphere just to express better the simplicity and pure thoughts of Antoine.\nThe revolutionary face of the French New Wave is concealed by the tenderness of the movie. The movie is more rebellious in its technique rather than the actions of the characters. Antoine doesn't fight for one ideology or another. He just constantly tries to find out what the world has to offer him personally. But I guess the ending explains all this much more appropriately than me.",

But he didn't have a role model to show him how to be good, at no point in the movie do we see his mother or father doing anything positive. So it wasn't like he was always doing wrong, it was more like he didn't know how to do right. For example when he stole the typewriter if was for survival, and when he realized he couldn't do anything with it he didn't just leave it in the street, he tried to do good and got severely punished for it. It was a lesson for him, don't do good. For some reason I would back that kid every day of the week, and if he were a real kid I would want to be his big brother.",

            "content": "Some say that eyes are the most powerful tool in cinema and Truffaut goes to show it in \"Les quatre cents coups\". Some say that cinema is cinema when shots and camera movement tell as much as characters express through words, and Truffaut proves it through the film.Antoine is a kid, a rebel one, son of a dysfunctional mother who tells him off frequently for no reason. He's sick of his parents and soon starts to pursue freedom.As the story moves forward through Antoine's eyes, one gets to understand that, afterall, all what he's seeking for is love. The love that he has never received at home, the one that every kid deserves. He goes out with his friend, skips class, steals stuff to get some money but it never works out. He never seems to find the freedom he's dying to have despite being close. No matter how, something or someone ends up dashing his plans.As stated, the story is told from and through Antoine's eyes. We see him look around amazed by the greatness of the city, we see him scared, enraged and sad, and, at the very end, confused. The long travellings that portrait the city help us understand Antoine's look and desire of breaking free and becoming a son of Paris and no one else.The ending sequence is a true lesson of film language. Antoine seems to have made it. After running away from the juvenile facility he was abandonet at, he's now free in front of the sea. But that sensation of freedom ends as soon as Antoine stares confused right at the camera, which is when the film ends. His confusion tells us that, afterall, he's a kid and is completely lost and alone, so he'll need to learn how to survive.",

            "content": "This wonderful film, the spear point of new wave cinema, has many delightful moments. In one of them, Antoine has seen his mother consorting with her boyfriend, a fellow worker. The mother attempts to \"make nice\" with the 13 year old so that he will not reveal her infidelity to her husband - affectionately tucking him into bed. However, the boy's expression makes it clear that he understands his mother's selfish motive perfectly and is not buying her act.What makes the story so compelling is that Antoine is an intelligent, sensitive and compassionate child. One wants to leap into the film, grab the unfeeling adults by their throats and throttle them to force them to pay attention to him and consider his needs. At the end we realize, as Antoine perhaps also has discovered, that we are all fundamentally alone in a world of self-absorbed people like the adults who so badly neglected and misunderstood this valuable young man.",

            "review_title": "Review and Opinion",
            "content": "A mistake, reflected onto years of petty crime, of absence of family love, and denial are all reflected in the movie 400 Blows. We viewed this movie as a closure for our film appreciation class this year in ninth grade. The purpose of watching this Francois Truffaut film was to get an inside view of the French New Wave, and how it differs from all of the Hollywood films of the time period. The plot is based on a young adolescent who is mistreated, has a lack of love and attention, and how he believes in the inside he was a \"mistake\". Antoine, the main character, reveals his life to the viewer, making one reflect the reasons behind why he behaves the way he does. The heart-breaking experience is one that the viewer can understand, and get to a point where one has empathy towards Antoine and accepts the story behind a troubled boy.The movie starts by showing an inner aspect of a never-ending cycle, which starts in the point where he faces a scarcity of caring from the family, specifically from the mother, which leads to his behavior problems. This misconduct will foment the mistreatment from the adults. It commences at the school, where Antoine is handed a picture of a lady and his professor punishes him by taking away his recess and demanding him to write that he will not write on the wall again 1000 times give rise to the fact that Antoine will miss school the next day. The fact that he doesn't attend school the morning after will lead to a discovery that will change the relationship between Antoine and his mother. His non-stopping escaping from his own reality will hand him things he never would have expected.The character Antoine Doinel is performed by Jean-Pierre Leaud, reflected by the story of Truffaut, which is later used in several other movies. In my personal opinion, I believe he Leaud engages perfectly with the character and story, making him a perfect choice. The fact that the French New Wave films were based on films closer to the reality of the place, helps Jean-Pierre Leaud fill identified, making it an easier character to perform. His silence throughout the movie makes the viewer focus one's attention in his actions and the reason behind all this quietness. The other actor I believe plays an excellent roll is Claire Maurier, as Gilberte Doinel; Antoine's mother. She is parts of the stereotype of the \"sexy, unfaithful blonde\", which leads to a couple of events in the film. This events are essential in demonstrating the causes of Antoine's behavior, and that's why it is so important for Maurier to act it out precisely.As to what I personally liked, there are several scenes and elements. I believe there are 3 indispensable details revealed in the film that divulge important parts of Antoine's life and reason of being the way he is. One of these scenes is when Antoine tells the psychologist that his grandmother told him that his mother wanted to abort him, and that it was thanks to her (his grandmother) that he (Antoine) was born. Just this fact creates a feeling in Antoine's mind that he is useless and unwanted. Gilberte also behaves toward him in a way that makes Antoine believe it even more, including the fact that she treats him more like a servant than a son. I also appreciated the fact that Truffaut enfasized certain parts of the story that were important for the viewer to see and understand. One example of this is almost at the end of the film where there is a long scene of him running away. This creates a feeling and and understanding of how long it was for him to obtain the liberty he wanted. A present moral in the film is that no one can judge a person without knowing him/her first, just as the quote states \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" This is a misconception that has always been present in the human lives, when one judges another by his actions or appearance alone. The second part of the lesson is that we need to understand why something is the way it is, because everything has a reason behind it, and eventually try to accept it, or at least understand it. The fact that people, most of the time, judge a person's misbehavior without knowing the reasons behind it, reflect a lack of empathy in the world. Empathy is when one can \"get in the shoes\" of another person, and understand the situation they are in.I would recommend this movie to a group of people older than twelve years, or in a time that they will be able to understand all the inside detail behind the story, understand the metaphors and the meaning of every feature. To enjoy the movie today, one must be aware that the pace is very different from the Hollywood films of the 21st century. Not only is it necessary to be aware, but to appreciate this kinds of films, because the viewer not only learns about Antoine's story, but also how the people lived in those times. The film is currently unrated, but I believe an accurate rating would be PG-13. Some inappropriate language and behavior is shown, that's why the parental guidance would be necessary, as well the fact that one could need help to divulge the meaning of some scenes.Rating: 8.5/10Mariana is a ninth grade student in the film appreciation class, but is mainly interested in drawing/painting and music. She is dedicated towards what she loves.",
