            "content": "While it thoroughly deserves its reputation as a film only worth seeing so that you can enjoy its remarkably amateurish production, on the other hand it seems a bit unfair to label \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" as the worst film ever made.  Most of it is quite watchable, it's not at all offensive, and the story - utterly ridiculous as it is - moves fairly quickly, and gives you some reasons to stick around to the end.  Those qualities put it well ahead of a great many movies that cost a lot more to make and that involved many more recognizable names than you'll find in this cast.To be sure, almost everything about it is of amazingly poor quality, from the incompetent directing and acting to the slipshod special effects to the dialogue that produces countless unintentional laughs.  The story is goofy, and uses ideas and devices that lack credibility even by sci-fi standards. Everyone who watches it has their own list of favorite examples of this film's complete ineptitude.If you have any interest in old movies, you should see this if you have the chance, as long as you can do so without paying for the privilege.  It says something that so many viewers are still talking about it over 40 years after it was made, which is a lot more than will ever be said about most of the movies you could see in a theater today.  Whether you will ever want to watch it again is an entirely different question, although there are those who have managed to enjoy watching this several times.  Take a look for yourself and see what you think about this classic example of inept film-making.",

            "content": "First things first - anyone who calls 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' \"the worst movie ever made\" needs to watch more movies! To me \"the worst\" would be one that was dull and has no entertainment value whatsoever. 'Plan 9' is the complete opposite of dull, and is it entertaining? You bet! It's still one of the greatest beer'n'pizza and have a bunch of your pals over movies ever made. Hell, it isn't even the most inept and bizarre movie Ed Wood ever made, that would still have to be 'Glen Or Glenda', which for some strange reason still doesn't have a tenth of the cult following 'Plan 9' does. Speaking of cult, in some ways 'Plan 9' is almost THE definitive cult movie if you consider that it virtually vanished without a trace when it was first released and it still lives on because it was subsequently rediscovered by thousands of enthusiastic movie nuts, collectors, journalists, cartoonists, rock musicians (e.g. The Damned), and other film makers (Joe Dante, Sam Raimi, Tim Burton). I think 'Glen Or Glenda' is Wood's most amazing achievement myself, but I still love 'Plan 9'. I've lost track of how many times I've seen it over the years. I wouldn't go so far as to say I have it memorized or anything, but it's always in the back of my mind. It's like part of the collective pop culture unconscious that I carry around with me at all times. As much as I love Bela Lugosi I think the three main reasons this movie is truly unforgettable (apart from the obvious -  silly aliens, laughably bad dialogue and \"those\" flying saucers,etc.etc.) are Criswell, Vampira, and especially Tor Johnson. Any three of those people being involved would have made this something special, but all three! Man! This is trash heaven! It's hard to believe there's anyone left alive who hasn't already seen this movie, but if by some strange twist of fate you are one of the uninitiated, you MUST, I repeat MUST watch 'Plan 9' as soon as possible! And remember, my friends, future events such as these will effect YOU in the future!",

Yes, it is poorly made, it was cheaply made, but I think that there are many movies that are MUCH worse than this one (MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE and THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS are much more amateurish and poorly made than this) and there are much worse directors than Ed Wood (Harold P. Warren and Coleman Francis for example). And I consider PLAN 9 one of the greatest bad movies.The many flaws of this movie are: the acting, full of corny dialogue and overacting (especially by Tor Johnson and Vampira); the sets and the special effects may be poor and cheap (I laughed a lot when I saw the pie plates used as UFOs); and lots and lots of stock footage. But I find this movie entertaining for the dialogue and also for Bela Lugosi's final performance (here billed ''Almost starring Bela Lugosi'' since he died before the movie was released). And Ed Wood directs nicely, and except at half-way the movie is very fast-paced.All in all, a nice and funny time passer and among the cults of bad movies! Not to be missed.",

No, it's not the best one, either.

Really! I've seen worse (usually the \"B\" sci-fi movies of the '50s, too!)I loved the first third of this film. I laughed many times at the hokey flying saucers, the walking \"dead\" and the corny dialog. I thought, \"Wow, this was a bad (meaning good) as advertised,\" but then I found the film starting to lag at the 35-40-minute mark and recovered a little bit in the end, but not enough to make me want to watch this again. It got too talking and too preachy. Holy cow, this movie is nothing but preaching for everyone to take \"flying saucers\" seriously. Then we got more preaching at the end about the usual how- violent-mankind-is\" blah, blah, blah. The writers here obviously took themselves too seriously. They should have just kept it as sci-fi/horror flick without all the heavy-handed preaching.Highlights included Tor Johnson's face, the many lines of ridiculous dialog, Vampira's zombie walk with her outstretched hand, and Criswell's incredible speeches and the beginning and end of the movie!

Besides, most criticism goes out to the lousy scenery and the goofy decors. Well excuse Mr. Wood for not disposing over a huge budget or funds! He did what he could and sure, the jet cockpit looks amateurish and the Pentagon-offices have the image of being build by a kindergarten-crew but so what? I have a lot more respect and sympathy for this film than for those over-budgeted, uninspired blockbusters! Like in ALL of his films, Ed Wood proves that he's full of good intentions, creativity and a strong will to proceed and purchase his dreams. The only thing you can reproach him here, is the silly and pointless screenplay. Aliens are desperately seeking contact with humanity and in their ninth attempt to achieve this, they even resurrect the dead. Why?!? To make humans aware of their existence and to figure as prophets with a message. This is where the silliness comes in. But it all remains pure fun, all the time! What also makes this film legendary is the fact that it contains the last on-screen appearance by Bela Lugosi. Lugosi died during filming and another guy in a Dracula outfit who constantly hides his face behind a cape (!) replaces him. Am I the only one who thinks this subtle cast-change is absolutely charming and nicely tried? Vampiria and Tor Johnson are credited as main performances but all the have to do is stumble around and look ghoulishnot a difficult thing to do if you have the posture of Tor Johnson. Overall, Plan 9 from Outer Space remains the absolute top-recommendation to watch with a group of people when there's beer and snacks.",

            "review_title": "Imagine What Plans 1 to 8 were like!",
            "content": "Well, \"10(excellent)\" needs the constant reminder - this film is so really bad (textbook stature bad) that it is great. If the cinema created masters like Ford, Huston, Renoir, Hitchcock, Bunuel, Welles, Truffaut, Bergman, Kurasawa....it also created the legend of Ed Wood, a man who was determined to bring his ideas to the screen, and lacked absolutely every degree of ability to make a decent mediocre film. But the result is one of the oddest in film history (and as I write this, I am fully aware it sounds a bit like Wood's horrible dialog for Criswell talking about \"the future\"). Wood would have been long forgotten (like the creator of the hideously bad ROBOT MONSTER) if he had not one glaringly good point - he was willing to take chances to discuss material that was slightly out of step. Transvestitism in GLEN,OR GLENDA for example (because Wood was a transvestite). In Plan NINE FROM OUTERSPACE he actually tries to make a case that mankind is playing with nuclear fire that may not only destroy the Earth but the Universe. In the late 1950s, even though Joe McCarthy was dead, this view was not a popular one. Look at the other science fiction stories, and you see that there is a suggestion that more care is required to use nuclear power. Once you destroy the atomic ants in THEM, Edmund Gwenn does not suggest dropping the use of atomic energy. But Wood does question it. Unfortunately he questions it badly.For one thing, Wood was aware of what he had to do with his audience - he had to try to keep their attention by a sense of dread regarding the science fiction threat to mankind by his space invaders. But compare his horrendously bad cast here (aside from Lugosi, who actually died before the film was barely begun, the only other performer of real note was Lyle Talbot as a Pentagon General in one scene). THEM had Gwenn, James Whitmore, and James Arness in the cast. THEM also had various special affects, such as films of ants in their natural background, and even having full scale battles with each other. The result is that one believes what one sees in THEM. One can't believe the cheesy effects of Woods production, nor his cheesy actors and cheesy dialog.Also there is an inherent contradiction in the film. The space invaders are destroying man with an army of the resurrected dead. Its purpose is due to the Earth not heeding warnings about the dangers of their nuclear weapon programs. But from what we see its more a matter of impatience by these same invaders in dealing with us (barely one or two messages get through, and they do not say much about what is the reason for the anger of the space invaders). Furthermore Woods keeps showing how inept the invaders are - their weapons fail and one is almost strangled by a zombie. Later the Earthlings manage to damage the \"controls\" (I hate using that sophisticated term for Woods cardboard sets) of the flying saucer, so that while the commander lies unconscious the saucer blows up. Some really effective futuristic foe!!Still Woods views (when one finds them) do strike one as interesting. The space commander points out that Earthlings are not only ones who believe in God. A curious point that was rarely suggested in the 1950s (in fact the next time it pops up was in one of the original STAR TREK episodes with William Shatner, written by Gene Roddenberry - and it was done with far more cleverness dealing with the punning of the term \"Sun/Son\" God). On the other hand the space invaders are not fully ready for total female equality. While the commander has a female assistant, he makes comments suggesting that women are supposed to be home most of the time - hardly a futuristic viewpoint.By now perhaps you can see the problem. Production standards are poor. Acting atrocious for the most part. Screenplay is dismal in language content. But those small little fragments of a brain that tried to speak to us remain fascinating. The result is not another ROBOT MONSTER, but a film that will never really die with movie lovers...and a further proof that if you do have some originality you may remain a legend, even with dismal side effects.",

Poor production values, terrible acting, worse directing, and dialog that has to be heard to be believed, combine to create a cinematic gem.When speaking of bad movies, it is important to understand what is meant by \"bad\". There is good bad, and there is bad bad. Bad bad is a movie that combines all the elements listed above--bad acting, bad directing, etc.--to produce something that bores. Good bad combines the same elements in such a way that a highly entertaining movie is made, although not in the way the movie makers hope.\"Plan 9\" is not just good bad, it is brilliant bad. It is unintentionally hilarious, and that's as funny as it gets. This is a movie that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Everything about it is bad. When George Romero made \"Night of the Living Dead\" he did it on the cheap, but still produced a film that was intense, scary, and had a point. \"Plan 9\" is nothing but bad, albeit in a wonderful way.As an example of bad production values, there is a scene where a police car is speeding away from headquarters. As the action begins it is broad daylight. The next scene is the car racing across the city. Now, however, it is night! Next is the car arriving at its destination, a cemetery, and again it is daylight. That is either one huge city, or somebody on the Plan 9 crew was asleep at the switch.\"Plan 9\" is so full of great badness that to detail all the goofs, flubs, and cheesiness would require remaking the entire movie. The cemetery is a weed-infested lot; an airline cockpit set is a shower curtain, some plywood and a couple chairs; a cop scratches his head with the business end of a gun barrel; the outside of the space ship has a ladder that goes nowhere; the plan itself, that is, plan number 9, makes no sense at all. And on and on and on...If you love movies, and want to consider yourself conversant in all genres of film, seeing at least one bad sci-fi movie is a must. \"Plan 9\" is the Hamlet of that genre.

Therefore, I was raised watching trash movies (LOL). \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is the masterpiece of Edward D. Wood Jr., a.k.a. Ed Wood, a man without talent that loved cinema.\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is totally lame: the screenplay is messy, with characters that do not have any development; the lines are awfully silly and stupid; there is an absolute lack of continuity, and sometimes the shot begins in the night, the next scene is in the sunlight and then it is night again. The scenarios are very poor and it is funny to see crosses shaking in the cemetery and other errors. But the performances are the funniest part of this film, with unbelievable ham actors and actresses. In one of the last scenes, it is hilarious to see the Colonel Tom Edwards (Tom Keen) with hands on the pocket; the police Lieutenant Harper (Duke Moore) with a gun on his hand; Paula and Jeff Trent embracing each other and the policeman with a stupid face watching the flying saucer burning on the sky. Ed Wood did not have producers or sponsors so his budget was extremely low. Therefore he could not afford to lose any shot and he used footages from the studios, like for example the sequence when the three flying sources are bombed by the army. Another example is the footages of Bela Lugosi, who was drug-addicted, forgotten and poor in 1956, and died three days after the beginning of the filming of \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". Ed Wood used a substitute actor that partially covers his face with a cloak since he was not alike Bela Lugosi.

Maybe we should have to look at that scene before watching this film.If Plan Nine is awful, it is probably so precisely because it IS so grandly ambitious. --If all ambition cannot culminate in a Citizen Kane or a Vertigo, maybe it gives us a moment to mourn quietly for the rest of us, the ones who worship genius \u0096as Ed Wood no doubt did\u0096 without being geniuses ourselves. Bottom line, no matter what cards you get, you can laugh or you can cry at life. Ed Wood put on nylons and pumps and, making sure his seams were straight, marched into the fray of life like a true Hero Born. He stuck incongruous, obvious stock footage into his magnum opus, knowing the poetry would arise from the montage; he improvised long stretches, fully certain he would get the same results Welles could working under similar circumstances; he tried valiantly to coax performances out of wretched actors, or fatally self-conscious non-actors, like Criswell and Vampira, and put them in no matter how their work turned out (\"No time to re-shoot!\"). No matter what, you have to admire his staying in the game.VanGogh is perhaps the best case scenario of a loser who cranked away, certain he was onto something, who is lucky enough to have the entire world one day concur. Ed Wood's is, sadly, the more often played scenario. He is positive attitude, high ambition and wishful thinking, unsupported. He was certain he was onto something.

We all know that the comedy of the film was unintentional, then why do we laugh? We laugh because Mr. Wood does everything conceivable to mask his non-budget to give the illusion of a grand sci-fi-horror epic. And he does it with such unabashed gracelessness with so little concern for time continuity or any other kind of logic, that we laugh at just how absurd the medium of film can become, if used in incompetent hands.

And later, a VO intones: \"The ever beautiful flower she had planted with her own hands became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.\" Evidently, Wood saw no need to hire a script editor. And yet, specifically because of its technical crudeness, \"Plan 9 ...\" is fun to watch.

It is as bad as you've no doubt heard. The scene changes from night to day to night, the spaceship is a hubcap (you can see the string it hangs from catch on fire at one point), I could do a better job acting, etc. ad nauseum. But it takes a hell of a lot to be almost universally considered the worst movie of all time, and here is Plan 9's true strength. There are many horrible of movies, but most of them are so bad because they are too bad to be truly bad, and therefore sink into mediocrity. Plan 9, however, has no redeeming quality's, and so it stands out. Few will recognise a movie such as \"The Medallion,\" but every movie-goer knows Plan 9.As I said before, it takes a hell of a lot to be the worst. Because of this, Plan 9 is some of the most fun you'll EVER have watching a movie. Almost every scene is so bad I broke out laughing. Few other movies achieve that kind of humor, whether intentional or not. For that I give it a very intentional 10/10.",

He had a burning drive and ambition to succeed in the film industry, yet his creative and directorial talents were infantile.Plan 9 is his most famous film and has become a cult favourite. The film is an example of extreme amateurism which creates an assortment of unintentionally funny scenes. It's truly amazing this film managed to be funded and released to the public (then again, The Swarm was too \u0085).Within Plan 9's ridiculous and convoluted story are a number of silly subplots due to the fact that Ed had such a variety of interesting an un-related footage which he really, really wanted to use in the one film. One needs to pay close attention to understand everything that's going on in this mess (although, when you do understand everything that's going on, you may wish you'd have remained ignorant!)Plan 9 has heaps of priceless quirks: hub-cap flying saucers, idiotic dialogue, the last gasp of the great Bella Lugosi, and the luscious Vampira (who apparently would have breached an existing contract if she uttered a word in Plan 9).One of the most interesting aspects of Plan 9 is the great variation in performance techniques by the actors. Some speak their lines like they know the script is idiotic while some speak their lines like they don't understand them (which is possible because some of the dialogue uttered by the bumbling aliens doesn't make any sense). But my favourite character is the airline captain played by Gregory Walcott.Greg's a real trooper and attempts to take his role very, very seriously despite the constant lunacy around him. How did he remain so professional? Did he imagine his role in Plan 9 would lead to greater things?Although Ed Wood has been voted by the US film industry as the worst director in history, he lives on as a kind of cult anti-hero. As a director then, he has achieved a level of lasting success.6/10 \u0096 For fun value.",

Sure there are many continuity mistakes including shots shifting between day and night in the same scene and the unrealistic dialog and silly looking sets but it all adds to the fun. The story revolves around UFO sightings happening in a Los Angeles town. The police and eventually the army step in to blast them out of the sky but can't hurt them. The martians who run the UFO'S look and sound like regular people but with silly uniforms. Their mission is to release \"Plan 9\" on the humans which is a plan involving bringing the dead to life to get everyones attention. The martians want to bring peace to earth by communicating with the humans but all the humans want to do is destroy the UFO'S making it hard for a peace talk. How this weird plan is supposed to work to bring peace is silly in itself. There are so many mistakes and silly scenes in the movie I would take up too much space writing it all. When Gregory Walcott, one of the lead actors, read the script, he told director Ed Wood it was the worst script he ever read but he needed the work. Bela Lugosi appears in some footage shot just before his death with no project in mind. Ed incorporated it in this movie so he can include him in the film. Lugosi was doubled by Tom Mason, Woods Wife's chiropractor, who was inches taller and played the part with a cape covering most of his face. The movie stars Wood regulars Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks. This movie reinforces my belief that the only bad film is a boring film!",

There also were the TV series like \"Superman\" and \"Batman\". By today's standards most of them had very simple production values and effects. But \"Plan 9 From Outer Scace\" represents perhaps the all-time low. The sets look cheap and cheesy. The flying saucers look like chrome hubcaps suspended from strings that are often clearly visible. The dialog often provokes a laugh, when none was intended. Unless Ed Wood was more clever than we think, and was simply making a parody instead of a Sci-Fi thriller.It appears that Wood, who also wrote the screenplay, borrowed plainly from \"The Day The Earth Stood Still.\" In that movie, the aliens were visiting Earth to warn us, if we didn't quit making more powerful bombs that could destroy the Earth, they would come and overpower us. In \"Plan 9\", the aliens are coming for the same reason, with some far-fetched pseudo-science about particles of light, destroying the sun, and that having an effect on the rest of the galaxy.\"Plan 9\" was to bring back the dead back to life, and control them with a type of ray gun the aliens had. For a race that had advanced eons ago beyond Earthlings, they had very primitive looking flying saucer interiors, and bulky machines from the 1940s used as controllers. The movie is in black and white, it never gets very interesting, the acting would rival a 1950s high school play, the dialog is cheesy, and the movie ends rather abruptly. What's not to like?",

The script is beyond belief! Seriously, did ANYONE think this was written by someone in the right frame of mind? The dialogue was just dreadful. Also the actors were directed all wrong--if they in fact WERE directed. Notice how the police inspector uses his gun to scratch his face, push up his hat, wave in a general direction...and everybody acts as this is perfectly normal.And Ed Wood...he was no director and had zero talent. I love how shots go from night to day to night again for no apparent reason. And poor Bela Lugosi! He was reduced to doing THIS? He has no dialogue and (before filming was completed) he died. So they got a guy ONE FOOT TALLER than Lugosi to play him by holding a cloak over his face! The other actors are (to put mildly) terrible.This is not the worst film ever made (\"Salo\" gets that dubious honor) but it's definitely down there. It should be seen with an audience--it's actually funnier that way.Among the amusing lines: \"You're all stupid stupid STUPID! Don't you see?

Wood was voted the worst director in motion picture history in 1980, which caused a resurgence in interest in his career, the Burton picture about his life in 1994, and even a DVD box set of his films with commentary.My 7/10 score is on a \"so bad it is good\" scale. It doesn't rate higher because there are long sections of the film that are just plain boring. Unlike other great bad films such as \"Night Killer\" or \"The Fanatic\", \"Plan Nine\" does not keep the action going. Plan Nine is about a group of space aliens who decide that the earth must be destroyed because of our dangerous use of technology, a timely topic for the 1950s. Also, it is rather interesting that the aliens decide to use the reanimation of the recently deceased to help in their attack. This could have possibilities that might even have raised eyebrows among those enforcing the production code but, alas, the film in total is just too incoherent when it is not being boring to raise eyelids much less eyebrows.The dialogue is stream of consciousness and often throwaway, you apparently have people who are killed just by being slapped by the reanimated dead, and Wood was obviously making a film he did not have the budget for since the props look like something out of a high school play.If you are going to try and labor your way through this one, watch Burton's 1994 \"Ed Wood\" before you do, because it explains so much about who is in this film and how it got made.

This gem is written, produced, and directed by Ed Wood, Jr. There's numerous stories of actors doing stupid things-- for example, an actor playing a cop would repeatedly point his gun at himself-- just to see if Mr. Wood would notice (Spoiler, he didn't).Now, there are really only 2 types of moments in this film: moments that are so bad it's funny, and moments that are just plain bad. I'm talking about an awful narrator who, whenever he mentions a character or setting, there must an awkward edit to show what he's talking about-- in case the audience was confused. The writing is so choppy, for better and definitely for worse, the directing is just... just bad. I don't think there's any other way to say it. And the actors would just get their lines over with because they had better things to do with their lives.So what is this ninth plan? Well, aliens with much laughably better technology come to Earth in their flying saucers on strings. And in order to make sure Earth creatures don't destroy the shared universe, they must be destroyed. Thus, the best way for the aliens to accomplish this goal is to obviously raise the dead using their electron guns. This diabolical plan ends up raising a total of 3 creatures throughout the movie: a big detective, Dracula, and Vampira. Trust me when I tell you how haunting and scary and gory and... Oh I can't do it. The biggest laughs are watching the 3 walk over to the main characters as the characters just stare and watch in \"horror\".This movie isn't always good, but it certainly is always bad. Look it up. There's horror and drama and sci-fi babble with quick edits. Not sure how much more you can ask for. There's even a Johnny Depp film called Ed Wood based on this guy (haven't watched it though).

For this reason, there was a myriad of \"invisible invaders\" movies that permeated the landscape at the time Wood created this movie. While the script is flawed, the storyline one-dimensional, the special effects non-existent, stock footage galore, and the acting as cardboard as they come, this movie blends these aspects together in spectacular fashion. Had this movie had Tim Burton or the Zucker brothers names attached, and been released 20 or more years later, this movie might be considered one of the greatest spoofs ever made. There is so much to get caught up in, and so many different things to hit the rewind button for, that it may take upwards of 2 hours to get through this short film. This film is bad, but it could be argued that this film was created to be bad! From cut shots that move from midnight to midday and back again, to mattresses readily apparent as fall-aways, to the ever-popularly sighted man in the cape covering his face from the camera, this film has more Easter Eggs in it to search for than Oliver Stone has conspiracies.We sometimes forget that films are created to be enjoyable. We don't always need to have to ponder the meaning of existence after every feature. This is a film from within the era is seeks to mock. Every clich\u00e9 is used. It's not quite a horror film, and yet holds some of the well-worn clich\u00e9s of the genre. Same for the Sci-Fi genre. This is a film that rises above it's own limitations to entrench itself upon the cinematic landscape it seeks to make fun of. Remember, this is Ed Wood's idea of the greatest film he could create.This film has to be listed among mandatory viewing for anyone aspiring to work with the industry, as it is a mockery of both the big budget as well as the independent spirit.This is one film you will not soon forget, and for all the right reasons. Is it right to be so wrong? Or is it wrong to be so right? Is this film a great parody? A masterpiece of a spoof? Or was it genuinely trying to be as good as it possibly could?

It is, however, the most incompetent, with unbelievable ineptitude seeping from its every orifice. And that's what makes it fun.The \"plot\" concerns aliens and their you-can-see-the-strings-attached flying saucers seeking (gasp!) domination of Earth. To help them in their evil quest, they borrow a page from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by raising the dead from their graves to serve as a zombified army. Now it's up to hapless earthlings - led by moronic police, clich\u00e9d army officials and feeble-minded airplane pilots - to stop them.The storyline serves as little more than a front for the pure anti-genius of director Ed Wood to shine through. The most famous quirk is the employment of Bela Legosi as a star. Legosi, bless his heart, died three years before the film's release. No matter, said Wood, who sought to base his low-budget creation around a few scant minutes of unused silent footage of the horror icon. Wood is to be commended for his ambitious, if not inappropriate, attempt. What really makes the illusion crumble is Legosi's hilariously obvious stand-in, who, not blessed with much resemblance to the deceased actor, compensates by inexplicably covering most of his face with a cape.The Legosi gimmick may get all of the attention, but the truth is PLAN 9 would have been just as horrendous without it. Take the dialog, which must be heard to be believed. When a laser ray suddenly morphs Legosi's zombie into a skeleton, a bystander is heard to note, \"He wasn't like that a minute ago!\" Very observant. Then there's the head alien henchman, smirkingly reminiscent of a '50s TV announcer, who tries hard but is about as convincing as Pauly Shore as Al Capone. \"You're all stupid... stupid, stupid!\" he tells the earthlings during an unimpressive temper tantrum. (Thankfully one of the good guys then proves how intelligent we really are... by punching the alien's lights out!).Other absurdities abound. There are times when it appears Wood had to stop the camera so he could think of what to do or have the characters say next. A woman being chased by the zombies \"trips\" over nothing not once, but twice. Presumably sturdy tombstones fall over. After being brought back to life, burly Inspector Clay can't climb out of his grave. Policemen belittle a woman for not wanting to be alone with murderous creatures roaming the grounds. The same footage of Legosi walking out of the graveyard is used over and over again. No other film has given the viewer such little credit. Wood simply shrugged his shoulders at the glaring errors and must have thought, \"Well, heck, who pays attention to these things?\"What really allows PLAN 9 to succeed (to some degree) despite itself is the fact that it's so damn innocent. It doesn't seem Wood was trying to be campy; he really thought he had a winner. To his eternal credit, he did create something truly memorable, just not in the way he intended.",

            "content": "Clearly this is a very difficult film, judging from the multitude of critics that have failed to comprehend its intricate fabric of multi-layered symbolism and rich, evocative imagery. That Ed Wood was an authentic American genius is altogether beyond dispute; and like most geniuses, he has continued to be subjected to the rancorous attacks of tiny minds unable to grasp the sheer enormity of his conceptions. That those conceptions, so lovingly crafted and nurtured to fruition, were largely ignored by the hormone-crazed drive-in theater audiences to which they were usually consigned, might have claimed the sanity of a lesser man. But for the peerless and indomitable Wood it was always truly \"arse gratia artis,\" and it was this passionate commitment to artistic perfection that set him apart from his contemporaries. Even the inscrutable Federico Fellini was apparently so moved by Wood's work that he was reported to have cried out from his death-bed: \"Merda! Son Morto!\" Certainly there can be no greater tribute than this, from one dying artist to another.\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is unquestionably the shining centerpiece of Wood's creative efforts. From the incisive opening comments by the impeccably urbane Criswell, we are transported into an unparalleled realm of cinematic poetry. The perpetually fog-shrouded cemetery is a metaphor for the murky depths of the human soul, while its cardboard tombstones evoke the fragility of man's earthly fame, even as the rapid transitions from day to night proclaim the transience of his earthly existence. And moving silently in the midst of this cosmic desolation, the always elegant Vampira is like the primal earth mother, gathering her wandering children to her bosom, while the brooding figure of Bela Lugosi strides endlessly to and fro, wrapped in unanswerable questions.Veteran Swedish actor Tor Johnson (fresh from a string of triumphant performances as Charles the Wrestler in the Stratford Festival production of \"As You Like It\") is a standout in the technically demanding dual role of Inspector Daniel Clay/Fat Zombie. Who else could have injected such pathos, dignity and depth of meaning into such seemingly trivial lines as \"I'm a big boy now, Johnny\"--who but the man that (on two separate occasions) graciously declined the part of Antonius Block in \"The Seventh Seal,\" thereby effectively launching the career of his hitherto unknown countryman, Max von Sydow? And who else could have risen so magnificently from the grave as a symbol of man's eternal quest for redemption and resurrection (a theme which is carried forth in the subtle Grail connotations conjured up by the Arthurian garb of the alien leader)? However, in the end, it is Wood's acerbic wit that propels this film to true greatness. Boldly rejecting the vision of his contemporaries (born of human vanity) that superior aliens would actually wish to conquer and possess our ridiculous little planet, Wood shows us that the only aliens that would waste their time on such an unpromising venture would have to be even more ridiculous. Hence he presents us with aliens who, having presumably bungled their way through eight previous plans for world conquest, have arrived at the ninth without even grasping the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs. Their supposedly superior technology is constantly malfunctioning, most of their pilots appear to be flying while intoxicated, and they actually have to tie strings to their flying saucers so they can find their way home again. (Sadly, many unperceptive critics have dismissed these brilliant satirical touches as mere shoddy special effects.) Little wonder, then, that the ninth plan fares no better than any of its predecessors. In a burst of flame, the aliens are gone, and it is just as if they had never been. One may well imagine that the fire that consumes their spacecraft travels all the way up the string to their home planet, and incinerates the whole dreary lot of them (thus effectively bringing to pass their own worst fear). The earth continues on its sad course, seemingly impervious to Criswell's final, angst-ridden plea for divine aid, and we are left with the distinct impression that (contrary to the mindless optimism of the fifties) all may not be well, after all.",

This movie has everything. Silly aliens. People rising from the grave. Vampires. Ridiculous flying saucers. And, without a doubt, some of the worst acting that has ever been committed to celluloid. And, still, we laugh and look forward to each scene because we know what's next. We know that Bela passed away and a guy who has no physical resemblance to him had to take over. There is no real plot. I believe that the worst list is for movies that have no heart--something like \"Godzilla vs. Freddy Mercury.\" I believe that there are and were directors who simply wrote for the third feature at drive-in movies where the kids didn't even watch. If you've not seen this film. Have the fun of viewing it for the first time.",

Personally I believe this is the one film that is beyond rating, there being two many side issues to deal into the equation. Rather than re-hash either the plotline, such that it barely is, or the film's glaring production faults, I just want to add my own thoughts here.PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE has achieved that which many films strive for but few can ever attain - screen immortality. It doesn't matter any more how bad it is, how amateurishly made, how laughable or even how lacking in substance...it IS Ed Wood's PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, and flying hubcaps or not, MORE people know of this film than of HELL IN THE PACIFIC or even LIMELIGHT.  The film strives to be earnest and I'm sure in Ed Wood's mind it went a long way to achieving this. As someone wrote, having seen Tim Burton's rather rose-colored biog ED WOOD, it would be churlish, even downright cowardly to savage this film, one that is unable to defend itself.PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE is like a lovable and worn out Teddy Bear - you don't toss it and buy a new one. You grow up quietly and keep it in your cupboard of memories. I am proud to have known PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. Once, I laughed at it - now I respect its limitations.",

Since then a lot has changed, I've developed my own taste and became very picky about what I watch. And after rewatching it I can tell for sure that I would not be returning to this movie again.\n\"Plan 9 from outer space\" is a low-budget movie and the lack of finances feels in every way and in every scene: ragged editing, minimal set pieces, puppet flying saucers on the strings, non-professinal actors who just stand there and say the lines; there's also a narrator whose presence is absolutely unnecessary and who doesn't bring positively anything to the plot which is terrible anyway. I tried to see more in the story than laid on the surface but I couldn't - yes, there was a warning about bomb usage and how people could destroy the Earth by the flick of the switch but Mr Wood only tried to present it as something meaningful and failed miserably. Any movie, low budget or no budget, is supposed to be all about new ideas and getting people to think about something. During watching I thought only about when does this movie going to finally end.\nBut not everything was that bad. Bela Lugosi in his final role was amazing, especially at the beginning and the fact that he died during filming is clearly visible because of a stand-in actor whose face was always half covered with the cape - another thing that could have been handled better.\nThe score is the only thing I have nothing bad to say about: excellent music that creates the scary atmosphere and helps you get through to the end of the movie. So, is it that bad? Yes. But there are way worse pictures out there.",

Now, I'm not one of those people that give this movie a 10/10 because it's funny. That's just another way of saying it's bad, but entertaining. I've seen plenty of really terrible almost zero budget horror films like the Violent S**t series. And yes, it's called Violent S**t. Granted, I don't think those movies got commercial releases, and if they did it was straight to video. But there do exist movies much worse than this one. Especially other Ed Wood movies that are worse. It has an entertainment value like no other. There are movies made today like \"Devil\" and \"2012\" that have a big budget but no heart put into them. It might be just me, but when I watch this I can tell there was heart put into it. Little effort, and a very small budget, but still has heart. Does that alone make it good, not really. But with the aid of other things,it helps.The story, though not well done, is creative. And even if you watch the movie with a serious mindset it isn't boring. If you look at the average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie it really isn't that great a film. The acting is mediocre, the story is usually unoriginal, and there are several other things wrong with it. But many people love them because they're still entertaining as all hell. And that's the case with this movie in a wayThere are people that can't even sit through this whole movie because they think it's so bad. And I really think that's sad. If I can sit through a movie shot on Super 8 then you can sit through this. A lot movies that came out at the time of this movie were B movies with a high camp value and no effort that people didn't say two things about. Maybe they were more forgettable. And isn't that what really makes a movie bad; being forgettable? Being so boring that no one ever payed any attention to it. If this were the worst movie of all time people wouldn't still be talking about it. And there are plenty of Ed Wood films that people never talk about that are much worse than this one.There really is a thin line between famous and infamous. People just don't realize it.All I can say is, it's not really bad. If I were surfing channels and saw it was one I'd watch it. It's entertaining. It's a fun movie. And whether intentional or not it's funny at times. Need I really say more? Just my take on it...",

On the other hand, if you are so cool and so good in discovering any movies weakness and every leak of special effects that even the major 21st century Hollywood movies hardly get to you anymore,you will surely find a lot to complain about in this one.

            "content": "The infamous \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" was initially conceived as \"Grave Robbers from Outer Space\" until writer-editor-producer-director Ed Wood found financing for his masterpiece from Baptist minister J. Edward Reynolds (it took a meat packing executive to help him complete \"Bride of the Monster\"). Wearing his Dracula cape for what was intended for \"The Vampire's Tomb,\" the late Bela Lugosi is shown emerging from the woods in three different shots, then skulking about someone's back door, while we first see him mourning at the funeral of his late wife before leaving his home one last time (this was actually the residence of Tor Johnson). If this was all the footage in the can that Wood had filmed for other projects, 3 silent minutes of a shattered Lugosi performance, then he must be congratulated for making certain the public would see it, billed above John Breckinridge and Lyle Talbot as 'Special Guest Stars.' Local television celebrities Vampira (as Vampire Girl) and would be prognosticator Criswell make their presence felt early on, the latter narrating off screen when necessary, while the former horror hostess appears very much in costume playing Lugosi's deceased wife, the first corpse to rise from the dead through alien means, Plan 9 to be exact (no light is shed on how the previous 8 fared). This may have been the first occasion when extraterrestrials brought back the living dead, two years before John Carradine's \"Invisible Invaders,\" and over a decade before radiation was suggested in George Romero's Pittsburgh classic \"Night of the Living Dead.\" Wood's story holds together as well as \"Bride of the Monster,\" Gregory Walcott a headstrong pilot, former Western star Tom Keene assigned by Lyle Talbot's General to investigate flying saucers over Los Angeles, Duke Moore's Lieutenant in charge with the demise of Tor Johnson's Inspector Clay. The cemetery next to Walcott's home is a hive of activity, Dudley Manlove as Eros and Joanna Lee as Tanna the concerned invaders fearing the worst from mankind's acquisition of greater power in the wake of the hydrogen bomb. Far too entertaining to be erroneously labeled 'worst movie ever made,' plenty of quotable lines since exhausted from overuse, and Wood's all too real sincerity in the face of nuclear annihilation, younger viewers such as Joe Dante may have scoffed at its dirt cheap production values but no other director could have achieved so much with so little.",

Friedberg and Seltzer), and I actually consider Plan 9 one of my favourite \"bad\" films.Yes, the acting is amateur and full to the brim with overacting. Yes, the sets are wobbly. Yes, the special effects are crude, especially the use of hub-caps for flying saucers. And yes, the stock footage can be messy. However, I do find it entertaining, because the film does have some truly funny dialogue(decide for yourself if and when you see it whether it is intentional or not) and some interesting shots of Bela Lugosi(and the fake body double). Also Ed Wood Jnr does direct with heart, and the film moves briskly and doesn't feel too long or too short.So overall, a guilty pleasure and not a bad way to spend 75 or so minutes. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

There are so many unintentionally hilarious scenes, that one hardly knows where to begin. Let's start with Lugosi. Somehow, he does not look like your typical Long Island houseowner; his European cape is strangely not in sync with the rest of the community. The gravedigger scene is very funny as well. How cheap are the people in this community with their loved one's graves? A cheap wooden cross instead of a headstone? That is pretty cheap; but not as cheap as the sets in this film. Ed Wood, bless his soul, does a masterful job of ruining every scene with horrendous props. I love the curtains separating the pilots of an airliner from the passengers that we never see. Great security. Remind me not to travel on that airline. But this is not the only place with curtains. The pilot's home (even though he lives outside with his wife) has curtains outside the home. I have never seen this decor before. Even the spaceship has curtains. The people who made curtains as props for this film made a fortune.I think that The Price is Right must have the director's favorite TV show. (What's behind curtain number two?). The cast had two major problems; very few of them knew how to drive a car. Two of them put the cars in reverse before driving. Two others leave the lights after leaving the car. Another problem area for both the police and the aliens are their weapons. They don't seem to work. The aliens are forced to flee when their microwave oven catches fire. This is perfectly understandable. There is also a very fat man who wanders around looking for food and a scantily-dressed woman who doesnt change her clothes for four days and can be smelled from over 100 yards away. This film is not half-baked; it not even in the oven. But it very funny to watch.",

More than just being bad, it is an object of study for any apprentice filmmaker, because almost everything that could go wrong actually went wrong.The problems begin with Ed Wood's utterly incompetent direction. My cat is the best movie director. Inattentive, careless and incapable, Wood simply lets everyone else do their jobs at their own risk. Wood doesn't seem to be concerned with any question of continuity (days and nights seem to happen at random, props appear and disappear several times), he allows us to calmly see the filming material (cameras, microphones, light equipment, etc.) until the cardboard headstones in his cemetery fall, so obviously fake it's incredible they were used in a movie. And I'd rather not mention the flying saucers, which are obviously children's toys hanging from transparent threads, probably maneuvered by fishing rods!The script is, of course, another problem, giving us one of the most fanciful and clearly false stories that science fiction has ever seen: unpleasantly mixing vampires, undead and aliens, we feel that we just need to find Tarzan, Donald Duck, two or three cowboys and a family from Minnesota on vacation, having a barbecue in the cemetery. The imagination is the limit! And the dialogue? The film is an unstoppable source of jokes and memorable phrases, the result of the childish and idiotic way in which everything was written.The cast brings together a series of names well known to most of the public, not because they are good actors, but because they have played important and notable roles at certain moments. This is the case of Maila Nurmi, the eternal Vampira, who doesn't say a single word and does little more than stare at us and the other characters. Even without opening his mouth to utter a sound, this is undoubtedly one of the most iconic films of this actress, in one of the most remarkable \"personas\" of her career. The friendly Tor Johnson is also here, with his unmistakable look that made him a striking figure in the cheap horror movies of this era. Bela Lugosi had his last film appearance in this film. Invariably wrapped in his aristocratic vampire cape, which immortalized him and in which he would later be buried, he died during filming, having been very skillfully replaced by another man, who hides his face with the cape so that it is not so evident that they are two different people.",

Horror star Bela Lugosi died halfway through filming, probably of acute embarrassment, but Wood didn't let that inconvenience stop him - he just used a stand-in who covered his face with a cape for the rest of the film.The cheapness of the production is evident in almost every scene, from the hilarious airplane cockpit comprising of a curtain, two chairs and some plywood controls, to the wobbly 'hubcap' flying saucers suspended on pieces of string, to the alien's spaceship which features velvet curtains and ladders inside and out. Stock footage of military airplanes is used to pad out the run-time.It's hard to say who is the worst performer: Tor Johnson and Vampira are terrible as reanimated bodies under the control of the aliens, but at least they're supposed to be lifeless; the rest of the cast has no such excuse. For your consideration: Gregory Walcott as 'fists first, talk later' pilot Jeff Trent, weird soothsayer Criswell as the narrator, and Duke Moore as the cop who scratches his head with the barrel of his gun and delivers this priceless piece of dialogue - 'One thing's sure... Inspector Clay's dead. Murdered.

While some fans maintain that \"Glen Or Glenda\" is Ed Wood's crowning achievement, I find Plan 9 from Outer Space to be more spectacularly incompetent and a more enjoyable viewing experience. This film transcends the \"so bad, it's good\" genre like few films before or after it. Plan 9 from Outer Space is so bad, it's utterly brilliant.Plan 9 from Outer Space, like most of Ed Wood's magical output, is either pilloried or praised for its technical incompetence. The film is indeed a cinematic car crash when it comes to matters such as attention to detail, continuity and special effects. However, the exuberance, joy and unrelenting sense of fun that permeate Ed Wood's film-making is often overlooked and undervalued. This man was clearly too much of a visionary to be fussed about anything as trivial as a character holding a gun upside down or an actor reading directly from the script. Plan 9 from Outer Space is a lot of things but boring isn't one of them.The plot is pure sci-fi fluff. Shortly after flying saucers begin appearing in the sky, bodies start to disappear from the local cemetery. It seems that the aliens are re-animating corpses to use as tools against the human race when they invade Earth - not out of spite, mind you, but due to their overwhelming concern that humans could blow up the sun. This is unfortunate for Jeff and Paula, who happen to live next door to the zombie infested graveyard. Ludicrous as it is, this plot is no more outlandish than any number of B-grade movies. What makes Plan 9 from Outer Space stand out from the crowd is the execution - take a bow, Mr Wood! It would be exhausting to sift through the plethora of goofs, gaffs and mind-boggling mistakes that litter this film. However, some are so outstanding that they demand individual recognition. The first blindingly obvious faux pas is the fishing line which clearly suspends the flying saucers. This is only the beginning of an avalanche of blissful incompetence. There is the infamous Bela Lugosi cameo, which was filmed before the script was even written. After Bela's death, Ed Wood had no qualms about using his wife's chiropractor to take over the role - despite the man being a head taller and considerably slimmer than the great Lugosi. In addition to these sublime blunders, there is the detective who mistakenly points a gun at himself, John Breckinridge's shameless script reading - which results in The Ruler not being able to look at the camera or his fellow actors and the blatantly obvious use of a sound stage for a cemetery, not to mention the cardboard set that doubles as an aeroplane cockpit. This is only scratching the surface.The most amazing thing about Plan 9 from Outer Space is not Ed Wood's ambivalence to detail but the fact that this ambivalence never detracts from the film's overall enjoyment. Plan 9 from Outer Space works spectacularly well as science fiction entertainment. The mix of action, unintentional comedy, spectacular ineptitude and camp special effects is intoxicating. The film is well paced and, in its own unique way, strangely logical. There is also the joy of watching Bela Lugosi's final film role (well, until the chiropractor takes over!) and a rare glimpse of the magnificent Vampira at the height of her Gothic loveliness. Plan 9 from Outer Space is an unmitigated pleasure from beginning to end.This film belongs in IMDb's top 250, and I'm sure if people rated films based on the enjoyment factor as opposed to any pretentious conception of artistic quality, it would be. In any case, I'm sure Ed Wood would be pleased to discover that almost 10,000 viewers have taken the time to vote for Plan 9 from Outer Space, which greatly exceeds the impact of many 1950s \"classics\", ranging from Bergman's \"Wild Straeberries\" to Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\".",

And to think this was conceived without the reported aid of any hallucinogen.He had to have an imagination just to have made a feature film after the death of his star. What you saw in Tim Burton's Ed Wood is quite true. Wood filmed some scenes with Bela Lugosi, recently discharged from a sanitarium only days before Bela died. Did that stop Wood? Not a bit, though I wonder what the original film might have been if Bela had lived and done the whole thing.Instead Bela had a stand in with a cape over his face and the dead Mr. Lugosi along with Vampira and Tor Johnson became the walking dead of Plan 9 From Outer Space. Now what were these zombies walking around for. Merely to get our attention, the governments of the people of Earth particularly the American government.Why the aliens who are controlling the zombies want our attention. Because we're a people who likes to blow things up and we're about to discover something that will blow it all up and I do mean the universe.

Yet in all the horrible special effects and laughable dialog, poor Ed Wood combat soldier from the Pacific theater in World War II was actually trying to say something about disarmament. The man just didn't have the talent to pull it off. But he did create purportedly the worst film ever made. I guess that's an achievement of a lifetime.",

I'm a fan of this film and never fail to laugh at its ridiculous characters, dialogue, sets and acting. If a modern director could make a movie like this it would be a huge campy hit. Director Edward D. Wood Jr. didn't intend to make a comedy but he's given us some of the funniest scenes and characters ever filmed. It would be impossible to intentionally make a movie as funny as Plan 9 from Outer Space. Pick any character; they're all equally ridiculous. Tor Johnson, Swedish ex-wrestler, as Inspector Daniel Clay. \"I'm a big boy now Johnny.\"Dudley Manlove as Eros the alien who gives the side splitting Solaranite speech. \"Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun. Now, you spread a thin line of it to a ball, representing the earth...\"The stand-in for Bela Lugosi who appears holding a cape over his face so no one will notice. (Lugosi died after filming only a few scenes.)John Breckenridge, the effeminate alien ruler, who at one point reads his lines directly from a script he is holding. \"Plan 9? Ah, yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead. Long distance electrodes shot into the pineal and pituitary gland of the recently dead.\"Criswell as the narrator. \"Greetings, my friends. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future.\" Vampira, the TV monster movie show hostess, as a zombie who doesn't speak. All the sets are ridiculous. The infamous airplane cockpit with two chairs and a curtain. The inside of the alien ship with a table and assorted radio parts. The alien ruler's desk complete with pen set. The graveyard where headstones routinely fall over. The pie plate flying saucers on wires. You'll either fall asleep during this movie or you'll enjoy making fun of it, probably depending on your mood. See it with friends and get ready to ridicule it.Forget the other Ed Wood films. They are really boring and not funny. Instead, rent Tim Burton's Ed Wood after you've seen Plan 9. You'll appreciate what Burton has done.",

Misplaced props, bad lighting, continuity errors, implausible dialogue, almost a training film on how NOT to make a film.Edward D. Wood Jr. had ambition, vision, determination, charisma and imagination. What he didn't have was talent. Instead of being shunned by the world's film aficionados, he has been posthumously embraced as a \"holy fool\" of cinema. One whose sincere efforts came out horribly twisted to the point of absurdity.Yes, the spaceship looks as if it came from an IKEA catalog, the acting is so wooden you risk splinters, the plot and continuity has holes you can pilot a battleship through and the production vales are so threadbare, it makes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT look like STAR WARS.

PLAN 9 is so bad, so ineptly made and so awful that it might just be the very best film to watch with friends--even more than MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. Watching it solo is fine, but with friends you can delight in spotting all the inept and stupid mistakes Ed Wood made in creating this film. Some good examples are spotting the cardboard tombstone getting knocked over accidentally in the cemetery, seeing how Bela Lugosi goes from an old and tired man to a tall guy with a cape draped over his face to \"cleverly\" hide the fact that Lugosi died before principle filming began, and noticing the strings that suspend the metal pie plate UFOs in the sky!!! There are just so many silly and stupid moments and dialog that it must be seen to be fully enjoyed.

This classic film with errors and a low budget is arguably Ed Wood's best film I love the story, the acting, knowing that Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, and Vampira are in the same film, the special effects, and every else that the film has to offer! For starters the acting by all of the actors is actually very good in My opinion especially by the invaders. Lugosi performs excellently as well and I just love it that he is dressed as Count Dracula once again! Big Tor Johnson also has a great performance and he really looks awesome and the same goes for Vampira! Now for the hilarious things about the film. The space ships look really rather different but when they land they look OK. The dialog at times seems silly but the conversations between people are good. The narration by Criswell is good. The music is excellent. The direction by Ed Wood is actually good. The film is great for many reasons in My opinion. This is one of those treasures that are so bad its excellent. If you love low budget films that are extremely bad but are hilarious, and want to see a spookyish flick that is good to watch around Halloween time and any time if you want to laugh for a hour and a half then I strongly recommend that you buy this masterpiece Plan 9 from Outer Space! today!",

Having \"seen\" the hilarious making of Plan 9 while watching Ed Wood meant watching the real Plan 9 was immensely enjoyable, as you could pick up on all the arcane humour from Tim Burton's great film.Be sure to watch the documentary \"Flying Saucers over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion\" which is on the Plan 9 DVD. While it probably rates as the worst documentary of all time (bad sound, bad lighting, bad jokes, and more...) it has interviews with the real Vampira and other cast and crew from Plan 9.

Both were made more for the enjoyment and wish fulfillment of the director and writer than for the full quality of the film. I'll try to explain. Both films are basically an atrocity as far as films are. The dialog in both films is ridiculous. The acting in both films is ridiculous. The script in both films is horrendous. BUT, we still love the films. I find them both hilarious. Let me go over some of the things I liked about plan 9.The trashcan covers posing as ufos. With visible strings. The Bela Lugosi \"standin\" who is obviously not Bela Lugosi and keeps his face covered. The dumb dumb dialog. Gems such as Stupid Stupid!!! The so so fake turbulence in the cockpit of the plane in the beginning of the film when the \"ufo\" is first sighted.I'm sure Ed Wood's films got canned when they were first released, just like Freddy Got Fingered got canned, but you can say what you want. Ed Wood and Tom Green have this in common : They got their film made. It's what they wanted to do. They went against the grain to do a film that they knew would hardly win any Oscars but they had fun in the process.

            "content": "Bela Lugosi is mostly remembered nowadays due to his contributions to the horror genre. He portrayed the infamous Count Dracula in the classic 1930s film based on Bram Stoker's classic book. To most people, this is the extent of their knowledge about Lugosi. He was in Dracula and that's basically all, but this is not the case. The very last movie Lugosi was in is this one, which will probably be remembered as unfortunate by most. This movie is almost universally panned and is today considered one of the worst films of all time. The ones who say this are forgetting something. While the movie is pretty bad, it's bad in an endearing kind of way. The horrendous special effects (dangling UFOs on visible strings) as well as less than professional acting will no doubt be hilarious to most viewers. Essentially being the epitome of \"so bad that it's good\", Plan 9 starts out confidently enough. At first glance, the film doesn't seem half bad. It begins with an old man accompanied by some people in a cemetery who are grieving about someone that died. A UFO then lands nearby and drops off a zombie which kills everyone but the old man. The latter is later killed after a car hits him. At his burial, the corpses of the people killed by the alien zombie are discovered, so a man named Daniel goes off to find answers. Meanwhile Jeff and Paula (a couple) hear a loud noise which is followed by the appearance of more alien zombies, one of which is the old man from earlier. By now, the army is beginning to take notice of the extraterrestrial happenings and they try to blow UFOs out of the sky with missiles and anti aircraft batteries. We then finally get introduced to the alien's perspective, and onboard one of their spaceships, we're told that they've been unsuccessful in negotiating with the governments of sovereign nations on earth. Daniel has also been turned into one of the zombies. Eros, the alien leader, tells his underlings to initiate \"Plan 9\", meaning they want to bring humans back from the dead and turn them against their own kind. Ironically, this whole scheme is being enacted because the aliens believe humanity is a threat to the universe due to their tendency to fight each other and invent new and more destructive ways to do so. Humanity wasn't satisfied with inventing normal explosives, so they made atomic bombs, then hydrogen bombs, and someday, even an antimatter device that makes a nuke look like a firecracker might be possible. The aliens are simply going to keep raising armies of undead humans to cause havoc until earth listens to their demands. Eventually, the cops, Paula and Jeff are allowed into the alien ship Eros is in. He says humans can't be trusted having access to such destructive technology, and if they continue along the path they've chosen, they will soon discover solaronite; a chemical that is able to explode sunlight on a subatomic level. A bomb using this technology would cause a huge chain reaction between all the trillions of stars in the universe, killing everyone and everything. The aliens already have their minds made up, and still intend to destroy earth to ensure the universe's safety. Following a brief fight, the humans manage to escape the UFO shortly before Eros takes off, but the spacecraft explodes and the alien menace is shattered. The reason I mention Bela Lugosi in the beginning is because he technically does appear in this movie, but in a very minor part. There is a short piece of footage of him walking in a graveyard with a black cape. The footage comes from a cancelled project called The Vampire's Tomb which had to be shelved when Bela died. Ed Wood used the footage for Plan 9 to show how the old man (Lugosi's character) comes back from the dead after he is killed. Other than Lugosi's cameo, there really isn't much reason to watch this movie other than enjoy how bad it is. The storyline isn't that bad in itself, but it bears a strong resemblance to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both these movies feature aliens that are willing to destroy humanity in order to prevent the destruction of the universe. The only difference is Plan 9 actually shows the aliens attempting to carry out their plan. If you haven't watched this movie, I would say it is worth it just because it takes itself so seriously. The special effects are godawful and even in the 50s they looked bad. That doesn't mean they're any less hilarious to look at. Plan 9 From Outer Space may be a horrible excuse for professional cinema, but it's a lot of fun and will always be given attention by true sci-fi fans. Whether this attention is good or bad is for you to decide. I really should have been angry at this movie for being so horrible, but it was so fundamentally inept that it ended up being a masterpiece.",

The alien Leader (John \"Bunny\" Breckinridge) had Bela's reanimated corpse destroyed, in order to strike fear in the humans, as opposed to some world leaders, who would have called for more troops. In the world of Plan 9, such outdated concepts as day and night, the living and the dead, and original footage and stock footage, have no meaning. But I have yet to reveal the true greatness of this movie.The alien Eros (Dudley Manlove) explains that his mission on Earth is to destroy us before we develop the Solaranite bomb. His metaphorical explanation of the Solaranite bomb is chilling. \"Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun. Now, you spread a thin line of it to a ball, representing the earth. Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles. Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight. Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the earth, back along the line of gasoline to the can, or the sun itself. It will explode this source and spread to every place that gasoline, our sunlight, touches. Explode the sunlight here, gentlemen, you explode the universe!\" America, Russia and China were all working on developing a Solaranite bomb when this movie was released. All work on that was stopped, and all records were destroyed, shortly afterward. To quote Criswell, \"Can you prove that it didn't happen?\"",

Not only do we get Bela Lugosi appearing in a film three years after his death but we've also got the lovable Tor Johnson getting stuck in his grave, day to night back to day scenes, aliens who seem to be rejects from a TV show and lets not forget the funning looking flying saucers that wobble every time they're seen.

I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said, except, yes, the movie is bungled down to the last jot and tittle. But I do have to hand it to Wood's perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit. No matter how many screw-ups, he plowed on and on and on. I do wonder if he was generally indifferent to the gaffes, didn't notice them, or couldn't afford the film for re-shoots. Whatever, the reason, we've got 80-minutes that we can all laugh at, feel superior to, and be entertained by. That really does take some doing in a weird way.

            "content": "Plan 9 has become something of a cult classic ever since it was voted the worst movie of all time by the Golden Turkey awards, and it's director, Ed Wood, the worst director of all time. But does it really deserve this?The answer, in short, is YES and NO. Being something of a sucker for cheap fifties and sixties B movies I couldn't resist picking this movie up recently, and I'm glad I did. Perhaps it's just me, but I really did enjoy it! Yes, the dialogue is awful, yes the sets are cheap, yes the special effects are laughable and yes, the acting is as wooden as the movie's fake grave stones, but it still posesses a certain charm. Edward D. Wood Jr put his heart and soul into this movie. He saw it as his own Citizen Kane. and didn't let the fact that he had no talent get in the way.This movie is also famous for featuring the final appearance of the legendary Bela Lugosi, who died before Wood had properly started shooting. With only a few silent shots of Lugosi to base his film around he used his wife's chiropractor as a stand in. He looks thoroughly unconvincing as he stalks the graveyard with his face cloaked, trying to disguise the fact that he was taller and thinner than Lugosi. Wood cheerfully cuts between shots of the two with no thought for continuity.Wood also uses stock footage of military engagements with abandon, intercut with flying saucers on strings posing their latest   threat to humanity (Their other eight attempts failed, hence the title). With his band of Hollywood misfits and cast-offs, including TV regulars Vampira and Criswell, he tried to create something that would make a mark on the film world and that people would remember for years to come. Although Wood was ignored by Hollywood and eventually died penniless he has now achieved that fame and immortality he so desperately yearned for, even if it is for all the wrong reasons. Hollywood has certainly produced a lot of movies over the years that could equally qualify for Worst Movie Ever.",

            "content": "Needless to say, this movie's reputation preceded it. In all honesty, I hadn't even heard of it until I read the Medved brothers' book \"The Golden Turkey Awards\". It was listed as \"The Worst Movie of All-Time\" with its director, Edward D. Wood, Jr., receiving the \"Worst Director of All-Time\" honors. With credentials like that, of course I just HAD to see it. I got my chance later that year when a local theater had \"Golden Turkey\" night. PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was part of a triple-bill with ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES and ROBOT MONSTER. I actually think KILLER TOMATOES is a good movie (and will go to my grave defending it). ROBOT MONSTER, which I had seen before, turned out to be the highlight (or, in this case, would it be the \"lowlight\") of the evening. It is far worse than PLAN 9, however, that does not absolve PLAN 9 of its cinematic sins. There's the bad acting, the bargain-basement set designs, the \"el cheapo\" special effects (or should that be \"defects\") and, of course, the haphazard direction courtesy of Wood. The \"Plan 9\" of the movie's title (after the failure of the other eight plans to conquer the world) is the resurrection of the recently deceased. This includes a woman who looks like the Fifties version of Elvira (Vampira, who once sued Elvira for copyright infringement), a murdered police detective (the mammoth Tor Johnson) and the vampire woman's husband. He is played by the legendary Bela Lugosi, a long way from Dracula. Hell, he's a long way from SCARED TO DEATH. This is the infamous film in which footage of Lugosi in his Dracula costume was shot before the film's release, but Lugosi died before more film could be shot. Thus, Wood used his chiropractor, Dr. Tom Mason, to fill in for Bela. Never mind that Mason is about a good six inches taller than Lugosi with a different hairstyle. As long as Mason holds a cape in front of his face, we're not supposed to notice the difference between the two men. It doesn't work. This zombie trio is controlled by aliens Eros (Dudley Manlove) and Tana (Joanna Lee), whose acting isn't much different than that of the undead. The heroes are led by intrepid airline pilot Trent (Greg Walcott) and Gen. Roberts (the inimitable Lyle Talbot). As bad as PLAN 9 is, there is one thing that I found interesting: that the aliens make mention of God. Though I am an atheist, I think it raises a good matter of discussion about whether beings from other planets know of Him and what do they call Him. However, I think this was added by Wood in order to get the funding from the Baptist church. Still, that is the one rose that rises from this trash heap of a movie. But, if you think of it as a \"comedy\", you might get some enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, you'll feel, as Eros would put it, \"That you of Earth are idiots!\".",

            "content": "This film's reputation has long preceded it and due to this you may be disappointed when viewing this awful cheap science fiction film. Yes, it is badly made in almost every sense and this makes it highly watchable, but it's hardly the so-bad-it's-good masterpiece that most people proclaim it to be. Instead, it's a laughable and derivative alien invasion flick which makes the most out of a small set filled with cardboard gravestones and some incredibly hokey-looking flying saucers which wobble about all over the screen.If you're looking for some of the poorest special effects ever witnessed, look no further. Or how about a talent less cast of non-actors and actresses who find it hard to keep a straight face? Ed Wood did well to assemble a few familiar faces to give it that cult appeal, including strangely beautiful zombie woman Vampira, phoney psychic Criswell, Swedish meathead Tor Johnson, who visibly struggles with his dialogue, and aged horror star Bela Lugosi in what was to be his final role. Except the joke is that Lugosi was only around to shoot a few shots in a graveyard, so a stunt-double is employed for most of the film, walking around with his cape up over his face to disguise his identity. The trouble is, this doesn't fool anybody for a second! Poor Lugosi gets dissolved into a skeleton in one of the film's frequently ludicrous - and thereby hilarious - scenes.The one thing I liked about this film was Tor Johnson's appearance as a zombie, which was pretty scary looking. Otherwise it's abysmal all the way: a nonsensical plot, a lack of pacing and storyline, an inability to decide whether to play it straight or for laughs all help to relegate it to the dustbin of movie history. The sets are cheap and unbelievable and the special effects look like they were created by a four year old. This film has to be seen due to it's reputation, but it's pretty disappointing in the end and lacks the unintentional humour which often makes a so-bad-it's-good classic. This is just plain weird.",

Taken as that, you can sit back and enjoy the inept acting, direction and staging of every scene--a film obviously filmed on a shoestring budget and directed by the infamously untalented Ed Wood, Jr. If you saw ED WOOD with Johnny Depp, you'll have a special fondness for this atrociously put together film. You'll probably enjoy every minute of it! Worst performers of all are VAMPIRA and THOR, although they have competition in that department from most of the cast. Only LYLE TALBOT as General Roberts and GREOGRY WALCOTT (the male lead, as Jeff) give what can be called professional performances. The rest of the cast sounds like they're reading their lines for the first and last time.The outlandish plot has aliens devising their ninth plan to control the earth by raising the dead and controlling them to destroy the evil earth people by some sort of advanced computerized system. BELA LUGOSI's footage consists of a few glimpses of him walking around in a graveyard while most of the other shots have an actor wearing a black cape subbing for Lugosi who died during production.There's a certain creepy atmosphere to all of the graveyard scenes enveloped by mist and dark lighting and amusement in watching VAMPIRA and THOR go through their paces with hands and arms outstretched, but the film is actually not as much fun as I anticipated. Too many of the scenes are played in a manner that takes itself too seriously and none of it is the least bit convincing. The acting, for the most part, is as cardboard as the sets.Summing up: Worth a look at least once, but hardly the camp classic that it has become. But by all means, watch Johnny Depp in ED WOOD.Trivia note: Some scenes will remind you of the \"Flash Gordon\" serial of the 1930s--especially the dialog.",

Soon after her dead husband (Bela Lugosi) also returns to life as the aliens in the flying saucer begin to carry out Plan 9, a last resort plan after peaceful attempts to contact Earth's governments were ignored in which they intend to bring the recently dead back to life to wipe out all of humanity to protect the Universe from our destructive ways & to prevent to creation of the Solaranite bomb that explodes sun beam particles & will wipe out the entire Universe if used. A local cop, Jeff the pilot & an Army Colonel (Tom Keene) are our last hope s they try to stop the aliens from destroying the world!Originally titled Grave Robbers from Outer Space the Baptist Ministers who funded the film vetoed it & was released as Plan 9 from Outer Space, edited & directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. this film is now generally regarded as the worst film ever made which I don't think it is, not by a long way but it all comes down to personal opinion I suppose. While Plan 9 from Outer Space is certainly an incompetent film on all levels how can I call a film I enjoyed watching & gained solid entertainment value from the worst film ever made? I can't. At only 78 minutes long at least it's fairly short, it moves along like a rocket & is an absolute laugh riot to watch. Call me insane but I quite enjoyed Plan 9 from Outer Space for what it is, a badly made mess of a sci-fi horror film but a hugely entertaining one with a certain charm & likability that is hard to ignore. The script is often hilarious, some of the dialogue has to be heard to be believed with classic lines like 'Visits? That would indicate visitors' or 'We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives' or 'Future events such as these will affect you in the future' & 'I don't like hearing noises, especially when there ain't supposed to be any' & the closing statement of 'Can you prove that it didn't happen?' just rounds things off perfectly & left me throughly amused considering the question that was just asked. The plot doesn't make any sense & it's hard to believe that these aliens could destroy the Earth using three zombies, having said that Plan 9 from Outer Space is undeniable fun & has a feel of something that was a labour of love for Ed Wood & he seems to be trying to get some sort of message across about the perils of war & atomic bombs along with Government cover-ups even if neither he or his cast & crew had the talent to pull it off properly.Technically Plan 9 from Outer Space is as inept & funny as it is conceptually, there are all sorts of continuity problems including it switching between day & night in the same scene several times, there are glaring boom mic shadow's, a cardboard crypt that has a door so small that everyone needs to bend down to enter or exit it, a so called graveyard at the start that looks like an empty field, the way cop's shoot at people approaching them without even saying anything first, sets that consist of black curtains, a plane set that is merely two chairs & a couple of paper steering wheels (the auto pilot also uses a candlestick phone to talk to the tower!), actor's knocking over headstones in the cemetery scenes, flying saucers that look like pie dishes & are clearly held up by strings & the expression on Tor Johnson's face when he is turned into a zombie is priceless. The whole film is just so funny on so many levels yet has a certain charm that I liked.With a supposed budget of about $60,000 the behind the scenes stories are just as fascinating as what ended up on screen, Bela Lugosi died a few days into filming & Ed Wood simply used a body double to complete his scenes & had him cover his face with his cape! Filmed in 1956, copyrighted in 1957 but not officially released until 1959. The acting is really bad, so bad it's fun to watch how badly & how wooden the actor's get. Horror hostess Vampira is quite striking but doesn't get any dialogue & her waist line is incredible, apparently it was only 17 inches.Plan 9 from Outer Space is the sort of film you have to see to be believed, I really liked it & thought it was throughly entertaining although it's hard to recommend as I can't say it's a good film at all but one that I enjoyed for all it's faults & it has many.

Shoestring production , in fact , while Tim Burton's Ed Wood was big-budgeted whose film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D.

Almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart Plan 9 from Outer Space and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as the statuesque Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King .The picture was absurdly and ridiculously directed by Ed Wood with abundant failures , shortfalls and flaws , in fact the sets are made of cardboard and often bumped into by the stars and the dialogue incredibly moronic and without sense .

If the aforementioned three directors were really, really AWESOME, Ed Wood was really, really AWFUL. He showed a genius in making one of the most awful movie in cinematic history. Nobody else can make such a bad movie. If a mediocre, average person like I made a movie, I will just make a mediocre movie. I can never make a movie which is so bad. One needs a genius of Ed Wood's calibre to make such a bad movie. This is like taking an exam made up of one hundred multiple choice questions. An intelligent or genius student will get 90+ to 100% correct. Even though one has never studied the topic covered in the exam, one will, by statistical chance, get some of the questions correct. One needs a real effort and genius to get everything wrong. Ed Wood is such a genius. He got everything WRONG, WRONG, WRONG in this movie. One needs a tremendous talent to get everything so wrong. His casting is incredibly bad. How can one choose Tor Johnson to be a movie actor? His dialog is so bad. Compared to Johnson, another muscle man turned actor, Arnold Schwarznegger, with his sometimes incomprehensible Teutonic English, sounds almost like a poetry reading by Sir Lawrence Olivier. And what is Vampira doing? Do you call that acting? Somebody said there are no bad actors. There are only bad directors. If that is true, Ed Wood is ba-a-a-a-d!! And who wrote this script? Even grade school kids can write better scripts. Does Ed Wood know what special effect is? I read that those flying saucers are paper plate spray-painted silver. They do look like paper plates spray-painted silver. Ed Woods' special effect makes some of the tackiest Godzilla movie look like masterpieces.Ed Wood seems to have no sense of continuity. That tall actor--really Ed Wood's chiropractor--who is supposed to be a stand-in for the deceased Bela Lugosi doesn't even look like Bela Lugosi even with his face hidden. The chiropractor is much too tall to stand in for Bela Lugosi. Even with all these amateurish film making, Ed Wood had the gall to release this movie. What a gutsy guy!! After Ed Wood screws up everything, the result is something deliciously tacky and fascinating. Many film schools analyze and teach works by Kurosawa and Bergman.

William Goldman once said something like \"making a movie requires hundreds of people to drag it into existence.\" I believe it. Making a movie is a herculean task. So many people must work so hard at so many different things that the fact that any get made at all is a miracle.So I salute writer/director Ed Wood for getting his script and his vision up there on the screen, and to do it with a legend like Bela Lugosi in it too!It's simply so unbelievable that anyone would put this together, and have the nerve to call it a finished movie. There's a couple of scenes set in a cockpit, and it's so obviously just two guys sitting on chairs with brooms in front of them that I marvel that Wood believed he could get away with it. But that's the charm! That Wood believed in the magic of cinema so much that he thought the big screen and audience imagination would make it work. What faith! What delusion!Film-makers often write low budget films about people having conversations in rooms because that's what they have access to but not Ed Wood! He wanted to make a movie about alien invasion, government conspiracies, and the dead coming back to life and he wasn't going to let no-talent and a budget of ten cent stop him.Like with Wiseau's movie, you have to enjoy Wood's effort with laughter, a bemused shake of the head, and a tremendous admiration for the audacity of their persistence.It might not be the effect Ed Wood was seeking to have but his movie is still being watched, and bringing joy, and I hope he'd be okay with that.",

I watched this expecting a terrible film that I would sit and laugh at, but really I just sat back and watched it. I didn't enjoy it but I didn't think it was as miserable as everyone has said. I found old horror films like Attack of the Giant Leeches or The Creeping Terror much worse and much more deserving of criticism. The directing and acting is no worse in Plan 9 than most of the other low budget horror/ sci-fi films of the time that I've seen, I'm just confused as to why this one got the spotlightDirecting, acting, writing etc, all are tolerable but it's just not bad enough or good enough to really enjoy that much. It's a little boring, but really, as I mentioned, it is tolerable.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless you are a big Ed Wood fan or you just want to see what all the fuss is about. 5/10",

Yes, it's completely inept on every level, but it's certainly not the worst move of all time, as it is frequently labeled. Hollywood produces dozens of truly godawful movies a year, most of which have hundreds of times the production resources of this...and yet, Ed Wood is so bloody charming in his clumsiness. Honestly, this movie is funnier to watch than most of the lowest-common-denominator driven comedies the studios churn out every year. Never mind that none of the laughs are intentional. This is a movie made by a man who wanted nothing more in his life than to make movies, and refused to let some little obstacle like the fact that his movies were the textbook examples of how NOT to make a film stop him.Is it inept? Oh yeah. Does it have the most awkward dialogue put on film? Almost certainly. Do actors forget their lines? Oh lordy yes.But is it the worst movie ever? No. It's just too damn earnest to hate. Give it a shot sometime when you need a good laugh.Favorite moment of unintentional humor: after Bela Lugosi's character gets run over by a car offscreen, the viewer can clearly see the shadow of him standing on the edge of the screen.

There, for this movie Plan 9 From Outer Space, came up the name Edward Wood Jr as the producer, director and writer. I had seen the movie Ed Wood a few years back and remembered it as the story about some guy with a tiny budget and little talent for making movies who was a genius at scrounging up money to make them, finding washed up movie actors and somehow getting theaters to show them. I didn't know this guy was real. He was real! In the movie Ed Wood finds Bella Ligosi as his one star he needs to lend credibility to his productions he makes. Bella Ligosi shuffles about in despair, realizing his career is over. And when you see Plan 9 From Outer Space, you can see why. Plan 9 From Outer Space is one of those movies Ed Wood made! It would have been much more meaningful for me to have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space before seeing the movie Ed Wood. But now that I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space it all makes more sense to me now. Both movies belong together as a set. Plan 9 From Outer Space captures the true cheesiness, the desperation and results of shoe string budgets, the lack of movie making skills and how those things all contributed to the basis of the plot upon which the movie Ed Wood was based. I think you will actually enjoy the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. It is so bad, it's good! And I know it will make you enjoy the movie Ed Wood even more.",

This film is sort of an honorable mention in my list of favorite parody films, though the funniest thing about the film is that it wasn't intentionally a parody, what's even funnier is that's what makes the film even funnier.This film has more blunders than the after take segment at the end of every Jackie Chan film; only those blunders were corrected the ones here weren't. Yeah this film has bad to almost non existent effects, but then again even a few episodes of shows like \"Doctor Who\" and even \"Star Trek\" had a few of their misses in that department but despite that it didn't stop those shows from being entertaining all the same. And even the writing isn't very good, proof reading/editing obviously wasn't one of Ed's strong suits.But all the same the end result it turned out to actually be really entertaining and that is really all I ask for and want whenever I watch a movie, to be entertained and have the time of my life which it does. The plot line I actually thought was good despite poor execution, but I thought Aliens reanimating the dead to create a zombie army is actually a cool and different idea because it's shows not just that you can still do more with the alien invasion subgenere but it was also a blending of two different genres horror and sci-fi; which made sense because both were a thing in the 50s.There really isn't much I can say for characters they all serve their function's (or function as best they can). Most of the acting is pretty well bad, most of the cast obviously weren't trained actors or haven't really taken any acting courses but you sense their hearts are in the right place and they really tried; and in a strange way it just contributes to the humor.But of coruse we're all in it for all the visual and verbal humor and this film is just a grocery list of it, so you'll hardly run out of laughs. There are just so many great funny moments, I'll just say a few of them.In a couple of scenes the timing is sometimes really off, like there was a couple talking outside at a back yard and then suddenly you see a spotlight just pass across and they would both get down but they did it seconds late about after the spotlight has long passed him.But the funniest scene of this was when we see the undead inspector creep up on the police man very slowly and then the police man turns around and delivers such a terrible acting reaction and then the undead inspector kills him (I think) by just slapping him down. I couldn't help but snicker on the fact the policeman had every opportunity to get away, let alone one or two long minutes.And of course the first scenes with a funeral that took place in a cemetery that is clearly see is fake; those grave markers you can see are wooden and too small almost looks like a Gnome Cemetery, and we see a Crypt and everyone getting out of it. I just crack up every time I see it because it's sort of like the equivalent of seeing clowns getting out of the clown car.The dialog is just fraking hilarious because it is just so deliciously bad, as I said before editing wasn't one of Ed's strong suits. There are just so many memorable lines, one that is my favorite is the alien commander saying, \"You stupid minds, stupid, stupid!\" I always thought that was funny because that sounded like something some second or third grader would say. Overall, if your a fan of old vintage sci-fi or even the parody subgenere then this film like any of the paper plate saucers in this film is worth a spin. It may have been a flawed plan but it was a plan that succeeded in fun.Rating: 3 stars",

            "content": "From what I understand and from hints in the movie \"Ed Wood\" by Tim Burton, Ed Wood created this movie based on the last footage he ever shot of Bela Lugosi. I recently just watched the colorized version, which adds a lot more dimension to the film. All I can say is the dialog in this film is superior to many recent films, especially Star Wars Episodes 1-III.Basically Ed Wood's premise for this film was superior for 1953, he just lacked the resources to make it well. He blended in Stock Footage with his framing story well and his editing was actually rather good. The parts he shot himself have good audio and decent film grade, so it's not really that shoddy. And it is also LIT well. This is one of the earliest true Zombie movies ever made.And when it comes right down to content, some of Ed Wood's \"Science\" - It's not really that implausible compared to other films where I had to stretch my imagination, I can suspend disbelief due to how the \"Ruler of the Galaxy\" and the other aliens explain the mechanism they are using to raise the great Tor Johnson from the dead and remote-control his body- And then \"Waporise\" him later.Wood, like Hitchcock before him, knew how to not show something to get the same effect as showing it, and it works here- We don't see Bela Logosi's Ghoul getting vaporized, but we easily see that it happened. The same trick was used in \"Seven Men from now\" by Bud Beotticher- in the light-speed gunfight between Lee Marvin and Randolph Scott, Randolph Scott is shown to have an amazing quick-draw speed, simply by not showing him drawing his gun. Wood uses that same Fakery in this film.What is amazing is that I can see two guys in Pilots's uniform sitting in a obvious cardboard set, but you BELIEVE they are flying an Airplane.I don't consider Wood as a great director, he was adequate. He was better than some directors of today that get handed billion dollar projects on a regular basis. If this film had been adequately funded, it would have been another \"Forbidden Planet\"- But only if Wood had stuck to writing and producing it, and not also directing.I have to admire the gall of Wood, and in the movie \"Ed Wood\", he seems to have the same kind of friends I have, and that he befriended Bela when nobody in Hollywood would even talk to him, shows what kind of person he really was.This film literally \"Marries\" Lugosi to 50's LA Horror host \"Vampira\", so from the time this film was released forward, the two have been synonymous.This also marks the film with possibly the most lines spoken by Tor Johnson, who was a great Character actor in his own right. His \"Inspector Clay\" - Well, I believed him- It's not his usual kind of part, which was why it worked.So, when people say \"How can anyone rate this a 10/10\", I don't think they really comprehend how difficult it is to get Films funded and produced, especially when you are handed a \"reputation\" by an industry that is not fair in how those reputations are meted out.Somebody SHOULD remake this today and add Plans 1 through 8.",

The logo on the uniforms looked like what king Arthur's knight's of the round table would wear. I suppose what really made this film famous was Bela Lugosi's death during the production and the poor attempt to replace him with a screen double (poor Ed Wood couldn't re-shoot the scenes, he was already over budget!).

Producer Ed Wood, who has become a legend in recent years due to this film a choice few others of his making, actually was more of a salesman than a showman. Back in 1956 he raised $60,000 to make PLAN 9, which in today's market would equal close to a half million dollars! Not a bad haul, and considering that he did not die a rich man, he undoubtedly was a very honest person who put everything he had into a dream. The story behind this film would have made a better movie than the dang movie itself! Legend has it that Wood raised money for his project through a variety of rather ingenious ways. Undoubtedly, in exchange for rent, he cast his landlord in the film in a bit part as well as his church pastor, who used church money to finance the production and probably hoped to get a little publicity out of the deal. Some of the actors who appeared in PLAN 9 \"invested\" in the production as well. Interesting stuff. And when you come down to it, had any other producer been in his shoes (and there were certainly a few others), you can bet that their \"work\" would probably have been not much better. It's a campy movie with some good scenes and some bad scenes, with a combination of sci fi and horror elements that somehow, someway get your attention and seem to stay with you!! Bottom line, don't be too hard on a guy who was trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood where money, and lots of it, is the bottom line.

It adds a whole new fourth dimension to this pile of crap and makes it worth watching for the first time. It's as hilarious as ever, some of the smart ass American witticisms flying over my head, but beautiful cynicism when they do connect. They maybe sounded a little cruel regarding Bela's heroin addiction, but only compared to their put-downs of the rest of the useless cast.

Not when \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\", \"The Incredible Petrified World\", and \"She Gods of Shark Reef\" all occupy a space on this planet. I've been giving this a lot of thought, and for my money, a movie can only be truly bad when you can't even find the wherewithal to make fun of it. On that score, Plan 9 succeeds wildly, and it's your loss if you miss an opportunity to see it. And you know something else, buried deep in the plot of the story is the germ of an idea that maybe Earthlings have gotten a little too big for their britches and have become a bit too dangerous to be part of the galaxy. Trouble is, the concept was done right eight years earlier in a masterpiece of sci-fi fiction - \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\".So I guess that leaves the goofy stuff. Like when General Roberts (Lyle Talbot) explains to Colonel Edwards (Tom Keene) that the government's official position on flying saucers is that they don't exist. Yet earlier, we saw an Army Officer in charge of Saucer Field Artillery. It's the kind of oxymoronic thinking one would expect from military intelligence.You know, it was kind of curious to me that the female alien's name was Tanna, since Plan 9 had to deal with resurrecting the dead to take over the Earth. The entire series of Universal Studios' 'Mummy\" franchise dealt with the power of tana leaves to reanimate the title character. Coincidence? - I wonder.My favorite line from the movie - Paula Trent (Mona McKinnon) to her pilot husband Jeff (Gregory Walcott) - \"Now toddle off and fly your flying machine...\" Speaking of the Trent's, where exactly did they live anyway? When Bela Lugosi's stand-in comes calling in the middle of the night, she runs out of the house and is smack in the middle of a cemetery! That's kind of creepy, don't you think? The film though did give me something to ponder rather seriously. There's a line in the picture where someone states - \"People who can think are so scared of people who cannot\"; he was talking about The Dead.

You sure are - Unless, of course, you're a total grouch, that is.Like its spooky graveyard setting of cardboard headstones that wobble in the breeze, P9FOS's plot of an alien invasion (taking place in the San Fernando Valley), is wafer-thin, to be sure.Directed by schlockster, Ed Wood Jr., P9FOS opens with Criswell's priceless, dead-serious \"My friends\" monologue in which he refers to future events in the past tense and guarantees us all that what we're about to witness here is (My friends) based on \"sworn testimony\". (Ha! That's a killer!) So - Is PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (the cheapie of all cheapies) the worst movie of all time? No. I think not.",

            "content": "Okay, yes; \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is a bad movie. I think we're all ready to concede that point. Bad directing, yes. Bad acting, most definitely. Bad sets, bad continuity, bad special effects; they're all in there. And REALLY bad use of actors the likes of Bela Lugosi (remember when he was actually scary in his \"Dracula\" heyday?) and Tor Johnson (yes, he was a good actor; anyone here recall his comedic turns in movies like \"The Lemon Drop Kid\" and his many appearances on \"The Red Skelton Show\"?).So all of this is true, then; but there's still so many who watch \"Plan 9\" over and over again, drinking in every small detail and relishing such choice dialog as \"A flying saucer? You mean the kind from up there?\", \"You see? You see? You're stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!\" or the classic \"Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible!\". So what is it about a movie like \"Plan 9\" that has people turn to it time and again, gets it colorized, brings vivid commentary from the likes of no less than Mike Nelson (from TV's \"MST3K) and even lauded for its 'merits' in the classic tome \"The Golden Turkey Awards\"?Quite simple: it is one of those films whose badness is tempered by the sheer likability of what is put on screen. In other words, some scenes are so completely endearing and evocative of the work of Ed D. Wood that when you watch this film and see...* Pie tin spaceships wobble happily across a cloth backdrop sky * Police officers stumble over bending cardboard tombstones * A detective scratch at the back of his head with his own gun barrel * Scenes change from day to night and back again all within a few seconds time * A double for Bela who looks nothing like him holding a cape over his face and stand a good foot or two higher than Bela did * several different locations that use the same furniture and props as previous scenes had...it just gives you a warm, comfortable feeling in that after watching so many movies that sweat over every detail of the film, here is a director who is only interested in telling a spooky story as a fever dream; never mind that it makes no sense, never mind that much of the dialog is incomprehensible, never mind that the bookend scenes with Criswell hold no context, and certainly never mind that the most expressive actor in the whole thing is one who never acted in another film before or since (John \"Bunny\" Breckenridge).When you watch \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", you can at least see what Wood was *trying* to do, and that's enough. It certainly was enough to make a little film from 1959 fondly remembered even today, which is more than can be said for many other, bigger films from the same time period (quick: name the biggest money-making film from 1959! ... See there?)So forget everything you've heard. \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is bad, yes, but not bad in the same way that films nowadays are bad (like \"Gigli\" or \"Baby Geniuses\"). This is a film that is bad in an endlessly re-watchable way, a way that will guarantee you watch it with a huge smile on your face and a song in your heart. It really is sort of comforting; like wrapping up in a huge furry blanket in front of a roaring fireplace on a cold winter day...with spaceships and Mona McKinnon, sure, but you get the idea.So I heartily endorse watching \"Plan 9\" as soon as you can. As often as you can. With as many friends as you can. And, above all...enjoy.Eight stars out of ten...and this is all based on sworn testimony!",

            "content": "Edward D. Wood Jr. or better known as just Ed Wood really was the worst screenwriter of all time. Just like all of his movie, this one doesn't make sense and is filled with plot holes and visual mistakes, which makes this movie a laughable but fun one...So Ed Wood was the worst writer and perhaps director of movie history but does that mean that his movie are also the worst of all time? I think not, even though his movies are far from masterpieces he still knows to put some passion and love for cinema into it. Unfortunately it's a kind of strange love and passion that perhaps only Ed Wood himself understood. Looking at his movies you realize that the movies were made by a person who was living in his own world with his own ideals and standards, in his mind he thought what he did was great but the general public did not agree with that and all of his movies became an huge failure. Does that make him a bad filmmaker? More a misunderstood one, misunderstood by the whole world. I think this is also one of the reasons for Wood's cult status which he has gotten after his unfortunate early death, people began to see and understand the passion he made his movies with, when they rediscovered his movies and watched them in a new light. But I shall not try to romanticize it, facts are that Wood's movies are unique but still awful ones and it are these two things combined that makes his movies laughable but yet fun to watch. In a strange way I admire Ed Wood's life and career...\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is no different from Wood's other movies, except for one thing; this one his most known one. But why is it his best known one? Probably because it is his biggest movie and being officially known by the world as worst director of all time, this movie automatically became regarded as the worst of all time. I don't think worst is the best way to describe this movie, strange would be perhaps better.The story is weird and doesn't make a lot of sense. It mixes science fiction with strange zombie kind of horror. An horrible combination that simply doesn't work.Main problem I had with this movie was that I didn't understood who the main character was. The movie follows way too many characters without ever making clear who the 'hero' was. I think that originally Bela Lugosi was set to portray the biggest role in the movie but after his death the story had to be rewritten, with as a result an even bigger mess. Lugosi still is in this movie, Wood uses some self made archive footage of his good friend while he is running around in his Dracula cape. The result is a strange mix of archive Lugosi footage and sequences with a body double that looks nothing like Lugosi at all. The movie also uses other archive footage of the American army firing their cannons, it really doesn't blend in with the movie and looks laughable.The acting as always is horrible. I really laughed at Tor Johnson with his horrible accent who had been given way too many lines. Other strange roles are portrayed by Vampira, Criswell, John \"Bunny\" Breckinridge (who couldn't seem to keep his eyes of Dudley Manlove's costume) and other Ed Wood regulars Paul Marco, Duke Moore, Lyle Talbot and Conrad Brooks.Still I think that the movie has some nice moments. At times it knows to build up some good tension and I think that the underlying message itself also isn't that bad or unimportant. It's just that it's brought in the wrong way just like in Wood's other movie \"Glen or Glenda\" was the case.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "...and that time for this man came whilst watching Plan 9 From Outer Space. Obviously, I went into this film knowing that I was letting myself in for something truly terrible - but even so, nothing could prepare me for just how BAD this is. To be honest, I'm still in shock - how ever did this film manage to get a release? How did Ed Wood ever dare to make a movie with that script? How the actors dare to even be a part of it? All of these questions and more remain unanswered, and all the foggy elements surrounding the movie are matched by the huge amount of unanswered questions about the movie's plot. One of the many things that Ed Wood doesn't seem to have any grasp of is plot coherency. Some of the plot holes on display are so large that you could shove Tor Johnson into them, and still have room for at least three more terrible actors. The film follows the popular fifties idea of aliens landing on earth. These are actually the most stupid aliens ever to be seen in a motion picture, and the plan that they've cobbled together proves that. They want to destroy Earth, yet they want the 'earthlings' to believe that aliens exist, and the only way that they do that is by resurrecting the dead. Basically, Ed Wood wanted to make a movie about aliens and zombies.Many people give this train wreck plaudits for being 'fun'; but personally, I've only ever been more bored watching a movie once, and that was while viewing The Blair Witch Project. Some of 'unintentional humour' is actually quite funny, and I couldn't help giggling after the film had ended; but I don't watch films to laugh at how crap the director is, and the fact that there's no characters, plot coherency, decent acting or anything else just renders this film a very torrid time indeed. This film is famous for being the last one that Bela Lugosi ever made; even though he's only in it for a few seconds, while some guy in a cape fills in for him after his death; which is probably the most ridiculous death sequence ever to grace the silver screen. The rest of the cast are equally terrible, with Vampira and Tor Johnson standing out the most, but only because they look so stupid. The film kicks off with a narration sequence, and this really sets the right mood for the rest of the movie. The voice-over is so unbelievably cheesy that it's hard not to cringe every time it features. I realise that this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, but as far as I'm concerned; Ed Wood has wasted seventy-five minutes of my time with this stupid film, and it really does deserve all the criticism it gets.",

            "content": "Did Ed Wood intentionally create bad films, was he forced to make compromises and improvise for lack of funds, or was he missing a few clues? Possibly a little bit of each. In any case, Plan 9 has achieved cult status for its hodgepodge of horror and sci-fi cliches energized with odd performances against less than special effects. Poor Bela Lugosi had the bizarre fate of actually dying--off-screen--while playing an undead ghoul.Aside from Lugosi's role, there's his wife Vampira (Maila Nurmi), Tor Johnson as Police inspector Clay, the Trent family, Jeff and Paula (Gregory Walcott, and Mona McKinnon), the three aliens, the Ruler, Tanna, and Eros (John Breckenridge, Joanna Lee, and Dudley Manlove), General Roberts (Lyle Talbot), patrolman Larry (Duke Marco), and an actual psychic, Chriswell who plays himself.Chriswell narrates \"what happened on that fateful day.\" Grave robbers from outer space? What? Don't they have dead folks on their planet? The credits are pretty cool: we get the cast's names on headstones. Ghoul Man's wife, Vampira, has died. Can she do that? Meanwhile, an airliner is buzzed by a ufo; the spacecraft lands near the graveyard we were just at. Vampira has come back to life. Ghoul Man dies--he's got an above-ground crypt. For some reason the two gravediggers are dead too.That brings the cops out (led by Tor Johnson). The pilot, Jeff, safely at home, tells his wife Paula about the ufo. It conveniently buzzes their house and the graveyard. As the Inspector goes to investigate, he's spooked by both ghouls (Lugosi has reappeared) and dies. \"Wonder if the saucer had something to do with this?\" Impossibly, his burial is that same night--Vampira looks on.With the saucers supposedly everywhere, we see (thanks to stock footage) the army and air force attack them. Now, in outer space, a spacecraft docks at a station. The aliens (Eros, Tanna, and the Ruler) have a conference to discuss Plan 9. \"Report to me in two earth days\" says the Ruler. We mere Earthlings learn something here: the aliens want to take over our dead people because, having no thoughts, they can be controlled. Ghoul Man goes to check out Paula Trent. She flees to the cemetery, just in time to see the Inspector come back to life, and crawl out of his grave.Now we've got three ghoul aliens. Paula gets away thanks to a good Samaritan. The police return to the graveyard; but the ghouls walk up to the spaceship and enter. The craft takes off. Two of the cops see the saucer; then they discover the Inspector's messed up grave. Back in Washington, at the Pentagon, the military discuss the ufos. The General says that they've been contacted by the aliens. Thanks to a cunning bit of technology, they can listen to the alien Leader. It's the usual stuff about how we're endangering the \"entire universe\" with our nuclear activity.Back to the alien spacecraft: the inspector proves he's a wild card by attacking them. They neutralize him, and discuss what to do next. It's an ominous plan: armies of controllable (?) dead people taking over the earth. They return to earth. Why did they leave anyway? Now, ye olde Ghoul Man shows up at the Trent's. He's about to scare them to death, when a sort of laser emits from the spacecraft, reducing Ghoul Man to a skeleton. The chief alien did say he was expendable. The Colonel and all the others converge on the cemetary--dangerously close to the spacecraft.Eros sends Inspector Ghoul to get the Earthlings' attention. Actually, he just whacks one of the officers, while the aliens let the good guys inside. \"Do we have to kill them?\" asks Tanna. Yes, of course. On a video screen, Eros shows them the Inspector carrying Paula. Then he gives them the 'you guys are trashing the universe' speech.Nothing about the aliens convinces: their unremarkable appearance, the obvious banality of the spaceships interior, Eros's talky patronizing tone; it's just silly. A fistfight ensues--don't these guys have weapons? Probably because of busted-up equipment, the craft catches fire. The good guys open the door, and manage to split. The Inspector's reduced to a skeleton, and the flaming saucer takes off, only to explode over the city. Some wrap-up by the narrator finishes things off. The end.This was a bit better than I remember it: the pacing was pretty good, there was a lot going on, and the premise made some sense (if we bend suspension of disbelief enough). The blend of genres was a good idea. After all, what's the point of having zombies (technically, reanimated ghouls) if they're just going to scare people? Why not have aliens recruit them? This is alien possession taken to a new level. The best aspect was the genuiely creepy nature of these ghouls--Vampira would make the grade in any horror movie of the era.Other than some wooden acting, and a tone problem, it's the alien milieu that makes us roll our eyes. Absurdity is one thing, but plain hokey stuff just wrecks the overall effect. The exterior of the ufos, and the space station, aren't at all bad. But we don't expect the product of their proclaimed advanced civilization to look like a potting shed inside. What happened to the round shape? Isn't that a construction-site blinker on top of one of their devices? Is that table from a thrift store? Oh, well.Plan 9 From Outer Space is ambitious, and certainly original. To answer the questions I began with: this is a decent effort drastically undermined by its small budget.",

There are the awful visual effects, the mismatched stock footage, the gravestones which topple over at the slightest touch, the crypt made of cardboard, the \"cigar-shaped\" saucers which aren't actually cigar-shaped at all and a narrator who can't decide whether these events happened in the past or will happen in the future.

But what I have always admired about the man was his determination and resolve, and the sense of comradery you can feel from his motley crew of actors. He never gave up, and the passion he had for film was something that many in the industry don't have. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is widely considered the worst film ever made. I do not agree with this one bit. People who say this have not seen many films. They definitely have not seen \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" (Another Tor Johnson film, funny enough. But nothing against the big man!) or the diabolical \"Robot Monster\". Not to mention the likes of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". I've seen many 'turkeys' and the main factor present in all them cases was sheer dullness. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is anything but dull, and the history around its production is enough to amuse you. It is also the final on-screen appearance of the legendary Bela Lugosi.The goofs and quirks are endless. Bela Lugosi died before filming was complete, so Wood got another actor to stand in for him, who looks absolutely nothing like Lugosi. Plastic headstones fall over in the background. The dialogue is absolutely inane but so funny - my favourite: \"Inspector Clay is dead, murdered. And some one is responsible.\" Criswell's dramatic narration is truly something to behold. Every scene warrants study to detect something that's a blatant error or just another idiosyncrasy. Technically, it is a terrible film. But there is something about it, apart from the so-bad-it's-laughable element, that makes it very entertaining and so memorable. Wood managed to pull off a fine shot in one scene where Vampira walks through the cemetery with her arms stretched out. It evokes the finest horror imagery. The cemetery has a certain horror charm about it that makes me think of Halloween. The aliens would have been better had they not been human-looking. Grey alien-masks would have been sweet! I think it is easy to bash this film for its flaws but unlike the average bad movie you can see the effort that was put in here and it has enough charm and wackiness to make it a guilty pleasure.",

I think any fan of B-movies can list several off the top of their heads that are worse than this one (how about ROBOT MONSTER, NIGHT OF 1000 CATS or CURSE OF THE SWAMP CREATURE for starters). What is different about so many other \"bad\" movies, however, is the fact that most of them weren't even trying to be good. They were made to fill a vacancy in a theater program and had little in the way of artistic or social ambitions. They were pure exploitation and served no purpose other than to keep patrons in the theater for an extra 90 minutes to boost sales at the concession stand.Ed Wood desperately wanted to fill his work with subtext and sociological relevance. He wanted his movies to be thought-provoking. He also hung out with a lot of very offbeat counter culture people, many of whom wound up as cast and crew members on his movies, which led to their being that much more bizarre.Ed Wood was a terrible director. A terrible writer, too. He had no real connections, no money and no talent. Yet he managed to make six feature films in the space of ten years, five of which were theatrically released and a few of which even made a decent profit.

It's really a mystery up until this late point in the story; flying saucers are sighted all over, the military keeps it hush-hush, no one knows what these aliens want, the saucers fly too low and tend to force people to fall over, and, for some very odd reason, resurrecting three of the characters in the story into walking zombies is a major goal of the aliens. As I watched this all the way through, for perhaps the first time, I wondered how all these plot points would come together - what is the missing piece of the puzzle Ed Wood will put in place by the end? Of course, it didn't all fall into place by the end but I sort of breathed a sigh of relief when the alien (Manlove in a deliriously bad performance) finally revealed his concerns about Solaranite ('What? There's no such thing!'). And it happens during perhaps the most well-known & best scene in the movie: the alien is insulting and excitable in this story, unable to hide his contempt for Earthlings ('Stupid! Stupid!'), receiving a backhand blow from the stalwart hero (Walcott), who is obviously very patriotic about such things.So, with all this mystery & tension described above, how can I give this movie just one star? I am sorry, my friend, but this is what it is - a case study of how not to put a film together. I should know - in my twenties, I was in a similar situation to Wood. I had some super-8 footage shot during my late teens which I didn't know what to do with. I finally grouped together some friends and shot some more footage to align, as best I could, with the older stuff. All because I did my best doesn't mean the result was good. No, it was quite bad. As bad as Wood's 'masterpiece' of ineptness? Probably worse, but I had a smaller crew than him. One of the weaknesses of \"Plan 9...\" (and there are too many to mention here) is that it's a patchwork. Most of us know, for example, that Lugosi's footage was shot earlier and had nothing to do with the story of \"Plan 9...\" Was Wood clever in how he, er, spliced it in? We may applaud his resourcefulness, but that does not a good movie make. Wood's use of stock footage - not too shabby. But, stock footage is rarely a criteria for good films, except perhaps for documentaries. Interesting how I'm going on about this movie for such a lengthy comment, isn't it? The spell of Ed Wood is there, no doubt. No doubt.It boils down to the fact (yes, these ARE the shocking facts) that every single scene has something wrong with it. I'm not exaggerating - every scene! In fact, in some scenes, every single shot has something wrong with it. If it's not the background, it's something in the senseless dialogue. The most professional scene is probably with Talbot, his one scene as a general, but its very static - a 2-person dialogue-driven scene in a room. Champions of this picture claim that it's rarely boring, perhaps the most important element to judge a film by; my friend, this is not the case - quite a few scenes, like the one just mentioned, drag on and on. So I could not, in good conscience, give this more than a single star. Why has this become so popular - a cult favorite? To some extent, judging films is a subjective process; check out the votes for this on IMDb: the majority gave it one star; but the 2nd highest number of people gave it 10 stars! (Do we detect stuffing a ballot box?). Many viewers, especially aspiring filmmakers and film students, find this movie very instructional. Others find the exercise of finding the aforementioned wrong things in every scene to be quite amusing. I have to admit, I was sick when I watched this last night (or was it some dream?) and it still made me chuckle in a few spots. Best acting: Breckinridge as the effeminate alien leader; worst: the guy who plays Danny the co-pilot. Tor, we hardly knew ye.",

And while I wouldn't go so far as to call \"Plan 9\" a good movie, it is a funny one. How can you not laugh when Tor Johnson stumbles as he is getting out of his grave?  Or when Criswell warns us all that the future will affect us all...in the future.  Or (my personal favorite) the incredible lack of attention paid to continuity between day and night scenes.  Cars drive up to a site during the day, the car stops and everyone gets out, and it's night!I gave \"Plan 9\" a 4/10, on the basis of its original goals and its lack of succeeding in them.  This is not a horror film; the only thing that scared me in this movie was the Vampira's garishly skinny waist.  But as an unintentional comedy, the film is almost a 10.

Wood didn't care how the public would take it. All that mattered to him was how he himself thought of it. That, in my opinion, is the trait of a true director. This movie does deserve all the heat it receives...no argument there. But, when there is little to do and an escape from the real world is needed, \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is the perfect movie to watch and laugh at.

Indeed the evidence is strong. Amidst many other examples, we have:1 A chase in a graveyard which goes back and forth from day to night2 A man {actually the director's chiropractor} pretending to be Bela Lugosi {who had just died} and hiding the fact that he looks nothing like him by walking around holding his cloak up in front of his face3 Cardboard grave stones blowing in the wind4 A cockpit consisting of part of a wall, a shower curtain and a notepad5 Somebody being thrown onto the ground- onto a pile of supposedly unseen cushions6 Victims of the 'Ghoul Girl' screaming in pain before she's anywhere near close enough to them7 Dialogue of the nature of \"somebody's been murdered, and SOMEBODY'S responsible\"8 Some cast members reading their lines from their visible scriptsHowever, all this makes the film tremendously entertaining, so entertaining in fact that it's never dull for a moment. It could almost be described as a surreal masterpiece. No,it's not a good film in the normal sense, but it's so full of ridiculous details that, if approached in the right spirit, there is really a deal of enjoyment to be had. Honestly!One must also remember that the director Ed Wood made his films in a tiny period of time and with hardly any money- he HAD to use such makeshift props and could never reshoot. He had no talent as a director or a writer,but his films, which could have disappeared into B movie hell, have somehow lasted. Think of the last Hollywood blockbuster that you saw that was a disappointment, think of all the money that had been thrown at it, think of it's predictability and it's sameness to 20 other Hollywood blockbusters that came before it. Then watch and enjoy Ed Wood's stupid, terribly made but helarious Plan 9 From Outer Space. How can such a fun watch be the worst film ever made?",

Perhaps if he had better budgets and more time he might've grown to have had a slightly different reputation in the film world, but in the end despite all the shortcomings his passion drove him to get it done - as Tim Burton's biopic Ed Wood shows quite well.Whereas there were lots of stinkers produced before Plan 9, Plan 9 is one where every major flaw one could make in filmmaking is on full display with results creating very different emotions on the viewer than what had been originally intended. It is both very entertaining, but also serves as a cautionary tale to all filmmakers who want to get their visions on film but need to understand their limitations better to work around them.",

            "content": "There are so many movies worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space.This is a movie that should have had the budget of an epic, yet had the budget of your grocery store visit. Yet it doesn't stop trying to be that movie, no matter what.I blame the Medved brothers who named it the \"worst film ever made\" in their book The Golden Turkey Awards. Wood and his film were also posthumously awarded the Golden Turkey Awards for Worst Director Ever and Worst Film. Many of the people who think of this as a bad movie have never seen it.If you've seen it on TV, you may laugh about seeing the boom mics and pieces of the other film equipment. Wood never intended for this to happen. Plan 9 was composed and shot for the 1.85:1 aspect ratio theatrical projection, the predominant widescreen format of its day. It was never intended to be seen in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio or on a TV screen. Then again, Wood also incorporated stock footage as well as other footage he'd shot of Lugosi in the 1:33:1 format, so everything looks cropped improperly.The film begins with Criswell, one of Wood's friends, playing the narrator, starting things off by saying, \"Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives!\" Jeron Criswell King - The Amazing Criswell - grew up in a troubled family in Indiana where he learned to sleep in a coffin.At some point in the mid-50's, Criswell began buying time on Los Angeles TV channel KLAC Channel 13, selling his Criswell Family Vitamins. At some point, he started filling out dead air on the show by proclaiming predictions for the future. Eventually, this made him something of a celebrity and even friends with Mae West (who sold him her old luxury cars for as little as five dollars), appearances on The Jack Paar Show and a writing career that included a weekly syndicated newspaper column and three books, including From Now to the Year 2000, Your Next Ten Years and Forbidden Predictions. In these books, he predicted that a laser beam would destroy Denver, that cannibalism would become commonplace and that the world would end on August 18, 1999. Sadly, Criswell died 17 years before he could see if that prediction would come true. Supposedly, he claimed that JFK wouldn't run for re-election because something would happen in November 1963 and friends like Maila Nurmi - who are we to deny Vampira herself, may I ask you? - claimed he really as a psychic.He also appeared in two other Wood-related films, Orgy of the Dead and Night of the Ghouls. In this film, he literally says \"my friends\" four times in under a minute and speaks in his typical televangelist style. I also adore that the judge from TV's Divorce Court, Bob Shields, was Criswell's announcer.Man, I could talk about Criswell all day and how he predicted Mae West and Liberace's brother would go to the moon with him or how his wife had a dog she was convinced was her cousin Thomas reincarnated or that Mae West actually recorded a song about him, but we gotta get back to this movie.\"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space?\"After a funeral, a UFO causes a plane to nearly crash. That same UFO lands at a graveyard and causes the dead - Vampira! - to rise and kill the gravediggers. The old man, distraught at the loss of his wife, steps in front of a car and kills himself. And that's how Bela Lugosi - at least Bela in stock footage and being played by Ed Wood's chiropractor - shows up in this movie.This is a term known as a fake Shemp, given because there were four shorts that the Stooges had to contractually finish under their 1955 contract with Columbia (Rumpus in the Harem, Hot Stuff, Scheming Schemers and Commotion on the Ocean). Sadly, Shemp Howard died of an unexpected heart attack at age 60. So what did they do? Well, through a combination of Joe Palma standing with his back to the camera and stock footage, the films were completed.This term was invented by Sam Raimi, who used it to describe the many ways that he and his friends - Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, Josh Becker, David Goodman and his brother Ted Raimi - would fill in for roles on the original Evil Dead for people who had long since left the production.See - I get distracted easily! Back to the action!Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson!) is on the case. Well, he is until he's killed off by Vampira and not-Bela in zombie form, reanimated by Plan 9, the fiendish plot of Eros (Dudley Manlove, the best name ever), who uses it to resurrect the recently dead by stimulating their pituitary and pineal glands.Eros has come to Earth because human weapons development will one day discover Solaronite, which can blow up sun particles and start an uncontrollable chain reaction that just might blow up the entire universe. Yeah - I wouldn't trust humans with that weapon either. After all, we are as Eros says, stupid. \"You see? You see? Your stupid minds. Stupid! Stupid!\"All it takes is a block of wood to knock out zombie Tor Johnson and save the day, rescuing the zombified Paula Trent and blowing the UFO - or is it a model kit or a hubcap or perhaps a paper plate - up real good.In true Ed Wood fashion, everyone and any one had a role in this movie. The Rev. Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the Baptist producers of the film, while gravedigger J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention in Beverly Hills and executive producer of this movie.I love Plan 9 From Outer Space. Sure, that's just a shower curtain getting reused over and over. Yes, one of the cops keeps pointing his gun at himself. And man, the story makes no sense and then makes even less by the end. But who cares? Are you not entertained? Can you forget it? And how many people know of this film that don't know one other 1950's science fiction movie?",

When I heard from various sources that this was \"the worst film ever made\", I had expected a whole new level of incompetence. But this wasn't so bad. Sure, the effects were for the most part lousy, there were constant plotholes and errors in continuity, and we all know that Bela Lugosi only appears four times in the actual movie. But PLAN 9 does not come close to other atrocities I have endured.Gregory Walcott is the pilot who sees a flying saucer, then is terrorized by the walking dead that the aliens raise. Walcott is one of the only noteworthy talents in the entire film and today condemns the film. For good reason! I would not be proud to put this on a resume, but I would still feel a hint of pride to have MADE it. Others turning in rather good performances: Tor Johnson (yes! I thought he was good!), Mona McKinnon, Dudley Manlove, and Tom Keene. The special effects aren't too good, but the reaction shots by a seemingly \"startled\" crowd are priceless. It does get a bit boring about halfway through the movie (lots of talk scenes between Army officials, snore!), but PLAN 9 is for the most part top-notch entertainment for all the wrong reasons. It is often called \"the worst movie ever made\", but that's by people who have a low tolerance for such science-fiction films. Take a look at the movies of today! I can find far worse examples today than I ever could in the 1950's!PLAN 9 isn't the best introduction to Ed Wood (that would have to be GLEN OR GLENDA or JAIL BAIT, his best films), but it certainly carries much of his trademark quirkiness and should be seen by anyone who wants bragging rights for seeing \"the worst movie ever made\". I just hope that a newfound appreciation is found for this film in the years to come instead of constant condemnation. I love Ed Wood movies, for all the wrong reasons, while others just hate them.

The story line is messy, Bela Lugosi is briefly in it only because Wood had some unused footage of him, all the other actors are concentrated keeping on straight faces while saying their lines so the acting is wooden. Cheap sets (curtains in spaceship) and awful special effects. Still, the film is too damned entertaining to be considered 'worst film of all times' (Ed Wood's own 'Night of the Ghouls' is much more dreadful). The general plot - aliens are resurrecting the dead from the grave to conquer the World - is outrageously intriguing.'Plan 9 from Outer Space' cemented Ed Wood into the history of cinema and into people's concusses as the worst director of all times. This is the label his legacy has to wear forever. There are many directors of his level of ineptitude, but few of them are so entertaining and interesting.No matter what anyone says, Edward D.

For this viewer, some of the biggest laughs arise from the fact that Lugosi had unfortunately passed on after only about two days worth of shooting, and his role had to be recast with Woods' wifes' chiropractor, an obviously taller and younger man who is obliged to hold a cape over his lower face.In a cast also including Mona McKinnon, Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, Joanna Lee, and Lyle Talbot, a special shout out has to go to the hilarious \"Dudley Manlove\", who's actually quite the scene stealer as pompous alien bad guy Eros.

At the time numerous B Sci-Fi and horror films were produced and a lot of them weirder (Teenagers from Outer Space) or worse (anything by William Beaudine really) than Ed Wood's films. And if you are looking for the worst films of all time, do not look further than Italian straight to video fare from the 80s. Anyway, Wood is an easy target to make fun of because he took himself and his films seriously whereas Beaudine saw himself as a craftsman who would film the phone book if required to do so. Of course , Plan 9 is ludicrous but as a b movie it works quite well. Wood was actually quite good at producing reasonable low budget special effects (in fact, he was often used as a consultant on other films in the 50s and 60s)and they are okay. Unless you are really looking for it you won't actually see the strings on the flying saucers. I'm not comparing Plan 9 to 2001 A Space Odysee but within the framework of 50s b movies , the effects are actually okay. The same goes for some of the sets like the aircraft cockpit. Yes, it's plywood and a shower curtain with some bits of a fake computer but it works because no one at the time knew what a cockpit actually looked like. The thing is that most b movies at the time wre quite frankly extremely boring and that is something you cannot accuse Plan 9 of. It keeps your interest, is reasonably well crafted and of course it has the typical Ed Wood dialogues which really are hilarious. And that's where Wood taking himself seriously comes into it. He really saw Plan 9 as his Citizen Kane. However, Plan 9 has some iconic scenes like the zombie like Vampira or Tor Johnson rising from the grave. The make up is actually pretty good. I'm not saying this is a great film but i don't really think it qualifies as being so awful that it's great. Within the standards of 50s cheap sci fi movies it's actually okay.",

It is by no means the worst movie ever made. What it has become, is a horror movie with so many faults that it unintentionally has become a sort of comedy. It's often said that this movie is so bad, it's good. This statement has a lot of truth in it. Many people have watched Plan 9 because they wanted to see the faults and wanted to see how badly made this movie really was. This film has become popular because it was poorly made. It's almost become a right of passage for monster, sci-fi movie fans to watch Plan 9 From Outer Space at least once. One good reason to watch this movie is that in many cases it's used as a benchmark to compare other B movies to. One of the problems in rating this movie is that it has become so famous by being bad, it has developed a kind of cult following. It usually demands strong opinions. People usually love it or hate it. I would say that this movie is a must see for sci-fi, horror, movie viewers simply because it is so often referred to and is so well known. You have to watch Plan 9 From Outer Space and see what all the interest is about and view the movie that gave director / writer Ed Wood a place in cinema history.",

            "content": "For many people this Ed Wood film typifies the idea of so-bad-it's-good cinema. That I can go along with, as it hardly needs stating that Plan 9 from Outer Space contains an absolute multitude of unintentional hilarity. Equally, a lot of folks consider Plan 9 to be the worst movie ever made. It's here that I have to take issue. Not only is this not the worst film ever made, it's not even close to being the worst. It's way too entertaining for that. Like all of Wood's output this film has quite a specific weirdness to it. Wood was by any conventional standards a thoroughly incompetent film-maker but he was most certainly unique. His individual stamp is clearly evident in all of his movies. The rubbishness of his technique and the unbelievable clunkiness of his writing combine to produce films that often beggar belief. But they are always a bit odd and always fascinating. His films are always an honest attempt by someone who wanted to make movies but didn't necessarily know how. The results are very memorable and always possess a great deal of soul and charm about them despite their complete and utter daftness.With Plan 9 he produced his most famous and iconic work. It has probably achieved this because it contains so many separate points of interest \u2013 Criswell's deranged narration, those 'special' effects, bargain-basement acting, hilariously atrocious dialogue, the use of footage of an already dead Bela Lugosi, the replacement of Lugosi with an actor a foot taller than him, that cardboard graveyard, the somewhat obvious stock footage, the car of changing colours, Tor Johnson & Vampira, the 'exploding sunlight' concept, night-for-day / day-for-night, that fiery finale, etc.It's Ed Wood's most ambitious picture for sure. It combines Gothic horror with science fiction to bizarre effect. It has probably three of his most iconic stars \u2013 Lugosi, Tor, Vampira. So ultimately, it's not surprising that this is his most famous film. While I do tend to think it drags a bit in its final stages, I have to say that for anyone at all interested in Z-Grade cinema, this is simply a must. It's hilarious. It's bizarre. It's unique. So bad it's good? Yeah. The worst movie ever? Are you crazy? No!",

The fact that to Ed Wood the concept of day or night in filming scenes weren't important and his major actor (Lyle Talbot Excluded) died before making the picture and was replaced by a taller chiropractor/\"actor\" detracted from the overall skill in which the movie was made. I still rate this as a good movie to watch even if it is to only find the many major and obvious flaws. After all it is much more entertaining than a cheap movie about an apostle. :) So watch this to find out that we have stupid, stupid minds. You'll See.",

            "content": "By now we all know that really bad sci-fi movies can be funny; but the \"so bad it's funny\" cultural phenomenon is now pretty much a thing of the past. When \"Plan 9\" was considered the \"Citizen Kane\" of this 'genre' (if it can be considered such), there was a recognizable body of work associated with it, a handful of infamous producers and directors who had made these films, and even 'stars' of bad acting who had appeared repeatedly in them. And there was even a particular style one could recognize permeating most of them - stagy full shots, unremitting (and unnecessary) use of fog machines, cardboard sets, special FX with strings attached, haphazard costuming and prop design, ridiculously overdone or underdone make-up, and screenplays that read like a computer program's translation of a schizophrenic's word-salad. As long as such a film wasn't too slow, the mix could be downright hilarious.But over the years, the standards for \"so bad it's funny\" have become more and more vague. There are now too many 'bad' films on the list - surely not all bad movies are equally funny. There is now also a wider variance of taste among viewers, so even the worst movies ever made now have their defenders. Politics also entered the phenomenon during the Bush years, with bad films defended because either the right or the left thought them 'politically correct.' And in the 1980s it was possible to believe that Hollywood had at last achieved a level of general competency among those working there, such that the 'bad movie' era was over; but we know now that's not true, bad movies continue to flood our theaters, more now than ever before; what we have been discovering, sadly, is a gradual but apparently unstoppable degradation of audience taste and expectations.There is one other experience contributing to the end of the 'so bad it's funny' phenomenon - many of us most strenuously argued for the importance of such films because they represented earnest efforts at innovation that, while misfiring badly, pointed the way to techniques that could be used by much better film makers - and they also expressed an essentially absurd world-view that wasn't all that distant from that of Modern art and literature. But all that now belongs to the 20th Century, and this happens to be the 21st; so I think a lot of 'bad movie' fans have had time to take a look backwards and revise their notions of whether either the hope or the amusement we found in 'bad movies' are actually there or not.I'm still pretty amused by a lot of bad films, but others no longer so - I either can't watch them or I watch them in a different way. I mention all this because \"Plan 9\" has long been held to be the critical litmus test for \"so bad it's funny,\" and in attempting to watch it again yesterday, after not having seen it for some 10 years or more, I discovered two things that made me feel so sad I had to turn it off.First, there are the opening sequences including Bela Lugosi. Objectively, Wood is using home movie footage of Lugosi, and that would seem to make the sequence amusing, since this is clearly padding intended to cash-in on Lugosi's name.Or is it? I suddenly realized, watching the brief moment Lugosi prances about in his old Dracula outfit, that what Wood was really trying to do was to give his dying friend his last moment of being 'movie star' Bela Lugosi the once promising actor who had starred in Dracula but who had ruined his life, largely through drug abuse. Perhaps inept, but hardly amusing, and, indeed, rather sad.Then as the film moved on to include the aliens in their card-board space-ship, I also realized that this sequence wasn't all that much worse than similar footage to be found in the old TV series version of Flash Gordon - or other TV sci-fi at the time. And the importance of that is, if some TV producer had witnessed only these scenes from Plan 9, he might very well have given the perennially underemployed Wood a much needed job - indeed, an entirely different career. Which may be why Wood made \"Plan 9\" to begin with, hoping it would attract such attention.So caught between Wood's visually lamenting his dead friend Lugosi, and his failure to attract the notice that might have changed his life, suddenly I was both appalled and immeasurably saddened, and I couldn't watch the film anymore.When Tim Burton made his wonderful biopic of Wood, he rightfully did so as we all expected him to, at the time, as both tribute and comedy. But now it's time to admit that Wood's life was essentially tragic. And while I will probably continue to find \"Bride of the Monster\" amusing, \"Glen or Glenda,\" \"Plan 9,\" and other films in the Wood catalogue are looking less appealing, since they are basically intrinsic parts of Wood's tragedy, and not somehow accidental bi-product of it.In one sense Wood died to make these films, burning out on too grand an ambition, given his limited talent. But in another, very real sense, these films killed him, providing him defense for his wretched self-destruction.And I don't find that funny anymore, I'm sorry.",

Certainly the most regrettable - and saddest - aspect of the film is that it turned out to be Bela Lugosi's swan song (though his brief scenes, re-used many times throughout, were actually shot for another production and incorporated into the narrative here when that project folded!). Still, the decision to cast Tor Johnson (whose awkward delivery of Wood's dialogue in itself is good for some chuckles!) as a Police Inspector was an inspired one, for all the wrong reasons! There's also the camp solemnity of Criswell and the ghoulish appearance of Vampira (more or less as themselves)...and don't get me started on the other members of the cast, the non-existent special effects or the film's use of stock footage for its would-be action sequences!!

So awful is this cheesy film that you have to see it to believe it, the film's star the once great horror actor Bela Lugosi who after years of being a heroin addict was now a skinny shell of his former self, is only in the film for several minutes because he died shorty after production begin. Wood used Lugosi's dentist who looks nothing like him and is about a foot taller to replace him, the dentist spent the rest of film walking around with his cape over his face, but two other players are memorable playing ghouls, they are Maila Nurmi as Vampira, and the massive Tor Johnson as the zombie of Inspector Clay. The direction by Wood is non-existing, the film was narrated by the phony mystic Criwell.

            "content": "A movie as infamous as its maker, Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" has lovelingly kept its place among such titles as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and the various \"Son of Hercules\" movies as The Worst Film Ever Created, and for good reason: shots that have pretty much no visible relationship with other shots are loosely edited together in a stream of bad visuals, hokey acting, and the worst style of expository dialog, all wrapped up in sets that are more than just \"stagey\" and tied together with an amusingly earnest message. What more can you want? I believe it's the message aspect of the film itself that makes it so endearing. It's not enough that the movie itself shows incompetence in nearly every level, but the fact that it honestly tries to comment upon aspects of human nature is what gives it a wonderful type of charm. It's like a little kid who tries to make a political argument to a group of adults at a cocktail party... the kid is cute, and might even be right, but that doesn't change the fact that the whole thing is completely absent of acceptable logic or point. Logic is probably the best way to discuss this film, since it has absolutely none of it.Still, who doesn't agree with it? \"Humans are so stupid that they will eventually destroy the Universe.\" It might not have been the best way to state it, and it could have been said in a much better way, but Wood's failure in this instance to really make anything meaningful out of a spectacularly earnest concept helps us laugh not only at the poor quality of the film, but also ourselves as humans who know they're right.--PolarisDiB",

Do you think Ed Wood (consciously or subconsciously) planned to make a satire of the flying saucer invasion pictures released in droves during the 1950s? One can certainly consider \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\" a spoof of these \"Outer Space\" types of films. Finally, a question for the ages, asked by the countless, but still unanswered and unknown. Whatever happened to the first eight plans?",

This movie is not the worst movie I have seen. It was actually quite entertaining and interesting, and therefore I cannot label it \"the worst movie of all time.\" I feel that label is unfair.

Actually no, heck it isn't even the worst Ed Wood movie. If you haven't seen Plan 9 you are in for a treat! It features a great introductory narration by Criswell explaining the grave robbing from outer space which features stock footage of Dracula himself, Bella Lugosi until he suddenly gets run over by a car off screen. The imagery in this film inhabits that low budget sci-fi look from the 1950's. We have flying saucers on strings, a fake looking grave yard set and alien technology that isn't the slightest bit convincing. The naivety of the filmmaker is what makes this movie entertaining and the viewing experience doesn't feel torturous as say, Manos The Hands of Fate.",

            "content": "Considering the plastic curtain between the unseen passengers of a transcontinental jet and the cockpit (where there is little resembling an actual plane flying equipment), Drapes is certainly appropriate. Perhaps Drips might be more appropriate, because the aliens flying on hubcaps who think earthlings are \"stupid! stupid! stupid!\" aren't geniuses themselves, inventing a control gun for zombies that jams and utilizing only three creepy looking creatures in their plan to warn the earth that they are in danger of destroying the universe.Called \"the worst movie ever made\" by the \"worst director who ever lived\", this cult classic isn't so much bad as it is mostly boring. Certainly, there are plenty of things to laugh about (Tor Johnson barking orders in his hard to understand accent, then trying desperately to get out of an open cemetery plot; alien Joanna Lee spinning around after being pushed as if she was in a Fosse musical; Vampira and Bela Lugosi scampering around as if they were Morticia Addams and Grandpa Munster with the revelation that while alive, they were husband and wife; dialog so bad it feels like it came out of a junior high school drama club. I could go on and on, but what has already been documented in \"Ed Wood\" (flying hubcaps over stock footage of Washington D.C. and Hollywood, one of them at one point on fire) has to be seen to be believed.First of all, in stand-in Tom Mason's first entrance in taking over for Bela Lugosi, it is very apparent that even with dyed hair, similar ears, and the famous \"Dracula\" cape that they look completely different. The Criswell introduction is as silly as everything I mention above. Poor Lugosi didn't even get any lines (or any in his second to last feature, the even more deplorable \"The Black Sleep\"), and the footage of him traipsing through a cemetery while spinning his cape around him is repeated over and over to expand the 45 seconds of footage they had of him in this scene so he could actually get \"guest star\" billing. Having seen this over and over since first seeing it, I must confess that while it ranks as a bomb, there are certainly much worse films, and that takes away a part of its legend. The stock footage is so obvious and the acting out of director Ed Wood's stable of amateurish performers is insipid. Even the presence of another veteran 30's actor (Lyle Talbot as a United States general) doesn't elevate this any higher. There are certainly some great laughs here, and it is obvious that Wood did take this seriously, but it isn't the catastrophe of legend. It is just a slightly boring film that you have to see for yourself to understand why it has gotten the reputation which it has.",

However, it is watchable, only if you have a sense of humor and can laugh at the film itself. \nThere are worse films out there. Tons. Worse movies would be something that is so amateurish, but that you can't even make fun of it. Here's my all time best movie to make fun of \"Laser Mission\" with Brandon Lee. This is a great movie. My worst movie of all time would be Star Wars 7, The Farce Awakens. This is not a movie that you can laugh at. It's a movie you cry at, because it is so sad. Crappy acting, crappy story, killing off a fan favorite character - Han Solo (not mine, but the series), just a modern day action nonsense movie. Here's another garbage movie: Starship Invasions (1977) with Robert Vaughn, Christopher Lee. This is a truly awful movie. It is so bad, the only thing laughable is the stupid costume Lee is wearing. Plan 9 has nothing on this movie. Now, here's a movie that some losers consider the worst movie of all time: Manos, The hands of Fate. I don't think so. Manos has a story, some eerie characters that you will never see before or after in any movie. The dialogue is solid. It has atmosphere! There is comedy and I believe it was intended.\nPlan 9 has some of the worst writing and production. The dialogue is so horrendous, it's one clich\u00e9 after another, hard to watch. The plot is a joke in a not so funny way. The fx are crap. What we have here is a filmmaker who was basically an amateur. The film was produced and released, for that he gets an A. As a film it is a failure - F. For the unintentional comedy the rating is a a D-, 2 stars at best. 1 star given for including Bela Lugosi in a shameful way.Now, since there are over 200 ratings on this \"film\" and since imdb has gone downhill, where readers cannot opt to view in Chronological order, this review will probably never see the light of day.

Suffice to say, \"Plan 9\" is one of the worst, funniest moovies ever - it's all that AND a bag of cow chips. :=8) Well.  A bunch of \"weirdies\", including Bela Lugosi(\"Dracula\"), his taller, balding double, Vampira, Tor Johnson, an effete race of supreme aliens, and a host of paper plates passing as flying saucers all converge on a local graveyard full of cardboard headstones.

Perhaps: try sitting through any of the films by Jerry Warren, Francis Coleman, Ted. V. Mikels, or Al Adamson.  The difference, perhaps, is that Wood is sincere: he really does believe he is making great films, a point brought out by Tim Burton's wonderful, loving \"Ed Wood\". \"Plan 9\" is a watershed mooment for Wood, his last great debacle before his unfortunate slide into alcohol and soft-porn nudies.  It is a film where everything (bad) comes together for one truly unforgettable film experience. Poor Bela died just prior to the film being made, and his likeness was vainly attempted by Wood's doctor friend, ho obviously looked nothing like Bela.

There are any number of movies more unwatchable, more wretched, and more mind-numbing than Plan 9. For sure, it's bad, but it doesn't deserve the reputation it's gotten over the years. There are several positive aspects of Plan 9 I could cite, but I'll limit this to my old standard argument on Ed Wood as a filmmaker. He may not have had the most talent, the biggest budgets, the most gifted actors, and the best written scripts, but there's not denying Ed Wood's love for movies. You can see it in almost every frame of the film. His enthusiasm for his work is almost infectious. And in my mind that counts for something. It makes watching Plan 9 a reasonably fun experience. Sure, a lot of the fun comes from unintentional sources, but Wood's vision is still there for all to enjoy. And with the fun comes entertainment. I will continue to argue that entertainment is the most important factor for me in watching a movie. That's why I've got no problem giving Plan 9 a 5/10.",

            "content": "Believe it or not, films exist which are not nearly as entertaining and amusing as \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". The film begins with one of the most ridiculously silly monologues in film history, its opening line so dreadfully obvious that I crack up every time I hear it: \"We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.\" A filmmaker trying to consciously make a silly film could not come up with something so cheesy that it truly is \"reverse genius\". You had to believe you were a genius to make something so bad it's good.Only Ed Wood who was in love with everything he did in film and convinced of his own brilliance didn't know how bad his projects were. Apparently, he truly believed he was a great filmmaker. However, only a bad filmmaker who thought he was a great filmmaker could make drivel so unutterably inane that it is actually entertaining and works but not for the reasons intended by the filmmaker. If Wood had tried to make the film \"better\" it would not be nearly as entertaining. The production of \"Plan 9\" was truly awful but the people involved didn't really appear to notice, least of all Wood, which is what makes it so fun to watch the finished film. Ed Wood became the only filmmaker who made schlock into a new and unparalleled art-form, bad cinema for its own sake!What makes Plan 9 fun is not the story which is completely incomprehensible, not the acting which is absolutely atrocious, and not the silly flying saucers which look like Frisbees painted with silver with little hubs on the top. (In some scenes you can see the strings!) Even the wobbling tomb stones are not enough to make this watchable but certainly add to the charm. What makes Plan 9 the wonder of wonders is the dialog, which is so painfully ridiculously it is absolutely 100% entertaining. Nearly every line is a laugh. I don't know if you could make dialog this funny unless you didn't know how to write good dialog! Take for instance these lines:Colonel Edwards: This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard. Jeff Trent: And every word of it's true, too. Colonel Tom Edwards: That's the fantastic part of it.or Lieutenant John Harper: But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible.or one of my favorites:Paula Trent: I've never seen you in this mood before. Jeff Trent: I guess that's because I've never been in this mood before. The lines are so over-the-top they are unpredictable, unexpected clich\u00e9 which makes you take notice. Screenwriters are taught to avoid clich\u00e9, so I guess when it happens at this magnitude it is quite startling. You can't help bursting in on wave after wave of laughter which never ends. I have watched this movie several times, about every 2 to 3 years, and the lines always surprise me yet again, usually because I have forgotten most of them. This movie never ceases to entertain, although there are parts that aren't quite so bad, just dumb, and those I have to fast-forward through. There are times when the 78 minutes seem longer. Maybe \"Plan 9\" really is pure genius. Maybe the whole joke is on the audience who thinks the movie was intended as a serious SF thriller with an anti-war message, but it wasn't. Maybe Wood knew what he was doing all along, but I doubt it. You can't know what you're really doing to make Plan 9 do what it does! Does that make any sense? The closest analogy I can come up with is Jay Leno's \"Headlines\" on the Tonight Show. Newspaper headlines (outside of yellow journalism) are not meant to be funny, which makes them more funny when the wording turns out to imply things which weren't intended. This is the essence of Plan 9. The intention, apparently, was a serious SF thriller but the results are a laugh-a-minute. Not even John Cage could come up with something this crazy.",

It's tough to know where to begin with this film. I guess I should start off by saying there is nothing INTENTIONALLY good about this film. It is awful. It is horrible in every sense of the word. But is just how terrible it is that makes it watchable. It is hysterical just how ridiculously bad this film is. Mr. Wood thought he was a filmmaker and never gave up, and for that you have to give him a lot of credit. Especially when he can make a film as absurdly bad as this and get away with it.Plan 9 From Outer Space is about an alien race that, after eight failures to stop the human race from making (stick with me here) something called a Solarite which is a sort of sun-driven bomb (just stay with me). Their plan... to resurrect the dead (did I lose you? Yeah. Figures.) The humans try what they can to destroy the strange alien spacecraft (which are small plastic models hanging from strings) but they are unsuccessful. What the aliens intentions are with these zombies isn't exactly explained, but does it really matter at this point? We do know that they are controlled with the alien's plastic electrode guns which sometimes don't work as well as they should (it's a 50-50 shot). Are you confused yet? Well trust me, watching the film will probably make it worse.The most fun thing about Plan 9 is just being able to see what happens when you put the power of cinema in the hands of the most incompetent such as Ed Wood. You won't believe your eyes while watching this hilariously atrocious excuse for a movie. It is truly amazing to see what happens when a man like Ed Wood makes a movie whilst having absolutely no idea what he is doing. The saddest thing about the film is that while watching it you can clearly see the Ed Wood's intentions of what he wanted Plan 9 From Outer Space to be like. And that is an epic sci-fi horror masterpiece, complete with mind bending special effects, a gripping and terrifying plot, and even a glaring political statement on the state of the world. Unfortunately, he went about every aspect of the movie 100% wrong. The result was indeed the worst movie ever made.",

            "content": "If there is a movie that clearly proves the \"So bad it's good\" philosophy is this one. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" quickly gained a huge cult-following after being named \"the worst movie ever made\" and gave its failed director, Edward Wood Jr., the fame and recognition he never could achieve while alive. However, and despite its enormous amount of mistakes, \"Plan 9\" has a bizarre charm that makes it different than other movies: it has heart. It is the legacy of a man whose love for films was bigger than his artistic skills, and that could do anything to complete a movie.\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is, according to its narrator, the Amazing Criswell, the retelling of the fateful day when a group of aliens tried to destroy the planet Earth, by re-animating the dead to destroy the living. An old man (Bela Lugosi) and his wife (Vampira) are the first ghouls re-animated by the aliens in their ninth attempt to destroy the earth.The plot, as weird as it sounds nowadays, was really a variation on the usual sci-fi plot of the days of McCarthyism and the fear of invaders. However, Wood's script is filled with weird dialogs that one can only take as the unedited script. It is obvious that Wood was desperate to make the movie so he shot everything not caring if what he had written sounded good on screen. Despite the poor writing of his films, Wood always tried to put a social commentary on his films, and \"Plan 9\" shows his lack of confidence in the Government and maybe in humanity in general.About the obvious \"mistakes\", some say it was due to low-budget, others state that it was due to his overconfidence; the fact remains that Wood almost never shot a scene twice no matter the results. This terrible mistake become one of Wood's main characteristics through his career, and in Plan 9 is painfully notorious. Every shot seems to be in the movie no matter if the cardboard tombs fell or if an actor makes a mistake; the show must go on and the picture must be finished.The bizarre edition (going from day to night and vice-versa) and the use & abuse of stock footage is another of Wood's characteristics that make this film so special. The performances of Tor Johnson and Vampira, Pual Marco and Dudley Manlove, and the unforgettable Bela Lugosi truly complete the show.Probably Ed Wood's life and the story about the creation of \"Plan 9\" are a better tale than \"Plan 9\" itself; Tim Burton's fictionalized biopic \"Ed Wood\" is a good proof of that. However, \"Plan 9\" is a must-see for every fan of cinema, and specially for everyone interested in film-making, as it is the job of a man who had his soul definitely in cinema, but his talent definitely in other place.One could say after reading this huge amount of flaws that \"Plan 9\" is an unwatchable piece of trash, and while maybe they are right; Wood's masterpiece has an enormous charm that makes everything look good. It is a weird feeling the one that \"Plan 9\" conveys, a feeling of tenderness and naivet\u00e9 that infects the viewer with Wood's spirit and makes the unwatchable being enjoyable, and turns the trash into a classic. That is \"Plan 9\"'s incredible paradox: it is probably the only movie where one can proudly say \"It is so bad that is good\". It is a 5/10 that tastes like a 10/10.",

There are many comments about the blatant flaws in the movie, but some of these flaws are not really flaws. For example, the day to night and back to day inconsistency could be explained in terms of a woodsy canopy which covers the gravesite. When one leaves that canopy, daylight becomes predominant. In addition, the shabbiness of the cemetery could be explained in terms of it being very old. (I have seen old cemeteries before with the monuments stones falling apart for lack of maintenance.) The stand-in double for Bela Lugosi looks similar enough to Lugosi in his 1930s years (Dracula, Mark of the Vampire). Also the cockpit could be explained in terms of more updated technology with automatic devices in place. Bela Lugosi, Vampira, Tor Johnson - all so weird and bizarre that their presence in this movie makes \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" such a unique hair-raiser. (Vampira reminds me of Carol Boland from \"Mark of the Vampire\" - another masterpiece of the genre).So much for the film's strengths.The film's weakness are obviously dialog and special effects. But when one considers the concept of \"suspension of disbelief\" (I will admit there is a certain amount of suspending), these are the type of elements that make this film such a delight.

Maybe Plan 42 involves landing in Times Square and actually saying \"hi.\" The film does go off on a long speech near the end when the alien explains what he wants - you get the point LONG before he finishes.But it is fun, I can forgive the special effects - how can you not forgive something that gives you such a good laugh?

Many people feel it is so awful that is hilarious.  I have no reason to argue with these people.  I have watched this movie on tape, stopping it to examine it in detail at each outrage:  the awful dialogue, the wooden acting, the unbelievable props ... everything about this movie is awful, so bad that it has to be seen and examined to be believed.One or two people who have commented on this movie on the Internet Movie Database have defended it on the grounds that 1: at least Mr. Wood was attempting to do something and so deserves your respect and that 2: this is an example of subversive art film-making and so deserves your respect.I wish to take a little of the time of anyone who is reading this to argue that you cannot have art without craft. A monkey may throw dung at people, but that does not make him a cogent speaker. All he communicates is anger. Mr. Wood may have had excellent intentions when he wrote, produced and directed this film.  He may have intended to make some serious statements. All that comes across is an ineptness so profound that people watch this as a prime example of bad movie making.Others have argued that there are worse movies, movies that are made for a quick buck, which pander endlessly and add nothing.  I agree with that assessment.  If lack of talent is sad,  actual ability  that is used for the lowest purposes is worse. \nHowever, that does not dignify this work with any value, nor does the cloak of \"art.\"  I feel sorry for Mr. Wood, but he had no talent, no ability and no resources. This is an awful film.  Without ability, you cannot have art, despite the insistence of so many modern artists.  In another bad film of the era, BUCKET OF BLOOD, the protagonist wishes to be a sculptor.  He takes home clay and attempts to model a bust.  His technique of sculpting a nose is to smash on the clay and command it \"Be a nose!\"Roger Corman, who directed that movie, made cheap movies intended for the drive-in circuit and knew he was making cheap movies.  He knew you cannot make art with just good intentions, only a mess.  It is a pity that some of the learned commentators on cinema cannot seem to understand this.So, if your intention is to see a movie that is so bad it is hilarious, by all means, take a look at this movie, and my own personal favorite bad movie, TERROR OF TINY TOWN.  But don't mistake it for anything other than what it is.  And if you think you're an artist simply because you're so brilliant, all I can say is don't give up your day job.",

There's no talent on display here. The dialog, written by Wood, drops like lead balls. The tag lines aren't witty or poetic. The plot is disjointed and makes no sense. And worst of all -- it's uninteresting. The acting is a fornication upon the altar of Thespis.I mean -- three metallic flying saucers appear over Hollywood.

That's because these were just test shots meant to be put in another movie but ended up here. That's producer, writer, director Edward D. Wood, Jr. for you! He just took stock shots of Lugosi, had another taller man put that vampire suit on with the cape covering his face, and voil\u00e0, an excuse for a quick buck in publicizing the last performance of a once great man! That's just one of several inept decisions Wood made in making what was often considered the worst film ever. Hearing the narrator Criswell state the obvious is another mistake. Seeing the military superior on a blank background as the flying saucers are in the skies overhead as well as seeing many of his men miss those targets despite those targets just staying put are good for some laughs. And how about hearing Tor Johnson, a Swedish immigrant, do a brief dialogue scene as the alive Inspector Daniel Clay, speak in broken English that's almost incomprehensible? And then there's exchanges like this: \"The Earth people, who can think, are so frightened by those who cannot-the dead.\" \"Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible.\" \"They attacked a town, a small town I'll admit, but never the less a town of people, people who died.\" There's others but I think you get the picture. It actually gets a a bit monotonous after a while but a speech spoken by one of the aliens that seemed inspired by the final scene of The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 version) with some even more ridiculous lines, though also some thought provoking ones too, picked things back up. That and one more scene of shooting with only the back of \"Lugosi\" seen made it a little worth while watching to the end.

From this point the film sort of resembles Uwe Boll's infamous 'Alone in the Dark'.The rushed production shows in every singles scene. Actors struggle to remember their lines and to deliver them, especially Tor Johnson, but the continuity errors and cheap sets only work to enhance the experience. The film is actually rather hilarious to watch for the first 30 minutes or so, but after that the joke becomes old and we're left with a movie that just isn't competent on any level.An E for Effort and for comedy value but generally speaking Plan 9 has very few redeeming values.",

From there the story begins with an old man attending the burial of his wife. After the funeral the gentleman goes home to mourn his loss while the gravediggers finish their task of burying the casket. Unfortunately for them, aliens from outer space bring the corpse back to life and the zombie then proceeds to kill the two gravediggers. Around the same time a flying saucer buzzes a passenger airliner flying en route to Los Angeles and almost causes the pilots to lose control of their aircraft. Upon landing both of the pilots and one of the stewardesses report what they have seen but are told by the army to keep everything secret. Unfortunately, not only are other flying saucers seen in various cities in the United States but something very strange begins to happen in the same cemetery where the two gravediggers met their fate. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While I can overlook the fact that the special effects were extremely basic (given that the movie was produced in 1959) I cannot overlook the extremely bad acting so easily. Additionally, I should also mention that the costumes worn by the aliens were extremely basic and cheap-looking as well. At any rate, having said all of this I can only say that this film was a total waste of time and I would recommend viewers look elsewhere for their movie entertainment as this film is just plain awful.",

            "review_title": "A Film that Defies the IMDb Ratings System!",
            "content": "Frankly, I have no idea how to go about rating this. It should technically be given low marks because of the spectacular ineptitude with which it was made, but\u0085 but\u0085 It's just too much fun! Every absurdity found in the film seems to somehow paradoxically work to its benefit \u2013 the stupefying dialogue, the model flying saucers on strings, the stock footage which stands out because it oftentimes seems of better quality than other parts of the motion picture. Ed Wood's magnum opus may be brimming with dumbfounding incompetence, but it is too entertaining, too much of a zany delight, for me to rank it down with truly unbearable atrocities of cinema.The plot of \"Plan 9\" deals with the ninth plan of an apparently highly advanced alien race (though if they were so advanced, you'd think they'd have been able to succeed the first time around) to conquer Earth by resurrecting the dead from cemeteries. Wait, did I say conquer? I'm not sure. The aliens' motives alternate throughout. Sometimes it seems as though they want to take control of the planet. Other times it appears they just want recognition from the human population. And in the end, the aliens warn their captives \u2013 an army colonel, police detective, and hotheaded airplane pilot Jeff Trent \u2013 against the dangers of the 'Solaranite bomb' and act as if they are taking part in a crude and silly mimicry of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". Have they come to Earth to give Earthlings a message, a la Klaatu? Maybe\u0085 I guess\u0085 Except it is clear that the aliens intend to kill their human captives after telling them about Solaranite. So there is really no point in telling them much of anything, is there? I mean, if these humans are just going to be bumped off in a few minutes? \u0085Whatever. To seek for logic in the plot of \"Plan 9\" is futile, but it is undeniably amusing to try and to, of course, fail.Along with the idiotic storyline, the performances help propel \"Plan 9\" to its status of legendary badness. They range from humorously wooden to being so outrageously over the top and campy that they are a joy to behold. In the first category are the acting jobs from the people in roles like the airline stewardess who pops into Jeff Trent's shower-curtained cockpit from time to time or Trent's bland and pillow-cuddling wife. At one point, Mrs. Trent states to her husband, \"The saucers are up there. The graveyard is out there. But I'll be locked up in there.\" The total lack of emotion in her voice has to be heard to be appreciated. The second category contains many of the (few) actors playing aliens, like Dudley Manlove as Eros and John 'Bunny' Breckenridge as the Ruler. Manlove is probably the best (?) thing about the film. His obnoxiously authoritative voice and outrageous facial contortions make for an unforgettable character \u2013 so pompously sure of his own superiority, yet so ludicrously imbecilic. One of his best moments is when his female comrade, Tanna, attempts to speak out to the Earth people. As she does, Manlove silently fumes with more and more increasing intensity, at last roaring, \"THAT'S ENOUGH!\" and flinging her roughly aside. It's like he's a cross between a sexist tyrant and a petulant kid! (After this, Eros haughtily informs Trent and the others, \"In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting man's battles!\" Is that so? Well, why is this woman in uniform and in her planet's military, then?) Likewise, John Breckenridge's droll, eyeliner-wearing alien Ruler can almost always spark a snicker, especially when he is shown rolling his eyes exasperatedly at Eros. He seems as aware of the character's ridiculous arrogance and stupidity as anyone in the audience.Ah, \"Plan 9\"! Where else could one expect to find footage of Bela Lugosi outside of a house, sauntering to an off-screen demise as the shot freezes with Lugosi's shadow still in view and lame sound effects suggest a car crash? Where else could flying *saucers* be said to be shaped like cigars? Where else but in the wacky world of Edward D. Wood Jr. could narration be delivered by the loud and lilting voice of quack psychic Criswell? Where else could a viewer experience such grandly hilarious dialogue as, \"YOU SEE? YOU SEE? YOUR STUPID MINDS! STUPID! STUPID!\"? See it. It really is one of the best of the worst.",

The thing about the Bournemouth Sinfonietta is that the members were all genuinely mad keen about music and playing it, it was just that none of them had any discernible ability on their instruments. The record was therefore a screeching, discordant cacophony from which one could just about extract the identity of the particular piece of music as the Sinfonietta laboriously strangled it to death.It was very funny - it was released as a novelty item - and I got a lot of mileage out of inflicting it on family and friend. And the joke was all the funnier because of the sincerity of the \"musicians.\" But you wouldn't want to listen to that album too often: in fact I don't think I ever listened to it all the way through.Plan 9 From Outer Space is essentially the same joke. The boundless passion, commitment and determination of Ed Wood, tied together at the ankles by the twin bindings of insufficient resources and complete technical ineptitude, means that Plan 9 (and every one of his other films) was never going to do anything other than fall flat on its face right out of the starting gate. For that reason it is very funny, and it beats the Bournemouth Sinfonietta hands down by being very funny all the way through.But, although it is a delight to inflict on unsuspecting family and friends, I wouldn't want to watch it that often - just like the Bournemouth Sinfonietta!",

I have seen other Ed Wood films and while not good, they never reach the level of absurdity this film plummets to. I saw that Tor Johnson got top billing and I was thinking he would be featured more than he was and it was interesting hearing him speak as he has a very thick accent, but he is rendered mute and wobbling quickly. This is also the last film of Bela Lugosi who I believe died during the film which explains the obvious not Bela acting like he is with a cape in front of his face. Just a big mess, other Ed Wood films seem totally professional by comparison...The story, somehow we have sort of zombies roaming a local cemetery like rejects from a Hammer film and this is tied to UFO sightings. The aliens have a plan, Plan 9! To resurrect the dead and use them to destroy us! Unfortunately for the aliens, they only resurrect like three people in a span of days. Things are not moving very briskly. I mean, did the other plans involve killer sloths, murderous snails and other things that are super slow because sending a stumbling Tor Johnson makes this plan seem like it has obvious flaws.The film is very cheap looking. The airplane cockpit looks totally fake, the cemetery looks like the same run and they keep walking through it to create an illusion of length. That being said, Tor looks pretty creepy as the mouth open monstrosity. That vampire girl though, man, it did not look real how small her waist was! As for the aliens, they are supposedly an advanced race, but the dude leading the attack frequently starts having temper tantrums and quite honestly I do think that he would have done himself in without any intervention from the heroes...So it was bad, but not the worst movie out there. These days anyone can film a movie and there are so many of these horror films that people try to make horror comedies and they are just the most terrible things ever. I watched Rollergator a few weeks back and it is much worse and harder to watch than this thing with its constant guitar playing in the background. This one was an easy watch as it is unintentionally funny and at least Ed Wood tried, this whole reason the aliens were trying to take us out took a lot of thought, though it was making that alien explaining it tongue tied...",

In fact it wasn't very funny (or interesting) at all.Maybe if you were with a large group of people and you were all drunk and/or stoned, then maybe you could derive some cheap laughs at the expense; but really that has nothing to do with the film and a lot to do with the individual experience. A large enough inebriated-audience would probably laugh and joke wildly through Schindler's List if the mood was right; but that doesn't change the objective quality of the film.I just found this to be a rather dull, below average '50s B-movie. The worst thing about it is the editing; the discontinuity and the use of the same footage three or four times during different parts of the narrative (the shot of the police car driving by the cemetery is used four times; the shot of Lugosi flapping his cape is used twice, etc).Other than that it was badly plotted and suffered from some rather flat, lacklustre performances from a mostly amateur cast. But at no point would I call it \"so bad it's good\"; more like \"so mediocre it's boring\".

A few years ago, I saw a terrific movie called \"Ed Wood\", if you haven't seen this movie, please do, it's a great one. Ed Wood is dubbed as the worst director of all time, but if you see Ed Wood and read his biography, you can't help but actually like this guy. Despite the fact that he knew he was making trash, he never saw it that way, he had such passion for film and admiration for it. I don't think he looked at \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" as a disaster, but something that could be a treasure one day. Believe me, this was a bad movie, but there is this certain charm about it that makes it into the category of \"so bad, it's good\". You can tell the cast and crew of the film actually did their best to bring this story to life. Even though the flaws are obvious, I can't help but love this film. I know this goes against everything that I believe in where a bad film is a bad film, but I honestly had such a good time laughing that I don't want to give the movie a poor rating.In San Fernando, California, two gravediggers are filling the grave of a deceased woman, the young wife of an old man . Suddenly they hear a strange noise and decide to leave the cemetery. As they turn to leave, the resurrected corpse of the old man's wife attacks and kills them. Absorbed in his grief over his wife's death, the old man walks out of his house and into the path of an oncoming automobile. At his funeral, two mourners discover the bodies of the gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay, along with several police officers, come to the cemetery to investigate. While searching the graveyard, Clay encounters the female zombie, who is now joined by the corpse of the old man. Clay is attacked and killed by the zombies. Trent is watching the cemetery with his wife, Paula, and tells her about his flying saucer encounter, stating that the Army has sworn him to secrecy about what he saw. He suspects that whatever is happening in the cemetery is related to his UFO encounter.This movie is just a miracle, one of those movies you have to see to believe. One of my favorite moments being that the detective has his gun in his hand, the finger on the trigger and he is scratching his face with the gun and just waving it around at people as if it's a pointer. I also nearly died laughing as one of the film's most genuine moments of horror where Clay gets out of the coffin, but you can tell he gets stuck and can't get himself out. Of course how could you forget since it was Bela Legosi's last film and there was only stock footage of him shown, they needed him for more shots so they hire someone who looks nothing like Bela and is beyond significantly taller who just covers his face with the cape. The villain is very possibly Dr. Smith's distant relative, because I cannot believe how flamboyant he was. The \"aliens\" look exactly like humans and claim to speak a different language even though one of the aliens is named \"Janet\". The big solution to all of life's problems? Blowing up the sun! I loved the line \"If we blow up the sun, we become a stronger nation\", oh, boy, did that line kill me in tears. Also the line \"We have to admit they were years ahead of us\", cut to the next shot where the UFO is on fire and explodes. Yes, this movie is bad, but it's just too much fun to say \"Skip It\". Like I said, you have to see it to believe it. Ed Wood was a clumsy director, but given the time and money he had, give the man some credit, he knew what the audience wanted and that was entertainment.7/10",

Mainly because even though Wood, Jr.'s intentions may have been to make a serious Sci-Fi horror, while combining a bunch of the genre's creations, and as crazy as he might have been, he must've known that this movie was just fluff and not Oscar material. I've seen a lot, and I mean A LOT worse than this, mainly because they were trying to be serious and were trying to get awards. I doubt the awards season ever entered Wood Jr.'s mind.That said, wow, WOW, this movie was hilariously bad. Incoherent scenes and characters, laugh-out-loud horrible dialogue, funny special effects and the cast seems so, well, dumbfounded on what to do on the set. That's not the end of how bad this movie was, just the beginning. Costumes from \"outer space\" that were either made from 10-year-old King Arthur fans or just rented and had no business on \"space aliens.\" Also, it had sets, namely that main graveyard or the cockpit, that were so funny, so deliciously bad, you can't help but laugh again and again. I could go on and on, but suffice to say, this is thee perfect example of how NOT to make a movie. In fact, nothing at all works here. Nothing, but, again, humor for the audience. (Side Note: best to watch it via Rifftrax, though I know it doesn't need much help; they just make it all the more enjoyable.) I guess the well over-stuffed and confused plot involves an \"elevated\" alien race landing/hovering in the skies who's deep plan is to raise the dead in order to prove their existence to Earthlings who apparently don't believe the fake saucers in the air are real due to the government cover up. Some humans are attempting to undercover the conspiracy, but must battle 3 zombies/skeletons and \"intellectual\" aliens. (Unfortunately, they never meet the head, and enormously flamboyant leader \u2013 I would've liked to see that meeting.) I am not sure if books have been written on this movie, but I can see volumes written dissecting this movie. (I bet Wood Jr. didn't see that coming.) But there are so many aspects to scrutinize on the different scenes or dialogue that didn't work or the characters, namely the long-nailed, 2 inch waist of Vampira or the mouth-breather Tor or Bela and his cape \u2013 something that would work in Dracula, but here was obviously used to cover up that it wasn't him half the time.How could anyone hate this movie? It's the main definition of so-bad-it's good. I'm actually awarding this a full star higher than the bottom of the barrel 1-star, because of the enjoyment I got from watching it. Never before have I ever seen such a mess, embarrassment or perfect movie to watch while under the influence. And again, if you can purchase the Rifftrax audio commentary, it's a welcome addition to the already fun experience.",

            "content": "****SPOILERS**** The movie begins with Criswell addressing the theater audience about what their about to see. Sounding like he's giving a monologue for a movie that's a cross between \"Dragnet\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries\" Criswell tells us that what we are about to see is true based on the evidence that has been substantiated in the investigation of the facts that are presented in the movie. Based on those irrefutable facts we should reward the innocent and punish the guilty in the matter of what we are about to see on the screen. Well that's something that will get your attention if nothing else does! We're told by Criswell that there's flying saucers hovering over the earth using some kind of electric ray to rejuvenate the recently dead and bring them back to life to be used as an indestructible army of human Zombies. Their mission is to stop the governments of Earth from building super bombs and ending up destroying themselves as well as the entire Universe. The aliens have tried peacefully eight times before to get the human race to stop their drive towards self-destruction but to no avail. With the governments of earth shooting at their aircraft, and and in some cases downing them and killing their crews members. Now their taking off their gloves and going to Plan Nine and instead of trying to be peaceful and talkative with the Earth leaders their going to resort to force. What happens in the movie is that the aliens are foiled and destroyed by the heroic earthlings so that now they can develop more and more powerful weapons to destroy themselves as well as the Universe along with them. Taking away the stupid and ridicules sub-plots that Ed Wood Jr. put into the movie that consists of Vampires Zombies flying saucers looking like car hubcaps and aliens dressed up like extras from a movie about Knights of the Round Table \"Plan Nine from Other Space\" is truly thought provoking for a film released back in the 1950's. It was back then that criticizing the governments actions in regard to nuclear testing for the purpose of national security was practically unheard of. One scene in the movie that tells it all but is made to look by director Wood as if the aliens were the bad guys trying to do in the people of earth but really was just the opposite! They were really trying to save them and get them off from their road to self-destruction.Eros, Dudley Manlove, the alien crafts captain tells those earthlings that he invited on his spaceship the reasons for his getting in contact with them was to stop the earthlings from building a Solarnite Bomb! A super nuclear bomb which not only can destroy themselves but the entire Universe. The dense and brainless hero of the movie Jeff Trent, Gregory Wallcott, completely misinterpreting what Eros said then starts to brag to Eros saying that if we, the USA, develops this Solarnite Bomb \"We'll be even stronger then we are now\"! Which to the shock and surprise of Eros, who just explained to him how dangerous a bomb like that was, tells him just how stupid he and those on earth are. Eros then gets belted, by an outraged Trent, in the mouth for trying to put some sense into his empty skull. The movie ends like it started with Criswell ,again taking center stage, telling us emphatically that \"The story that you just saw is completely true\". Criswell goes so far to even challenge those of us watching the movie saying \"Can you prove that it didn't happen?\" Then adds, to his both smug and self-righteous monologue, \"How do you know that after you leave the theater and pass someone in the dark that person is not from outer space?\" Which is well in line with a lot of the idiotic things that we've seen, and heard from Criswell, in the movie. But I have to admit that Criswell's last words are really thought provoking and do hit home. This after what we just saw about the dangers of nuclear destruction in the mad rush for bigger and better nuclear bombs by the top world powers on earth: \"God Help Us In The Future\".",

Wood Jnr has produced is the masterpiece of his unmistakable genius.A fitting end for horror legend Bela Lugosi, who famously died early into production, the film is a classic A-class, B-Movie. The ingenuity of Wood to cast a look-alike in the role that Lugosi held before his death shows the ingenuity and tact possessed by Wood.It is fitting also that in Ed Wood (1994) Tim Burton's homage to the director, the film is heralded as Ed Wood's Citizen Kane, for this is quite simply everything you could hope for in an Edward D Wood Jnr movie. Simple story and simple people. Granted in some places the special effects are dubious at best, but consider the budget of this, a then mainstream movie, and consider what little money Wood had to work with. Science Fiction has always been one of if not the most expensive genre to make movies in, but this does not stop Wood from making a classic, low budget Science Fiction / Horror movie.Sadly, this film will be remembered for the negative attitudes of would be film critics, however, the film, for me, will always rank up there with Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Critters 1 and 2 (3 was a bit poor y'know) and of course the classic Tremors.

Having finally managed to download the Rifftrax Live version of this, it was great to see the cast of MST3K finally take this movie on. They thought of using it for the actual show, but thought it was too talky. Now they've riffed on it like five times in different versions. It's at least not worse than what you would expect, but should probably be studied like any film.The film's biggest weakness is how utterly boring it is. It's simply a movie where nothing happens. It seems like there's shot after shot of the flying saucers just well, flying. None of this advances anything and the effects are horrendous. I heard the aliens were just people wearing pajamas. Hey, to be fair, they were good looking pajamas. All the talking parts go on way too long and it's something that would have been better as a very short film. It's easy to tell how bad the sets are and how basic the dialogue is. The effect with the explosion at the end is particularly bad.The Rifftrax version(s?) gave us tons of great lines like, \"They move too darn fast\" with, \"We'll just have to kill the next group that comes along\". The one that had me laughing the most was at the end when the guy was talking about how anyone we know could be an alien in disguise with the joke, \"Kill them just to be safe\". It's great to hear modern jokes like, \"Tor studied acting under Dramatic Prairie Dog\". I also loved, \"Neither running or defending yourself have yet to be invented\". I also liked \"Holy cow!\" with \"He just became a Hindu\". It's great fun with jokes like, \"Flying saucers over Hollywood\" with the jokes, \"Chris Matthews repeatedly probed\" and, \"That has nothing to do with the flying saucers, you know\". *",

So let's not argue whether \"Plan Nine\" is the worst film, or whether the true bottom of the barrel is a millimetre or two further down.  \"Plan Nine\" topped the charts in a key poll taken two decades ago, and for want of an obviously worse candidate, might as well retain its title.Don't think for a minute that the atrocious production standards alone are doing the work.  The plot is witless and uninvolving, there are no characters, dialogue is laughable and the scientific explanations offered aren't even classy gibberish.  This is all beyond dispute.  Don't think, either, that it's so bad that it's good. NOTHING is so bad that it's good. That description is as conceptually incoherent as it sounds.The remaining question: is it entertaining?

My siblings and I once derived great pleasure from watching and laughing at \"The Neverending Story II\", a bad movie that will never become a cult favourite of any kind.

            "content": "MST3K is not needed here.  Other Ed Wood films (The Sinister Urge, Bride of the Monster) have gotten the MST3K treatment, but \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" has been spared. There may be several different reasons for this.  But the main reason, I'm guessing, is that the jokes are so obvious that uttering any of them would be entirely redundant.  MST3K's function is to point out that which is not so obvious and to make an excruciatingly horrible movie at least somewhat fun to watch.  Plan 9 doesn't need to be made any more entertaining than it already is.  This film unwittingly parodies itself and, indeed, the entire sci-fi genre of the time.  Just watch and laugh and stare in wonder.  It's almost surreal.I agree with others who have said this film is not, in fact, the Worst Ever. 'Worst' would imply that the movie is excruciating to watch and Plan 9 isn't.  As others have said, it's a gas.  When I think of 'worst,' I think of \"Future War\" and \"Blood Waters of Dr. Z\".That's not to say Plan 9's all a barrel o' laughs.  There are a few boring scenes, such as when stock footage of military weaponry unleashes barrage upon barrage upon hovering paper plates (or pie tins or hubcaps, or whatever the heck they are...), intercut with scenes of an officer staring up in the sky with binoculars; or when two pilots and their flight attendant woodenly exchange lines with each other.  But the film is only 77 minutes long (not 122 minutes as given on Netflix.com; I can't imagine this movie going on for that long), so it's bearable and it's never so bad that you want to switch it off.  Anyway, users of this site certainly don't seem to consider this the worst ever (that distinction goes to \"Manos: Hands of Fate\"); it's not even in the Bottom 100.  There are worse films out there than Plan 9 and all of them have earned their spot on the IMDb's Bottom 100.  \"Red Zone Cuba\" anyone?Some scenes in the movie actually struck me as kind of sad.  For example, there is a scene where two characters are being chased by the three ghouls and escape in a car (the oft-mentioned \"day/night\" scene).  A night scene of Lugosi's face-covering double cuts to a scene of the real Lugosi in broad daylight to suggest that he just missed capturing his prey.  It was just rather sad to see Lugosi like this, in this scene that plays out like some sort of bizarre montage.I rented this film after seeing \"Ed Wood\", which painted Wood as a highly likable and passionate man, whose ambition far exceeded his ability.  It is an affectionate portrayal and casting Johnny Depp as Wood only makes him more likeable and makes one want to root for him.  I really wish they'd release Ed Wood on DVD already.",

I understand that describes a lot of movies coming out of Hollywood today ( But today we have a thing called the \"car chase\" and \"gratuitous sex and violence\" to take our attention off of it.)The dialogue for \"Plan 9\" had me laughing out loud at times. From Criswell's opening narration to Eros' breakdown of how a 'Solaranite' explosion works (\"Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!\")As far as the filming goes, I liked how it could go from night time, to day time and back again about three or four times during any given sequences. Also the stand-in and file footage used after Bela Lugosi died was poorly done. The stand in was taller and much younger than Bela, but Wood had the actor hold his cape over his face so the audience wouldn't notice. One scene with Bela has the stand-in with the cape at night on a very bad studio set, then it cuts to file footage of the real Lugosi during the day, filmed on location somewhere and then switches back again.Needless to say there was not much to enjoy from a quality standpoint, but I will say that Tor Johnson did a very convincing zombie. He looked freaky.Anyway if you have two hours to kill and $1.50 in your pocket, rent this film. It's good for a few unintentional laughs.",

Often found on The Worst Movies of All Time lists, it's a story about vampires. And aliens. And airplane pilots. And newsroom announcers, I think. It features such exciting locations as a graveyard made of cardboard in front of a black curtain, a very small backyard, an airplane cockpit where the cardboard joysticks are not attached to anything, and of course the alien mothership (read: a medium room with science gadgets on the tables).The story is weird. It starts with vampires (with Bela Lugosi and Vampira of all people playing the roles), but then suddenly there are aliens (well, aluminium plates hanging from a string, but I assume they're meant to be aliens), which proceed to harass humanity in the name of progress. I assume.So okay, it's a terrible film, that's more than clear. But is it entertaining? To which the answer is, sadly no. I can see why people obsess over the film. It is fascinatingly bad, but in a rather boring manner. Most of the sets are done with such a shoestring budget that's it's more sad than anything else. The acting is nonexistent and the script is so all over the place that you can't really even call it such.Worth seeing for those of you who are morbidly curious. It's good to establish a baseline.

And Tor Johnson? As a zombie, he makes a great actor. Witness his scenes at the beginning before he is zombie-ized. And what can you say about Vampira that hasn't been said already. And yes, the rest of Wood's stock company (Dudley Manlove et al) perform \"admirably\" as well.However as bad as it is, I still enjoy watching it to try and spot new guffaws each time.

We should have known that the ridiculously-named Solaranite bomb would have monumental repercussions. Why must Mankind insist on destroying himself? First it was the atomic bomb. Then we developed the Hydrogen bomb, with which we exploded the air itself (to use the scientific jargon). Why, all those years ago, did we ignore those humanoid aliens in shiny spacesuits who came down to warn us of our folly? When Klaatu arrived to preach the dangers of nuclear armament, we sat up and took note. Yet these shiny-suited ETs were denied our sympathies. Despite the fact that their arguments made perfect sense, the human response was merely to set alight their spacecraft (if a wire held up by a foil-coated frisbee can be termed a spacecraft) and postpone all responsibility; the solaranite menace was decreed a problem for Future Earth.We should have listened to the aliens. After all, we witnessed first-hand the advanced state of their technology. Their agile flying saucers were able to dodge the cannons of the American military's finest stock footage. The electrode-gun, when it wasn't jammed, was even able to summon Bela Lugosi from the grave for one final acting role -- though the resurrected acting veteran seemingly developed camera-shyness during the reanimation process. I must confess, of course, that the human race has done some amazing things in its brief history. Jeff Trent (Gregory Walcott) was once offended by the suggestion that \"all you of Earth are idiots,\" and, to a degree, I share my fellow Earthman's indignation: after all, it was a human who shrewdly discerned that somebody must be responsible for Inspector Clay's (Tor Johnson) murder; it was a human who made the thematic connection between \"visits\" and \"visitors\"; it was a human who, rather liberatingly, punched Eros the alien (Dudley Manlove) in the face. Indeed, it was nothing less than a human who created 'Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959),' a film which first warned us of the solaranite problem. Ed Wood's warning fell largely on deaf ears: only a limited cult of \"bad movie buffs\" took the time to heed the film's lofty message, which even then went unnoticed behind the irrepressible sound of sarcastic remarks. Yet we can't say that Ed Wood didn't warn us. Future events such as these did, indeed, affect us in the future.",

It's a movie, like the anti-marijuana exploitation flick \"Reefer Madness\" (or \"Tell Your Children\") that is so inept, so utterly lacking in the slightest hint of professionalism, that it is supposedly a laugh riot. If only that was the case.The first time I saw \"Plan 9...,\" I admit I found it amusing.  Perhaps now, after having seen \"Ed Wood,\" my expectations are too high. (That's right. High expectations for an Ed Wood film!)  Then again, when I saw it the first time, my expectations may have been too low.  Whatever the reason, I found little to laugh about, or even to laugh at, when watching this film on video recently.  The film is bad all right, and like the worst bad film, it's principal fault is that it's dull.  The special-effects are lousy, of course, but not so amateurish as to be hilarious.  Wood is said to have used paper plates as stand-ins for flying saucers, but hubcaps would seem to be more like it.  By major studio standards, the effects are laughable, but for a low-budget 1959 movie they're really not that shabby.  Neither is Criswell, the \"psychic\" who introduces this story of \"Graverobbers from Outer Space\" (the original title), or Bela Lugosi, for whom this programmer served as his cinematic swan song.  \"Plan 9...\" is not so bad that it's good.

Granted the script, acting, screenplay and technical execution overall are sub par, but even with all its shortcomings, one must admire the directors relentless will to pursue his vision and produce films which defy the mainstream.Plan 9 from Outer Space is a movie which simply cannot be taken seriously and thus judging it purely on its technical merits alone seems unfair. I found myself mostly amused by the campiness and clumsy improvisations to which the director had to resort to in order to complete the film. And there were times when I found myself honestly interested with the out of this world story of space invaders who aim to stop humans from creating a doomsday weapon.. With the help of Zombie henchmen! Plan 9 from Outer Space is technically a bad film, no question about that, but I could name a dozen worse and more annoying films easily.

If anybody else could do better than Ed Wood did on a shoe-string budget, then I would like to see it. When George Lucas writes bad dialogue for a film with a $100 million-plus budget, you know it's because he can't write a lick of good dialogue to save his life. When Ed Wood does it for a film with a five day shoot, you forgive him because you know he didn't have a penny for every hundred dollars George Lucas has to produce a movie.I picked up the black and white DVD for the film at the video store for the first time and I ended up watching it three times.

We can only guess.  Could a likely possibility be - to entertain and make money?  He succeeded at both.  (At least in the former.) \nPlan Nine is the story of aliens who plan to use zombies to conquer the earth; yet they only create about three of them for the whole picture:  Tor Johnson, Vampira, and Ed Wood's wife's Chiropractor.  For anyone really interested in the background of this movie and Wood's life, check out Nightmare of Ecstasy, which the movie Ed Wood was based on.  The biography is far weirder (and sadder) than anything that they could have put in the movie or in one of Wood's movies.  One major quibble:  Ed Wood was talentless?  As compared to who?  Unfocussed I think is a more fair word for it. One wonders what would have happened if Wood had had the patience to go to film school for four years.  He would either be more famous or never heard from.  One of life's great what ifs...Reviewers of his movies seem obsessed with either dumping on it (about as easy as harpooning a dead whale) to what purpose, I don't know - or seeing a higher meaning in it which is truly hilarious.  One reviewer even compared Ed Wood to Jesus, though I think he was kidding.  To those critics who say that EVERYTHING about Plan 9 was bad, check it out again (if you haven't seen it, you must); some of the graveyard scenes are more atmospheric (I didn't say good, just atmospheric) than many scare films today.

After killing an old man (played, in stock footage, by Lugosi) , he is miraculously resurrected as a taller, thinner, and considerably younger man who must hide his face behind a black cloak, for reasons which are either too complex for our simple Earth brains to comprehend, or just not explained in the alcohol-fueled mishmash of a screenplay. Initial UFO sighting by the pilots is said to happen at 3.45am, but it also is implied that it is taking place at the same time as the woman's funeral (who has a funeral at 3.45 am?) and everything appears to happen in broad daylight. But the subsequent funerals all appear to be held in the pitch black night, but police arrive on the scene after driving in broad daylight, only to arrive during the same night. The film's abrupt changes from day to night make it seem each scene takes place over the course of about 85 days. Or, can these pompous, nitwit aliens alter the earth's rotation around the sun, without anyone noticing or acknowledging it? Hilariously, insanely awful; this barely even qualifies as a \"film\", as much of the footage seems to be silent footage, or stock/ newsreel footage, with nothing linking it to the other scenes, with background noises and ridiculously dramatic music added to the soundtrack, with some almost completely meaningless original scenes interspersed throughout the reels of film. This, the most infamously inept movie in the history of film, is also one of the funniest, and most watchable, and should be seen at least once by everyone, preferably taking a drink of Sake every time there is a continuity error to further enhance the experience.

Only it's worse than bad. It's a mind-numbing experience without a single inkling of pleasure to be found. Not even a guilty pleasure.

Basically, the aliens are upset because we \"stupid, stupid\" tellurians don't want to believe in them and they throw a fit with their zombies, ray guns, and wobbly flying saucers.Plan 9 from Outer Space is considered a legendary film not only because its notoriously bad, but because of the countless number of defects and continuity flaws and glaring errors that \"grace\" the screen before us as we view it.

We have flying saucers (which are just toys mounted on strings) flying in front of backdrops and we see them wobbling on strings, we see them cast shadows on their backgrounds, we see actors reading from cue cards and in one case, from a script in his lap, we see a microphone shadow on the wall behind the actors in plain view, Gregory Walcott refers to his wife's character by the actress's real name, we have constant inter cutting of daytime and nighttime even though the scenes are suppose to take place simultaneously in the same spot, and basically, yeah, you've got a very laughable production. But what's even greater is Bela Lugosi's part in the film. Lugosi had in fact died while making an earlier Wood film called The Ghoul Goes West or something like that, and the film was scrapped until Wood came up with the idea for this film and just spliced in the few seconds he'd shot with Lugosi into it to market it as Lugosi's last movie. Still, there were some parts where they needed a stand-in for Lugosi. So Wood hired his wife's chiropractor, who looked somewhat like Lugosi, and told him to wear the cape over the lower half of his face all the time. So there'll be moments where the cape's not over his face (the real Lugosi) and a split second later, it's back over his face (the chiropractor) and then back again and it becomes painfully obvious. There's even a moment where the cape starts to fall off and the doctor swiftly puts it back over again. And Wood still used the take, because he almost always used the first one.Despite all of these laughable flaws, which you would expect to spur laughter, Plan 9 from Outer Space still turns out to be a dismally dull excuse for a motion picture. Its plot even defies itself when the aliens, who are so desperate to prove their existence, try to cover up the murders they commit. They don't fear us, so what's with that? While watching it, we find ourselves looking at our watches very early on and nothing from that point on keeps us from repeating that. I'll be honest when I say that I turned off the show a third of the way through and watched something else. I actually did that once, a rare thing for me, and then tried again, actually managing to sit through the entire thing the second time around. Looking at Gregory Walcott perform, who reportedly called the script the worst he'd ever read, we get the impression he hated working on the film and I can understand that, because I hated watching the film. Now some fanatics have called Plan 9 a cult classic and described it as being \"so bad, it's good\". Well, I did not enjoy it one bit, it's no classic in any regard, and I would describe it as \"so bad, it's direful.\" Looking at Ed Wood's films and knowing his story, I still admire him for his passion as a filmmaker, but surely, in those three years when he was trying to work with that Bela Lugosi footage, he surely could have written a compelling script and asked for a second take every once in a while. Maybe if he'd adjusted his style, he might have made a presentable film and perhaps lived up to his idol, Orson Welles. I guess Plan 9 from Outer Space is just a prime example of how some people will never learn. It's a shame, for if Wood's talent matched his ambition, he might be remembered for something other than just being the Worst Director of All Time.",

            "content": "So here it is\u0097what some say is the worst movie ever made\u0097Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space. With its horrid acting, juvenile storytelling, and cheesy special effects, I can see how people come to that conclusion. Perhaps it is that I have watched it for the first time knowing its place in history and its context in the film canon, but I must say I was highly entertained. Were I to have seen it upon original release, I most likely would have been angered about the shoddiness, but today, the unintentional comedy makes it classic and priceless despite the infinite technical shortcomings.You know what is in store straight away with Criswell's introduction. The faux-psychic babble is funny, his delivery funnier, and the way his eyes move to read the script while never looking directly into the camera is hilarious. Once we are ushered into the actual film, inside the cockpit of an American passenger plane, we are finally privy to the wonderful set design. The plane's radio system is an old house phone that is passed between the pilots to speak with the ground and the steering yolks are merely cardboard half circles, which must be grabbed at the elbows during the turbulence caused by our friendly little flying saucer that has come to visit. Surprisingly, besides the first time on screen, the flying saucers are handled quite well without the notice of strings. Even when they exit the home base (a cardboard drawing that the saucers go behind) the depth of field as they fly away is impressive. Anything good about them is later circumvented, however, by the crashing saucer literally being lit on fire and floating around.As for what I called a juvenile story, I say this more for the structure than the ideas at hand. The ideas are actually somewhat heady if one cares to look at them from that angle. The aliens have come to warn Earth that their path of destruction internally could threaten the rest of the universe and they have come to put an end to it. Why they would need to kidnap live humans to take back to their spacestation is never really discussed, only the overall plans of annihilation and Earth's refusal to acknowledge their existence as spoken during a lengthy rant from Dudley Manlove's Eros, probably the best performance of the film, which isn't really saying much. The fact that all this exposition is delivered at the end and in one long scene is only one example of the structure being like a child's story in elementary school. Our narration is very abrupt and used to carry the story through as though it were a puzzle being assembled. Scenes are cut together clumsily and transitions are never smooth.As for the acting, I will say that Bela Lugosi does a fantastic job, never uttering a word. This could be because all his footage was archival and shot before the film was even thought of, but either way some of the stuff is good. Ed Wood shot all his scenes previously and supposedly wrote the story of Plan 9 around that footage so it would all make sense. Kudos to the stand-in for never showing his face, as he needed to be on screen with the new actors for the actual film. Watching cuts from the face-covered man to the actual Bela are priceless moments. All the rest that bear a mention are more for humor's sake. Vampira is plain scary as she lumbers around as a zombie for the entire duration with a lovely makeup job extending her lips almost to her ears; Duke Moore is hilarious as Lt. Harper, not only for his delivery of lines, but because of waving his gun around like it is his finger, pointing at people and scratching his head with it; and last but not least is Tor Johnson, a formidable man once in zombie form, but before that, his accent is so thick and his mind so slow trying to remember his lines, it is the funniest scene of the entire film.So, all in all, if I were judging Plan 9 based solely on achievement and presentation, it could very well be a one or two out of ten score. However, the context in which I have seen it in needs to be a factor and my enjoyment on a comedic level also must be considered. As a result, the film is definitely not the worst I have seen, if only because there are many that tried to be masterpieces yet are horrible. This film was never meant to win an Oscar, but instead was created by a man who never gave up on himself or his craft. Just to have something like this to show for his effort and commitment says something, and when watched as a farce really does end up being an entertaining time at the movies.",

But a true movie buff is recommended to see Ed Wood's notorious PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, at least once.Popularized by Michael and Harry Medved when they named it \"The Worst Movie of all Time\" in their book \"The Golden Turkey Awards\", PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is a must for any film enthusiast and aspiring filmmaker, or to anyone in desperate need of a good laugh. It has it all: Bad acting, laughable script (\"Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!\"), tacky sets (that graveyard set is probably one of the most laughable sets every created), terrible special effects, and of course, bad direction. Can Ed Wood direct? No way! The man has no sense of continuity (settings quickly change from day to night) and he obviously has no keen eye for errors. The dialogue sounds horrible it's worth every laugh; it sounds like Shakespeare on crack. And the worst yet, the movie top-bills Bela Lugosi as its big star... even if he's already dead (Wood merely used home video footage to fill in his role)! Unbelievable! And yet, despite being terrible beyond words, there's something about Wood's non-classic that makes it irresistible. One might consider that it's so bad, it's good, which is probably the biggest reason there is about it. But another thing about it is that PLAN 9 is a movie like no other. Wood may have no real talent whatsoever, but that doesn't really stop him from telling his bizarre tale of an alien race (played by 'actors' wearing goofy costumes) who plan to take over the world by resurrecting an army of dead (well, three of them actually!). We know the rest: The flying saucers (which are ridiculously described early in the film as \"shaped like cigars?!\") are obviously hubcaps suspended in wires, the 'creepy' cemetery is obviously a fake studio set with fog machines and cardboard tombstones, stock footage of the army and a late Bela Lugosi are used (the latter repeatedly), and all these \"future events\" are narrated by then-popular psychic Criswell, who also provides the film's landmark opening speech (\"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about Graverobbers from Outer Space?\").So is PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE the worst movie ever made? Not entirely. For a bad film, and this is a really bad film, PLAN 9 is much too watchable for a bad film, maybe even just for the unintended laughs and the utterly ludicrous ideas. For camp buffs, it's bad movie heaven! Rating: *** out of 5.",

            "content": "That somebody would be legendary director of cheap Z-movies Edward D. Wood Jr. who completed this film in 1956. Considered somewhat of an opus for Wood, Plan 9 From Outer Space is also considered a landmark in \"so bad, it's good\" cinema. When viewed from that perspective, it certainly doesn't disappoint. The many goofs and ridiculous dialog are well known and can be found in short snippets in places like youtube. But if you have 80 or more minutes to kill as I did lying in bed sick today, don't hesitate to check it out. If nothing else it is a good example of a dedicated filmmaker who believed he had something to say, just no funds or talent at his disposal with which to make it.The story is a bit jumbled, obviously thrown together in such a way as to utilize Wood's odd collection of colleagues and vault of stock footage. The narrative stumbles from the very beginning as a pompous narrator begins speaking of \"future events such as these\", and then begins telling a story of what has already happened \"that fateful day.\" I guess he is supposed to be living in the future and sending a warning back in time to the rest of us that aliens may be about to do us harm. Or at least our recently deceased persons. Somehow these aliens are turning recently deceased people into zombies and sicking them on the living. Why? Perhaps either to prove to humanity that aliens do exist, or maybe to somehow warn them about building something called a \"solaranite\" bomb which could wipe out the universe. Try saying the word \"solaranite\" three times fast. The actors Wood hired can hardly say it once. Apparently these aliens have decided that humans are too stupid to realized the consequences of building weapons of mass destruction. Wood was definitely a decade ahead of the large scale anti-war movement in America, but an inept science fiction film like this was certainly not the catalyst that marijuana, LSD, and Grateful Dead music would later prove to be.Anyway, Plan 9 is just too poorly made to either present a coherent message, or even tell a good story. With its horrendous dialog, day/night switches, shoddy props, and poor acting, it is merely a curiosity that has stood the test of time. Films such as this one, R.O.T.O.R., Bigfoot (1970), and Bella Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla, don't need to be good to be entertaining. They can be far more of a joy to watch than any CGI-laden multiplex time waster of our current era. I'll give Wood 3 stars for his effort. And for providing plenty of chuckles for me.

True, Plan 9 is bad, but it's enjoyably bad, like a high school yearbook photo. They were working with baisically no budget, and to me it's much worse when people have the money and still can't make a good film. The idea that the aliens want to destroy us to keep us from developing a bomb so powerful it could destroy the universe is actually kind of thought-provoking, especially from an age where threat of the bomb was always lurking. Had it been handled better, it could have been a twilight-zone style chiller, but even as it is, you can't help but admire Wood's efforts.",

No, they do not. Do any of these other films feature shockingly low budget set design, including cardbord headstones that get knocked over when one of the actors walks past them. No, they do not. Do any of these other surprisingly popular and lucrative theatrical releases star Bela Lugosi, whom (for at least a portion of the film) plays a unspeaking role and for the remainder of the film is replaced by another actor (and I use the term loosely) that looks *NOTHING* like Bela Lugosi but completely fails to obscure this fact by attempting (unsuccessfully) to hide behind a cape held partially over his face in every scene!? No, sadly, they do not.These other films might be considered \"good\", \"successful\", \"ground-breaking\", and even \"legendary\", but they can't hold a candle to Plan 9 from Outer Space; a movie so atrociously bad that it transcends the entire spectrum of good and bad, creating it's own quality-scale on which it is the only participant. It is both horrible and wonderful. It is both stupid and brilliant. It is the alpha and the omega. It is a movie that is so amazingly bad that it wraps all the way around the cinematic universe and returns on the other side becoming a seriously enjoyable diversion.There have been many attempts throughout film history to intentionally create a \"so-bad-it's-good\" movie, but Plan 9 from Outer Space did it first and it did it by complete accident. Ed Wood, the poor director that foisted this cinematic wonder on the world, always thought this movie was his masterpiece, and sadly he didn't live long enough to see it become the cult classic that it is now widely accepted to be.If you plan on watching only one movie from 1957, you should probably watch The Incredible Shrinking Man, it's got some amazing special effects for a movie released in 1957 and it's a fun film. But if you have the chance to watch two or more 1957 movies, try to include Plan 9 from Outer Space, because at the very least, it will help you to appreciate just how bad a movie can be while still being incredibly enjoyable simply by being unintentionally hilarious.",

It's so easy to make fun of for one thing, but also It's incredibly entertaining. Edward D Wood Jr. did this because he wanted too. If he ran into a roadblock he would just say \"Well let's do it another way.\" That really shows in this movie. So the plot. Aliens attempt to take over the world by resurrecting the dead. But they only resurrect 3 zombies and that's it. Vampira plays the first zombie who somehow kills people by wiggling her fingers. The second is sort of but not really Bela Lugosi. Let me tell you what I mean by this. So Lugosi died before the production started but luckily Wood shot silent footage of Lugosi wandering around a cemetery in his Dracula cape which was originally intended for another film. Therefore Wood put these shots into Plan 9. Because you can't exactly fill an entire role with like 5 or 6 minutes of footage he had to get someone in the role to fill in. He got Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor to fill in Lugosi's role. Mason did this by constantly covering his face with the cape. It's credited as Lugosi's last role but you can still tell that Mason is taller than Lugosi and looks nothing like him. The third zombie I will write about later but now I'll talk about other things. The flying saucers for instance. They always seem to be wobbling and quite often you see the strings. They even cast shadows on the outer space back round. And the mother ship look's like it's part of the back round. The aliens look like normal people and one of them acts like a little kid. But the film kind of has an antiwar message because the aliens are trying to stop the people of earth from building a bomb that can destroy the entire universe. Anyway now I will talk about the third zombie. He's played by Sweedish wrestler Tor Johnson who previously worked with Wood in Bride of the Monster. He had no speaking roles in that movie but he does in this one. You realize why he had no lines in Bride of the Monster when you watch this film. He's killed by the two others and eventually becomes the third zombie. It's incredibly funny because he get's stuck trying to come out of the grave. His face became a popular Halloween mask. people have analyzed how bad this film is. But Ed Wood should be applauded for at least getting the film made in the first place. So it can't really be the worst film of a time at all. I've seen plenty worse. And one thing it is not at all in any way, is boring. It's incredibly entertaining and that to me is the whole point of a film. So although it's considered one of the worst films out there, I say it's one of the best.",

Be it in the way or another, it certainly is a display of how not to make a movie.P9FOS is probably the best known movie by inept director Ed Wood Jr. It's his best known because the film is bad in every aspect, not that his other movies were noticeably better. The thing is, that Mr. Woods films were so bad, that he has received a cult following, which in return has made it sure, that he will be remembered long after more better movies of the same era will be forgotten.So what bad about the film: the acting at first. No one really knows how to act, but the script makes it even worse. The dialog is ridiculous and the fact that everyone is uttering their lines so seriously makes it even worse. Or more hilarious. And how about the man, who stands in for Lugosi, because Lugosi never finished filming the movie, because he died in real life, so Eddie boy just threw a cape over a noticeably longer fella and said :\"keep your face cover damn you.\". And the he just reuses a couple of scenes filmed with Lugosi over and over again.The plot is quite an achievement with very little sense, or anything else for the matter, in it. It never really becomes quite clear what the Criswell dude does in the film, or why in fact are the aliens resurrecting the deaders, as from the looks if it, it really is the worst plan like ever. It's just is silly, that they use so much time in waking up three corpses and after that, not really do anything useful with them. The corpses just wander around the cemetery scaring people. And Vampira actually doesn't do nothing else expect looks sexy. In a grim way that is.The sets are quite a sight, like the airplane cockpit with a curtain and no dials or anything else you'd expect to see in a cockpit. Or the cemetery where there's always dark.I could go on and on. If you can figure out a flaw, it's in this movie. In fact I'm sure this movie invented many of them, like cardboard grave stones, which wobble, when an actor accidentally kicks one.My final verdict: as a movie 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' is one of the few really deserving a 1, but when you take it as a camp comedy it goes straight to 10.

Johnny Depp's performance was so endearing that insulting the real Ed Wood is on about the same level as punching a sleeping baby in the face.  But that's not going to stop me from stating the obvious; that Plan 9 is a big piece of crap.As bad as it is, there are loads of movies that better deserve the reputation of being the worst ever made.  Batman Forever is far worse, and less excusable not just because it had a huge budget and actors who could actually act, but because it managed to kill the credibility that Tim Burton had brought with his two perfect movies.  Independence Day is insultingly dumb and wasted every one of its actors, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is British mockney cinema at its worst, and houses the lamest performance in the history of film.  These big budget, widely-distributed, well-cast, money-making turds are far worse than something like Plan 9 because they had more potential; it doesn't come as anything of a surprise to discover that a B-movie from the 50s isn't a work of genius.But what separates these and other stinkers from Plan 9 is that it isn't just bad, it's painfully inept.

Criswell's narration is by far the worst (and therefore best) thing in the film, providing such gems as, `The ever-beautiful flowers she had planted with her own hands became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.\"  It's such a shame that Wood actually thought this had some kind of depth, or even some kind of meaning!The stupidity of the narration is matched by most of the dialogue, and seeing the same shot of Bela Lugosi three times and then his obvious body double brings the film closer to its reputation.  But while these bits are so bad they're good, the rest of the film is just bad.  It's never fun to watch a boring movie, and the dull patches throughout stop its cack-handedness from being fully enjoyable.Poor old Ed Wood.  He couldn't even make a bad movie consistently bad enough to be good!  But you at least have to admire his ambition, however misplaced it may have been.  He was a bad writer, a bad director and a bad producer; truly a multi-talentless man.",

However, some of the \"invasion\" themes were probably well- founded during the popularity of outer-space genre flicks in the late 1950's, since the humorless and closed society of the Soviet Union had launched the first artificial satellite, just one year after invading Hungary to crush the liberal regime elected there in 1956.",

Now the costumes needed just a bit of work, but why nitpick.Our story opens with Criswell (the greatest psychic of all time, sporting the greatest coiffure of all time) setting the stage for the spine-tingling story about to be played out before us. From there, we get tender scenes of Bela Lugosi, the greatest bloodsucker of all time, mourning at his dead wife's funeral. Aliens from space, piloting the greatest flying saucers of all time, resurrect the wife, who is played by Vampira, the greatest television hostess of all time. She also has the greatest 2-inch waist of all time, and wears the greatest low-cut tight black dress of all time, which obviously made her funeral the greatest party of all time.When the guys who buried her turn up dead, Tor Johnson, as Inspector Daniel Clay, springs into action. Johnson, the greatest wrestler of all time, turns in a force-de-Tor performance, proving that you can indeed make an actor out of Clay. His rendering of lines is impeccable. When a detective warns him that the cemetery is dark, Johnson casually shrugs him off by saying \"I vill get one of flashlight from patrol car.\" No one alive (or dead) could deliver a line like that.I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone who has not yet seen this classic, but there are a few more performances that must be considered noteworthy. John Breckenridge, as the leader of the aliens, gives the greatest performance of a gay man not trying to pretend he's not gay. Dudley Manlove, as the alien Eros, gives the greatest exhibition of chest-puffing ever seen on the big screen. Joanna Lee, as the alien Tanna, wears the greatest leggings in the history of legging-dom. And to top it all off, Director Wood snagged two of the greatest superstars from the 1930s ... that's right, Lyle Talbot and Tom Keene.Why wasn't this film nominated as best picture?To quote Dudley Manlove, \"because all you of Earth are idiots!\"",

Watching Vampira with her outstretched arms and bulging eyes coming right at you on my 21' black and white Zenith Television. Famous quote from Edward D. Wood Jr.,goes as follows, \"This we'll be the movie I'll be remembered for!\" Inept film producer Malaprop Cum Lousy Ed Wood with the help of certain film critiques created this art form of inferior, abysmal,flawed films which became the cult classic Plan 9 from Outer Space. G-d knows what the other 8 plans where? I find it interesting that many people around the globe rate this as the worst movie ever made. Maybe they mean the worst watchable movie ever made. Or a film on how not to do a film. Anyway the worst film I ever witnessed was probably in my 12th grade film study class where my classmates where required to produce a film and show it in class. A film produced by Mike DiAngelis and Louie Weiss was the worst movie I ever saw. Famous film critic from Cleveland Nicholas D'Amico claimed that one of Ed woods talents was how quickly he could bang out a screen play in one day and in All cases it showed on the screen. Plan 9 has all the characteristics of what a movie shouldn't have. Poor editing, Poor continuity,endless faux pas by the actors, inferior writing and of course Poor direction. All the ingredients for this masterpiece of accidental finger painting which over time is pleasing to the eye despite the mistakes . Maybe the blunders are the attraction as we look for then next mishap to be shown. Hearing impaired individuals are even fascinated watching this mess with a smattering of stock footage thrown in for flavor despite the lack of subtitles. Wood would probably misspelled half the words.There are highlights noteworthy despite the finished product. The scene when Vampira (Maila Nurmi) comes right at you with those bulging, terrifying eyes and those nails a Five Town Long Island Girl would be proud to have. Inspector Clay played by heavy set bald Tor Johnson was another scene well done. We see Inspector Clay's grave and the earth moving as the rotund man rises from the dead. Despite the mess I loved it! They should have regular festivals for this movie and if they do, bring your happy face and a friend and enjoy the Ed Wood experience.",

One of the dead is even placed in a mausoleum (a small square play house, about 5,5 ft. in height and 6 ft. in depth). The two dead then turn into zombies and start walking around killing other people, and - and this is the \"scary\" part - they do this because the corpses are being controlled by aliens. This is \"Plan 9\", by the way: Resurrecting dead people. The aliens in question get around in a wobbly flying saucer (that's shaped like a cigar, according to an eye witness. I've never seen the similarity between a cigar and a saucer myself, but...), that leaves a shadow on the sky behind it. They are lead by the sissy of the year, who is for some reason wearing a long shirt with a picture of a medieval battle-axe on it.The goal of these aliens is to stop humanity from destroying the universe. In the future (that is now the past), they claim, humanity will \"stumble upon\" the solar...something - a bomb that explodes the rays of the sun. When this happens, the whole universe will go down the drain, since our sun's rays apparently reaches the entire universe. This quite questionable science fact had me laughing the hardest.Of course, the only three people actually being involved with the aliens aren't too keen on being wiped out for the sake of every other existence, and hence begins the battle between the races; the battle consisting of a small fist-fight between one alien and a pilot. After that the solid metal cigar-shaped saucer catches fire somehow, and humanity is saved.As a serious movie, this is a catastrophe. There seems to be no lower limit to the low budget; the same scene can be used up to 5 times over, nearly a quarter of the movie is old military or other archive footage, for the most part the background is a black or a gray sheet, and because of this the movie can shift from night to day 4 times in a minute.So why would I give this 5/10? Well, partly because the cast and crew of this wreck actually took their work seriously, and I'm willing to give them credit for trying. They did their best with the quite poor raw material they were given.The biggest reason, though, is that this is one of my favorite comedies - especially with the Riff Trax commentary. There are so many silly details and flaws in this film that I could write an essay about them, but they do ensure that you won't have a dull moment watching \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".",

And remember, my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.' Thus the 'Psychic' Criswell portentously introduces us to our story and gives us a taste of the wisdom and inane dialogue to follow in the unbelievably bad PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.Paula Trent: 'I've never seen you in this mood before.' Jeff Trent: 'I guess that's because I've never been in this mood before.'Jeff is in this unusual mood because he is a pilot (we know this because we have seen him sitting in his uniform in front of a shower curtain) and has recently seen a flying saucer. Intuitive as his wife may be, Jeff has been told by 'the army brass' to keep quiet about the 'saucers from up there' and this makes Jeff angry. In the meantime something strange is happening in the graveyard near Jeff's house.As the police arrive to investigate the strange goings on, a stagehand's torch beam sweeps across the set and we hear a whooshing sound. Inspector Dan Clay (Tor Johnson), delivering dialogue in a way that makes Schwarzennegger sound like Olivier, decides to go off on his own to investigate. Suddenly he is surrounded (yes, surrounded) by two people, one a man holding a black cape in front of his face and the other a narrow-wasted contender for the role of Morticia in the THE ADDAMS FAMILY, only with an expression that looks as though she's just been impaled on something. They both shamble toward Clay like cartoon sleepwalkers as he futilely fires his revolver at them. There is a bloodcurdling shriek. The other officers dash over to find the mutilated (well, slightly scratched) body of Clay lying there like a beached whale (or in fact like a body of clay). Using his gun barrel like a finger, pushing his hat back and scratching his cheek, Lt. Harper's keen mind quickly takes in the situation:Lt. Harper: 'One thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible.' Patrolman Larry: 'Well, I guess that's why you're a Detective Lieutenant and I'm still a uniformed officer.'When flying saucers are seen over Hollywood and Washington D.C. the army is quickly put on alert and dispatch loads of stock footage to depict their mobilisation. Planes, tanks and artillery bombard silver paper plates suspended by wires in front of a painted sky, but to no avail. The saucers wobble off across the screen as quickly as they came.Pilot Jeff meanwhile has to head off back 'up there' and is in uniform and about to leave the house, for some reason carrying a small handbag/purse. He is of course concerned about his lovely, but not too bright, wife's safety whilst he is away:Jeff Trent: 'You promise you'll lock the doors immediately?' Paula Trent: 'I promise. Besides, the saucers are up there. The graveyard is out there. But I'll be locked up in there. So off you go to your wild blue yonders.'And so it goes on. PLAN 9 is of course infamous and acclaimed by some as 'The Worst Movie Ever Made' and has been awarded Golden Turkey Awards in both Worst Film and Worst Director of All Time categories by the Medved brothers. It certainly lives up to these accolades with it's wobbly sets, pathetic 'special' effects, execrable dialogue, wooden and melodramatic performances, awful direction and it's dreadful exploitation of about five minutes of footage of the once great Bela Lugosi, shot by Wood four years earlier, shortly before Lugosi's death, for a totally different project (TOMB OF THE VAMPIRE), and which is used repeatedly when his role of 'Ghoul Man' is not being filled by a stand in who bears no resemblance to Lugosi, even with the cape concealing his face. Many viewers regard it as the ultimate spoof of 'B' horror movies, sadly though Wood was taking his subject deadly seriously but was just totally inept at putting it on the screen. This isn't a spoof \u0096 it's just terribly bad. It came out in 1959, and over the next two years we would be treated to spectacular films like THE TIME MACHINE, MASTER OF THE WORLD, MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA and DR.NO. So while we might admire Wood's enthusiasm, by 1959 his ideas, techniques and lacklustre skills were already 20 years out of date. Edward D. Wood Jr. himself has become known to a wider audience through Tim Burton's 1994 movie ED WOOD which starred Johnny Depp as the hapless transvestite director and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, a role for which he won an Oscar.Remember, if you laughed at this film, I remind you of the great Criswell's closing remarks:'My friend, you have seen this incident, based on sworn testimony. Can you prove that it didn't happen? Perhaps, on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it... for they will be from outer space. We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio and even television, and now some of us laugh at outer space... God help us in the future.'",

The joke was that Bela Lugosi signed-on before the script was ready. A few pleminary shots were taken at the woods and graveyard, and also in/around a house and audiences could see his face. Then, when Bela finally got the script, he exclaimed a Native American phrase, \"It's a good day to die!\" Much of the movie had a stand-in slowly stalking around with his black cape covering his face.Again, Plan 9 From Outer Space is a hoot today for anyone who has seen it decades ago.

A film with a cult following who whole heartedly agree that the movie sucks, and in fact cite that as their reason for their devotion and adoration? I could complain and recite the film's shortcomings, but what's the point? It falls flat on so many levels that it's either hysterically funny in its overwhelming deficiencies or depressing. How did the film hit me? I'm part of the latter crowd.Watch the opening of the film as Criswell makes his infamous speech, featuring eloquent redundancy in phrases like, \"And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.\" If this cracks you up, great. Enjoy the ride because there's plenty more where that came from. If you cringe at the abysmal writing, shut down the DVD immediately and gather your friends, a few drinks, and get your own MST3000 commentary running. If with the friends, the drinks, and commentaries, you have not laughed by the time Bela's significantly taller double appears on screen and lurks around the fake sets hunched over hiding his face behind the Dracula cape \u0096 then just return the damn thing and get your money back.Me personally? I thought I knew what I was getting into \u0096 I mean, the thing advertises itself as \"the worst movie ever made\" and then there's the \"Almost starring Bela Lugosi\" bit. Not to mention the film's long running and widely known reputation. Sounds like an invitation to go bad movie bashing . . . and I couldn't even enjoy gunning for the film. It wasn't just bad, I found it obnoxiously bad as though Wood intentionally tried to make this film a black comedy/spoof but went into serious overkill. And . . . and . . . supposedly Wood sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after viewing the Plan 9 companion special feature on the DVD, I have trouble believing Wood's sincerity.I know better than this \u0096 I know better than asking logical questions within the context of a film like Plan 9, but how could you sincerely write the dialogue for superior aliens that goes, \"You and your stupid minds! Stupid! STUPID!\" It upset every writing instinct in my body, and despite having overwhelming reasons to laugh and mock Wood's virtuosity in the art of crap, it just irritated me.Anyway, I did find Tor Johnson's zombie face hilarious every time he made it to the screen. The \"disguise\" technique for Lugosi's stand in was entertaining at first, but faded to obnoxious by the second time it came up. A handful of other grin/chuckle moments spiced the film, such as how the alien vessels are constantly referred to and shown to be \"Saucers\", later Jeff tells us they were \"shaped like cigars\" and the sets were mysteriously yet distinctly rectangular in shape. Hmmm. I also liked how the interior to the high and mighty aliens' space ship had a wooden tables where electrical crap rested.It goes without saying the Plan 9 sucks, and it's completely unnecessary for a critic to really bash the film for being a crappy movie \u0096 just as its unnecessary to hear another critic recite the famous praise of Citizen Kane The real question and issue surrounding Plan 9 is \"will the viewer enjoy the film for what Plan 9 is?\" Do you love the film or hate the film for the established fact that it is a terrible, terrible, movie?

At least they could have found a body double that wasn't two freakin' feet taller the Bela! This is a lesson to all inspiring filmmakers of what not to do. I give this ultimate TURKEY...THE NOOSE!",

At the beginning of the 80s some people voted this film for the worst movie ever made: there are flying saucers fixed on visible wires, a wobbling set decoration, a constant illogical change between night and day in each individual scene and a Bela Lugosi-double that always holds his cape in front of his face because the original main actor had died to early. Nevertheless this film is really worth a look and although it is horrible directed it has a higher cult status than other meaningless Z-grade productions have! The actors are surprisingly good, but the most memorable parts come from Tor Johnson as bald headed zombie as well as Vampira as vampire lady, however both give the worst performances in the whole film. \"Plan 9 from outer space\" is the ideal party movie to laugh your head off! In 1994 director Tim Burton filmed an homage to his idol with Johnny Depp playing the main character Ed Wood, but I think it is more a typical Hollywood-clich\u00e9 production than a real portrait..!

This is no \"Michael Rennie moment\", this is passion and rage and a calculated revelation of humanity's true nature.Ed marries vision and talentlessness like no director before or after him. Ed's insight into the human condition is marred only by his inability to translate it to the screen with any coherence or intelligence.

From 'Bride Of The Monster',to his later porno era films,he has given us a few greasy giggles. 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' is easily his 'Citizen Kane' (which is funny,as he always fancied himself a bargain basement Orson Welles). The plot (?) concerns an alien invasion, intended to re-animate the dead,thus making the alien invasion of the Earth even easier. Somewhere along the way,Bela Lugosi figures into this mish mash as one of the recent undead (it's known that Lugosi's footage was actually filmed for an unfinished vampire movie that Wood abandoned when Lugosi died during production a few years earlier, but ended up using Lugosi's scenes,none the less). Lots of laughable special effects,such as the Table Talk pie tins that are used as space ships,as well as lots of stock footage left over from other no budget thrillers,make this somewhat unintentional bit of surrealism all the more fun. This is the perfect kind of film to toss on at a party for hoots. No MPAA rating here, but too bizarre to rate.",

Famously, in that book, they named \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\" the worst movie of all time, and the immortal Edward Davis Wood Jr., the Worst Director of All Time.I was fascinated. I had to find out more, but as this was the early days of home video, I couldn't. I first spied clips of this cinema disasterpiece on David Letterman's \"Late Night,\" probably not long after it started airing in 1982. Naturally, that whetted my appetite for more. The next year, I was off to college, where I eventually got my first glimpse of PNFOS during a late-night screening full of stoned college students who hooted non-stop at the screen. (As a veteran of many showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show I was quite prepared for such rowdy behavior in this case.) Some time later, a tape of the film found its way into my hands, where I could subject it to repeat viewings and further study. It was during these repetitive viewings I discovered what many others have discovered about Ed Wood and his films: what he utterly lacked in technique, he more than made up for in enthusiasm and sheer love of movies, especially the escapist fare he grew up with: western serials, Universal horror films and slapstick comedies.In spite of himself, Ed has provided the ages with timeless entertainment. No, he was not trying to make \"bad\" movies. He was trying to make the best movies could with the (tiny) budgets he had to deal with. He poured his heart out into his product, and that is clearly visible on the screen. If love translated into box office, than PNFOS would have taken in more money than Titanic. Sure, so many people rated this movie a zero, but as Ed reminded us, that is because \"You of Earth are stupid, stupid, stupid!!\" I will readily admit that Plan Nine From Outer Space is not for everyone. But if you turn off your brain, listen closely (because some of his dialog is impossible to understand), and enter the twisted world of Edward Davis Wood, Jr. I believe you will be in for a wild and goofy journey of fun. Ed Wood's world is a world that looks kind of like our own world at first glance, but clearly after viewing, you will be convinced that his films truly do come from some other planet.",

But, its claim to fame is that is the overwhelming view that it is the worst movie ever made! The negative publicity has made many, including me, watch this movie. It's not surprising that the film enjoys a cult status today!Originally titled as Grave Robbers from Outer Space, the idea of aliens robbing graves is absurd and ludicrous. But, guess what? They have a benign intention to save the Universe. And how do they do it? By keeping earthlings busy with zombies, they can prevent humans from creating a mega-weapon that could destroy the universe. Noticeable lapses are cheap production design characterized by cardboard sets and overuse of curtains, irrespective of whether the scene was of a house, an alien ship or a cockpit. Of them all, the cockpit was the worst with flimsy looking controls, radio tied to the suits of one of the pilots and a boom mike visible occasionally. The movie totally lacks special effects although Hollywood was already into shooting films with special effects. Scenes like the spaceship flying, etc., are extremely tacky. Probably it had to with its abysmally low budget. Budgets that are way below even B-movies, this film is a classic example of what are called Z-grade movies. Making matters worse for the film are its incoherent and pointless script which wavers between being comical to silly to sometimes preachy. Repetitive footage of cars or flying saucers does get irritating after a point. Examples of poorly written dialog include \"my friends, the future events will affect you in the future\"The biggest goof was to recycle stock footage of Bela Lugosi from an abandoned project 'Tomb of the Vampire' which was shelved after the actor's death in 1956. This way, director Ed Wood could use Lugosi's name in the credits to promote the movie.A 1994 film tilted 'Ed Wood' was based on the life of the the director of this film. The film was directed by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp playing Ed Wood and it portrays the outlandish antics resorted to by the film crew to make Plan-9. In a way, it was this Academy Award winning film that made me curious to know more about Plan-9.In fact, the real life director who was infamous for making low budget films was posthumously awarded the Golden Turkey Award for being the worst director ever. Another of his films 'Glen or Glenda' too ranks among the worst films ever made. Nevertheless, it is believed that Wood, a big fan of Orson Welles, was proud of the fact that he donned multiple hats as writer, actor, director, editor simultaneously.Plan-9's cult status is justified as it represents the nadir of Hollywood. But, unless someone told you, one may have never heard of it; the movie channels ignore it too. If you are a film aficionado, do watch it; at least you can say that you have seen one of the worst movies ever made in Hollywood's rich cinematic history.",

Second, they raise three random people from the dead, taking care not to let anyone know they are responsible for this (It could blow their cover.) The dead people, acting on the orders of the aliens, wander aimlessly around a graveyard. One of them even goes into a nearby house and horrifies a woman by walking slowly and staring at her. Finally, the aliens cleverly reveal their entire plan to a trio of snoopers who manage to find their ship (It was hidden behind a tree.) They explain to the Earthlings that they fear Earth will one day discover how to make a Solaranite bomb that will explode the sun. Then they explain to the Earthlings exactly how the Solaranite bomb works.

The dialogue is awkward and nonsensical, the set looks like it was borrowed from an elementary school play, and the acting makes Keanu Reeves look like Sir Lawrence Olivier.

PLAN NINE is the only film I know of that has undergone so much discussion not for being a good film, but because it considered so bad.

I will say that PLAN NINE, despite containing so many technical errors that would give a high school film class student an \"F\", dialog written with no ear to how people really talk and sounds like it was written for a radio show, and mostly inept or indifferent acting, PLAN NINE is not the worst movie ever made. It is however one the most watchable \"bad\" movies ever made. Anyone watching it for the first time will stay glued to the screen. Its certainly more watchable that other notorious turkeys like FRANKENSTEIN ISLAND or recent big Hollywood flops like THE SKULLS. It certainly isn't even the worst film from Ed Wood, that would be JAIL BAIT, a film that can only be watched once. At least with PLAN NINE, Wood kept things moving. PLAN NINE merits repeated viewings, turkeys like ROCKET ATTACK USA and THE CREEPING TERROR can only be viewed more than once by viewers with high tolerance for boredom. At least Ed Wood's film badness is due to naive ineptitude, not the kind of jaded, cynical ineptitude found in bad films from the same era like THE ASTOUNDING SHE MONSTER or KING DINOSAUR or the dozens of God awful slasher movies of recent vintage.

Now I wasn't expecting much since I'd heard that this was one of the worst movies ever made, and secondly, it was a cheesy sci-fi flick from the 1950's.The best thing I can say about this movie is \"amateurish.\" The acting is pretty stiff and the sets are laughable. For instance, some of the grave stones & crosses in the cemetery are apparently very fake since some of the actors almost knock them over in some scenes, the high-tech equipment of the spaceship consists of some old electronic equipment sitting on a wooden table along with a Jacob's ladder (the two wires sticking up with sparks rising upwards between them), and one of the props is actually a blinking warning light from a traffic barricade. Then there's the constant switching between day & night in the same scenes.Then there's the plot. The aliens have apparently tried to contact government officials to tell them to not develop a new bomb which would set sunlight on fire and destroy the galaxy. But the government ignored the aliens, so the best plan (Plan 9) they can come up with is to raise a few recently deceased earthlings from the dead to show their power. But in reality all it seems to do is spread confusion.Overall, if you're a big fan of cheesy 50's sci-fi flicks or you like to make fun of bad movies, you might enjoy this film. That's the only way anyone could really watch this the whole way through.",

I've seen some movies that deserved an F that I just hated! The thought of watching those types of movies just makes me mad and irritated.  However, with Plan 9, it was an F-movie that makes you laugh.I compare it to William Hung, who went on 2004's American Idol and did that hilariously awful rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs.\"  Sure Mr. Hung's performance made you laugh (especially when he stunned Randy and Simon by saying he never took a singing class), but among the class of professional singers out there, Mr. Hung can only get an F.  He should not be singing, as Ed Wood really shouldn't have been making movies.Ed Wood's story in Plan 9 was just ridiculous and corny, and there was nothing he could do to overcome the shortcomings he faced when making this movie (Bela Lugosi's death, Vampira being contractually forbidden from speaking in this movie, etc.)  And let's not forget about the hilarious \"special effects\" and the wonderful space-like sets.  I'm surprised to see that this movie was made on a $60,000 budget.

What can be said about it? It defies any traditional movie-making conventions and does it without any shame whatsoever. Wood had to have the cast baptized in order to make this bizarre film, and that's the least strange thing about it. The original title Grave Robbers from Outer Space was later ditched, but Criswell mentions it during the intro nevertheless. Plan 9 is promoted as \"almost starring Bela Lugosi\" because he died before the film could even get finished, and the footage of Lugosi from this film was originally filmed by Wood to be included as a part of his movie The Ghoul on the Moon, which never got made, so Wood just shoehorned those scenes (which just involve Lugosi walking around by his house and later by a cemetery) in Plan 9. Wood's wife's chiropractor Tom Mason substituted Lugosi (despite looking nothing like him).Ed Wood tried to send and anti-war message in Plan 9, and while some of the themes he brings up do sound interesting, they ended up being so hilariously mishandled that you just can't help but laugh at them. From the technical side, nothing in this movie works. The wobbly, cheap sets ft. cardboard gravestones and beat-up fences, the super-fake flying saucers held by visible wires, the awkward transitions between the daytime and nighttime shots (and some other poor uses of day-for- night photography), the lousy editing, the bad interspersion of stock footage of soldiers and actual scenes that were shot for the film, the visible equipment, etc. etc.The acting is, of course, atrocious as well. Most of the actors sound wooden and uninterested (Mona McKinnon as Paula Trent), some completely ham it up (Dudley Manlove as Eros), and some are barely intelligible (Tor Johnson as Dan Clay). The dialogues are absolutely nonsensical and just further attenuate the film's anti-logic (\"We contacted government officials. They refused our existence.\"). In Ed Wood's universe, outer space has an atmosphere and flying saucers are described as resembling cigars. Not only that, but Criswell's narration is overly dramatic without any real sense of measure (\" The beautiful flowers she had once planted, with her own hands, became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.\" - WTF does that even mean???) However, the music is actually pretty cool.Plan 9 is such a beautiful disaster of a film that one just can't love it enough. So far it's been colorized, there's a remake in the works and it also spawned a series of popular Halloween masks based on Tor Johnson's face. I mean, what's not to love...\"Perhaps, on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it... For they will be from OUTER SPACE!\"",

The plot, if one could call it that is about a race of aliens looking to invade Earth using an army of the dead, which can be controlled by Electro guns.There are several cases of night turning into day, and day into night, and a scene where a police officer scratches his head with a loaded gun. This all in addition to severe overuse of stock footage to advance the plot.That all being said, Plan 9 is not with out charm. It is the perfect b level low budget film. It is entertaining, funny in spots where its not supposed to be, and filled with enough over the top scene chewing acting, It really is a so bad it's good style movie.However, I don't think that Ed Wood should still have the honor of being the worst director of all time.

So appallingly amateurish and nonsensical that it falls well into the \"so bad it's great\" category.You have to admire Ed Wood's earnestness. He loved cinema; he loved everything about it, the way it could create vast new worlds, new stories, new characters; he loved the willing suspension of disbelief; he loved the magic; and he loved making films... He just had absolutely no talent for it whatsoever. Seen through his rapturous directorial gaze, toys on strings became menacing UFOs from beyond the galaxy, tombstones cut out of corrugated cardboard became a sinister graveyard, and a curtained room containing a desk and some scavenged ham radio equipment became the interior of an orbiting space station. Ed made friends with aging, forgotten horror film star Bela (Dracula) Legosi, and got him to return to the screen for one last kick at the can for this film, but Legosi died during filming, so Ed hired his wife's chiropractor - who played all of his scenes with his cape over his face - to fill in.The acting, dialog, plotting, editing, continuity, lighting and literally every other aspect of the production, all are astoundingly, mind-freezingly bad. Police cars race to the scene in broad daylight, only to arrive moments later in pitch darkness. Toy flying saucers on clearly-visible strings wobble pitiably over stock footage of downtown Hollywood, or worse yet, before painted sky backdrops against which the saucers' shadows appear. At one point, one of the saucers flies away in flames, and it looks as if someone just poured lighter-fluid over the model and lit it. The cast is a motley assemblage comprised of a washed-up late-show horror movie hostess (Vampira, who plays her role mute), a wrestler with an unintelligible accent (Tor Johnson), the earnest but numbingly stupid son of one of the film's investors (who at the last minute apparently made funding contingent upon his son playing the lead role), and various other bit players dredged from the bottom of Hollywood's endless barrel of extras. Hack TV \"psychic\" Criswell provides a barely-coherent narration (he begins by referring to everything we're about to see as \"future events\" then immediately switches tenses and tries to tell us that everything is \"based on the sworn testimony of the poor souls who survived this ordeal.\" Are we supposed to assume that they survived the ordeal... in the future? Apparently so.)Pre-adolescent kids borrowing dad's video camera could do as well, perhaps better. But somehow, the absurdity of it all has captured people's hearts, and I think it has a lot to do with just how much Ed poured his love of cinema into this film, colossally inept though it is.It's pointless (not to mention nearly impossible) to outline the plot of Plan 9, such as it is. Suffice to say that it involves some aliens whose plan (the \"Plan 9\" of the title; what happened to plans 1 through 8?) is to resurrect the recent dead using some sort of an \"electrode gun.\" Why? In the words of one of the aliens: \"Because... of... DEATH! Because all you Earth people are IDIOTS!\" It's great fun, and actually stands up to repeated viewings, in order to catch yet more glorious moments of ineptitude in all their splendour. For those who want to know more about Ed Wood (including his infamous transvestism and angora fetish; he apparently directed at least some of Plan 9 in drag) you probably can't do better than Tim Burton's eponymous film, starring Johnny Depp as Ed and Martin Landau as Legosi.",

The quality of Plan 9 From Outer Space is awful in every way: awful script, awful acting, awful dialogue, awful special effects, awful sets and props, awful editing, etc., but it's this all-around awfulness that give Plan 9 From Outer Space its appealing charms. Many will be able to find the awfulness to be quite hilarious, and this certainly is a fun movie to watch with friends. It is non-stop flubs and hilarious awfulness right from the movie's very beginning with the segment \"Criswell Predicts.\" Oh that Criswell; the hair style, the monotone voice, and the ridiculous things he says in his opening segment! Criswell also is narrator at times during the movie, and has the silly, closing segment at the end. The movie concerns flying saucers (which are really hubcaps) flying over Hollywood and Washington, D.C. One of the saucers lands in a cemetery in Southern California with its two aliens planning on executing Plan 9. Plan 9 is their plan to take over the world by reviving the recent dead as murdering slaves. They need to take over the world due to man's increased knowledge in making bombs, because they know of a bomb that would explode the entire universe and are fearful earthmen will also learn of this bomb. Bela Lugosi had limited footage shot for this movie when he died, so when his character is revived from the dead he is sometimes Bela and sometimes portrayed by a much taller actor covering his face with a cape (as if we couldn't tell it isn't always Bela!) T.V. Horror movie hostess Vampira is also one of the revived dead, and looks quite silly as a creature of horror with super-long fingernails. Shots of Vampira wandering through the cemetery in search of victims actually seem semi-classy in an odd sort of way; like a cemetery Mona Lisa. Tor Johnson also falls victim, and the effects of him rising from the grave are hilarious (he seems to have difficulty getting out of the ground; the giant tombstone before the grave is also shown in an unconvincing miniature, which then plops into the open grave after Tor has climbed out.) The scenes of the alien invaders (Dudley Manlove and Joanna Lee, who also starred in The Brain Eaters) are also unintentionally humorous; especially when they report to their flaming, hand-waving leader (John \"Bunny\" Breckinridge.) There's a scene of saucers over Washington, D.C. where the military goes into action, and we are shown nothing but military stock footage of the ordeal. Some of the scenes don't match up in filmed footage from one shot to the next, and night scenes are bright as day at times! At times actors (the gravediggers) are badly overdubbed, and other times it is apparent actors are reading off of cue cards! Many parts of the sets are reused over again to portray other sets, and the cemetery is totally unconvincing with its cardboard tombstones and little cardboard crypt. The airplane set is a hoot, and so are the plane's controls! The science fiction elements are mildly interesting, but often seem unlikely. The acting is totally incompetent, and Plan 9 From Outer Space contains some of the silliest dialogue ever heard! To watch this film with a critical seriousness would make Plan 9 From Outer Space to be one of the worst movies ever made, but because of its flubs and ineptness it is often enjoyable and may provide many laughs.",

Sure it's an hilarious, amateurishly made film that Ed Wood thought was \"Art,\" but consider the time when it was made. American military might was unquestioned, and it was a given that whatever we did was the right thing to do; in that light, this is an amazingly subversive movie for 1958. The aliens are trying to save us from ourselves as well as trying to save the rest of the universe; jet jockey Jeff Trent (Gregory Wolcott) is a stereotypically lunkheaded example of 1950's militaristic thinking- he won't listen to reason, assuming that possession of the Solaranite bomb would only make America stronger. Bigger and better bombs were the key to survival to such people. He is indeed the headstrong young fool Eros (Dudley Manlove) pegs him as.Of course, along came Vietnam and proved that more and better technology wasn't necessarily the answer to a determined enemy who saw his survival, and that of his people, at stake.The film is an impassioned plea for arms control when general public opinion held that those who advocated it were fools, Communists or tools thereof.",

            "content": "First off, let's get down to facts. Despite the fascination for Ed Wood, his life, his times, he made really lousy cheap movies.I have suffered through a plethora of bad films, but \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is hardly the worst. As a matter of fact, I find it alternately fascinating, hilarious and simply bizarre.We all know the shots of the cardboard graves moving, the night into day into night sequences, the ridiculously human and effeminate aliens, the tin foil flying saucers, the ludicrous replacement of Lugosi (who died during the filming) for a \"lookalike\" -- the obviously younger and taller Tom Mason, chiropractor.I've seen this film at least seven times and I would watch it again and again.The presence of the foppish and hammy Criswell is a big plus. For me, the scene where Duke Moore as a police lieutenant scratches his head with the barrel of his revolver is priceless.And say what you will about the talentless Wood, the images of Tor Johnson and Maila Nurmi as \"Vampire Girl\" walking through the graveyard are veritable horror icons, right up there with Karloff as Frankenstein's monster and even Lon Chaney in his \"London After Midnight\" makeup.I don't know if we needed Wood's story told in a movie, but \"Ed Wood\" seems to lovingly record so many of the quirks of Wood's life. And Martin Landau's performance as Lugosi is uncanny.Personally, I get a bigger kick out of the actual documentaries about Ed. \"Look Back In Angora\" is a telling portrait of the frustrated movie director/cross-dresser.What Wood lacked in talent he more than made up for in sheer will and a great love of horror movies.I believe the public became aware of Ed Wood when the Medved brothers proclaimed \"Plan 9\" as the worst movie ever made in their \"Golden Turkey\" award book on bad films.I've watched most of Ed Wood's films and find them all pretty terrible. \"Bride of the Monster\" is almost as fun as \"Plan 9\". \"Night of the Ghouls\" and \"Orgy of the Dead\" are truly rotten. And I mean that in the sense that I don't really want to watch them again.But \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is always a fun romp for me. I marvel at the homeliness of the leading lady Mona McKinnon. I am amazed at Ms. Nurmi's waistline. O.K., I'll confess it, I love her!I give this movie a '6', which is the best rating I give any bad film. You want bad films? Try sitting through \"Poor Pretty Eddie\" with Leslie Uggams. Try making it through \"Alligator People\". Try watching the 'comedy' \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" with real talents like Steve Martin and Michael Caine. Now THOSE are bad movies.Hell, try sitting through \"Dances With Wolves\"....talk about putrid. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",

            "review_title": "Avant garde masterpiece?!?",
            "content": "Camp classic?  Anti-political propaganda?  Avant-garde masterpiece?  Who can say?  This winner of the Worst Film of All Time Award (by the Medved brothers' book The Golden Turkey Awards) has been delighting people for years. With the renewed interest of Ed Wood in the past 20 years, one must really ask, for what reasons is this film really being enjoyed?  In Cult Movies, Danny Peary wrote a tongue-in-cheek piece about  how Ed Wood was being critical of government and escaped trouble with the censors because no-one would ever read such subtext in such a Grade Z movie (although he was just kidding when he wrote the piece, he later believed what he wrote after seeing other films by Mr.Wood).  In RE:SEARCH Incredibly Strange Films, Grade-Z master Ted V.Mikels talks of people who have been saying for 20 years how much they've wanted to make a movie, yet still have done nothing about it.  So whatever you can say about the non-achievements of a 5 buck movie that made it to the screen, one has to admire its maker for striving to do it at all costs, even at the expense of credibility.  Instead of being one of too many people who talk of doing things then have mid-life crises because they've done nothing, at least they made the damn thing instead of just yammering about it.  In the article \"Bad Movies\" (collected in his book, Vulgar Modernism), J. Hoberman dryly writes of the avant-garde aspects of Grade Z filmmaking, that they suspend normal movie logic with the diverse fragments they use to piece movies together.  Some of this work is done by people who realize in the editing room that they're not cut out to be a filmmaker after all, and try to fix it.   Then, after one or two stabs at cinema, they bail, never to be seen again in the film world. Then there are people who actually make a career out of making Grade Z cinema, stuffed with ingredients of inane scripting, acting, dialogue, props, lighting, editing, etc.  What are they  thinking?  Are they just out to make a fast buck (or a tax write-off)?  Are they sincere that they're making art?If you read the interviews with these legendary Grade Z heroes in RE-SEARCH Incredibly Strange Films, you are flabbergasted at the clarity of these people discussing their craft.  Their contempt for the Hollywood system mirrors that of the players in the New American Cinema, circa 1943 to 1966. The stirring realization is that they choose to make these no-buck exploitation pictures, because they will contend with no Hollywood big shot telling them how to make their movies!  In an interview with Rudolph Grey (for his book, Nightmare of Ecstacy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.), Vampira describes the making of PLAN 9 this way: \"...someone came to me and said Ed Wood is doing a movie.  He's got filmclips of the SINCERELY YOURS premiere, with Liberace, the fans outside, he's got film clips of flying saucers, he's got stock footage of jeeps and Army stuff, and he's got some old discards of Bela Lugosi movies, cut-outs from his other films, he's gonna put it all together, and he's written a script around it, and he's sending to you.\"  In other words, Ed Wood had this movie well-planned- HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING!So, as tongue-in-cheek as Hoberman may be in his \"Bad Movies\" article, he indeed has a point (in fact, if you look at the classic Grade-Z films in an avant-gardist frame of mind, a whole new realm of creative possibilities occur).  Think of the cinema of avant-garde filmmakers Bruce Conner or Craig Baldwin: both men create films with narrative threads, yet from found footage, scraps of diverse subject matter shot years and miles apart, married in the editing room to form its own language.  For example, one decoupage in Conner's A MOVIE has a stock shot of a submarine crewman looking in a periscope, followed by footage of a bikinied sunbather, followed by a stock shot of a submarine jettisoning a torpedo.  Consider this synopsis of Baldwin's 1999 film SPECTRES OF THE SPECTRUM: \"...a treasure trove of early television shows, industrial and educational films, Hollywood movies, advertisements, and cartoons, combining these with original live-action footage, no-budget special effects and relentless narration to generate a wholly original paranoid science-fiction epic\". Baldwin himself puts it best: \"My filmmaking process is a form of ventriloquism.  I use found footage as a puppet to mount my political arguments in visual terms... What better weapon to use against mainstream society than the stuff that they consider obsolete garbage. That for me is perverse revenge.\"  Or to put it more bluntly, it is the garbage art movement of the 60's put to moving pictures: take useless junk, put it in a collage and people will then admire it.It is arguable whether Ed Wood was intending to be subversive in his threadbare collection of stock footage, intercut with his own washed-out bargain basement visuals.  Because it  is so inane, no-one would notice any dissident intentions, if indeed Wood had any.  Perhaps Ed Wood was genuinely trying to break into the Hollywood mainstream with his peculiar cinema, but it is likely that in his later 8mm porn loop years, he had somewhat accepted his fate in the fringes, even if he still kept trying until his last breath to escape it.  It is another probable truth that while trying to deliver entertainment pictures, he also felt inclined to include a message.  Lest we forget, his first completed feature, GLEN OR GLENDA, was a plea for people to regard transvestites as normal; BRIDE OF THE MONSTER ended with stock footage of a mushroom cloud (surely because he couldn't afford to torch Bela Lugosi's lab, but also he may be saying something about atomic warfare); PLAN 9 has a subplot of the government withholding information from the public (a subject still taboo in that post-war age).  It may not be difficult to write tongue-in-cheek articles about what a true artist Ed Wood was, but it is harder to discount that at least he left a body of work that is unmistakably his own.  He was no dreamer, he was a realist in his own demented way.   He withstood a lot of misery (and people making fun of him) to commit his work to celluloid, but he believed in himself enough to do it. Is that not the behaviour of an artist?You may take all of the preceding text in whichever amounts of stride you wish.  However, if you believe that Ed Wood was truly a unique artist and that PLAN 9 was years ahead of its time in socio-political subtext, and truly revolutionary in its avant-garde techniques, then I agree with you. I'm not kidding.  PLAN 9 can be considered as nothing more than a beer and pretzels movie with the guys in the rec room.  But I concur with authors like Danny Peary and J. Hoberman- regardless of the satirical prose in their pieces, they both surrender to the possibility that these Grade Z movie-churners were artists after all.  Forty years later, we still don't know what to make of Edward D. Wood Jr.  Whether he was a serious artist or serious bull***t artist, that is part of the mystique that draws us to his threadbare oeuvre of outlandish ideas, riotous dialogue, acting by has-been's and never-will-be's, and discernably  minimal art direction. Whenever I watch PLAN 9, I laugh at it, but I am also kind of amazed by it.Edward Wood was the Brecht of narrative cinema.  No other person's films constantly reminded you of their artificial properties.  With his cheap sets, unrealistic props and stock footage, PLAN 9 is nothing if not a commentary on how representational film can be, just like theatre.  While no fictional cinema will fool you into thinking it's \"real\", regardless of its naturalistic setting and characterization, seldom does any try to fabricate reality with such a flagrant disregard of space and time, continuity, and with such a heavy reliance on montage.  People in a sunlit knoll will react to an offscreen image, revealed in the next shot to be Vampira in a night setting at an obviously fake crypt.  I'm not sure that this was what Kuleshov had in mind with his theory of montage.  Or to put it more plainly, Ed Wood could have been making a surrealist film, with its deliberately incongruous images, yet attempted to string all together with some kind of narrative.  His shameless use of Bela Lugosi (shot two days prior to the actor's death) incorporated with a younger, taller stand-in may be tasteless and inane, but lest we forget no-one else but Bunuel had two people play the same role (in THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE).Singularily, PLAN 9 is a shameless slipshod attempt at commerce, yet its flagrant artifice also makes it a commentary on the very kind of entertainment product it wants to be.  It may be useless to defend a body of work that is so flabbergastingly desperate, but this shoddy oeuvre still draws people back for more scrutiny.  It is not for nothing that Wood could be compared to Warhol.  Each had their acting gallery of strange wannabe's, each created works that made you think about their natural or unreal properties, and each made one wonder whether they were sincere in their own cracked ways, or whether they were just frauds who didn't care what the end result was.  But if one could believe for a moment that Edward D. was a serious, genuinely maverick filmmaker, then one could say that he was a pioneer of American Independent Cinema- making work his way without the aid or despite the shunning of a major studio.",

This is most certainly one of the worst movies you'll be able to see, but it's not \"worthy\" of the title \"THE Worst Movie EVER\".Why? First, this is a piece of cinema that CAN be called a \"movie\", and therefore is more watchable than others. Second, it has a fine period score that works exceptionally well with the movie. I mean, they hired an orchestra, an actual orchestra, to play the score (although I have suspicions that they used stock cues for some scenes). Third, there was a studio involved. Although Mr. Wood used the same exterior countless times, he still had scenes inside a studio. And fourth, it's just plain fun to watch. You can make a game: whoever finds the most flaws wins a coke.Of course, the so called plot is incredibly stupid, the dialogs are even more dumb, the script is often contradictory. But it's still one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My favorite scene is where Bela Lugosi's stand-in walks forward a policeman, and later to the detective, the Colonel, the pilot and his wife, and they all just stand back very calmly when they see the zombie.Other gems include a flaming miniature UFO, stock battle footage inter-sped with scenes with the Colonel in a sky background, the boom mike shadow, stock footage of Bela Lugosi being used over and over and the final showdown.So, I'm sorry, I had to say it. Hal P. Warren's anti masterpiece \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" is in fact THE worst movie EVER. Unlike this one, \"Plan 9\" has the possibility of being rated 10 and it can be watched by the whole family (not only masochists).It's still incredibly bad. When I saw a glimpse of the opening graveyard scene (missed the Criswell monologue) I actually said \"Wow! This is bad!\"Just as \"The Godfather\" is the official best movie ever and \"Citizen Kane\" is the technical and practical best movie ever, \"Plan 9\" is the official worst movie ever and \"Manos\" is the technical and practical worst movie ever.\"Plan 9\" is a movie that you can recommend to someone and it will not be taken as an insult. It just may be a must-see. I'm not so sure about that. Still, it will probably make you feel good when it ends, and that's something.I beg your pardon for mentioning both \"The Godfather\" and \"Citizen Kane\" within the same context, along with \"Manos\".

I rented Plan 9 from the video store thinking Bela Lugosi was the star. Around that same time I rented Ed Wood thinking it was about Lugosi. I didn't even know who Ed Wood was. I know who Edward D. Wood Jr. is now. He was a director that worked hard and was very dedicated. After all that work he was voted the worst director of all time. Believe me, I've seen worse. When I was little I never noticed the silly mistakes in Plan 9 From Outer Space. It wasn't until I saw Ed Wood and read about this movie that I realized them. Just because there are mistakes that doesn't mean you should hate it. I always found Eddie's movies to be interesting, original, and fun. I think the script to this movie is very good. It tells an interesting story and it is fun to watch. Despite the silly mistakes it is still a very good movie. There are a lot of effective scenes in this movie. The best part is when Criswell comes on in the end and makes his closing monologue. I also liked how Wood used bolts of lightning for the opening. The music in Plan 9 From Outer Space is good too. People say how there is bad acting. I didn't notice any really.Tor Johnson was pretty good in this. When he portrays Inspector Clay when he is alive, Tor really isn't that bad of an actor. He has a heavy Swedish accent that makes it a little hard to understand him, but he's fine. Tor Johnson isn't bad in the movie when he's dead either. One actor that was fine for a few minutes was Bela Lugosi. I love Lugosi's scene in front of the house when he is touching the flowers. You know, in shots from the side and from the back, Tom Mason actually can pass as Lugosi. I don't think they should have ever showed him from the front though unless his face was covered enough. In some shots he doesn't cover it enough. I noticed that Tom Mason kind of has Lugosi's ears and his hair was made just right. Sure he's a little taller, but it's not a big deal. In one scene I even noticed that Tom Mason was walking like Bela. I really don't have a problem with any of the actors except Gregory Walcott. He thought he was such a big shot. Where did he ever get? He read the script and said how it was the worst he had ever read. It by no means is the worst. Plan 9 From Outer Space is by no means the worst movie. If you think this movie is the worst then you haven't seen the worst. Try seeing; The Day Mars Invaded Earth, Cabin Fever, Hostel, The Cell, Ghost Ship, Dumb and Dumberer, Gigli, some Friday the 13th movies, some Nightmare on Elm Street movies, Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Spice World, Mortal Kombat Annihilation, Bones, sequels to Halloween, Dracula 2000, In the Cut, End of Days, Mars Attacks, AVP Requiem, Phantom Punch, Pompeii. After you see those then tell me which movie is the worst of all time. After you see those tell me if you have seen the worst acting, the worst writing, and the worst directing. A week from now you can be paying a lot to see the worst movie of all time. There will be more and there might be worse. God help us in the future.",

Bela Legosi was supposed to be in this film, however he passed away a few days after the start of production, so his part was replaced by Tom Mason, who was much younger and taller then Bela Legosi. Continuity is another massive problems with this film, which makes it so much better. During certain scenes it would be day, and then night, and then back to day again. Also, when Tom Mason replaced Bela Legosi, he covered his face with a cape so that no one would notice the facial difference.The special effects are very poor as well, but again that was makes it so good. When the UFO fly around, they fly like they are being guided by string. During the Army attack of the UFO's you can see that firecrackers are used, and the stock footage being used comprised about 85 percent or better of that scene, and what also makes it better, is that since it's \"supposedly\" outside the Colonel casts a shadow on the back drop. The cheesy lines in this film are just out right funny to hear. Like this line in the opening \"future events such as these will affect you in the future\", are just pure gold. They are so poorly written my 5 month old nephew could write far superior lines to those that were written in this film. I don't think there was one line in this film that wasn't funny to hear, just because it is so corny.The acting itself was so wooden, you could build a log cabin if you wanted to. Forget about character development, there is none. The characters are all about the same start to finish. A lot of the time you can see that actors are reading from cue cards or reading their lines directly from the script. At the start of the film for example you can tell that someone reading from cue cards, as Criswell is looking directly at camera and no where else.While there have been many bad films made through the years, (more or less films that have been created since 2000, as a good bit of them are trash in my eyes), this film has the distinction of being the worst movie every made. If you are ever depressed, sad, had a long day at your job/school, or just need to be cheered up, watch this film, you won't be sad after watching it.",

The police lieutenant always seems to be pointing his gun up at himself, and when he discovers a murder victim he concludes that \"Someone is responsible!\" All of the dialogue is ludicrous, the fight sequences are unconvincing (obviously fake punches go unassisted by sound effects), and Wood's addiction to stock footage is made abundantly clear.

His alien technology appears to never have calculated the physics of a broken jaw.It has been said that Ed Wood's films do not have special effects. Rather, they have symbols to show where special effects would be if Ed could afford them. This was never clearer than the final scene, where the burning flying saucer flys away and explodes. The saucer was not one of the toys. Rather, it was two paper plates glued together, sprayed with lighter fluid, and set on fire. Why would Ed have burned a valuable toy when he could have kept it and given it away for Christmas?Criswell's pretentious narration was the best part of the film.

There's a difference between not having the resources to make a good movie and having the resources and just making a bad movie (Kevin Costner, call your office).Having said that, Ed Wood attempts to make a serious, honest movie about the dangers of nuclear weapons.  Yes, Wood cannot escape the cheesiness that is inherent in his nature.  But don't let that stand in the way of the central point that he is trying to achieve.What is remarkable is that the \"aliens\" also believe in God.  Aside from their many differences, both humans and aliens are accountable to God for the portions of the universe they've been entrusted with.  It makes sense for both races to work together.  The aliens need to mature just as much as the humans do. The aliens are too high-minded and arrogant in their attitude, and humans need to wise up to the higher responsibilities that go with being a member of the universe.As required in any Plan review: there are flaming pie pans and neurotic switching between day and night in this movie, along with another wooden performance by Tor Johnson.

This one blows right past such stinkers as Eegah and Mighty Morphin: A Power Rangers Movie, and any film that's worse than movies like that is definitely no work of art. It's easily the biggest camp classic of all time, but not even it's ineptitude can make it good.In what is Ed Wood's biggest \"masterpiece\", two aliens prepare to launch \"Plan 9\" on earth, which they'll do by turning dead humans into zombies and have them overtake the capitals of the earth. Familiar Wood movie faces Tor Johnson, Vampira (What's with the thighs?), and Bela Lugosi are cast as the zombies, although Lugosi only appears shortly due to his untimely death. But Ed Wood still came up with a solution: He hired a local chiropractor to put a cape over his face for the rest of the scenes he was supposed to be in. Johnson and Vampira also look ridiculous, and let's not forget the aliens that look like humans. Wood's effects will crack you up, such as the hubcap flying saucers, the liquid oil flames on the spaceship, and the cheap looking graves. Every single scene is flawed in at least one way (For instance, there's one part where you can see the studio lights reflected on a television screen). Most of the scenes don't make sense, and there are plot holes bigger than Tor Johnson. But it is an Ed Wood movie after all! Plan 9 is also riddled with tons of average Hollywood dialogue (and some stock footage), making it the perfectly typical Hollywood B-flick. But simply put, the movie is a bore fest. Despite its slightly short running time you'll be yearning for it to end after the first minute. But if you're a fan of bad movies, you'll be entertained to say the least. All in all, I do recommend this if you want to see how bad a movie can get. It's awful, but like most old B-movies it's fun in a campy way.

I'd rather not be blacklisted.Thanks to Netflix I have at last had the odd pleasure of viewing the infamous \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" for myself, and I must say that I am puzzled that this managed to secure such an appalling reputation for itself. Surely, in all the history of cinema, there are worse films out there than this? Yes, this film is bad, I don't deny it. But it's watchable. That in itself gives the film merit which I cannot give to others I've seen. The plot is full of holes, but many well-received modern films have that problem, too. The special effects, particularly the flying saucers, are indeed laughable; but hey, the giant ants from \"Them!\" weren't too great either, yet THAT film is held up as a classic in 50's sci-fi. Go figure.The acting is poor, but far from outright egregious. The stars spout their dialogue with no more or less skill then others did in other B-movies. The aliens do little acting, but plenty of speaking; a good thing, as Dudley Manlove, who plays the alien \"Eros,\" can barely act, but has a great voice. As for the zombies, two of them are under the impression that they are in fact vampires: an identity crisis that provides unintentional amusement throughout the picture.In the writing, the film truly shows its ineptitude. The story is poorly explained and the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard. The editing is no better; shots that run for too long, sound effects vanishing and reappearing between cuts, and spontaneous jumps from day to night and back again are just a few of the film's ailments. Still, the movie is not so incoherent that you cannot understand what is happening. Besides, these flaws are more likely to induce laughter at their stupidity than outright disgust.Maybe Ed Wood's other films (none of which I've seen as of now) were bad enough to taint this one from the day it was released. A bad movie, indeed, but not the worst ever. Not even the worst I've personally seen! To this day I hold the first Twilight to be the most awful film of my acquaintance. THAT film fails at every conceivable level: acting, writing, special effects, cinematography, entertainment value... it isn't even funny in its dreadfulness!My final word? Maybe I'm just not very demanding of my movies, but to me, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is a really poor 50's B-movie that received a worse reputation than it deserved.

You really can't put this into words.  Although some may claim that there are other movies just as bad, do not be fooled.  Sure many movies have the same quality of actors that Plan 9 has.  They may even have cheesy sets.  But the writing for this movie is terrible.  There are dozens of instances where a line could have been written better by monkeys, including these gems:Criswell: \"Future events such as these will effect you in the future.\"Paula: \"That's all the point they'll ever be.\"And the Lieutenant, after one of the zombies has disintegrated into a skeleton before their eyes: \"He wasn't like that a minute ago.\"These are the instances that put Plan 9 below any other movie.  Really horrible, but highly recommended.  See it once, it only wastes 78 minutes of your life.",

First, in the scenes that include the real Bela Lugosi, he looks sick. Knowing that he died during the making of the movie, and guessing from the looks of him that he suffered, I was saddened to think of him suffering the indignity of being involved with this fiasco at the same time, and that being the last thing he would ever experience before he died.More importantly, PLAN 9 looked like it was really trying to be a good movie.  There ARE some movies, such as ATTACK OF THE FIFTY-FOOT WOMAN,, that I CAN laugh at for their poor execution because they're such blatant and shameless attempts to sell garbage. PLAN 9, on the other hand, looked like a sincere attempt to make a good movie, albeit an attempt that failed miserably.  I was left feeling that it would be inhumane to laugh at Ed Wood, when what he really needed was to be consoled.",

A film that really must be seen to be believed. Cult icon Edward D. Wood Jr, (Ed Wood) directs his usual cast of Hollywood nobodies and manages to create a film that has stood the test of time as well as any other. Director Wood's script was written around deceased star Lugosi (who had appeared in other Wood films, `Glen Or Glenda?', `Bride of the Monster', and tragically died after shooting a day's worth of footage with Wood for an unknown project). Airline pilot Walcott spies weird objects in the sky. Could they be related to the resurrection of the recently perished Lugosi, his spurious `double' and his completely implausible wife, Vampira? Detective Inspector Tor Johnson is on the case with bumbling cops Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks. Mismatched footage of Lugosi is blended with his body double (who is actually much taller than Lugosi and looks nothing like him) but this only adds to the fun. A film that should be seen by all. Lugosi's body double actually Chiropractor Dr. Thomas R. Mason. Followed by sequel `Night of the Ghouls'.",

There are terrible mistakes that make it a hilarious movie and there is something surreal in an extremely artistic way,which I think it was absolutely accidental. Maybe it's a reflection of the hallucinating passion that Edward D. Wood felt for the world of cinema and a mind not cinematographic structured. Anyway Plan 9 from Outer Space is hugely successful, even if all Hollywood industry considers Edward D. Wood has one of the worst directors. With no sponsors and no money is amazing how he manages to find a way to make the movie and how he replace Bela Lugosi with another actor who is not an actor( just phenomenal). In fact I think it's great that Tim Burton has made the movie about Ed Wood, he managed to give an idea of the whole production process of the movie and Wood's chaotic mind that continues to fascinate me. The poorly constructed scenarios end up damaged in the scenes,such as the graves in the cemetery that are run over by the police and eventually fall, just hilarious!

            "content": "Okay, as you can tell from the title, this is going to be another disgruntled critic review, much like my review of Home Alone 4. This review is written just for fun, so sit back and have a few laughs with me as I try to do a humorous review of this \"heinous\" movie, curiously titled Plan 9 From Outer Space. Remember, this is just my perspective on the film so if you have a different perspective, feel free to let me know of your opinion. Until then, let's dive right into what I consider to be a flame broiled turd. First off, I'll say that I have been, for the longest time intrigued by director Ed Wood. He has been considered by many to be the worst movie director of all time and although I'm not a big fan of his films, I admire his efforts and his passion for his work, reenacted in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic Ed Wood. I did however have a hard time sitting through this slop fest of a movie that was said to have been shot as is. When Ed Wood shot a scene, that was the scene that ended up in the finished movie. Wood wasn't fond of editing either and it really shows in this movie. The main problem I had with Plan 9 From Outer Space is probably not the same problem others have with the movie. Some say it has bad acting, bad cinematography and bad special effects, but that's not even scratching the chalkboard on why I disliked this movie. IT'S TOO DARN BORING. I had to drink 30 cups of coffee and smack myself in the face several times to get through this vomit sandwich of a movie and even then, I wasn't intrigued in the slightest about what was going on on the screen. The great Bela Lugosi, who died several years prior to this film's release, only appears in stock footage and the actor who replaced him in the movie was none other than Ed Wood's wife's chiropractor. I'm not even joking. The guy doesn't even look like Bela Lugosi, so much so that he has to keep his cape in front of his face the entire time, which comes off as not only annoying, but distracting in every scene he's in. Imagine if Superman or Batman kept their capes in front of their faces the entire movie. In Nolan's trilogy, it would only make Batman's raspy voice even more ridiculous than it already is. And the other actors aren't so stellar either. Maila Nurmi, better known as Vampira is always walking towards the screen with that DER! look on her face and wrestler Tor Johnson as Dan Clay always looks like his cat climbed up a tree or something. Do all these actors get paid good money to make these darn annoying facial expressions? Gee, they put Bella from Twilight to shame. Perhaps the best actors out of the film are the flying saucers, and that's not saying much. These things are so inconsistent throughout the film, for they are always changing size and shape whenever they are shown. The people who made them could have taken lessons from Ray Harryhausen on how to make flying saucers look real and believable.But as I said before, this movie is just boring. I wish I could build a time machine, go back in time, meet up with my former self and warn him not to watch this mess of a movie. This movie has more inconsistencies than the Frankenstein film series. I much rather have spent the time plucking hairs out of my noise or repainting the Sistine Chapel than watch this concoction of black and white crapiness. The scenes were filled with nothing but technobabble and there was not enough suspense and excitement to keep me invested. Paint drying would have made for a better movie.The acting is bad, the special effects are cheap looking and inconsistent, the plot is all over the walls and I really don't remember one stinking scene from this wonky slime covered tripe. There was absolutely no scene that left an impression on me and coming in at 1 hour and 30 minutes, it's way too long for a film of it's kind. That's 1 and a half hours I'll never get back! Oh good lord in the heavens, why did I watch this movie! It was an awful experience that I shall never watch again! Curses! Curses! Curses! I guess I'd better calm down.",

Besides, this is a more than good experience to witness the cinema done a long time ago as it is an instant reference for us mexicans (or from any other country) whom have watched movies by El Santo or the film Pepito y Chabelo contra los monstruos. Those are legends in it's own right too.Here, the most scary thing about Plan 9 it's that the film was intended to be taken seriously which makes it even more pathetic on the way. However, that\u00b4s exactly why the movie turns into a classic and I don\u00b4t like people to despise it 'cause as worst as it gets, it\u00b4s the greatest of the bad movies ever done.

Grave stones being kicked over and toppled; police cars leaving in daylight and arriving at a graveyard in the dark, 5 minutes later!; a police inspector scratching his neck with a loaded pistol!; police cars heading to a graveyard with a spotlight on top and arriving missing it!; Bela Lugosi and an imitator sharing scenes together as the same person!; old world war II army rocket firing scenes pieced into the film, two army officers,discussing rocket attacks, supposedly on a battlefield, standing on a stage with a paper curtain in the background!; and martians telling earth-people you are \"stupid, stupid, stupid\"!

The opening Crisswell's prediction was hilarious, though there's no need to go into the details, you're probably well-versed with them if you've heard of this flick. The film is essentially about aliens, who are so sick of us humans denying their existence, that they decide to awaken dead people using some \"electrode gun that will stimulate their pituitary glands\". You've got to give it to them- it could have been much dumber. The climax culminates in some of the humans finding their spaceship, and some talk about a future explosive \"Solarinite\", which could destroy the universe, including the aliens.To be fair, there was a message on the destructive nature of the human mind, and our insatiable greed in the film, but the presentation is so awful you wonder why nobody at that time had enough common sense to highlight the glaring and obvious flaws in the script. As I expected, the \"special effects\" were laughable and abominable. There is a particularly brilliant scene in which the army fires rockets at the flying saucers, and they miraculously survive, even though they actually appear to be little plates on strings. The best part about the screenplay is that you can actually understand it, and the aliens look so much like us, you wonder if the filmmakers knew what the words \"make-up\" meant. The acting by the undead zombies is also hilarious, and the film as a whole, is the most shoddily made sci-fi movie I've ever seen.",

The surprising answer is: YES. When we judge movies we need a scale to judge by - from 'excellent' to 'awful' - and you haven't calibrated your scales correctly unless you have seen this movie. It is the definitive word on 'awful'.",

The production designs look like they came off the set of a middle school play, the dialogue is giggle worthy, the acting is stiff and the story is about as well constructed as a tower of jenga blocks. But man was it fun! The charm of this film doesn't come from the movie so much as it comes from how much you can make fun of it. You can tell though that everyone tried their hardest to make this a good film. But they simply lacked the talent to do so. The best way to describe this film is like it is the cinematic equivalent of that klutzy office guy. You know that one guy who is really nice and kind but is also a complete doofus and continues to mess up almost all the time. That is this movie in a nutshell. Thanks for reading and God Bless!",

Any person who is even remotely interested in films should see this, and anyone who has never seen a b-movie before should start here.

Flying Saucers look no more like Swiss Chalet containers glued together and held up by fishing wire. The movie has a huge OOP'S when one character comes out from his house only to walk across the street (off screen) to get hit by a car, although the film is somehow paused and you can still see the shadow of the man (Bella Lugosi). Sadly Bella Lugosi died before the film was finished, so Ed Wood used the same shots of him over and over again throughout the film.

The worst films, to me, are the utterly mediocre ones--the ones that are so formulaic and lull the audience into such a state of unthinking submission and have such generic, ordinary dialogue that it's hard not to fall asleep while watching them.What separates this film from crap like that?  One thing is the special effects.  You'll never be able to ignore the special effects of a movie when you could do a better job with your home camcorder and a pie tin.  This is unlike most modern sci-fi films like, say, the Phantom Menace, in which you're just sort of lulled into submission by the special effects and the director tries to substitute them for actual substance.  Not so with Plan 9.The acting and dialogue is wonderfully funny.  It's not generic--rather, it's so stylized, blunt, and melodramatic that it gives the film the feeling of a comic book.  There's plenty of quotable material in this one.The part of the film that impressed me the most, actually, was the story. I was expecting the overused, generic cold-war plot of \"evil alien force invades earth and tries to destroy the human race, just like what those damn commies are gonna do to grand old America if we don't stop them.\"  But it's not like that at all.  In fact, I think it's a pretty interesting satire on just how utterly stupid the entire human race really was during the cold war.  The alien race is actually quite intelligent and even ethical, although quite uncharismatic and devoid of tact, which is what makes them so funny.  The great part is the film's incredibly ironic ending, but I won't give it away for those who haven't seen it.  It's no Dr. Strangelove, but it's still a humorous commentary on cold war ethics.Well, anyways, maybe this wasn't Ed Wood's intent at all; I haven't seen any other Ed Wood films, and I've never seen the Johnny Depp movie.  But that's what I got out of it.  Definitely a fun film and well worth watching--it's also quite inspiring for wannabe filmmakers.",

Why 'him' (why not?) I read on THIS site, he was a drag burlesque performer and live as much as a woman as he could It was literally a much campier version of Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris in the Lost In Space TV series) a decade later than this film.A loss that Lugosi was not there to really take part in the film .

The gravestones wobble.  When on fire, the flying saucers look like burning paper plates.In some scenes, the time of day switches back and forth several times.  For example, toward the beginning, some gravediggers are working late in the day, around sundown.  At the same time, a plane is flying overhead, and it is almost 4:00 on the plane.  Since the people on the plane describe it as being early morning (although the sun is brightly shining, creating shadows of everyone), one can only assume that it is 4:00 A.M.  Next, the scene shifts back to the graveyard, where it is apparently sundown.  That's only one of many plot holes big enough to fly a saucer through.There is also Bela Lugosi, who died before production even began. Ostensibly seeking Lugosi's box office draw, director Ed Wood put old Lugosi outtakes in.  The result is hilarious.  One scene is used several times, and in between, there is his taller standin who uses a cap to conceal the fact that he is not Lugosi.Another highlight is Eros's description of how the earthlings will destroy the universe by exploding sunlight.I've only covered part of why this movie is soooo enjoyable.

All scenes with him seemed so random and accidental like he was lost on the set and was looking his way out but Wood used the chance and captured him on the film. Unintentional comedy that was.Also this film features the greatest worst dialog ever. - Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody is responsible. - The saucers are up there. The graveyard is out there. But I'll be locked safely in there. - Visits? That would indicate visitors. - A flying saucer? You mean the kind from up there? / Yeah, either that or it's counterpart. Movie filled quotable lines. And the funniest part of the dialog was that it didn't make any sense whatsoever.

Compare this to dozens of poorly lit black and slightly-less black cheapo movies of the era. The editing is fairly well done with good timing and fades between cuts and only some small continuity problems and is superior to the long money-saving takes (often with flubbed lines) that other bargain movies of the time used to save post production costs. The print on the DVD has excellent contrast, solid blacks and the dialog, however silly, is perfectly clear and the stock music is actually appropriate for every scene.The plot is only a notch or two below many Roger Corman movies made a few years earlier and possibly could have been salvaged with some script rewrites and professional actors.",

The absence of aeronautical equipment bearing switches and lights still leave you feeling as though this weren't quite a legitimate cockpit? No problem. Radial protractor on the back wall.Advanced alien beings (\"by eons of your earth years\") stand chatting in a \"flying saucer\". Turn on the \"Televisor\"? Sure - it's the switch to the right of the flashing STREET CONSTRUCTION SIGN BEACON.Had this been any other production I might've thrown my monitor. However, this was much less a movie and more evidence of a crime in progress. I was literally mesmerized by how insanely awful this movie was.The ONLY reason for seeing this film would be to be able to join in a discussion on how flipping bad this film was. That is literally it. This film bears not a single redemptive quality. I wouldn't even use this film to show a student how NOT to make a movie. Seriously.A previous reviewer said the dialogue must be heard to be believed. I've heard the dialogue and I still don't believe it. You know why? Because it's unbelievable, that's why.I was going to quote the film here but when I realized how much time it was taking me to isolate a single shining example of how viciously the dialogue sucked I got annoyed and just dropped it.See this film. Do it. You should see this film JUST so you know I'm not being dramatic. It won't hurt, either, because it's so mind-numbingly bad you won't even notice the time. Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it - whatever you do.",

I've walked out on those films in the theaters and thrown away the tapes and DVD's But I've watched this film over and over. I see the mistakes; like the scene where the police race to a scene in a 1957 Ford. When they arrive, thay're in a 1956 Ford. But thats ok. This movie is fun and far from the worst movie I've ever seen. For a real turkey try \"Teenage Zombies\". I bought that one, watched it for 15 minutes and threw it away. It was just horribly inept and stupid. \"Plan 9\", as I said earlier, has a certain charm to it,  and for that fact, it is enjoyable.",

The night and day effects constantley switch, and the paper tombstones are constantley falling over. By far Ed Wood's \"best\" film.

A lot to laugh at, especially when compared to other sci-fi films of that day. By no means as good as the Giant Claw or the Deadly Mantis, bad in their own right. The acting is abominable, the sets worse than an elementary school play, the plot ridiculous and the special effects, if they can be called 'special', are -- well you get the picture. Maila Nurmi, Vampira, was so disgusted with the dialog Wood wrote for her that she said she would refuse to be in the film if she had to utter a single word of her 'written' lines. Good for her. You have flying hubcaps, I mean saucers, walking dead, time incongruity, human aliens and magically transforming police cars. Wood should be congratulated for being able to have this thing shown in theaters. I must say that any real old-time sci-fi buff must have Plan 9 From Outer Space in their collection.

The 1987 NYC Film Forum Summer Festival of Sci-Fi Program describes this film as \"The Amazing Criswell, Bela Lugosi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, washed-up cowboy actors, and movie-crazy Baptists, in this tale of Earth's invasion by flying hubcaps and paper plates from outer space\". What could be more horrifying than Vampira's tiny wasp waist, and its implicit damage to her abdominal vital and reproductive organs ?The film even has its own tautology ( a term from logic and philosophy, meaning a statement which, of necessity, is true, and which therefore may seem trivial) :\"Inspector Clay is dead ! He's been murdered ! And one thing's certain ! Someone's responsible !\"Lugosi died in 1956 while this film was being shot. Hence Mrs. Wood's chiropractor taking Lugosi's place, albeit being eight inches taller than Lugosi, etc. I have read that the film was not released until 1959, because Wood could not pay the lab bill to process the film until then.No, sorry, that was \"Plan 9\"'s sequel, \"Night Of The Ghouls\", which is even worse, if you can believe that.I've always enjoyed the resemblance of Eros and Alien Commander to Neil Sedaka and Truman Capote, respectively, with all that that implies.The film could also be seen as Wood's version of \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\", which also concerns extraterrestrials attempting to get Earth's people to take them seriously, acknowledge their existence, and listen and respond to them. There is, of course, no comparison between the two films, and some may see it as nonsense, blasphemy, sacrilege, etc. to even mention them both in the same paragraph. Perhaps the next step downward would be to mention the corpse-reviving radiation from the Venus Explorer satellite returning to Earth in \"Night Of The Living Dead\".I wonder how much of Lugosi's real pain (from narcotic addiction, the pain the narcotic was prescribed for, what had happened to his life, and to his career) is visible in what little we see of him on screen in \"Plan 9\".Having seen this film on \"Chiller Theater\" on Saturday evening as a youngster, and attending Mass the following morning, I could not help but remember, and ponder it, towards the end of the Nicene Creed :\"Ah yes ... Plan Nine ... the resurrection of the dead !\"\"And I believe in the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"",

The leader of these aliens, a pompous beuraucrat, wants to just wipe this dangerous race out, but grudgingly allows some earnestly pacifistic underlings to try scaring them first - making them aware of the threat of alien destruction, then delivering an ultimatum (this idea was later appropriated by James Cameron for \"The Abyss\"). An extraordinarily clever sci-fi premise which has huge potential for anti-war satire; unfortunately, there's the ludicrous grave-robbing idea, awful special effects, illogical action scenes, lousy acting, hilariously bad dialogue, cardboard sets, and Wood doesn't even seem to be siding with the right characters...somebody should remake it.

Many people agree that he is the worst Hollywood directors of all times (although some people also said that he is an alienated genius). Second, it's about the story. Alien in human form who tried to use plan 9 (resurrecting dead people) to subject earth? What a mess. Third, it's about the Muse en scene aspect. The actor, the setting, the properties, the wardrobe, the cinematography, the special effects, they all are terrible. Look at how Wood tried to replace Bela Lugosi with an actor who permitted to show his eyes and cover the other body part, whom it's eye and gesture doesn't even fit with Lugosi. Look at the thin thread that hanged over the silly flying sources, what a crap. Look also the cockpit setting in this movie. It really made me laugh. Fourth, see also the humiliating montage from this movie. You'll find that night shot and day shot combined in one scene (through a single continuity). You'll also see many jumping scenes in this movie.For me, the whole movie is a comedy. The armies fight the UFO then vampire appears? It's just like a parody, even though Wood actually made a serious toned movie. If you tried to consider it as a standardized since fiction Hollywood movie, you'll get disappointed.

In all of this, over the years, there has been something sublime and classic that has settled upon \"Plan 9.\" And, as indefinable as it is, it is a \"something\" that makes an obscure string of movie mistakes a classic study of \"space invaders\" ineptitude for all time.",

It should also be noted that Lugosi wasn't just the only notable performer (Given a wonderful homage by Martin Landau in the film 'Ed Wood') in it because there were three others of note: Criswell, Vampira and Tor (Lobo).",

The story feels like an episode of a really campy sci-fi show and requires absolute no brains to follow. As a horror movie it completely failed, but you can still see it as a horror spoof and have an entertaining night. And if a movie is able to entertain you, how can it ever be considered the worst movie ever? In truth, Plan 9 has some sort of sincerity over it. It feels like a school play and it's a tribute to all those people who ever shot home-made flicks with their friends. Ed Wood is really just a 10-year-old running around with his camera and having tremendously fun in the process. It's like a school play, in which the cast and crew really don't have that much experience but still a lot of enthusiasm for making movies.In short: as bad as it is, it still puts a smile on your face.

I believe it to be a commentary on talent, creativity, and film-making. It is almost humorous in its sheer overwhelming mediocrity. One cannot take this movie seriously; pay less attention to the plot and more attention to what is being done. Wood may have been trying to show how an idea such as this film, though believed creative, fresh, and sharp by its creators, is, in reality, a total joke.

While many people hate this movie and say it was the worst in history, I completely 100% disagree. Why? I have many reasons. The thing about \"Plan 9\" is that while it did have poor special affects, one must remember that Edward D. Wood Jr. did not have the best funding, he had to produce and pay for everything himself, sometimes with assistance from his crew. If you look at it that way, it would actually be a very good movie, if his funding had been better. While the acting and writing was poor, let me tell everyone who scoffs at it something. The acting and writing in some of today's movies are far more atrocious than that in \"Plan 9.\" Most of today's movies are filled with sex jokes, which are not at all amusing, and are so over done that it gets tiring. While many actors are praised today with having incredible abilities, many do not, and really are no better than the best acting in \"Plan 9.\" The most important thing we have to remember about \"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\" is that it was a sincere movie. Ed Wood thought he had something going, and he directed from the heart. He just wanted to tell stories and to be artistic. So many people get back lashed for doing what they love, and if it is not hurting anybody, leave them alone! Let them do what they want for Heaven's sake! All in all, if you look at what \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" could have been had it been given better funding and assistance, it probably would've turned out swell, and it wouldn't be known as the worst film in history. \"Plan 9\" had a very good plot, and was pretty entertaining (I'm not talking about laughing at it) but really, it was a pretty good movie.

What he's done is pull a Homer (from the Simpsons; a phrase meaning \"to succeed despite idiocy\").

I'm pleased to report it did not disappoint. The film, released in 1959, is the brainchild of Edward Woods, who had desperately sought to make a movie. Ed was told there was no way he could make a movie given the paltry budget of $60,000 that was available (for reference the sci-fi cult classic \"Forbidden Planet\", released in 1956, had a budget of $1.9M). Ed proved his critics right by not making a movie. While he did produce something on film, it certainly isn't a movie.The failures start at the story line, which takes absurdity and silliness to a whole new level. This script is so bad that even stink would say it stinks. The dead are rising from the cemetery, and of course you can't have walking dead without aliens. Seems the aliens fear that since we humans are idiots, we will not only destroy ourselves but will shortly invent a new device called \"Solaranite\" which has the power to set sunshine on fire (of course!). Once we do that the burning sunshine will travel back and destroy the sun. Since the aliens have beachfront property and like their all year tans, they really want the sun to keep shining, so they are raising the dead (which turn out to be a grand total of 3) to defeat us poor hapless humans.The film starts in a cemetery, supposedly located just outside of Hollywood. Oddly the cemetery appears to be comprised of scrub grass and snarled trees that seem more at home in the Scottish Highlands, but why quibble. The walking dead include Vampira (who plays a vampire ghoul), and a police detective (played by Tor Johnson) who is killed shortly after the start of the film and becomes a generic type ghoul. Vampira stalks about with her arms outstretched attempting to be scary, when the only scary part is the fear they'll show more of her. The third ghoul is played by the literal ghost of Bela Lugosi. Lugosi had signed up for the film before the script was developed. It is said that once Lugosi received and read the script he proclaimed, \"this is a good day to die\", and proceeded to do so, anything to avoid being in this awful movie. While Lugosi was dead before the start of filming, the producer had a short clip of Lugosi in his vampire outfit exiting a cave into a graveyard. They use this clip to cut to an amateurish scene of a stand-in double for Lugosi. Outside of the double being a foot taller, skinnier, and comprising a completely different body and facial structure, he is a dead ringer for the happily deceased Lugosi. This double, who now plays a combined vampire/Lugosi, stalks about with a cape drawn over his face and seeks to frighten young women, who somehow manage to pretend to be afraid rather than breakdown laughing at how silly this all looks. Just in case you missed it, don't worry, you'll be seeing that same short clip of Lugosi multiple times.During the course of the movie you'll see a cadre of characters bumbling their way through the makeshift cemetery, their feet sliding on the artificial grass covering a concert floor. You'll notice the curtains that attempt to cover the wall of the garage, where this scene was obviously shot, and the bending of multiple cardboard tombstones. The police investigating the cemetery are in urgent need of a gun safety class. We see them rubbing the barrel of their revolvers on their check, pointing it at their heads, indiscriminately waiving it at anyone conveniently nearby, and in general using it to scratch anything that itches. Their knowledge of firearms is profound, as there are frequent references to loading clips into their revolvers. Silly me, I though it wasn't possible to load clips into revolvers, but these Keystone Cops have figured out a way.The childish sets are legion. In the setting of an airplane cockpit, pilots are seated on folding chairs with flight yokes made from cardboard. Neither pilot makes any attempt to fly the plane, given the cardboard yokes aren't attached to anything it would seem rather pointless even to try. The stewardess enters through a shower curtain to talk with the pilots. How she does that without falling down laughing is beyond me. She then exits back through the shower curtain, hopefully there is an actual shower back there where she can attempt to wash off the smell of this movie.By now of course the aliens are arriving, we see them depart from the mothership, which appears to be a hanging snow globe. The flying saucers look remarkable like hubcaps from a 1958 Edsel, artistically hanging from wires and superimposed over stock footage of greater Los Angeles. With the aliens approaching the military springs into action, sending battalions of stock footage from WW2. The army launches a massive artillery barrage, which also seems function as anti-aircraft fire. Sparklers are lit up next to the suspended hubcaps. This seems to frighten the aliens and the hubcaps quickly fly away. Perhaps they are seeking a newer model Edsel.When the aliens do finally arrive, they are comprised of what seem to be the king and queen of hearts from Alice in Wonderland. They speak with the alien emperor, who oddly is dressed like Sir Lancelot. When emperor Lancelot delivers his lines, his eyes roll into the back of his head and he appears to be stoned out of his mind. This makes perfect sense to me, as the only way I could numb the pain of being in this movie and have any hope of delivering my lines without falling down laughing would be to get as high as a kite.Entry to the alien ship is made through a garden shed that has a ladder on the side which serves no purpose. Within the ship are some tables from Sears and a pile of used electronic equipment that fell off a DuMont TV repair truck. Interspaced within the electronic gear is a flashing yellow light from a road construction barrier, likely picked up by the aliens in that detour around the asteroid belt. After a lecture from the alien king of hearts on our idiocy, we manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and destroy the alien ship, which we do by pouring lighter fluid on the hubcap and setting it ablaze.There is far more than just ridiculous story line and set design. Scenes are cut and set without any sense of logic. Backgrounds and people inexplicably change from scene to scene. The same footage is used again and again, each time incorrectly stitched into the following scenes. Night turns into day, back to night, and then day again with alarming speed. Perhaps in addition the ability to burn sunshine we have managed to speed up the earth's rotation. The complete lack of any acting ability combined with set blocking and line delivery that is so amateurish, stiff and wooden, one wonders if the director was ever actually on the set. Perhaps the director, aka Charlie Brown, was called away to finish the school Christmas play. Abysmal acting is matched only by laughable dialog. Hopefully the writers of this script had their fingers sown together, lest they ever write again. An example of writing greatness includes blinding flashes of the obvious: When the vampire/Lugosi double is hit by an alien beam and turned into a skeleton, the actor nearby points to the skeleton and proclaims, \"He didn't look like that before\". Any other observations you care to share with us Ray Charles?When the only redeeming aspect of a movie being it is 79 minutes long and not 80, fortunate for me as my anti-nausea medication was running low, you know you have something really special going. While there are many candidates for worst movie of all time, to reach this lofty level one must fail in every way imaginable. In this, Plan 9 From Outer Space achieves perfection. Every conceivable facet of movie making from story, scripting, acting, directing, set design, lighting, blocking, wardrobe, special effects, producing, soundtrack, etc. is an epic failure. While even the most incompetent among us will on occasion, even if by accident, do something right, this movie manages to do everything wrong. That's quite an accomplishment! Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst movie ever made, a perfect failure.",

It is a wonderful presentation of the various props and costumes from psychotronic movies that this afficianado extraordinaire has collected over the years.And, surprise, he has some of the props from Plan 9.And, among these, several of the \"flying saucers\"!They were NOT made out of paper plates (as far as I am concerned, Tim Burton did a disservice to Ed by depicting Kathy Wood putting paper plates and bowls together to make these props).In fact, Ed (or his prop master) picked up several Revell(not sure about brand here) Flying Saucer model kits and assembled and painted them. To one of the models, a square flange was attached to the bottom to allow the connection of another cube-shaped (wooden, probably) piece to be attached for the graveyard landing scenes. Cheaper than constructing a rounded set for the inside of the saucer, which would have made more sense. At least Ed was making an attempt to explain why the saucer interior set was so \"square\".I think there is a tendency on the part of some reviewers to reduce the apparent craft which goes into \"bad\" movies such as this one to the level of high school drama productions. But in my opinion, this is oversimplifying. Plan 9 for all its flaws, was created with a full crew (not all of them professionals, obviously) and, I might add, a surprising amount of original music (if I read the credits here on IMDb correctly).\"So, please --- stop mit der paper plates!\"",

That being said, I must admit that this is the most hokey film that I love to love simply for the audacity of its poor quality mostly throughout. Its hallowed lower rank status among the forerunners of Hollywood \"Alien/Atomic Cafe\" clunkers is legend.Here you have at one hand some somewhat solid scenes delving into the tried and true \"Yes, we the Military KNOW there are Flying Saucers, but it's unwise to panic the populace\" scenes. And at approx 43:10 there's mention of the Human to Alien language translation Computer. And I'm wondering if that's one of the first mentions of \"Computer\" in cinema.Regardless, later on the Humans and Aliens are talking a blue streak of script, and nary an earpiece is evident for the translation, ha-ha.I don't EVEN want to go there when it comes to the freaky small waist of the Vampire freak woman. But let's just say I'd do her if the airline pilot's wife wasn't available. And that's another thing, in that the airline pilot's wife apparently plays both his wife and also an Alien on board a flying saucer. And WHAT an Alien she is! Darn, she's got great thighs and a butt that wont stop, and of course a 50s era brassier that's pointing those knockers at attention.Sadly, there's only a bit of woman bare foot action in this flick. It could have lasted longer, but of course the scene lost continuity and her bare feet were suddenly covered up again, even though she was asleep and not shifting in bed... darn you Mr Ed Wood!Sincerely, Chauncey \"Sonney\" Earlington, III",

Example 2 - the eponymous 'plan 9' involves aliens raising corpses to get Humanity's attention.

Of course it had a lot of issues like, let's say, \"stiff acting\", horribly made sceneries - cemetery, saucer's and plane's cockpits just to name a few. The plot wasn't that bad at all - the idea of aliens trying to stop people on Earth from inventing the most powerful weapon in the universe was quite good in my opinion. I couldn't however sit and watch it as a horror movie, it made me laugh almost every single minute - the best part was \"hanging saucers\" (no, not \"flying saucers\" but \"hanging saucers\", you could see strings attached to them) and the general in charge of the rocket attack. You can see his shadow on the surface of sky, and sky itself is a little bit folded in some places. I believe they used a sheet as a piece of sky. All in all it's a fine example of low-budget sf movie, and if you are interested in such things you may even like it. The rest of you will probably turn it of after 10 minutes.",

Actually if you know how to appreciate it, it is sheer joy and enjoyment to watch it, and isn't that what we really need from a movie. If somebody made a spoof that resembled that (as Tim Burton himself tried with `Mars Attacks) he would be considered imaginative genius. It is a movie that is `so bad it's good' which is much better than the many movies that try to be too good and spend millions and millions but turn out very bad. Examples: `Battle field earth, water world, the postman, etc). I think most movie buffs like some classic shots in movie history like `Lord Orlok' rising from it coffin, and Frankenstein monster backing up into the room.

Or, if you have an hour to spare, take a look at the goofs section.Im a fan of this movie for 2 reasons that most critics should include in any rating they give: 1. This movies heart is just SO big. Eddy really threw his whole self into all the movies he Wrote, Produced, and Directed. Hiring his friends for roles instead of going around trying to find actors. He has such a love for film-making that extends to his passion. As you watch this imagine your 13 year old wanted to make a science fiction movie, it's not going to be great because they don't have the technology, but you will enjoy it, it has that feel to it.2. The idea is the important thing. Eddy had such a vision in mind that if he could see the things in CGI now he would be blown away and have a more suitable medium to portray his vision. I know, I know, there are good movies from back then that do not need todays effects but Ed Wood's visions really needed it to be effected. Look at this film as the story board for what he really wanted, ignore mistakes and try to see in your head what Ed saw in his head for his movie.You will laugh at the mistakes, and it almost seems like a naked gun movie, trying to be a little tongue in cheek. There are movies that are good, It's a Wonderful Life. Then bad, Doom. Then really bad, I Eat Your Skin or Manos: The Hands of Fate. Even still, there is so bad that it went past bad and back to good again, Plan 9 from Outer Space. Gold for any movie buff, or just anyone who wants to play a game of \"Oh Yeah...\" with that punk at the Rental shop who KNOWS ALL THINGS FILM! You may feel different but I love this movie, own it, and watch it every now and then.",

How could this be so funny to watch? Then I realized: it's anarchy that works here. Take a writer/director/producer with absolutely no talent in writing, direct and produce. Take some people whose last thing on Earth you'd call them is 'actors'. Take Bela Lugosi last footage, and you'll have the worst movie ever made. In other words, one of the funniest ever. It's been said this film is worth watching nine times. Wrong. It's worth watching infinite times. Each time your life takes itself too seriously.

In the beginning there is a narrator but 1/3 of the way through the movie the narrator is never to be heard form again. After you watch this movie you will feel like Mike Tyson has repeatedly punched you in the head. Your IQ may suffer. This film has the worst acting, period, if Tor wasn't enough with his slow walking not-even-close-to-scary zombie attempts, it has the worst cache of talentless hacks that sounds like they're reading their line from hard to read cue-cards.

Of course the aliens are just humans in jumpsuits, so their conversations about how 'strange' humans are, I found very entertaining as well.

Bad bad is a movie that combines all the elements listed above--bad acting, bad directing, etc.--to produce something that bores. Good bad combines the same elements in such a way that a highly entertaining movie is made, although not in the way the movie makers hope.\"Plan 9\" is not just good bad, it is brilliant bad. It is unintentionally hilarious such as Birdemic or The Room, and that's as funny as it gets. \"Plan 9\" is nothing but bad, albeit in a wonderful way.As an example of bad production values, there is a scene where a police car is speeding away from headquarters. As the action begins it is broad daylight. The next scene is the car racing across the city. Now, however, it is night! Next is the car arriving at its destination, a cemetery, and again it is daylight. That is either one huge city, or somebody on the Plan 9 crew was asleep at the switch.\"Plan 9\" is so full of great badness that to detail all the goofs, flubs, and cheesiness would require remaking the entire movie. The cemetery is a weed-infested lot; an airline cockpit set is a shower curtain, some plywood and a couple chairs; a cop scratches his head with the business end of a gun barrel; the outside of the space ship has a ladder that goes nowhere; the plan itself, that is, plan number 9, makes no sense at all. And on and on and on...If you love movies, and want to consider yourself conversant in all genres of film, seeing at least one bad sci-fi movie is a must. \"Plan 9\" is the Hamlet of that genre.

The planet where the action is set is not the Earth. Did anyone notice it? It's not the Earth, but a smaller planet which rotates so fast that night and day pass in only a few minutes. You're in the middle of the morning watching a point in the sky and at the next moment, you look at your feet and it's dark. Scary, isn't it? In few words, everything in this movie is bad, except for two things: the music, and Tor Johnson's face, which really expresses the terrible nature of death.Finally, I wonder about the message behind the plot... we humans are about to destroy ourselves and the whole universe with us and yet we blindly keep on acting like if we were the masters of nature... and our pride is so big that we even bite the helping hand which has traveled from far away to stop us. The most amazing part (for the 50's) is that the ending is not happy, but pessimistic. Did Ed Wood really want to say that through his work?

I believe that Ed Wood was great because with no resources and with a lot of work he made his dream real: to make films, following his passion.

Since watching Plan 9, I have on occasion begun eschewing good movies for unintentionally hilarious movies and atop that bargain bin of movies, Plan 9 reigns supreme.This movie is so incredibly stupid that I have never seen anything like it, and it makes regular stupid movies seem totally sane. The movie is about a group of incredibly stupid aliens who seemingly invade Earth, but turn out to be trying to protect us... from ourselves! The aliens land on Earth and begin raising a small gathering of zombies from the dead. They then attempt to use their new minions to threaten Earth into stopping work on a bomb called solarnite or something similar, I can never hear exactly what they say. Unfortunately, they don't tell anyone what they are trying to accomplish until right before the end.The whole movie has no tension whatsoever and oddly enough makes less sense the more you watch it. However, I would recommend it to anyone with a good sense of humour as you will need it to retain your sanity.The reason I would recommend Plan 9 to almost anyone because it is perhaps unique in that it actually got made. I for one would have loved to have been in the board meeting when this film was suggested, but I could probably have said the same for pretty much any other Ed Wood movie.So anyway, watch this movie and let your journey of horrendous (yet surprisingly fun) movies commence!",

You wouldn't call a doctor that forgets to sew up his patients a genius would you? As much as I love Johnny Depp I have to disagree with him about all the wonderful things he says about the late Ed Wood. Ed Wood is only a charismatic man on a journey to fulfill his dreams of being a great director, when he's being portrayed by Johnny Depp. If you want a real glimpse to the mind of Ed Wood skip over the Plan 9's and the Brides of the Atoms and go watch one of his REAL stinkers like \"The Sinister Urge\" with its plot worthy of any Lifetime movie that'll leave you dumbfounded and half asleep.

The first 20 minutes are amusing, and is fun to joke around with. After that its impossible to watch, because it drudges on and on with the worst VFX and sound design, I'd take the Asylums movies over this anytime, and I'm not saying that because its newer, I'm saying that because the acting is at least bearable, the effects are so pathetic its a mystery on how the actors kept a straight face. In the end I loved the movie, despite hating it so much, because its fun to do that, you know? Go ahead and watch it if you want to bash something other then your Ex Wife.",

Not because the film is great or anything, in fact it is so poorly done it does require to be called the \"Worst Movie Ever Made.\"But the overall tackyness, pardon me for inventing my own word (pulling a 'George Dubya' as we call it), is what makes you want to watch it. Weather it be the papermache back ground. The army stock footage used in what seems like half the film. The cheezy/morbid plot. Or just the fact it is a 'B-Movie,' you just have to watch it. So, in conclusion, on the IMDb, i rated it as a '1' but for being the \"The Best Worst Movie Ever Made,\" it gets a 10!",

            "content": "I must say, this has to be one of the greatest comedies in the history of the world.That is, one of the greatest UNINTENTIONAL comedies.Seriously.When I first saw Plan Nine, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing at some of the egregious incompetence on display. If Ed Wood had known it would turn out like this, he would have become a fertilizer salesman (all due apologies to Hal Warren. I don't know why I said this, because if he were alive, *he* should be apologizing to *us* for Manos). The logic of the claim, \"Inspector Clay is dead. Murdered. And somebody's responsible!\" kind of escapes me. I mean, you'd think someone being \"responsible\" was kind of written into the definition of murder.That's not all. The entire thing appears to take place in a void where, to quote Rob Thomas, \"time falls away\". Scenes take place simultaneously in broad daylight and pitch darkness. Did you know that the sun goes down at 3:45 am? The characters in this know, that's for sure.More heinous errors: they never make it clear what kind of undead monster these things are. Vampira's character is listed as 'Vampire Woman', yet behaves like a zombie. Inspector Clay is clearly a zombie. Bela Lugosi acts like a vampire, yet is credited as 'Ghoul Man'. I thought ghouls ate people, and they never do anything that uncouth. I'm nitpicking, but it's fun.Also: completely round flying saucers are described as being 'cigar-shaped' and have an obvious ninety degree angle when on the ground. The burning saucer looks (with good reason) like it's not much bigger than a tennis ball (the clue's in the size of the flames). And the logic of two people, each of whom have been attacked by the zombighoulpires (my word) at least once, behaving thusly when alone in a cemetery stalked by the undead: one sits in the car with ALL THE DOORS UNLOCKED, and one stands outside. He then gets knocked unconscious from a light tap on the arm.This movie deserves a 0/10 for technical skill, but gets a 7/10 based entirely upon how hilariously funny it is to watch people utterly failing to get it right.",

Sure the production values are below that of even a grammar school play, the acting atrocious and the dialog inane, but under the watchful eye of film auteur Ed Wood it all melds together into an enjoyable film. Perhaps not as he meant it to be enjoyed but a fun film nonetheless. So how can a movie which is enjoyed by millions of viewers be the worst movie ever made? Ed wood clearly put his heart into every feature he made, had he ever been given a break at one of the studios, he could have gone on to better things. But maybe we are lucky that he didn't get that big break for we still get to enjoy the work of an ever-so-slightly deranged master of his craft!",

One of the funniest movies ever made! \"Turn of the gun!\" is one of many great lines in this movie; I recommend Plan 9 From Outer Space if you want a good laugh!",

Usually, the teacher would show us all of a film before moving onto another movie. However, this movie was SO bad, he said, \"Now, I'm only going to show you all half of this movie, because I'm your friend, and I don't want to torture you.\" He even added, \"And if you talk, please let it be only about mocking the film, because if you don't say it out loud, you will burst!\"",

Lucky for us, it stinks in a special way. It's so bad, it's hilarious! I don't think it's the worst movie, that title would have to go to Hal Warrens film \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" as a previous reviewer mentioned. But this movie has the big five, bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad directing, bad casting.The characters (and that is an apt description of them, they are not actors) drive from dark to light and back again. Night scenes have shadows and day scenes are filmed in dark. Tor is barely understandable and emotes his lines like turds from a constipated man. The main character disappears at the start of the movie and is replaced by an obvious fake with no explanation.Don't get me wrong, I love this movie! If Ed Wood hadn't intended to make a great movie it wouldn't have been near as funny. Think about it, half the fun is knowing he was dead serious. If he was trying to make a comedy we wouldn't like it near as much. Just imagining his seriousness as he directed this mess makes me smile! Even \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" can be funny if you watch the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version (don't ever watch the pure version, I think it might be fatal). Listen, this is great entertainment, but not great movie making. Don't try to be pompous or try to explain away the too numerous to count mistakes and flubs. It deserves to be listed in the top 10 or 20 all-time worse films. Yet unlike most of them he has a charm and a pure stupidity that makes it enjoyable and at times side splitting.Watch it, laugh, but don't tell anyone it's \"not that bad\". It is. It's horrible! Lucky for us. Ed must be turning over in his sweater and skirt, but at least we're still watching it.",
