            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky was without a doubt one of the genuine artist working in the cinema. With films such as \"Andrei Rublev\", \"Solaris\", \"Mirror\", Stalker\" and \"Nostalghia\", Tarkovsky enriched the world with powerful works for art. \"Sacrifice\" was his final film, made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. The story concerns an elderly academic who lives with his family in a rural part of Sweden. When he learns that about an imminent nuclear war, he makes a desperate pact with God. The film is astonishingly beautiful, like all Tarkovsky's films. Images of nature, water and fire feature prominently, as does the shifting from colour images to black and white.It is important to remember that Tarkovsky is not a very accessible film-maker, and his films make great demands on viewer's patience and attention, but if you are willing to make the effort you will be rewarded by an unforgettable experience.",

            "review_title": "Too Much Sense",
            "content": "Spoilers herein.Tarkovsky is one of the five inventors of cinema, and the one most disconnected from the constraints of reality. He is highly intuitive, visually rooted of course and deliberately eschews the necessity of making narrative `sense.' The magic of his earlier masterpieces (`Rublyev,' `Mirror') is precisely in how he sustained a reality with highly folded, irrational causality.But as he grew older, he became celebrated and ineluctably developed `theories' of his approach. He began speaking and writing about his work and slowly slipped into the safe harbor of making sense. This film -- his last as it turns out -- is the result.Along the way, he allied himself with Bergman, someone who always was rooted precisely in the simple narrative. Bergman's heritage is the theater. He begins with `real' life, abstracting and staging elements of it. Bergman's whole point is to make the sense of the situation easy to read so that he can intensify and embellish it. Life is real, and because we can enter the reality of a Bergman film, we can emotionally relate to it. Bergman's world is allegorical,  real, and causally connected where Tarkovsky's is metaphorical, ultrareal with causal folding.So it is a strange voyage for Tarkovsky to convince himself of the logic of his theories, and to journey to Bergman's doorstep.This film has a strongly Tarkovsky-ite beginning (until the map) and end (the last 47 minutes beginning with the visit of the actor to the witch or -- depending on your tolerance -- perhaps a few minutes before with the vision of the small house). In between, there is a muddle of emotional angst that is clumsily inserted. Also, it may be my imagination, but all the cinematography seems different than his earlier work. His early eye was languorously curious, lingering and floating. Here it is Bergmenesque: deliberately fated, smooth with premeditated and goals with foreknowledge of the fate.To see what I mean: look at the documentary included on the Kino DVD. That documentary is flatly stupid in plumbing the mysteries of Tarkovsky (it elucidates his `theories'), but it does include the remarkable original shot of the transition from the witch's visit to the post-holocaust peace. The original is pure Tarkovsky: a shot of the actor, then panning to a scene with the same actor surrounded, then a continuous movement through visitors, reflections, players in the magic, the world, and a remarkable image of the nude daughter corralling chickens. Only that last image remains in the final version which is reduced to Bergman-like clarity. It is dramatically economical, but Andrei's poetry is lost. It is a dead tree planted with high hopes.This package: the film, the documentary on the film and the book, are proof that artists are often not the best source of insight into their art. This film, alas, is not \"The Tempest,\" a self-referential perspective on an artist who understands his own magic. It is instead an echo of that artist's misunderstanding of himself.Must be seen for that alone, preferably after \"Prospero's Books.\"Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Andrei Tarkovsky Does Ingmar Bergman, Philip K. Dick Style?",
            "content": "Andrie Tarkaovsky's final film takes elements from Ingmar Bergman, \"I Am Cuba\" with a story that if not influenced by, is a kind of psychic cousin to the later works of Philip K. Dick.A family on a small Swedish island, find out the world is about to end(there's nowhere to hid and nothing that can be done)...planes heard overhead, and television warnings are all anyone knows. So far this doesn't sound too different from Bergamn's \"Shame\" where a couple try to escape from the world and war, on a similar small Swedish Island. The difference is where Bergman, dissects his characters down to nothingness, Tarkovsky includes mysterious post-men obsessed with miracles, a maid who may be a powerful witch, a man with the chance to re-create the universe, and a love making scene in mid-air?That Tarkovsky moves with such subtly between psychological study, religious allegory, and science fiction tropes, should'nt be too much of a surprise considering his early philosophical SF films like \"Solaris\", and \"Stalker\"(which I may re-watch, cus of this film, though I hated it before). Like Philip K. Dick, end of the world paranoia, reality manipulation, and the religious (specifically Christian) ecstatic vision all merge together in 'The Sacrifice\", with a lot more force and clarity(at least for me) than in any of his earlier films.The lead character seems like a stand in for Tarkovsky himself, his views on nature, art, God, progress, and humanity, seem to match pretty closely with some he gives in the interview section of the DVD.It's still slow as all hell, but the intensity of the story helps balance out the visual pace. It's not as instantly impressive as some of Tarkovsky's other films, but I think this maybe his strongest movie, all around.It's the story of a man who saved the world, without anyone ever knowing it, and the trade off, man must make with God, in order to survive. A prayer on film.",

            "content": "I sit here, agog, with the holy terror of wonder and amazement at the immensely tender spirituality which this film has bestowed upon me. \nThis is my second Tarkovsky film...and now I am hooked.  I am not going to be very successful in explaining this movie to anyone -- even to myself, so forgive the sketchiness of these reflections.  THE SACRIFICE is a revelation to me.  The level of pathos I feel right now is overwhelming -- something that has occurred too infrequently in my life. \nThis film regards the human soul as the most precious commodity possible and life as it's most ample celebration.  \"Time cannot vanish without trace..\" Tarkovsky has said.  And so the time that Tarkovsky spent on this Earth, has been well spent and he has left more than a trace for future generations to wonder and ponder at.I adore Tarkovsky's images, so lovingly photographed here by SVEN NIKVIST. Most remarkable of these images are the final settings where everything comes to a point...even THEY have dialogue made up of great silences packed with intensely significant emotions which have come from the protagonist's culmination.The choice of music here is also deeply personal and wildly original in its contrasts and penetrating meaning.  In the final strains, we hear first the modern and timeless Asian sensibilities of Watazumido Shuso.  After which a great silence of visual narrative we are offered a spiritual selection from some of the most beautiful music ever written -- Johann Sebastian Bach's St. Matthew Passion.All of these, combine in one's mind's eye and heart to provide the thoughtful viewer with one of the most spiritually satisfying endings of any movie I have ever witnessed.The movie seems long but, it really isn't as long as you might imagine.  I suppose it is because so much of the narrative is not splashed into our senses -- ready for regurgitation.  There is much we must work for.  There is much for which we must contribute our own viewpoints and form our own conclusions.But then life isn't filled with dialogue in the conventional sense...it is more packed with our own thoughts and our own decisions -- as so is this film.  It allows you to conclude many things on your own. \nIsn't it kind of Tarkovsky to have been so benevolent to us and our panoply of thought-patterns?  We come to this movie all with our different characters and personalities...Tarkovsky thought of this.And he offered us a masterpiece - where we were the mental protagonist who made the endings for each us - our own -- and yet all different -- but the same, after all.",

            "review_title": "Beautiful, Powerful, Philosophical, Art at its greatest form",
            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's swan song \"Offret\" (\"The Sacrifice\") is composed of 112 long takes and sequences, almost without any cuts, planned scenes just like a stage play with enormous acts whose dialogs are rich, powerful and filled with insights on life, death, philosophy, sacrifices. It sounds like a film directed by Ingmar Bergman and there's no secret that this was Tarkovksy paying a tribute to one of his favorite directors, filming in Bergman's famous island used as scenery in many of his films; some actors who worked with him and the habitual cinematographer Sven Nykvist are present in \"Offret\".In one the finest performances ever captured on film, Erland Josephson lives the journalist Alexander, a worried man about mankind's destiny who tells to his little and mute son, called 'Little Man', about how doomed we are, but also tells him good things too, teaches him to plant a tree and all. On the day of Alexander's birthday the Third World War breaks in and this time we and the characters have the feeling that now the world really is gonna end. As last wish, Alexander pray to God wishing to have more time to live and in exchange he'll give up his family, his belongings and his house. I don't wanna keep wavering about where the plot goes and show the thoughts I have about the film, I'll leave that to you reader. Instead, I'll keep my focus on some of the beautiful things presented here, some of my favorite moments and the physical aspect that I found interesting about \"Offret\". As I said earlier, this film looks like more a work from Bergman than a work from Tarkovsky, and for the die hard fans of the Russian director might not be so appealing since he uses the visual to tell his stories in most of his classics but here he depends on dialogs and more dialogs which is quite rare in his filmography. Tarkovsky composes along with Nykvist two worlds in one: a beautiful and colorful island with green trees, a sunny place; and the devastated place with dark tons, shapes, very dreadful, creating an apocalyptical world without any kind of expensive scenarios. He uses the cinematography and a subtle and powerful special effects to destroy the world.Here are the things I won't forget about this masterpiece: 1) Alfred's prayer, one of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments ever made, filmed in one long shot; 2) the house on fire burning down to the ground, beautifully filmed; 3) The jar of milk smashing on the floor when the planes appear showing us that the war begun; 4) The story described by the postman about his 'collection' of events; 5) Alfred's monologues about art, death, life, fear. Tarkovsky's idea flying in its fullness. 6) Alfred visiting the only one who can help him, Maria the maid of his house. 7) The desperation of Alfred's family when the world's end. 8) The first scene with Little Man and his dad planting the lonely tree (which also ends the film with Little Man's first quote), meaning the creation of life, a hint of hope. 9) the ending, absolutely perfect.It is art and philosophy at its highest point. And it's sad that this Tarkovsky last film in the way that I really loved his change of style here, I was looking forward for more films like this but it simply didn't happened. Life was taken away from him very early but we're left with interesting and great masterpieces like this, \"Stalker\" and more. One of the most beautiful pictures ever made and must be included on a list of films that you can't get out of your head. 10/10",

I watch it again about once or twice a year, like a ritual or an annual holiday I would be taking into levels of consciousness where the mind is not really required. I do not understand, and I do not feel like I have to, it is secondary. I feel touched like only pure and silent beauty can touch me, or bliss. It is obviously created around an idea of sacrifice, being both a gift to others but also to ourselves. By offering his life in order to save his family, his grandson and the world, the main character is also giving a true meaning to his own life that had mostly been of artificiality, questionings and shallowness. Every person who enters the house, he starts seeing under a deeper if not more expressionistic light... And when he meets with magic (while making love with the witch) he creates the bridge that will take him from reality into mystery. The whole film is as breathtaking and self-sufficient as a painting, or even more so, a Russian icon. It is ageless. I suppose it will remain with me for my entire life. I consider it Tarkovsky's last will, but even more so a piece of the Human Heritage that should be protected and kept accessible for future generation.",

            "content": "It has the makings of a film I'd usually like - intellectuals pondering man's fate and the existential threat of nuclear war, the poetic visions of Andrei Tarkovsky, and cinematographer Sven Nykvist - and as it was Tarkovsky's last film, I feel bad I didn't like it more.The setup is strong, with that long conversation with the postman and then the pessimism in the monolog of the main character (Erland Josephson) while his son crawls around: \"We have acquired a dreadful disharmony, an imbalance if you will, between our material and our spiritual development. Our culture is defective. I mean, our civilization. Basically defective, my boy! Perhaps you mean that we ought to study the problem, and look for a solution together. Perhaps we could, if it wasn't so late. Altogether too late.\"I also liked the indirect imagery of war, with the planes rocketing by overhead rattling the cupboards, and the apocalyptic television broadcast that suddenly goes dark. The film was made when nuclear Armageddon was still the biggest fear for humanity's survival, and Tarkovsky is brilliant in the restraint he exercises in these scenes, which effectively amplifies it.Warning, spoilers from here on.In an allegorical way, the film then seems to show three reactions to such extreme, existential fear: (1) anxiety and/or panic that's muted through alcohol or sedatives (2) praying with all one's heart to God, and (3) turning to more earthly pleasures, and perhaps making a deal with the Devil via a witch. Maybe these are the three basic ways people tend to respond in life, facing a world with so many problems and knowing they will die one way or another. Get anesthetized, get holy, or get laid.In each of these things though, I was a little disappointed with what Tarkovsky was showing me: (1) the wife's panic is overwrought and I cringed over the daughter's forced sedation, (2) plays on the stereotype of the atheist turning to God when the chips are down, and (3) is just weird, even if taken in some symbolic way. These scenes also go on for too long, and are absent interesting philosophical dialogue.It's all subject to interpretation and there is no shortage of analyses about the film, but it then seems to show the nuclear war avoided (yay god! Or yay witch?), but the man's demise unavoidable (that shot with the ambulance, while prolonged, was excellent). Was this guy just going insane all along, crushed by his pessimism and fear for his own mortality? Regardless, Tarkovsky seems to show that while humanity somehow finds a way forward without wiping itself out, the next generation will always replace us, a bittersweet message which yet somehow has hope.There's a lot to chew on and I confess I liked thinking about the film more than I liked actually seeing it, if that makes any sense. Ultimately the religious overtones, its length, and the middle sections which I thought were weak dragged it down for me. It's worth seeing, but I don't think I would want to watch it again.",

            "content": "It is perhaps too blunt a notion that Andrei Tarkovsky's the Sacrifice bears some comparison with Ingmar Bergman's films. More than a notion, it's right up there on the screen: Erland Josephsson, one of Bergman's great collaborators, as well as Sven Nykvist (probably the best), as well as certain allusions in some of the shots (i.e. the kid in the bed in black and white seems right out of Persona). But it's also the themes being dealt with, the tone in the monologues from the characters (albeit from Josephsson and usually dealing with his faith and memories), and the sense of grief and bewilderment ala Shame. At the same time, with these allusions as well as others to the likes of Nietzche and Dostoyevsky, it's through and through the work of a filmmaker so in touch with his soul as an artist, with so much to pour into a work that has relatively little plot (not that it doesn't have a story), that it floors one.And, in a sense, it's close to being, despite its darker intonations and its ambiguous, staggering ending of madness and hope, the director's quintessential work. While Stalker will probably stay as the artistic pinnacle of his career, the Sacrifice brings to a head many of the director's chief concerns while not possibly making them too patched together to make sense (i.e. The Mirror, which is nevertheless also great), as well as in a style that is meditative, calm, harsh, surreal, and always with the heart and mind of what leans toward the poetic. Once we get into the premise of the picture, which takes a little while itself to set up- an old man, Alexander, (Josephsson) and his family are at his home to celebrate his birthday when elsewhere a catastrophic war is going on, with the family left to their own devices out in the middle of the countryside- Tarkovsky explores the spaces that are there to see in the consciousness of men (and, to a degree, women) in a crisis of faith.In reality, there isn't a whole lot that \"happens\" in the usual plot-driven sense of the Sacrifice, but within the realm of the scenes depicted and acted, there's a lot more than any other filmmaker would meet at. A visit to Maria, a \"witch\" in a church nearby, takes up a fairly significant chunk out of the picture, but in it is a story told by Alexander about a garden and his mother, and around this and in this scene are the details that Tarkovsky builds with. It goes without saying his genius also lies with whom he works with, and Nykvist creates such a mood for each particular scene (sometimes the light or look of a scene will fade just a little, and everything will change, however subtly, for an instant), and such a delicate, brooding nature with the camera as it tracks along in Tarkovsky's carefully lined long takes, that it ranks up there with his very best pieces with Bergman.But at the same time, as the director mixes in black and white footage, slow-motion of a character running down a hall, a tilt up some mud and nature, a sense of time and place and horror is depicted, honestly, without the problems with usually pretentious visionaries. And as it was that Tarkovsky knew that he was dying- unlike other filmmakers who fade out after their last picture or die unexpectedly- there's a sense of self-reflection, as it comes out with Alexander and in those around him, that is sad but ultimately poignant to the highest order. Questions are raised that can hardly be answered, but one of the chief ones has the ring of naivet\u00e9 until it's known that it's this particular instance it's raised: is there no hope for the spirit? What about the boy, however, might also be another sort of question, as we see the final shot starting on the boy and raising up ever so gently up the tree with the music playing on.All these and more can be raised from the Sacrifice (not to mention, of course, what does it mean to really sacrifice oneself), but it's besides all of that just a truly rich cinematic experience, one that's so rich that it's hard to take it all in all at once. It has the sustainability of its artistic force to not have the danger of growing 'dated'; to make a more leap with some grandeur perhaps, as with a poem or some renaissance painting (not far off from the Leonardo featured in the film), the Sacrifice asks to be revisited, to have the experience of the thoughts and ideas poised, and for the amazing performances and technical work. It's one of the true masterpieces of the 1980s.",

            "review_title": "Disappointing end to an astonishing career.",
            "content": "This last film by the great Tarkovsky and seen as an article of pure faith by many, suffered from production problems, the largest being a camera jamming which resulted in the cast and crew pulling together to rebuild a set so that the film could be completed. Tarkovsky had suffered worse, not least the loss of an entire film due to a lab fault back in Russia. His chief problem was adjusting to the more formal structure of crewing in the west as opposed to the freedom afforded him back in the Soviet Union. I think the main problem affecting this film is it seems unduly influenced by Bergman and has the same cameraman. The hysterical women on the floor especially reminds me of 'Cries And Whispers'. Mimicking another's style, even one as great as Bergman's, diminished him somehow. Also, I can't pretend to understood the plot which at times seemed eccentric to the point of obtuseness and silliness, not least the rather too sudden appearance of an ambulance and the puzzling business involving a witch. Why anyone should suspose such an involvement would prevent a nuclear war is perplexing. Also the tired use of yet another levitation motif suggested Tarkovsky may have been running out of artistic steam. On the plus side there is an enigmatic soundtrack of what sounds like sheet metal work, suggesting spiritual discord perhaps?Whether one engages with a Tarkovsky film depends on whether you identify with whatever spiritual problem his character is wrestling with. Some people are more concerned with nuclear issues than others. Some may see the sacrifice made by Otto as an inspiring spiritual one against his own interests. Certainly Tarkovsky seemed enamoured of the concept of the holy fool, weak and perhaps misguided and foolish individuals who are disenfranchised but in their lowliness somehow admirable and insightful on some matters. Others of a more secular persuasion may see Otto's sacrifice as selfish (his family being affected) and merely the pointless actions of the benighted. I'm sitting on the fence. The final sequence, which for the reasons above had to be re-shot is sadly not one of Tarkovsky's best. He has this need not to edit for the audience and prefers scenes to run to their own inner dynamic. It didn't work for me.Tarkovsky was dying of cancer during the making of this film and the watering of the withered tree is actually an older myth, ruminated upon in his extraordinary book 'Sculpting In Time'. It is about 'the truth' as he sees it and is a Christian one. Unfortunately, I don't think this film was all it could have been but I see why it means so much to many. In my opinion he was perhaps the greatest film maker of all time and we are unlikely to see his like again. He believed that the gift of friendship was the most natural and important one to give as it is the one most open to us all.",

            "content": "While not quite his best film(Andrei Rublev), The Sacrifice, like every film Andrei Tarkovsky did, still manages to be a wonderful film. Like other Tarkovsky films, particularly Solaris, it requires a lot of patience- like Solaris The Sacrifice has a rather ponderous and static first 30 minutes that might alienate viewers- but if stuck with it is very rewarding.Tarkovsky's films are some of the most visually accomplished and beautiful films ever seen, and The Sacrifice certainly is visually accomplished and beautiful with positively dream-like photography, evocative scenery that reflects the horror of nuclear war brilliantly and stirring images and symbolism that are not too hard to understand. That's unsurprising though considering it's from Sven Nykvist, an Ingmar Bergman regular and one of the greatest cinematographers who ever lived. Tarkovsky's direction, which always had a rare consistency in quality(to me he never made a bad film- one of the few directors for that to be the case- even my least favourite Ivan's Childhood is great as well as his most accessible), is as usual exemplary. There is a vast Bergman influence here in terms of themes, but there is enough of Tarkovsky's style to still make it feel still like a Tarkovsky film.The music is haunting and melancholic, like with Mirror Bach has never been more effectively used on film, and the script evokes a lot of thought and succeeds in giving dimension to the characters. The story is more rigid and uncomprisingly detached than Tarkovsky's other films, but while the film is deliberately slow and long there still is a lot of power and emotional impact, especially in the truly miraculous scene with the witch and the powerful epilogue. The acting suits the film very well indeed with Bergman regular Erland Josephsen giving a compelling performance in the multi-faceted lead role. Overall, not his best film, for me it ranks around the middle of his filmography, but Tarkovsky's final film(he probably would have done more films had he not died so young) hits a high note. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Minor spoilers. This is not a film for everyone, and probably not a film for most. However, if you like art, it might be a film for you. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky, viewed film as art and his films make few, if any, concessions to commercialization and marketing. If you are looking strictly for entertainment, you may find this film to be slow, boring and depressing. However, if you are looking for art, then you should not ignore this film.The artistic merits of the film are considerable. The theme is an individual's relationship to God, politics and mankind in general. How can a sensitive and intelligent person come to grips with these huge and sometimes overwhelming parts of life and still keep his own integrity in tact. Just attempting a subject like this is courageous and laudable, but in doing so the director walks dangerous ground. It is so broad that no film can truly encompass it, and wisely Tarkovsky doesn't try. Instead he shows one man's attempt to deal with it - flawed and inadequate as it may be. This is a clever way to approach it, because it stimulates you to start thinking of what your own approach might be.It begins in color, with Alexander, a very self involved and disconnected man in his later years who is forced by circumstances and a very odd mailman, to confront his relationship to God, and society. This causes Alexander to go through different mental states which are filmed in black and white or muted color. As the day moves forward, Alexander eventually sifts from a passive observer of life to someone who is committed to playing a dramatic but positive and active role in the spiritual and temporal life. With this new reality, the film returns to color. The composition of the sets the framing and the editing of the film all are carefully done to support and emphasize the theme and development of the film. The film takes place on one day, Alexander's birthday (yes, this does have a double meaning). Throughout the film death is the looming and persistent presence. Near the beginning Alexander rightly observes that fear of death will drive people to do many foolish things. We see some of these foolish things as the characters of the film become unfaithful, hysterical, and even cruel and destructive when threatened by death. Tarkovsky himself was facing death by cancer when he made this film and this was his final film. In the end, however, the film is life affirming, leaving us with a view of hope and even joy.This is a film I respect but it is not very entertaining. I am glad I watched it, but I wasn't really ready for it when I started. If you are not ready to see a film this serious and deep, then it would be easy to dismiss it as difficult and even painful to watch. But to do so would be a reaction to that same fear of death that seems to be the root of so much evil in the world. Understanding that this is a film about serious topics that effect us all and not a casual bit of entertainment can make the difference between appreciating and valuing this film or not. But even though the film had some difficult and soul searching moments, you will enjoy the end and its message of hope. The final image of the film is a young boy bringing life to a dead tree. It is a truly beautiful image and one that think will stay with me for a long time.",

            "content": "Each time I see a film of Andrei Tarkovsky I think this is his most impenetrable film, but \"Sacrifice\" (his last film) really deserves this honor.At the end of his career Tarkovsky left the USSR and after shooting \"Nostalgia\" (1983) in Italy he shot \"Sacrifice\" in Sweden. To be more precise the film was shot on the island of Gotland in the Baltic sea, and not on the nearby island of Faro. It is easy to understand where this misunderstanding of Faro as shooting location comes from. Faro was the island of Ingmar Bergmen and \"Sacrifice\" has everything to do with te the oeuvre of Bergman. Bergman actor Erland Josephson plays the leading role, Sven Nykvist is cinematographer, the little tree in the opening scene made me think of the tree Max von Sydow fights with in \"The virgin spring\" (1960, Ingmar Bergman) and even the theme of the film is very Bergman like.The film is about a man thinking that World War III has broken out and nuclear disaster is impending. In a key scene of the film he is desperate about (as Bergman would have called it) \"the silence of God\". In this respect one could consider \"Sacrifice\" as the fourth episode of the Bergmanian trilogy about \"the silence of God\" which consists of \"Through a glass darkly\" (1961), \"Winter light\" (1963) and \"The silence\" (1963). The character of Alexander from \"Sacrifice\" resembles perhaps most the character of Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow) from \"Winter light\".\"Sacrifice\" is not Tarkovsky's best movie, but I couldn't help to be touched by the final scene. The beautiful images, the beautiful music (Erbarme dich, Matthaus Passion, Johann Sebastian Bach) and the dedication of this movie to his son (given the fact that Tarkovsky was terminal ill when he made \"Sacrifice\").",

The cinematography and editing are obviously Bergman influenced, but anyone who says that it bothers them to see Tarkovsky borrow the style of another needs to learn more about Eisenstein, Kuleshov, and perhaps Wajda.This film serves as a stark example of the real difference between the work of the European authors and Hollywood.  While viewing, keep an eye on the editing.  Th film opens on a five minute long shot in which it is extremely difficult to even discern which character is speaking. The scenes are made up of as few shots as possible and the shortest shot of the entire film is about 10 seconds.  There are less than a dozen close ups in the entire piece, which may be why American audiences with their limited attention spans, would reject the film.  The Sacrifice might not sit well with Tarkovsky purists, but it's themes and philosophy, I feel, surpass in depth, any of the master's other works.",

There's very little music during the course of the movie, yet subtle, mysterious sounds contribute to an overall feeling of mystery and foreboding. The acting and dialogue are no doubt greatly influenced by the work of Bergman. Perhaps the film is a kind of homage to him.This is definitely not a popcorn movie, nor one to see on a first date. I recommend you see it when you're not distracted or impatient - when you can be fully present and mindful as events develop at an unhurried, organic, human pace.

The story is supposedly about a group of characters in a rural setting experiencing the end of the world, but as usual for Tarkovsky it's dragged out to the degree that it gets boring very quickly, and is far too long-winded for its own good.

Tarkovsky is a fan of long takes, slow character development and awkward silences. Even though this is one of my favourite films, it was a struggle to get through the whole thing...which is, in fact, an effective medium to describe a man who is finding it a struggle to progress with his everyday life. The settings are fittingly dreary and dismal; indeed, his son seems to be the only spark of life in the film.There is no plot to speak of; the film is an in-depth character study. Tarkovsky has given the main character so many dimensions that one cannot help but wonder if it is semi-autobiographical. Elements of magic realism serve to enhance the character's despair and isolation, but there are finely-crafted human details -- such as a shaking hand that must try twice to light a match properly -- that give the film a very realistic sense. The world Tarkovsky has created is like a vivid dream.The images in this movie are incredible: watch for his use of fire, wood, earth and water, for all four elements are heavily drawn upon in his shots. There is a documentary floating around out there that has Tarkovsky discuss this film in depth; it shows the processes he invented to create some of the takes, and the stubbornness he exhibits to get everything to match his vision perfectly. I saw the documentary before the film, and I think it only added to my appreciation. His book, \"Sculpting in Time,\" also offers insights and bits of philosophy that add dimensions to this movie.Though I regret that Tarkovsky passed before he could produce more works like this, \"The Sacrifice\" is a fitting epilogue to his collection of films, and perhaps the best eulogy a person could ever hope for.",

When people talk about pretentious and boring films that sophisticated people fawn over, this is the best example I can think of apart from a few films by Jean-Luc Godard! While some unfairly look at Ingmar Bergman's films as being pretentious (they've been made fun of repeatedly on TV and in short like De D\u00fcva), I have seen a huge number of them and they are not pretentious. While they aren't always as great as some claim (and this is true of any film maker), but it is clear he is a great writer and director. However, this horrible film that is a joint Swedish-Russian production IS pretentious, boring and just about as much fun as eating broken glass. No,...wait,...I think I'd rather eat broken glass than watch this film again. Now I am NOT saying movies need to be fun to be watched and appreciated--it's just that if they are depressing and bizarre there should be some reason for subjecting the viewer to this.The movie delights in long and emotionally disconnected camera work. Some may see this as artistic, but I just see it as dull and lifeless. Then, when it is combined with interminably long and self-exploratory monologues, it is a recipe for total boredom. The characters rarely interact--they talk at each other or just talk into space. And the surrealistic elements of the film may seem sophisticated to some, but to me they are a giant headache. For a similar effect, read several books by Albert Camus, a couple existential philosophers and then rap yourself in the head with a mallet.If you like this film--great. I am very happy for you. But you also should realize for the average viewer (and in fact, MOST viewers), this film will be a tedious experience. In other words, this movie definitely is for a very, very selective audience.FYI--This is the third film I have seen directed by the widely acclaimed Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky. While many love his films, I have found all three overly long, overly introspective and overly \"artsy\".

It is one of those rare films that goes to the antipodes of what is good and bad in that art form. Overall, it's a film worth seeing, but it is in no way, shape, nor form a great film; much less a masterpiece. Tarkovsky, who had fled the Soviet Union, filmed The Sacrifice in Sweden, using Swedish actors- including Erland Josephson, the star of many Ingmar Bergman films, and used Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist, as well. This was a wise choice, as The Sacrifice is one of the more arresting visual works anyone is likely to see on screen, especially in its interesting choice of medium shots as the dominant frame, or mis-en-scene. Yet, where the film falters is by, instead of maximizing the positive traits of Tarkovsky and the Bergman contingent, the film brought out the worst elements of Tarkovsky and Bergman. As example, Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay, and like most Tarkovsky films, The Sacrifice is long (142 minutes on the Kino DVD), but it lacks all of the subtle poesy in earlier Tarkovsky films (Solaris, Stalker) and instead indulges on overwrought scenes of terror and regret. There are early scenes where philosophic banter occurs, but the last three quarters of the film is filled with some astonishingly bad acting, which has to be laid at the feet of Tarkovsky. Bergman, who was possibly the greatest screenwriter of the Twentieth Century, was always concise in his screenplays. However, whereas that strength of Bergman is ignored, Bergman's greatest weakness is employed, and that is a relentlessly depressing view of life and the characters. One knows from the beginning that they are all doomed, and, save for the youngest character in the film, this comes to fruition, although, this is only so if one renders the most positive interpretation of the film possible. In all other ways, that ending is likely a delusion, which means Bergmanian dourness combines with a dearth of Tarkovskian poesy to make the film dark, despairing, and oftentimes dull.",

            "content": "Tarkovsky's last film is one of those perfect last film, a last testament. Tarkovsky heard he had cancer when he was editing the film. Still, he had been sick for some time so who knows how fear of death influenced his script and filming or what he knew unconsciously?It was made in Sweden. Tarkovsky was a refugee, missing his home country, his life there and especially his young son. Tarkovsky borrows many of Bergman's collaborators, including Sven Nykvist on camera and Erland Josephson as Alexander, the protagonist. Alexander is really Tarkovsky's mouthpiece. He has the same religious and political views and the same taste in art. Sacrifice is in fact not very Swedish at all. It is a Russian film through and through, with very Russian characters speaking Swedish. Tarkovsky even filmed it in Gotland because it looked like Russia. The whole film is very personal. The little boy is like his own son who he missed terribly. The wife in the film is just like his own wife in Russia and the story about how they found the house is in fact how he found his house in Russia (and the house in the film looks like the that house).The original idea for the film is found in a script he wrote and called The Witch. In it a man dying of a cancer has sex with a witch and is cured. He leaves all his riches, family and friends and follows the witch into poverty. While Tarkovsky was filming Nostalghia he got the idea of adding an apocalyptic scene to it, an all out nuclear war. While keeping the witch in the script he added a deal with God also, which has confused many viewers. I personally don't get the confusion. It can be read in at least three ways. One that he is a desperate man who makes deal with anyone willing to make it, to safe mankind and his family. Or that he makes a deal with God to safe mankind and the witch to safe his family. And there does not have to be a crash between the witch and God. Looking at her home we see that she is quite religious. She might be called a witch but she is more of a holy fool. Otto, the post man is another and Alexander turns into the third one in the end of the film, creating a holy trinity of holy fools in the film.Then there is the whole question of what really happens in the film. Is there a nuclear war, is there any deal with God, does he really go to the witch? What is reality, what is hallucinations and what are dreams? It is hard to say. We get hints, like turning off the music and so on but even they don't work. Tarkovsky deliberately makes it impossible to determine what is real and what is a dream. He said that he wanted it that way. People would have to make up their own mind about those things.I honestly think Tarkovsky would have been most pleased if we did not make up our mind. If we just lived in the mystery, the uncertainty, the dreamlike state of none logic. These things happen and they don't happen at the same time. We have to believe and not believe. Life is full of those moments. We don't know what would have happened if we acted differently, took a different path in life, even what happens at times in our life. Life is uncertainty and it is very modern to try to kill that. In fact this love of cold rationality is killing the world, creating atom bombs that can wipe out all life on earth.Tarkovsky's answer to this cold rational anti human spirit of modernity is mysticism, art and faith. This is crystallized brilliantly in the end when Alexander wakes up. It looks like God has answered his prayer or was it the witch? Or was it all a dream? He can't be sure and he can't find out. If God has moved time back to yesterday then no one but he remembers what will happen. The telephone calls hints at that. Alexander has only one possible action in front of him. To keep his promise, no matter if it was a dream or not, if God did something or not. Otherwise God might make all of it happen again and he is for sure not going to get another chance to stop the horror. So without knowing if this was a dream Alexander burns down his house and takes a vow of silence. In the beginning was the world, in the end is the silence. And here we come back to how personal this film was. Tarkovsky had in fact sacrificed his house and his life in the Soviet Unions for his art, and he honestly hoped that art and his sacrifice could change the world.This uncertainty is also reflected in the last shot of the tree. For a moment the dead tree looks alive. The hope here is in the next generation that waters this tree of life (I call it tree of life because Tarkovsky had previously shown us the tree of life in a painting, obviously to help us make the connection). Tree of life stands for hope eternal. It was one of the two trees in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve could not eat off. They are kicked out in fear that they will also eat of it (and become like God) and it is only promised to mankind at the end of time. In Christianity Jesus Christ is often seen as the tree of life. So what we get in the end is a hope for mankind in the from of a tree which stands for mysticism, art and faith - a hope kept alive with every new generation.",

We are watching the middle of summer, with everything (but the one tree) growing and thriving.  The rains are relatively gentle compared to the winter snow.  The windows are open to the light breezes, and the light never leaves the sky.  When it seems that disaster has struck, the fen is not panicked.  The dapple of the leaves doesn't stop when the rush of planes has gone by.By comparison, the interior shots are overly ordered and spare.  The inside is Alexander's mother's garden, after Alexander prunes it.  Everything is in order, and the beauty is pretty much gone.  The moment order is disrupted, things fall apart.  The English wife bursts into hysterics and declares she can't stand it \"anymore.\"  This is not the wail of someone who has suffered a sudden shock.  This is the wail of a woman who has seen her foundation swept from beneath her, and is forced to confront her existential realities.Otto and Maria are obviously out of place in this orderly, petty world. We know that Maria is the best kind of witch -- but what is Otto?  Is he collecting the incident that happens in the house that night?  Is he collecting the incident with Maria?Kierkegaard wrote the answers to most of the questions asked, either in Sickness Unto Death, or in Fear and Loathing.  Recommended reading -- if you get through this film, you can certainly get through Kierkegaard. ;)To me this is a film that pits romanticized fertile nature against the restriction of (Christian) predestination, pits hope against despair.  The Japanese found aesthetics in the most despairing circumstances, even where there was not hope.  Alexander feels trapped by civilization, by his ordered and cowardly life -- yet he moves to sacrifice himself to save it...or to escape?  Does he redeem his family, or remove their chance to transcend their petty patterns?Resist taking the first part of the film as monologue -- perhaps you have never had a child?  Little Man is old enough to think for himself -- he proves that by the end of the film.  He has listened to every word his Papa speaks to him.  His father is answering questions that the boy can't ask, or doesn't know that he should.  Papa Alexander is trying to pass on what he has learned so his son might have a better chance (or, paradoxically, so his son can grow up with comfortably similar delusions?).  At the end of the film, we realize that Alexander's son has questions that his Papa will never answer.Finally, I have to note, on the closing scene -- for those of you who are not familiar with botany -- the dead tree seems to be planted head in the earth, with the dead roots in the air.  It is a project out of touch with nature, and like the rest of the film it offers a prayer for a miracle, or the evidence of utter psychosis.Now, read Kierkegaard, watch the film again, and enjoy!",

Every single scene is meticulously crafted and executed. Tarkovsky applies each and every technique that he has learned - and mastered - over the years and solidifies himself as a master of cinema. An artist. An expert. An auteur. I'd be lying if I said I did not cry. I cried twice. Once at the beginning, and once at the end. The opening credits hadn't even finished, and I was in tears. I don't know if it's because I realized that this was Andrei Tarkovsky's final film, his last mark on cinema history, or if it was because of the beauty that overcame my senses, from sound to sight. I cried at the end, because it was over. Tarkovsky's last film. It ends triumphantly, magnificently, and heartbreaking(ly). It is a legendary ending, juxtaposing the end of life and all we own (a house fire) and the beginning of life (a child caring to a young tree). This film marks the end of the Andrei Tarkovsky Appreciation Event, the end of Tarkovsky's filmography, and the end of a legend. But is it the end or just the beginning?Tarkovsky's filmography will forever be immortalized in film history. Each of his seven films are masterpieces in their own ways. 0. The Steamroller and the Violin (1961): One of the greatest short films to come from a film student and proof that Tarkovsky had limitless potential. 1. Ivan's Childhood (1962): One of the best directorial debuts and wartime character studies. 2. Andrei Rublev (1966): One of the best biopics and historical epics in film history. 3. Solaris (1972): One of the greatest space and psychological journeys to cross the silver screen. 4. The Mirror (1975): One poetic piece of cinema in every way and an incredibly personal experience. 5. Stalker (1979): One of the finest science-fiction films of all time and a masterclass in filmmaking. 6. Nostalghia (1983): One of the most sincere and reflective films to ever be conceived. 7. The Sacrifice (1986): One of the best shot films and a beautiful end to a master's work. Every film Tarkovsky created is quintessential to cinema. Even though Andrei Tarkovsky passed away, he lives on. Someone somewhere, will discover his work. Someone somewhere, will be inspired by his work. Someone somewhere, will pay homage to his work (I will pay homage to him... one day). Tarkovsky may be gone, but his impact on cinema will never disappear.Now onto The Sacrifice (1986). I really couldn't find much wrong with it (hence the 10/10 rating). Maybe the slow pace, but slow paced films don't bother me. This film has a lot of main characters in it, and it works. Each character is written originally, organically, and purposefully. At times the different personalities clash, and then moments later they blend. The overall chemistry of the entire ensemble is really great. Erland Josephson is the main (main) character. He is amazing in this film. From the very first scene, we are connected with him (even though the camera is distant, but I'll get to that later). That's really how it is with all of the characters in the film - we're connected with them. They're completely real, raw, and original. Josephson doesn't just carry the film, he makes it. Without him, the supporting main characters would not have worked. He is the common ground for the audience, between insanity and rationality. The performances were up to par with the quality of the film, but in the end some characters could have had a little more \"stage presence.\" Such as Julia and Maria's characters (Val\u00e9rie Mairesse and Filippa Franz\u00e9n). They weren't as fleshed out as they could have been, and I think both of their performances weren't as strong (or noticeable) as the rest of the cast. Regardless, their characters still work. In the grand scheme of things, they did not need to be as present as the other characters, but it would have been nice to see. Overall, the ensemble cast (something Tarkovsky really hadn't done before) worked. The way these characters worked wasn't just because of the actors, but also because of the writing. Tarkovsky wrote such a complex plot for this film. He throws everything he has into it. Every stylistic device. Every metaphor. Every amount of personal-ness he can add. The Sacrifice (1986) was dedicated to Tarkovsky's son. The son who he had not been able to see for eighteen months. This is a love letter to him, and a message to all of human race (I know, big expectations to fulfill). The story serves as a warning to mankind: to not abandon our spirituality for materialistic goods because when you lose everything you own, all you have is your faith. I think this story is as important and impactful as it was back in 1986. It holds up on so many levels. From the historical allusions to the character attributes utilized. The plot slowly (very slowly) evolves from a normal day into dire circumstances (WWIII) to only devolve back into normality. It's hard to explain because the plot is simple, yet complex. Beautiful, yet devastating. Each line of dialogue is real, yet expositional and artistic. I learned a lot about how to write an effective film and how to write subtextual dialogue on the first watch. I wasn't even trying to learn anything, I was just trying to experience it. That shows how amazing the writing is. It captivates you. It intrigues you. And it makes you question yourself. Andrei Tarkovsky writes with such nuance, mastery, and experience (as in he puts his own experiences into the film), to craft a timeless piece of art named, The Sacrifice (1986). The cinematography is gorgeous. There are a total of 115 shots in this film. 115. That means that the average length of each shot is a minute and a half (not every scene is a minute and a half, that's just the average length of each shot for the 149 minute runtime). There are sequences that last upwards of 6 minutes long. The length of a scene doesn't mean a film is beautifully shot, but what it captures does (that isn't to say that the long takes aren't beautiful in themselves - they are). This film captures beauty in its purest form. It captures nature, humanity, kindness, faith, and much more... just through imagery. The shots Tarkovsky and Sven Nykvist choose to use, denote emotion. Every single shot has a purpose. Like the very end of the film, it directly parallels the opening to Tarkovsky's first film, Ivan's Childhood (1962). The Sacrifice (1986) ends focused on a tree, and Ivan's Childhood (1962) begins with a single tree in focus. I doubt that this was done purposefully, but this connection just ties his films together. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if this was in fact done purposefully. Regardless, all of Tarkovsky's films are shot beautifully, each with their own style, emotion, and composition. COMPOSITION! I completely forgot about the composition of this film. Each scene is staged to perfection. The camera revolves around each character, hitting marks that are just aesthetically pleasing. The composition of each scene is purposeful, as characters move around (in and out of frame) to reveal new things. The mix of scene composition and camera maneuvers just elevates this masterpiece.The Sacrifice (1986): Tarkovsky's final film. This is the penultimate Tarkovsky film. It is the an incredible cinematic experience. I had very high expectations going into viewing this, and they were exceeded. This film is nearly perfect, marking the end of Tarkovsky, and places him within the ranks of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived. Seeing this final film makes me wonder... how different would film history be if Tarkovsky hadn't sacrificed his life for art. I'm sure he would have somehow outdone this film with an eighth feature, but we'll never know. We'll never know what he thought of today's masterpieces. If he really enjoyed The Terminator (1984), imagine what he would have thought of films like The Matrix (1999)? Or even films like The Shawshank Redemption (1994)? Marvel films? I would love to hear his opinion on these films, but I don't think I ever will. All we have are the films he made, books he wrote, and ideologies he established to communicate with him. His seven masterpieces. That is how we will continue to celebrate Andrei Tarkovsky's legacy. So as the month of April ends, Tarkovsky's birthday month, so does this event. The goal was to view every Tarkovsky film and to review them for a greater audience, and I can confidently say that I did so. I've had so much support on this, and I thank you. I thank every single one of you for simply viewing my posts, because now you've heard of Andrei Tarkovsky. And maybe, one day you'll decide to watch one of his films - and I hope you do. Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky was one of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived, and a filmmaking hero of mine. I've really exhausted all of my opinions on his films, so I won't bother explaining them to you anymore... I'll let him do it. \"My purpose is to make films that will help people to live, even if they sometimes cause unhappiness.\" -Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky (April 4th, 1932 - December 29, 1986).",

Yes there is much here of beauty - the elaborate sequence shots; the fluid recreation of interior space.  But often Tarkovsky's rejection of purely intellectual cinema seems to leave a paganistic, cod-transcendent, touch-feely melange of muddled ideology, soggy spiritualism and cardboard characters.  One can only marvel at a film, though, that switches from melancholy Chekhov 'comedy' to apocalyptic fantasy to supernatural horror.",

            "content": "Pauline Kael once said that \"movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip - from what was coarse and common.\" Andrei Tarkovsky, in his relatively short career, dismissed cinema's original intent, it's coarse nature that Pauline Kael referred to, and used cinema as a way to move the viewer to meditate on his or her spirituality. THE SACRIFICE, Andrei Tarkovsky's final film, is yet another film of Tarkovsky's brilliant catalogue, which emphasizes the importance of faith and spiritual reflection. THE SACRIFICE is a hard film for some to figure out. Personally, there is not one film playing in the nearest theater from which I write this review that approaches the relevance that this film conveys. The movie is about a man with a lucrative career that takes some time off with some family and friends to an isolated location. He appears to be pretty well off until he gets message that war is imminent. He prays to God, in one of the most intense moments in film, and promises that if God ends the war then he will disown his family, burn his house down, and stay silent for the rest of his life. The war ends.... That's as far as I'm going to go because I want you to have the opportunity to see a film that rises above cinema. The film, however, does not reveal if God responds to the prayer. Whether he does or not is not what THE SACRIFICE is about. It's about the actions that we perform in order to be closer to God, and some people respond more intensely than others.Great movies about spirituality are all but gone from today's cinema. Most come off as either to corny, preachy, etc ... Unlike those ridiculous exercises, THE SACRIFICE is a smart film. It's beautifully crafted, the acting is terrific, and the direction is top notch. It is a film that has moved me to reflect on my own spirituality as well, and I can truly tell you that few movies have done that to me. I really appreciate THE SACRIFICE; it is a film that has produced an important effect in my life. Now how many movies can do that?",

The \"plot\" is very vague and, despite the terrifying premise of a nuclear holocaust, there is almost no urgency. Where the film excels is in its camerawork: the movements of the camera are so fluid and so \"soft\", that you'll often get from a very long shot to a close-up of a person without even noticing it. Some people have called it a masterpiece; such an opinion is understandable, even if I don't agree with it.    (**1/2)",

            "content": "Exiled from his native Russia, Andrei Tarkovsky shot his final film, The Sacrifice, on Faro Island, where Ingmar Bergman produced his body of work (and also lived). Tarkovsky also used Bergman's cinematographer, Sven Nykvist. He was also aware that this would be his ultimate film, as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unfortunately, whilst he survived till the release of the film, he died shortly afterwards, in the same year. The subject of his concluding piece is telling of his knowledge of his impending departure from the world, and it is fitting and profound, as you might expect from the Russian master of the poetic, and aesthetic.Alexander (played by Erland Josephson - a Bergman regular, who also worked on Tarkovsky's 1983 Nostalgia), has a birthday, where some family and close island friend, Otto (Allan Edwall), come to offer their congratulations. They here on a statically-interrupted television broadcast. that a nuclear strike is imminent. With this news the family break down emotionally, and Alexander pleads to God to alter this reality, and offers himself in sacrifice to the ones he loves. This offering is seen to its fundamental conclusion when he wakes (possibly from a dream), and all is as it was, the threat of World War III seemingly never a subject of genuine certainty. Towards the climax of this film, is a one-shot take lasting several minutes, whose logistics are incredible, but Tarkovsky still manages to infuse the scene with some kind of mystical power, that I believe permeates all of his films.As you would expect from a Tarkovsky film, the pace is slow (which gives the audience time to immerse themselves within the intricacies of philosophical thought, and the profound nature of the situation). But with this comes a flurry of beautiful imagery. The muted colours reflect the setting, with its cold, and subdued backdrop. And what is it that we do when we face death - a difficult moment to comprehend? We perhaps reflect on our achievements, and speak to our friends and family. And perhaps when we die, our spirit lives on in others, or new beings. Or maybe we simply continue in the minds and spirits of our offspring, passing on knowledge, character, and morality.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "\"Offret\" or \"The Sacrifice\" is a mostly Swedish-language movie from 1986, so this one is already over 30 years old, and it was the final filmmaking effort by writer and director Andrei Tarkovsky, who is seen by many as one of the most impactful filmmakers from his era. When this film got released in some countries in the late 1980s, he was already dead. So I wish I could write soething more positive here, but I really can't. No intention to be disrespectful, just my thoughts on this film and Tarkovsky in general. Not a fan honestly. He sure is a very divisive filmmaker and I personally count definitely among those who don't see too much quality in his works. There is nothing really Russian to this movie here anymore compared to his other pieces. He is basically deep inside Western/Northern Europe this time also looking at the cast. Now as for the story like so many other times it is a bit difficult with Tarkovsky to understand precisely what is going on. Erland Josephson still does a solid job overall I'd say here and it could have been a worse movie without him. He has great screen presence and maybe with a better and more touching story I really could have cared about him and his character. The way it actually was though, it did feel pretty bland and for the sake of it and shocking without great substance really and with the latter I am mostly referring to the final scene when the house is burnt down. Back to the basics, this movie runs for pretty much exactly 2.5 hours, you could say it is Tarkovsky's standard running time, sometimes his films are a bit shorter, sometimes a bit longer, but this is kinda average I guess. Oh yeah by the way this movie also won a BAFTA, a bit unusual because with awards bodies Tarkovsky was never really successful. I can see why with how difficult it can be to access them thematically. But many viewers love them, including those here on imdb. Despite the high rating, this is far from the director's best-rated movie on this website. Some of his works are inside the top250 even. Anyway, this one here does still not feel like the usual Tarkovsky, which i recognize that I dislike it also for other reasons than some of his other stuff. It has a touch of Bergman to it at times. But as always with Tarkovsky, there is no comedy in here.. Like none really except one or two very subty humurous sequences that audiences were craving for really, like the slightly funny guy on the bike. And with audiences I am talking about a lot of people. I am still baffled how many people went to see this recent Tarkovsky retrospective here in Berlin. Very surprising. This particular theater has never been fuller when I was there I think. The high level of how seriously this film takes itself and how poetic it also is can be seen through the repeated inclusions of Nietzsche and Zarathustra. Even the simpler characters here seem super-intelligent. It does not feel too authentic and realistic a lot of the time. What I did like though at times were the green sequences outside the house. The interactions and chemistry between the individual characters and mentions of the little boy were among the better aspects too. So overall, I say that this is not a film symbolic for Tarkovsky, except the religious references you find in all his works. Don't watch it first if you haven't seen anything else from him. It would make no sense. Watch other stuff and if you like his approach unlike me, then give this one a go. I personally give it a thumbs-down though and I think there's far too many better ways to spend 2.5 hours compared to this one here. Don't waste your time. It does not get better during its course, actually even worse I'd say all in all. You're the biggest victime here.",

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILER: A Western viewer needs to know a few things about Russians to fully understand the meaning and significance of this film. One item of particular significance is the magnitude and nature of war. The film states that a nuclear conflict of some sort (limited or unlimited is not clear) is imminent or has already started. Certainly the noise and vibrations due to the noise of the jets flying overhead indicates that war is about to break out. Now, war damage is actually something of an abstract meaning to Americans; all of the battles fought by our military in the wars of the 20th century were in far off places. Though there were exceptions with Pearl Harbor, the torpedoing of merchant ships of the coast of the United States during the early days of WWII, and of course the events of Sept. 11, 2001 the truly great battles were elsewhere and people who lived in the center of our country, in the countryside such as shown in this movie, were not directly affected or attacked. Now, nuclear war would probably bring about death and destruction even to the Heartland of the United States but that is hard to grasp for most Americans as this sort of war has never happened.However, the Russians (or Soviets at the time of the making of this film) did suffer tremendous destruction throughout their country in WWII. And, this destruction did affect most of these people. In fact, wars in the past before WWI and WWII (such as during the Napoleonic era) have also caused terrible destruction in Russia. So, to the Russian viewing this movie, the terror shown by the actors is very well understood. War to the Russian is not generally sending troops across oceans to fight but rather fighting the enemy in one's front yard.The other matter that a Western viewer needs to know to understand this movie is the very superstitious nature of the Russian people. I had long thought that the most superstitious country in the world was probably somewhere in Africa or the Caribbean. It may be, but the most superstitious country with any sort of development is undoubtedly Russia. Those people are very sincere in their belief in Astrology and any other superstition that they have ever heard of. The movie is not being factitious when a woman is cited as being a witch. They still believe in such people in Russia, though the nature of witchcraft there is somewhat different than the traditional depiction of a witch in the West. And, quite a few employers in the former Soviet Union probably believes that one of their servant women could be a witch.And, most people in Russia could believe (for the sake of the film) that a witch MIGHT actually be able to do something to stop a war. Who the witch is and what, if anything, she can do in this case is something you have to see the movie to find out. Sufficient to say though, that belief in the supernatural is still quite common in Russia, and must be taken into account when seeing this film.",

Tarkovsky purposely made the beginnings of his film slow so that audiences who are not interested will leave the cinema hall and the ones remaining were really the kind of audience that would 'get' his work. In a Legacy of art films by Tarkovsky, 'The Sacrifice' is the last and final offering and extremely inaccessible to the uninitiated. Viewers' patience and attention is tested greatly. At 2 hrs 28 mins it is long however if you stick through with it you will be rewarded with the auteur's vision of cinematic 'hypnotic' suspension which he had mastered with his earlier works.This film was made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer and I wish he was able to make more such works of art and beauty.

It's so pleasantly different from the rapid jump-cut editing of today's blockbusters here in the United States, and I was glad to look at a tree or a picture longer than most modern movies would allow.**SPOILER ALERT** My main fault with this movie is the screenplay. It's a contrived mess. The hero, Alexander, just happens to be taking stock in his life and where his life has led him when nuclear war breaks out, and the postman who's read more books and has more whimsy than your local hippie librarian just so happens to know a lonely witch who can undo all that has been done in return for a \"favor\"? It strains credibility to an absolute fault, and the plot line sounds like the work of a child just beginning to write in cursive.Then there are the situations and characters that take you absolutely nowhere. Alexander's wife -- what purpose did she serve other than being the obligatory hysteric in a crisis film? And her rambling about loving one man and marrying another? Where does this train of thought go? Nowhere!!!! Do we see her analyze her marriage and seek to do anything about her plight? NO!!! It's a line that makes no sense in the film and has no resolution at all, and yet ENTIRE FILMS have been made about that very feeling! There are so many lines that don't make sense in light of everything going on, and it just feels contrived and meandering.I understand there might be a cultural difference in storytelling that's at work here.

Although the island has a long semi-independent history, it has been an \"official\" part of Sweden for more than three centuries.Many of my reactions to this film are the common ones: this film is \"Bergmanesque\", a little different from yet not discontinuous with Tarkovsky's others; the images are striking and almost overwhelmingly powerful; the film is long and slow (\"stately\" to say it positively), so much so some won't have the patience to even finish watching it.I think though the story is more complex and subtle than is often stated. Supposedly the topic is a slightly off-kilter person giving up what he loves in exchange for the salvation of others as a reaction to the specter of nuclear war. After all, his life circumstances look pretty attractive to us viewers: wealthy, respected, private, and comfortable. The ominousness of the opening dialog doesn't seem warranted.But I think it's more than that, or at least more ambiguous than that. The main character isn't just slightly off-kilter, but close to collapsing completely. His life has become unbearable. And his motives are as much about \"punishment\" (or even \"revenge\") as \"sacrifice\".Why do I think that? For starters, how is it that the only people that will come to Alexander's birthday party are his doctor and his postman? That guest list sounds to me like an act of desperation, an admission that he's hit rock bottom. Alexander's wife is so neurotic even her daughter and her lover chide her. His daughter can't grow up in such an isolated place; she never sees anyone else anywhere near her age. And as far as her obvious age-appropriate interest in boys, there's nothing more than a bad joke about the postman being her beau. She flips between acting like she's ten and acting like she's thirty, with nothing in between. Alexander sleeps on the couch in his office rather than in the marital bed , and everyone acts as though that happens all the time. When he bicycles to his servant's house (or at least dreams he does), along the way he sees the doctor's empty car with his wife's shawl; clearly he's aware that his wife is having an affair with his \"best friend\". His servant's immediate reaction is \"something terrible must have happened at home\", and it's apparent this isn't the first time she's seen Alexander's home situation become intolerable. And the doctor's plan to move to Australia is a truly momentous, one-in-a-million attempt to escape forever. The doctor's calm, detached, slightly ironic bearing belies the awfulness of the words he speaks about just how dysfunctional Alexander's household is.",

            "content": "I am not going to be kind about this film. Indisputably a masterpiece, or so many people say, and they may be right. I am not so sure. The opening and very philosophic sequence lasts ten minutes and we see a barren tree being watered and listen to a lot of dialogue, mainly about Nietzsche. From this seeming improbability, we move into a house in a part of Sweden which resembles the Russian Steppes. The house is celebrating the master of the house's birthday (played dully by Erland Josephson) and for a long while we look at a Leonardo da Vinci reproduction, an old map of Europe and a book of Russian Icons in full, and it must be said, glorious colour. The contents of the house are so perfect I wanted to break something, and this long stretch of the film introduces us to a cast of mainly one-dimensional characters, and a sort of discourse on the decline of civilization and culture, and of course a vague sort of spirituality. The film's opening music is Bach's 'Matthew Passion' and that heightened state already heralds that something momentous is going to happen. And it does. The beginning of WW3-with thunderous planes, shaky furniture and my wish come true, something breaking. I perked up a bit to see our main dour character's wife having a total collapse, and Susan Fleetwood is excellent at bringing the film to vivid life. A great performance, until the men take over again. I have forgotten the downtrodden maid who is supposedly a sort of witch, and someone very wise (male of course) suggests she may be able to return the world to the way it was. No more spoilers. I also noted among all this high mindedness that Tarkovsky could not resist showing off two women's naked bodies, falling into the trap of the male gaze on women's flesh so prevalent in other art house films. This disappointed me. I thought naively that Tarkovsky was way above such a crowd-winning sight, but I was wrong, and it was that moment of revelation that made me doubt his water-tight credentials as being a master of the spiritual. Bresson too has fallen into this erotic trap, so he is not alone. No good judging society's values and then pandering to an audience's basic needs. Or am I being too harsh? I think when these giants of austere film-making fall off their own pedestals it is entirely their fault. The BBFC called it at the time 'brief sexualised female nudity' and they did so for this elevated film. I love sexuality in film when it is honest, but this example of it is not. I am still not sure what the 'sacrifice' achieves other than giving a sense of apocalypse, but Tarkovsky was dying of cancer at the time and the last scene shows his concern for his son. This is understandable, and given the state of the world at the time (no mention of the AIDS pandemic) I asked myself has the world got any better since 1986? Arguably from the perspective of May 2021 it is worse, and Tarkovsky's hope for a better world has not yet arrived. Because of this I find the film dated, but both Bela Tarr and Alexander Sokurov owe a lot to Tarkovsky, but then again in 'The Sacrifice' Tarkovsky owes a lot to Ingmar Bergman. Great directors all,but give me the deceptively light profundity of Eric Rohmer any day. In the same way I often prefer the insights of Francoise Sagan over Fyodor Dostoyevsky. So why the generous 10? Because I err on the side of it being a masterpiece.",

Basically, former stage actor turned journalist, critic, and lecturer on aesthetics Alexander (Erland Josephson) is celebrating his birthday. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franz\u00e9n), and young son, \"Little Man\" (Tommy Kjellqvist), who is temporarily mute following a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander's friend Otto (Allan Edwall), a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. Alexander mentions to Otto that his relationship with God is \"non-existent\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and medical doctor and close family friend Victor (Sven Wollter), who performed Little Man's operation, arrive at the scene offering to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car. However, Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, Alexander recounts how he and Adelaide found their lovely seaside house by accident, and how they fell in love. But then he feels weary if the pressures of change, feeling lack of harmony within his family and threatened by relentless modern technology. Many people gather for the birthday celebration at Alexander's house. People comment of odd behaviour of maid Maria (Gu\u00f0r\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir), she leaves while nurse-maid Julia (Val\u00e9rie Mairesse) stays to help. Just when the dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, a news broadcast announces the beginning of what appears to be a nuclear war. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown. In despair and desperation, Alexander vows to God to sacrifice everything he loves, even his own son, if the devastation will come to an end. Otto suggests and convinces him that Maria is a witch. Alexander takes his gun and escapes the house and rides his bike to where she is staying. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but then he pulls out the gun. At this point, the rumbling noises return, Maria soothes Alexander and they consummate while floating above her bed, though his reaction in unclear. Everything seems normal when Alexander wakes the next morning in his own bed. But he still plans to go ahead and give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk and sets fire to their house when they are away. The group rush back when they see the fire. Alexander confesses that he set the fire himself, and furiously runs around. Maris comes along; Alexander tries to approach her but is restrained by others. An ambulance appears unexpectedly in the area, two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, catch him and drive off. Maria begins to bicycle away, stopping halfway to watch Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted. As Maria leaves, the \"mute\" Little Man lies next to the tree and speaks his only words, a quote from the Gospel of John: \"In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?\" Also starring Per K\u00e4llman and Tommy Nordahl as the Ambulance drivers. I will be honest and say that I didn't get it all, the basic story is that an intellectual goes delusional and strikes a bargain with God for peace, so I got lost with all the philosophical and biblical stuff at times, but it is performed and directed well, it is not necessarily for all audiences, but it is not a bad drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Foreign Language Film. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!",

For others, the vivid resonance may have an oddly therapeutic effect\".Indeed, the movie rarely leaves the Gotland-based manor the main characters reside in as the threat of nuclear holocaust looms over them (making this almost too perfect a movie choice for the COVID-19 lockdown and our present uncertainty of the future). But there are so many more layers to the movie and, in spite of cinematic philosopher\u2122 Andrei Tarkovsky being well-known for his insurmountable depth (the underlying theme might even differ from the \"overarching\" one preached/discussed by the characters), this may be his ultimate, most layered masterpiece.The Sacrifice (org. title Offret) was produced in Sweden, with help from Bergman's old friends, during the Soviet refugee's final years, and the approaching nuclear doomsday, foreseen and dreaded by Alexander (Erland Josephson), likely represents his own knowledge that lung cancer would inevitably claim his life. This is the underlying, implicit stuff.The more explicit themes come when the once dispirited Alexander tries to bargain with God himself, hoping desperately to \"restore everything as it was before, as it was this morning and yesterday\" - resorting to faith (and eventually worse) even as some things are so clearly unavoidable. Although, maybe Alexander's rediscovery of the supernatural isn't unfounded? Maybe his friend Otto (Allan Edwall) wasn't wrong in his beliefs that, for example, the new Icelandic maid (Gu\u00f0r\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir) is really a witch? Are there - at least within the film's universe - larger forces to be summoned? Things like this are for the audience to interpret themselves, and help them reach other conclusions about the characters.There are also musings on the idea that, after this is all over, it may just start again (and I'm not just talking about the historical repetition of doomsday scares); an endless cycle that, as a concept, gives some believers hope for a new life, the same way others might fear that it will be a repeat of all the same losses and failed endeavors (the 2001 sci-fi film K-PAX advises us to \"get it right this time\"). As usual, Tarkovsky communicates the ideas through intelligent filmmaking choices that work on several levels:Early in the film, Alexander quotes John 1:1 to his voiceless son: \"In the beginning was the Word\". As the movie closes, the child speaks for the first time by uttering \"In the beginning was the Word\", bookending the film (which arguably fits the theme of cycles and recurrence) and adding an extra layer to the citation by, indeed, speaking his first word. As a more ironic meta touch, they are also the final words spoken in the entire film - possibly the final words ever written in a script by Tarkovsky (who dedicates the tale to his own son). In the end, was the Word. You see what I mean yet?Of course, we can't avoid discussing the more directly observable technical mastery. The list of Tarkovskian masterstrokes is endless: the effective way that the camera dollies, pans, and zooms about the scenery as the characters discuss heavy philosophical subjects in long, uninterrupted takes; the way other actors in the scene are directed to be at just the right place at just the right time in accordance with the calculated camera movements; the minimal but all the more striking usage of music and special effects; the absolutely flawless staging during the climax, perfectly synchronizing the filming of the scene with the deterioration of a burning building. I dare not try to imagine how many tries it took to get this right. Knowing Tarkovsky, probably one!If you aren't afraid to be truly challenged by a movie, then, well, there might be a few things that still perplex you about this one. Much like Suspiria and The Man From London (to name a few), this is one of those multi-national European film productions where all the actors on set (e.g. the Scottish Susan Fleetwood) simply spoke in their native language to be dubbed later. This is very noticeable; in this instance, the dub character appears to be an English-speaking immigrant, shrieking in her native tongue when she breaks down in a fit of despair in the arms of Sven Wollter.With movies like this, I often try to recognize their historical importance and impact while perhaps not personally enjoying them (Tarkovsky might be the ultimate filmmaker that, supposedly, film snobs \"pretend\" to like in order to appear cultured and cinema savvy). I didn't always \"enjoy\" watching Stalker, for example, yet I realized that having fun wasn't the point; a movie can be effective and succeed at communicating precisely what it means to while still being \"boring\".But The Sacrifice was so genuinely moving, so impressively made, and understandable on such a multitude of levels (the underlying musings of death and the apocalyptic plot that's sadly relevant; both to the late-phase Cold War worries of its era and the worries of today) that I adored every second of it. I was dead certain about giving it a 10-star rating, but am still considering whether I will name this the greatest film ever made in my homeland - perhaps, dare I say, my new favorite movie.Again, it may not be the escapist reality-break you require at this time, but since the film is public domain and legally available on YouTube, you deserve the chance to have the sort of movie experience I just had. It's certainly been a while. I know this isn't the right level of classy verbiage for a Tarkovsky post but: Jesus Christ what a good f*cking movie!",

            "content": "What strikes you first in this film is the very careful and extremely esthetic visual composition: every scene is like a beautiful painting, and Tarkovsky's knack for making his women exceptionally beautiful enhances the visual gratification. The actors are also all very good, Erland Josephson and Allan Edwall leading the extremely extraordinary speculations. A retired celebrity of letters and the theatre celebrates his birthday together with his friends and family in an isolated beautiful spacious old-fashioned house by the sea, when apparently the third world war breaks out. His wife immediately succumbs to hysterics, the young doctor Victor (Sven Wollter) gives them sedatives, the professor drinks brandy, while his friend Otto (Allan Edwall) comes with bizarre alternatives.I always had some difficulty with Tarkovsky's later abstract films for their extremely slow pace marked by a total absence of action, especially \"Stalker\" and \"Nostalgia\", but here something keeps happening all the time to keep you awake and interested: small details, the child's pranks, the mysterious kitchen maid in her beauty, Otto's indispensable bicycle, mirrors of course, breathtaking long shots, and above all the philosophical or parapsychological development going to bizarre extremes. How is this predicament to be dealt with? That's the issue of the labyrinth leading you on for constantly more exciting thought and practical experiments.This was the year of Ronald Reagan's strikes against Libya, the beginning of the Glasnost movement with Gorbachev, and the murder of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, a mystery still unresolved. And in the end of the year after this film Andrei Tarkovsky died of cancer at 54, which he probably had attracted from toxic fumes as early as during the shooting of \"Stalker\".There is much of Bergman here, the team is all Bergman's, and one could describe the film as more Bergman than Bergman. There is also many reminiscences of Carl Th. Dreyer, but it's still definitely all Tarkovsky: you recognize his special peculiarities and details in almost every scene.The most peculiar detail of the film is perhaps the surrealistic war scenes of total confusion showing random people running about in bewilderment among the ruins of a car and a lot of rubbish. The street shown in this scene is the very place where Prime Minister Olof Palme was shot six months after the film had been completed, and the camera is placed on the very spot - a notable coincidence.So where does all this lead to? Pure metaphysics. It's definitely a masterpiece of art but very difficult to understand, but it presents a very intriguing thought experiment - the professor is willing to sacrifice everything if the war is averted, he does sacrifice everything including his own mind, and he seems to achieve the desired result.The film is dedicated to the director's son, and the son in the film clearly stands in for him and both introduces and ends the film - to Bach's most beautiful air from the Passion of St. Matthew - \"Have mercy\", \"Erbarme dir...\"",

But sorry, I can only explain the misplaced reverence for this film as credit for his earlier work, and respect as his career and life was ending. However, this film is the kind of thing that has made \"intellectual\" a dirty word in the US. Just what we need - more artful glorification of the clich\u00e9 that being an intellectual means being a spoiled rotten self-absorbed, self-pitying terminally miserable humorless neurotic, who has it all but does nothing but desperately search for reasons to feel sorry for himself. This film asks deep questions? Sorry but I was only 12 when my intellect questioned and rejected the ridiculous idea of a \"loving\" all powerful god getting sadistic kicks from demanding \"sacrifices\". This film limply accepts that lame-brained dark-ages scam of religious oppression with a whimper. But why not when the sacrifice involves every old rich white guy's fantasy of banging his hot young maid! Some sacrifice! Of course he manages to turn even that into a downer - sheesh! Can't be an \"art\" movie without a topless maid! Class oppression - even making the maids wear uniforms in the 20th Century - is another sickening idea that is accepted without comment or critique. The idea of there being some eco-idealistic message in burning a house is also silly as hell. He obviously had no problem owning a house that would take the energy use of a small country to heat. Guess it doesn't matter if it impresses the neighbors. And people say this is about teaching the next generation to do better? Are you kidding? It's sad that there's an art-house audience for such pap, when Greenaway can't even get a release in the US these days. So... this is the film for you if you're no longer satisfied with depressive navel gazing, and you're so desperate for miserable self-absorption that you'll bend over and stare at your own anus, so then you can complain that something smells bad, and you have a backache too.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's final film is the type of thing that fans of his cinema would immediately recognize as a great concept for him to take on: a man is celebrating his birthday with his family when it is interrupted by the news that the world is on the verge of war, and everything will be destroyed. In Hollywood-world there'd be explosions. In American independent cinema there would be survival at the edges of society as the characters are forced to live together in a very small house far from civilization and certainty. In Tarkovsky's view, it is another passionate reveal of faith, fate, and free will, and the father who sacrifices himself to save the world for his son (i.e., not too far from Tarkovsky's father, who went off to war and didn't come back, and with the same burning house as in the Mirror returning this time as part of the sacrifice).This movie has, I think, less cuts and longer takes than Tarkovsky's other movies, but it flows faster because of the more characters (Nostalghia is the only other movie of his I've seen that has quite so many people around, his world is only filled with people who represent something important, the background of populace does not concern him). They come in and out of frame, constantly shifting and moving, while the camera follows the most important information. Just keeping track of where the characters are spacially can take up the larger part of the playlength; following the dialog and its philosophical tones will more than keep you busy; and then basking in the painterly beauty of his landscapes and sepia tones ought to tie up the experience for the patient viewer just fine. As usual, this movie is only for those who desire contemplative cinema that takes its time and unravels rather than reveals. The impatient viewer might find himself looking at the timecode too often, and pity for that.Otherwise, for my part, nothing keeps my attention riveted more than his use of camera. The man can make that thing float through space as if it has no mass and has no weight, but is a figment of his will to compose imagery. The Sacrifice also features one of the finest performances by Erland Josephson I've ever seen, and honestly if I hadn't had known it was him going in I wouldn't have recognized him at all (he's a very different character from, for instance, the man from Saraband and Scenes from a Marriage). The dedication at the end is a punch in the gut, too, if you keep in mind that Tarkovsky never got to return to his homeland and died just after seeing this movie completed, effectively creating a zip effect from his own childhood to his son's, through the magic of this singular film.--PolarisDiB",

Though his best-loved films were done in Russia, he clearly adapted well to Sweden, as films like \"Sacrifice\" are still powerful epics. He sort of entered the world of Ingmar Bergman by casting Josephson, using cinematographer Sven Nykvist, and even hiring son Daniel Bergman for the crew.Over the years, the film has grown in stature. In 1995, the Vatican compiled a list of 45 'great films', separated into the categories of \"Religion\", \"Values\", and \"Art\", to recognize the centennial of cinema. \"The Sacrifice\" was included under the first category, as well as Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\".

And as with every of the seven films of Tarkovsky, it is incredibly beautiful to witness the visuals. The use of different film stocks, 10-minute single takes, elegant slow motion, the signature water, and of course, Nykvist's signature shadow and lighting work. It is truly gorgeous.I have no more words to spill on, what needs to be experienced. The film is the perfect ending to one of the most impressive filmographies from a director in cinema history.

            "content": "I was very disappointed when I saw Offret the first time years ago. I wanted to check what time did to the film and to me, and so I rented the new DVD. Alas, the experience repeated itself. I was irritated by the slowness of both the camera and actors to the point that I watched almost the whole film on double speed (which I recommend to everyone; subtitles make sure you will follow the plot in the absence of sound). Tarkovskij is still my favorite director, I just wish he did not make this silly movie with pretentions all over. First, the plot. I learned from the documentary \"Directed by Andrei Tarkovskij\", included on the DVD, that the plot was concocted by putting two separate original screenplays together: one about the witch and another about the final war. With this knowledge it is easier to understand the resulting absurdity of the plot. Second, the characters' psychology. Well, there is none, but perhaps it was meant to be that way. Tarkovskij is not about psychology, he is after something else and much grander. His characters only are wooden puppets, moving on the set in somnambulic stupor to illustrate or convey the author's message, whatever it may have been. The director's dictatorial style is well shown in the mentioned documentary: he apparently seldom gave the actors freedom to enliven their performances with even small gestures. Third, visuals. Not impressive at all. The empty, bleak landscape was not exciting, although again - it was probably meant to be that way. Camera moved a lot, but slowly. There were no revealing angles or shots, with the exception of the dream sequences. In the documentary we most often saw the master cameraman Sven Nyquist standing along, while the director was sitting behind the camera... So what is all this about? Since I have been \"trained\" by the previous Tarkovskij's films, I guess, this film is, again, about an individual's responsibility for the state of the world. But in contrast with the early masterpieces Ivan's Childhood and Andrei Rublev, the message of active involvement is muddled here by imposition of too literal a threat of the world annihilation and the unforgivable introduction of the witch theme, which is - apart from other things - incongruent with Tarkovskij's religiosity. I am sorry that the director was carried away too far in his crusade against any kind of rationalism in the world of human affairs.",

Either way, it is worth watching. If all else fails and nothing grabs you at all, Sven Nykvist's cinematography is gorgeous. Arguably the best he's done. You could just drug yourself up and turn off the subtitles and smile for a few hours.This is why I don't love it: its visual similarities with Ingmar Bergman's films make the acting seem sub-par. It sounds really horrible, because Erland Josephson is one of my favourite actors and I admire Andrei Tarkovsky's earlier films. But Bergman has this special knack for getting out perfect performances, especially from women. When The Sacrifice's dramatic scenes flared I felt uncomfortable because I'm used to a stupidly high standard. My second and lesser reason has to do with the absence of grounding within the first hour of the film. Tarkovsky's philosophical musings on art and faith have always had a strong and fundamental world to exist it- Andrei Rublev has its medieval Russia, Stalker its post apocalyptic wasteland, The Mirror exists within the tendrils of memories. The Sacrifice doesn't give you a platform to make its ideas relevant, so the first time you watch the film it is distracting trying to find out actually where we are. Some praise this dreamy ambiguity. I disliked it. It's actually more enjoyable the second time around.The disappointing thing is, if Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman didn't exist, and this film was the first film made by some random director, it'd probably be an all time classic.

Tarkovsky's movies are for me like watching into some abstract painting and everytime you find something new you missed previous time. You must be very concentrated and patient when you watch his movies, if not you will lose yourself and probably you will get bored and confused. For watching The Sacrifice you really need great patience, Tarkovsky's movies are known to be very slow, and this one is the slowest of his works, it is very difficult to watch but so rewarding at the end. You will think about movie many days after you watched it, and probably you will rewatch it again to find something you missed previous time. The Sacrifice can be undestand from different perspective, for someone it will be just a movie about madman and his personal inner demons, for others they will see many metaphysical and higher themes, it can also be viewed as semi autobiography and last sacrifice of a dying man, Tarkovsky died just few months after the movie was finished. He really made big sacrifices in his life, he didn't made any compromises, because of that he left Soviet Union and left his own family there, for the sake of his own art, it is really a big sacrifice, he even dedicated this movie to his son. The movie atmosphere is very bleak in times very depressive, haunting and scary, but at the end life regenerates and continues through the mute boy (his son). Sweden was perfect choice for continuation of his work, in sacrifice we can see some influences from Ingmar Bergman, but mostly it is very Tarkovsky and very Russian. Again perfect use of Johann Sebastian Bach music and Japanese traditional music, Tarkovsky was big admirer of Japanese cinema and culture in general , he said that the biggest influence on his work were Japanese movies, and we can see that influence in his works. This is the perfect ending of Tarkovsky's life and with this movie he closed his circle of life. My grade 9/10.",

            "content": "It is extreme cynicism-- even solipsism-- to imagine that the world exists in one's own mind.  Yet, in some sense, each of us lives in a universe bounded by his own five senses and ruled over by \"the Mind.\"  In a post-nuclear-holocaust world, Alexander faces a reality that he cannot bear. In essence, he sacrifices himself by visiting the witch Maria, and one may almost regard that meeting as more symbolic than literal.  Somehow, Alexander decides that by giving up everything (i.e., his home, his family, his sanity), he can save the world.  He can undo the \"war\" simply by making it a part of his madness.  In other words... if, ultimately, he is deemed crazy, the destruction will be passed off as the mere \"ravings of a madman\". Where normally society determines, in retrospect, what is \"sane\" and \"insane,\" Alexander is given the chance to rewrite history by choosing his insanity.  The question then becomes: Is he losing his grip from the start (and indeed off the deep end by the film's end) or is his \"madness\" consciously chosen?  In that sense alone, Alexander is a sort of Hamlet; he's \"crazy like a fox.\"  We're never quite sure whether he is in control of himself or not, but the net result-- if we accept the ending literally-- is that the world goes on without him.I have a feeling that this film was Tarkovsky's way of dealing with his declining health.  The watering of the dead tree is symbolic, at least to me, of the way in which one continues to do the simple, quotidian things even in the face of death (in the hope that, either within one's lifetime or not, it will yield something beautiful for others.)  His birthday also marks the death of civilization and, in choosing madness (the death of the rational mind), Alexander gives life back to the world.  I'm quite sure that Tarkovsky felt that, in accepting his death in this project, he was making a statement about what it meant to be alive and, obversely, how precious and fragile human life ultimately is.  I also get the \"Just a Gigolo\" theme here: \"Life goes on without me.\"  He's comforting himself in the thought that, in sacrificing his life to his art, even in death his life will have had meaning... in the hearts and minds of the people he has touched. Alexander's visiting the witch, in some way, represents that moment in a person's life when he chooses conversion... when he decides to accept the supernatural, in fitting with Pascal's wager (i.e., risking all on the only bet that can possibly lead to salvation... be it a bet on God, or a \"higher power\", or Destiny, or \"other\"...)I'm not sure that Tarkovsky would agree with much of this.  He had a tendency to depersonalize... perhaps in the tradition of a Vertov or an Eisenstein (at least in the sense of letting the \"camera eye\" capture reality)... in an effort to create a universal art.  But perhaps \"Offret\", to its credit, achieves universality... describing the kind of spiritual legacy that artists, as nearly all people, endeavor to leave behind.  While it may not be quite as clearly defined as Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\", in which the poet literally contemplates the way in which his mind and body give back to the Earth, it's in that same general vein.  What makes \"Offret\" unsatisfying to me is it's adagio pace, the histrionics of actors who thought that they were performing on stage and the great Sven Nykvist's wooden cinematography (which worked well for Bergman by fails utterly here.) It's a two-and-a-half hour film, of which one-and-a-half hours are a yawn (and of that \"yawn\"... at least a half hour in the middle is pure snooze.) It's still Tarkovsky, so I recommend it to other cinephiles, but its far from the kind of final masterpiece one might expect having seen \"Andrei Rublyov\", \"Solaris\", \"Zerkalo\", \"Stalker\" and \"Nostalghia\".",

I thought the use of monologue ( more like a soliloquoy in a theater piece) to convey Alexander's thoughts was so pitifully unimaginative.  It is always better to show it than using a voice over, however voice over is a far more desirable option that the kinds of monologues I saw in this movie.  If you listen carefully to what he's saying, they are inner monologues that should not have been verbalized.  There is nothing more uncomfortable than some self important person telling me that there is not any truth in the world, or that we must overcome the fear of death, gee I didn't know that!  They often border on cliches rather than insight.   Does this director understand subtext? subtlety?In addition, I couldn't forget the fact that I was watching a Tarkovsky film.  The actors moved about like chess pieces, no, they were more like arranged by the director.  Two people standing in the foreground, facing away from each other, and the third enters the frame in the background, and poses in the space between them.  Of course,all of them look ridiculously serious.  This kind of overly calculated blocking and frames repeat throughout the whole film.  The acting and blocking should organically fit into the vision of the director, and contribute to the seamless storytelling.  However, this film baits for awes of the audience rather than telling its story; \"what a beautiful shot! what beautiful framing!\"  I wish I was allowed to immerse myself in the story and experience the journey with the characters.  I feel remorse at having said such harsh words about this director who is not without talent or some measure of greatness.  Also learning that this was his last movie, and that he made this while in exile make me want to see the movie differently.  However I believe a film should stand on its own. Some may like this movie passionately, but this is not my cup of tea.",

Nor did he know that he was going to face so many problems with the Russian regime to get his films out, and it also happened. Andrei Tarkovsky claimed that \"sacrifice\" was the central theme in the life of an artist.The imminent nuclear extermination makes Alexander (Erland Josephson) turn to the divine presence to offer his sacrifice and thus avoid the consequences. The different realities, with their respective tonalities, and the divine are mixed in this dreamlike parable about the emptiness of material life.It is slow, complicated and philosophically theatrical; but satirical in turn. Through sequence shots of infinite length, Ordet represents a story that denotes maturity and experience on all sides. What seems to go no further than a family drama ends up becoming a battle against destiny and divinity.However, Tarkovsky affirmed that the cinema is the only place where this duality between the real and the divine can occur (see the black and white fragments), so he does not conceive the cinema as the bearer of a single meaning. The film has two ways of interpretation: the rational, the first one we turn to, and the \"divine\". This event can also be seen reflected in Da Vinci's painting (multiple spaces within the same frame) and in the dead tree that is still standing. Tarkovsky connects them all through the figure of Aleksander, so that the reading is always personal.No movie had dared to treat the subject of divinity in such a sure and absolute way as Sacrifico. His technical superiority is overwhelming and his intention very clear: materialism ends in human violence. Tarkovsky has managed to transcend that decision with Sacrifice. The choice is now ours.",

This one, though, is darker in tone, certainly related to the fact that the director was dying of cancer while filming his last film. Tarkovsky is perhaps the greatest art film director who ever lived and it shows on all his films.Like The Mirror and Nostalghia, this film has gorgeous cinematography and it is worthy of watching only for the images. It is essentially plot less, though I have watched only once and thus I failed to absorb everything in this complex work of art.Given the impression it made on first watching I would rate it as inferior to Nostalghia, Andrei Rublev and the Mirror and roughly equivalent to Solaris. Still, it is great and rises above 99% of all films. Highly recommended for everyone who has the patience and the open mind to watch art films and I note that I am not the single biggest fan of art films.",

            "content": "While Solyaris was Tarkovsky's attempt at a science fiction film, I think Offret can best be understood as his entry into the horror genre.Yes, there are no jump scares, no shocking moments, hardly anything traditionally frightening at all, but the film still succeeds at horrifying as it follows the descent of a man into spiritual delusion and pride.This is a story of a lofty academic, a man who lives a secular life and to all appearances has no need of crusty outdated institutions like Church or Tradition. His life is a privileged one, a life of academic ease and high social standing. And yet, not all is well in the house. Cabinets open mysteriously. Objects move. A postman who claims to be a \"student of paranormal phenomena\" speaks with a mysterious charisma.Into his life of bourgeois pains and pleasures, the news of a potential beginning to WW3 is announced through the radio. Completely lost in fear, he begs God to spare the world this tragedy, even if it means sacrificing what he has. Otto, seizing on this moment of weakness, explains to him that sleeping with his maid, a \"witch,\" will somehow stop this. So this man disconnected from God becomes convinced that sleeping with a woman not his wife is a \"holy sacrifice.\"The next day, the threat has abated, if only for the moment. In his delusion, he destroys all that he has in an attempt to parallel the life of Abraham and Isaac.Being the sort of man who holds traditional Christianity in contempt, he has failed to understand basic Christian theology; his actions are thus an ape of Christianity, a strange twisted mockery. He fails to understand that Christ is the lamb of sacrifice which God gave Abraham so that the Earthly sacrifice is not necessary. The Sacrifice that Christ calls us to is the sacrifice of our own pride, such that God can carry the burden for us. In thinking to make a bargain with God to spare the world, he comes to see himself as the man responsible for saving the world, and all humility in him is destroyed.How was this possible? How could such a thing happen to such an intellect? A lack of immersion in the Orthodox tradition that Tarkosvky himself would have been well familiar with. The Eastern Orthodox teach that one must constantly be wary of demons tempting us to become prideful and in other ways sinful. Even the simplest Babushka or catechized Malchyk would have seen through the preposterous suggestion of Otto's.In the end, the pride which Otto tempts Alexander to immerse himself in damages Alexander greatly, as his mind breaks as he tries to fulfill all the terms of the sacrifice which he mistakenly thinks he made to God. This is again fitting with the Russian conception of Sin as a form of self harm, for which the remedy is humble repentance. Does Alexander repent once in this film? Not that I can remember. He becomes a man lost in his own psyche, with what is certainly a difficult path ahead of him.",

Until then, the only relief is supplied by a witchy Icelandic kitchenmaid (Gu\u00f0r\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir!) and an eccentric mailman who tells a spooky anecdote, plus lingering shots of the gorgeous set. Try not to doze off (like I did for a bit) or press the Stop button before Tarkovsky has a chance to display his full powers as a director and visual artist. Hint: there's an ominous announcement on the radio (a JVC tuner in what looks like an antique walnut cabinet) and the lights go out; as soon as Erland sets off on his wobbly bicycle ride, you're pretty much out of the woods (figuratively speaking\u2014there's only one highly symbolic tree in sight). The haunting final scenes and the epilogue are justly celebrated, though I'll leave the mystical meaning of all this to others.

            "content": "From the gentle beginning to the harrowing yet satisfying end, this film commanded me with an inexorable pull in its sublime images. In what extent this depended on the collaboration with the Swedish cinematographer Sven Nykvist, I wouldn't really know. Suffice to say that I deeply admired Nykvist's work in such Bergman films as \"Jungfruk\u00e4llan\", \"Nattvardsg\u00e4sterna\" and \"Fanny och Alexander\"; after viewing Tarkovsky's \"Offret\" this admiration has turned into a kind of love I normally reserve for separate movies or perhaps actors. The shot near the end with the burning house and Alexander running around in delirium is to die for: it's unbelievably beautiful, and still hauntingly terrifying in its destructiveness. I would watch this film only for its visual (and aural) qualities and still be happy just to absorb the bleached art of the cinematography and the meticulous mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.Of course, this would all be somewhat shallow and empty if Tarkovsky had nothing more to offer. Thankfully, \"Offret\" has enough depth, spirituality and pathos to do its visual virtuosity justice, and even with energy to spare. Though many of Tarkovsky's cinematic elements are mystifying, they can be enjoyed and provide epiphanies on different levels of the mind and spirit, much like music (Bach not the least, exemplified by the perfect choice of opening and closing piece from the St. Matthew's Passion). The slow and elaborate pacing only heightens the tension and is necessary for this sort of cathartic journey.But for some scenes in the middle where it stumbles and just plods along for a while, \"Offret\" is in my mind perfect. Watch the suggestive movement of the ethereal curtains in the little boy's room, like divine breathing from without (or within?). Notice the exactness in the moving and placing of characters in a room to achieve symmetry, seamlessly done with flowing naturality. This is art done by a master, and the world seems a lesser place without him.",

The Sacrifice feels like a tour of everything Tarkovsky, though putting itself in the ideal middle ground as to explore them all. It features science-fiction, philosophy, mortality, male- female relationships, parent-child relationships, religion, magic, long shots, rich plots, nature and wide static angles. The imagery is a particular strong point, with his always incredible cinematography, as the colour is drained from the film during the World War III sequences and brought back subsequently. It has a very delicate and patient approach, but allows itself to explode with surprises without feeling contrived.Much of the dialogue elaborates anecdotal metaphors to the crumbling of life which represent the outer view of the world and are often fascinating. My only issues are the overacting of Susan Fleetwood (who is, interestingly enough, the younger sister to Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, one of my favourite bands, odd that a British person should star in a Tarkovsky film) and it's sometimes too mythological rather than spiritual, with Maria being explained as being a witch rather than having it ambiguous or up for interpretation. I imagine this will be a film that will fascinate me more in rewatches, but I already adore the idea of the premise.8/10",

Some argue they feel drawn-out, feature a very typical, hard to decipher imagery, a somewhat detached language, create all in all very inaccessible worlds, at least on first glance. In a way, yes, but once you get in you'll find that they always deal with essential issues of life and faith, grow on you and offer to explore new perspectives on repeated viewings, eventually leave a lasting impression. Take \"Offret\" (\"The Sacrifice\") for example.Not only was the movie shot in Sweden, but Tarkovsky also clearly channels Bergman in this one, even uses parts of his crew, which plays well into the themes at stake. But he more than re-hashes \"Wild Strawberries\", \"The Seventh Seal\" or similar Bergman works that deal with death or re-evaluation of one's life. At any rate it's Tarkovsky's last movie and in many ways autobiographical and personal. It is a deep character study and deals with the reflections of an intellectual on his past life, which becomes unhinged at some point - and the changed circumstances demand a final, definite answer. The film is carefully constructed and leads from seemingly casual conversations of a life that is in complete order to something rather different. However, while the path that leads to the conclusion might be there right in front of you on screen, it's up to the viewer to decide where to draw the line between reality, imagination or dream. The viewer also has it in hand to determine the ultimate reasons why certain things happen: whether an atheist has suddenly become pious in the face of death and God answers, or innermost convictions have surfaced, even if witchcraft is in play or the wheel of life itself just turns once more thanks to the Nietzschean eternal recurrence, a theory a certain postman ascribes to. The spectrum of Tarkovsky's \"Sacrifice\" is enormous and the picture is as substantial as the viewer is willing to concede.",

I was too young to really enjoy it - or grasp it, if you will, and I must admit, parts of it seemed like a terrible drag, all tough other parts were very interesting and oozing of some sort of eerie repression, or maybe horror. The film is very demanding, and sets you back into wondering what, why and how a lot of the time. Tarkovsky, it seems, isn't about to give anything to the spectators for free on the intellectual level, and I guess many are simply put off by this. The simplest example to this might be what other commentators has perceived as a World War III scenario, but in fact there are no clear references to any war at all in this film (to my memory). There aren't any scenes of combat, and no war machinery is ever shown (for sure). What is it then, but that of a feeling conveyed? This is of course very important to the understanding of the film's underlying topic.Slow paced, difficult to understand, and confusing it may be at times, however I think it's worth the endurance, if only to experience something different, and a lot more thought provoking than the average Hollywood entertainment film. Further more, Tarkovsky's skills with film techniques are very evident and this film is, if nothing else, a good film to spot the successful use of film language on a very high and subtle level \u0096 the way he so dynamically and dramatically uses lighting, and the way he chooses to use sound, like in the opening sequence where the dialogue of characters far away in the picture is unnaturally audible across a vast meadow. And not least the way he so subtly can convey feelings and moods with simple, but effective means \u0096 maybe even tricking us to make connotations to some sort of nuclear holocaust.

It's one of those Russian films where not much happens during the story, some of the scenes might seem awkward to a modern- day audience, but you still feel blown away. This and Nostalghia actually required me to check a few analises to understand better the story. They're way more hermetic than other Tarkovskij films, but no less good. I particularly loved the choice for the setting and the music (Despite it didn't show up much in the film). Anyhow, I suggest to watch Offret twice, and to read a good analisis of the thematics in the film before the second view.

Surprisingly straightforward in structure & assisted by breathtaking cinematography, the film seems different from his past works yet retains all the director's trademarks.Written & directed by Tarkovsky, the story comes packed with endless monologues & philosophical musings that bring the narrative to a halt but its portrait of a middle-aged intellectual reflecting on his faith, existence & mortality in the wake of nuclear holocaust still manages to be stimulating in bits n pieces. The film contemplates on regret, disillusion, service & sacrifice through its protagonist but the journey can be tiresome & frustrating.The pacing is far too relaxed & undisturbed which in turn makes its already lengthy 142 mins runtime feel twice as long. Also not helping the cause is the very difficulty of connecting with the characters. Still, the arresting imagery is able to keep us in a state of trance with its long unbroken takes, dreamlike manoeuvres, silent gestures, decolourised palette & impeccable lighting, and that house burning segment leaves a lasting impression on the soul & senses.Overall, The Sacrifice marks the final outing in a filmography that's ranked amongst the greatest, and brings Tarkovsky's career full circle with its final shot. Crafted with care, composure & consideration, the attention to detail in every frame is admirable and its plea for spiritualism is lyrical & ruminative. All in all, Andrei Tarkovsky's final feature film is a multifaceted work of profound beauty & quiet mystique that isn't for all, for some will be enraptured by it while others may find it tedious & overlong.",

            "review_title": "Following through on a Promise",
            "content": "Made while Andrei Tarkovsky knew that he was on death's door, The Sacrifice is the final work of one of cinema's finest filmmakers. A plea in the face of a literal Armageddon on a small scale, it deals with the sense of the apocalypse in the most overt and immediate way, speaking directly to Tarkovsky's obvious sense of mortality. That immediacy makes The Sacrifice a surprisingly visceral film when coming from Tarkovsky, the maestro of long, slow takes, made all the more interesting because the film also functions as a paean to Ingmar Bergman.When Tarkovsky was negotiating with Soviet authorities over the final cut of Stalker, he supposedly said, \"I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman.\" Both Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman were known for slower films, often barebones productions with a heavy focus on character and the human face. When Tarkovsky went to Italy to make Nostalghia, he hired Bergman regular Erland Josephson to play Domenico. Exiled from his home in the Soviet Union (with the Soviets quite literally holding his son hostage for a time), Tarkovsky went to Sweden to work with Josephson again, as well as Bergman's most frequent cinematography Sven Nykvist, Bergman's Academy Award winning production designer Anna Asp, and even Daniel Bergman, Ingmar's son, in a small capacity. On top of the talent, there's an emphasis on soul-baring dialogue, especially in the first third of the film, that would feel at home more in a Bergman film than in a Tarkovsky film (it's too personal and less philosophical).Josephson plays Alexander, a retired actor turned lecturer who lives with his wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franzen), and son Little Man (Tommy Kjellqvist) in a remote two-story house in Sweden. It's Alexander's birthday, so they are joined by the newly local postman Otto (Allan Edwall) and the local physician (and Adelaide's lover) Victor (Sven Wollter). Together with Alexander's two servants Maria (Guorun Gisladottir) and Julia (Valerie Mairesse), they congregate in the house for a birthday dinner. Everything seems bright and cheerful and cordial, and then Alexander leaves the house to look for his mute son who has gone missing.The bright and colorful color palette suddenly turns drab and desaturated, almost to the point of being monochromatic. One of the advantages of running through a director's work in order is to see the evolution of style and discovering the purpose of certain stylistic choices. At no point in Tarkovsky's career was the changing of film stock, or the abrupt change in color timing, meant to imply that the action displayed was happening at the same time or same place as the footage around it. In every color film he made from Solaris on, he used black and white or tinted footage to show that there was something materially different from before. I bring this up because the essay by Robert Bird that accompanies the Blu-ray from Kino says in no uncertain terms, and bases quite a bit of his analysis on the idea, that everything happens here definitely, most definitely, happens for real. It doesn't. This is all a dream. It being real doesn't even jive with the thematic focus of his past few films where characters dealt with great faith in the face of seemingly nothing.Anyway, Alexander comes back to discover the entire household sitting around the television after news of the outbreak of World War III has reached them, quickly followed by the television getting turned off and the people needing to deal with the news. Adelaide immediately has a mental breakdown requiring a shot of drugs to get her sleep. The rest are much more circumspect in their reaction to the end of the world, conversation eventually moving from what to do next (whether they should drive northward or stay) to how this could have happened. The overall conflict is never described in any kind of detail (lending further credence to the idea that this is really just a subconscious creation of Alexander's) and the focus solely rests on the people in the house with Alexander retreating to his upper room and praying to God to take it all away, offering up all of his possessions and his family to undo what has come to the world. Otto sneaks up and offers him a way out, though. He must go to Maria, the servant, for she is a witch, and lay with her to save his family. And so he goes, laying with her before waking up in his own couch in his upper room as the colors of the first section of the film return.I want to bring up Bird's essay again because he seems particularly confused by the transition from what was Alexander's dream back to the waking world. He doesn't know what reversed the Apocalypse, Alexander's promise to God or Alexander's sleeping with Maria. Well, it was neither, because it was all a dream. However, what's important is that Alexander thought it was real. Whether it really happened and he's been drawn back in time or whether it was just a premonition of things to come, he has a choice about how to move forward. He could take the laying with the witch as his freedom to disregard the vision, or he could follow through on his promise to God.Looking at the poster above, I think it's obvious to anyone how he chooses, and that's the point. Alexander, much like Alexei in Nostalghia, was a man of little faith at the beginning, and through a Saul on his way to Damascus moment, he's given a vision of truth that he feels compelled to act upon, changing everything about his life as an act of faith. He gets his family to leave the house for the morning, and he burns the house to the ground (which had to be done twice during production because Nykvist's camera jammed the first time through necessitating producers funding the hasty construction of the house again). This fits perfectly with Stalker's unbroken faith in the Room and Andrei's walk with the candle. It may be nothing, but faith drives him to act.Tarkovsky died less than a year after completing The Sacrifice, and I think the bookending images of the film, along with a story that Alexander tells the mute Little Man in the beginning, help provide some small solace in the passing of one of cinema's giants far too early. Alexander and Little Man plant a dead tree by the side of the road near their house with a tale about how a monk planted a similarly dead tree atop a mountain and spend several years climbing to that spot to water it, eventually resulting in the tree springing fruit. The film ends with Little Man, largely absent from the film and missing much of the excitement, quietly watering that tree by the road by himself. The tree has sprouted no fruit, but the implication is that he will continue to water it for years himself. This feels like the perfect visual metaphor for Andrei Tarkovsky's struggles with faith in the harsh environment of the Soviet Union, a place he wanted to go back to because it was his home but never could. It's hard to think of a better image for Tarkovsky to have gone out on.The Sacrifice is something special. Many final films of great directors feel like the spent leavings of a great mind, but Tarkovsky went out swinging for the fences. His quiet ode to his cinematic hero, Ingmar Bergman, has a surprising life and vitality all its own that makes it truly shine in an already bright cinematic oeuvre. It's a beautiful movie that takes its time to fruit, but fruits beautifully nonetheless.",

            "content": "I first saw this \"OFFRET\" at the time it came out for theaters. Back then, on my twenty-something, I was perhaps like most of the other young men regarding culture and entertainment. I did mostly enjoy Pop music, pop culture, some other light appeals for my free time. I had perhaps only one aspect making a difference: I liked movies beyond this popular approach. I could go and watch Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the mute movie pictures, the classics of John Ford or Anthony Mann, Hitchcock, and enjoy it all. It was perhaps this need of the diverse that guided me to go and see \"OFFRET\", the first TARKOVSKI movie I really saw. The story is there, strongly autobiographical, quite upsetting, but too human, too close to all humans experiences of some moments of desperation, also of hope and belief. It is perhaps the most human movie I ever saw. It is not spectacular, it is slow, repetitive and cruel on its silences. But it is a very moving piece of art. Seen at a proper time it can make damages on a sensitive soul, but, for I would say 30% of those who see it can be felt like a big prize, from its humanity. And then it comes BACH, and the small tune that starts and closes the movie picture. It is \"ERBARME DICH\", the 7 minutes aria from \"MATTH\u00c4US PASSION\", for me the one choral piece of art of all history. That was really the one revelation that attached me to this \"OFFRET\" to all my live. Before \"OFFRET\" my knowledge of classical music was too small. After \"OFFRET\" I discovered how intense and bright can be BACH, and from BACH so many others big classical and romantic composers. I invite you all to try this experience of discovering at one time a very human and sensitive movie picture and the passion of BACH. For at least some of you it may be also a singular experience to remember, as it was for me.",

            "content": "It's set in 1985 in Sweden and is a psychological drama on meaning and death in the spirit of Ingmar Bergman.Alexander (Erland Josephson) is a troubled intellectual, formerly an actor, who finds little meaning in life. In response to his postman friend, Otto (Allan Edwall), he confesses little connection with God. However, he does love his young son, Little Man (Tommy Kjellqvist). Alexander's wife, Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), laments marrying one man when she loves another, perhaps Victor (Sven Wollter), the doctor who operated on Little Man and is present for Alexander's birthday celebration. There is also a daughter, Marta (Filippa Franz\u00e9n) and two maids, Julia (Val\u00e9rie Mairesse) and Maria (Gu\u00f0r\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir).As the birthday meal is almost ready, color leaves the film as the rumbling of jets flying low overhead, apocalyptic news on the radio, followed by the failure of electricity and telephone, create dead forboding and hysteria. The film follows Alexander's reconsideration of faith and his efforts to sacrifice himself to save his family. This seemingly includes a descent into madness.This is not an easy film to watch. There is not much action, and there is a lot of talking. It's undoubtedly a Bergman-type movie probing the human psyche amid despair. Tarkovsky was facing his own death when the film was made, which may have impacted his approach. One does not watch \"The Sacrifice\" for entertainment but to be pushed to reflect inward.",

            "content": "I've seen a few Tarkovsky films but it has been a while. Stark desolate shots lead to introspection, and accent isolation while doing so. The main character here, a proxy for Tarkovsky one might guess, often is sneaking away from his family. Is he seeking atonement, and thus needs to be at one with himself?Perhaps, although a visit to the witch/goddess/Virgin Mother/servant is an important scene, still after that he rises alone in a transported state.There's a video where Tarkovsky talks about a cleaning woman at the end of a length discussion of an earlier film of his, \"The Mirror\" brusquely says something to the effect of what's the big deal, the meaning of the film is obvious. A man has done bad things, and is dying and feels guilty about those things. That's the rough translation, and I see the story repeated frequently online by others. Watching the interview, Tarkovsky to me seemed more intent on dismissing the notion of pulling apart a film to find the little treat or secret message inside.I submit *both* notions might apply here.If poetry/painting/song spend time chasing dreams, film has a leg and two eyes up on all of them. This film features the other art forms and indeed is dreamy, but like many dreams trying to examine them with pen and digital paper the next morning, they go from gossamer to gone pretty quickly..Like a painter, Tarkovsky surely loves his light (and dark for contrast). He has a musician's ear, and the soundtrack includes classical, jazz, Japanese koto I think, and some eerie chorale chants that feel like the might have drifted in from a horror film.I wonder how much of his films are pulled from images in his own life or even his dreams. Is there a Tarkovsky bingo? If so this film has levitation, rain inside a house, alternatively a house engulfed in flames, a large map - damn, I think I'm one shy.The color of this film shifts, as others have noted. It felt like plain life in the natural world before and after, and in the middle odd contemplation captured more in dim shades, or black and white.He does love landscapes especially in magic hour with tragic shadows. But two other uses of light stood out of me, one was the flickering cast by the television on the actors and furniture in a slow pain. That alternating dark/light flashing like an alarm, or how we live our lives under the specter of nuclear annihilation.The other color moment that stood out came from art-within-the-art. Alexander our Tarkovsky Prospekt, is given a book of religious art for his birthday. The camera slowly pages through the book, images basking in red/gold warmth. This section really stood out to me, more than the repeated zoom-ins on the Leonardo reproduction with reflections.Speaking of religion. Well it's very personal in general so I tread lightly here, and Tarkovsky treads even more lightly, nearly mystically or with non-existent footprints. Years of living in the Soviet Union may have generated many holy atheists? I don't know, personally I'm a charismatic agnostic.That said, I had to work hard to exorcise preconceived Old Testament notions of Abraham/Isaac from the onset of the film. And really through-out the movie whenever Little Man aka boychik was shown, or even not shown but discussed, I felt he was in danger.Maybe all young men are when war gets hungry?And yet this film might really be about the father sacrificing himself (and his standing and homestead) for his child? Hard to say, it is a film easier to feel than dissect.Speaking of which, the cleaning lady is here, and I am in her way.So, some simple potential pragmatic tips...Start this when you have enough time for a relaxed viewing (I blew it and started Sat night at midnight and ended up splitting over two nights).Find a dark quiet room, if not an actual theater, to help with the immersion in the film. A theater with a good sound system likely a bonus, although I watched with headphones and that enhanced some of the music and foley-work. Tick. Tock. Tick.Lastly you don't have to be old to enjoy this film (relax, unBoomer) but it might help. Okay, old souls count too.A side note : I do wish Tarkovsky had lived long enough for Hollywood to demand a sequel based on the fascinating Mailman Otto. Really he was the character I could connect with the most. One might say he delivered.... Alexander from evil and annihilation and unto Mary, the mother of peace.",

            "content": "I had high hopes for this but it really let me down. The Sacrifice is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense that tries too hard to be deep and philosophical.The Sacrifice is about... well, it's not really about anything, which leads to my main problem with this film. There is no plot at all. The whole movie consists of characters doing monologues, that's it, there's no purpose or meaning to it. They just go around telling monologues. And don't tell me \"yOu JuSt DiDn'T uNdErStAnD iT\", thats quite wrong since there is nothing to understand here. It's just characters going around and doing monologues. Nothing special happens until like 1 hour and 40 minutes in when he sleeps with the witch. 1 HOUR AND 40 MINUTES IN! The total runtime is like 2 hours and 20 minutes minutes which means nothing happens until there's only 40 minutes left, that is a problem as the paper flat characters wasn't interesting at all. Which leads me to my next issue with this nonsense of a film.The characters are incredibly flat and forgettable, if you don't have interesting characters that will hurt the movie. Of course the characters can be bland if the plot, writing and other things in the film is good. 2001: A Space Odyssey for example is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time, yet it has bland characters. That's because it does other things well. The Sacrifice however don't have a good plot, because there is no plot, which means the characters can't support this film. Every character is forgettable. They don't have any real personalities, they don't do anything, they don't change, they're just there, and all they do is telling monologues. They all try to be super deep and philosophical but since the dialogue is so forgettable and clich\u00e9 it doesn't work. It's your usual \"society sucks\" and \"everything is awful\" monologues. Nothing special here. The characters also deliver them in a clich\u00e9 way thus making both them and the monologues so forgettable. The main character Alexander is not interesting at all and when your protagonist is forgettable and bland it's a huge issue. That's the character you will follow throughout the story and if that character is bland the film will feel less interesting to watch. He is however the character I remember the most as he is such a weird character. Weird and forgettable. He and the rest of the characters are just so unrealistic. Who even goes around telling monologues? Like who does that? The witch is also extremely bland. I only remember her a little more than the others because she is a witch. She doesn't do anything special, she's just there and she's a witch, that's it. The rest of the characters are even more forgettable. There's the mailman who doesn't do anything, he doesn't even really have a personality. There's the mother, she's just there, the daughter is also just there, and so is the rest of them. They don't have any personalities either. The son is a little more memorable than the others tho. Mainly because he can't talk throughout the film but then does in the end. There's really no meaning to it. I only remember him a little more because of that.The acting is ok, but nothing special, the writing is bad, the cinematography is bland. One good thing about this piece of nonsense of a film is the first scene. It's a long take of the main character and his son planting a tree and then walking home and talking to the mailman. The scene is good because the dialogue is actually okay in that scene and because it's a continuous shot. The story the main guy tells is just a little interesting, although I don't even remember most of it. That scene is good but that's about it.The Sacrifice as a whole is a bunch of nonsense that tries way to hard to be super deep and philosophical, with no plot, forgettable characters, forgettable dialogue and bland cinematography it's a bad film, and a forgettable one that should not be considered a masterpiece at all.My final rating for this nonsense is 3.7/10",

He sees it as his duty to stimulate reflection on what is essentially human and eternal in each individual soul. Which \"In the end everything can be reduced to the one simple element which is all a person can count upon in his existence: The Capacity to Love.\"And with the movie \"The Sacrifice\" Tarkovsky is, in my opinion, spreading the message; while words is a powerful tool and can be much efficient to an extent, it is vital that we take action and fulfill these dreams and promises one has made to loved ones and oneself, rather than just speak of it; \"Words! Words! Words! At last I know what Hamlet meant.\"Its the impression, I got at least, watching Andrei Tarkovsky's 1986 \"The Sacrifice\". He mediates this with a poetic undertone played out in a gloomy desolate environment set in the dawn of World War III.

In some cases about the war but then they just talk about random things is strange ways and a specially weird one is a supernatural thing about a photo of a woman and his long-ago dead son, that is there only to justify later dialogue later that, otherwise, will be really unbeliavable.After the war started, the protagonist prays and says he would sacrifice anything in order to the world peace to be restored, after that the mailman says he has to sleep with Maria, his former worker, to do so, because she is a witch... that doesn't even sound symbolic in any way, is just wierdness and randomness to cover the lack of substance in the movie, but another bad aspect of the scene is that the mailman spents 6 minutes and 18 seconds to tell him that, was it so hard to just say: \"she's a witch\"? Of course not, but he movie would be 6:15 minutes shorter, and Tarkovsky surely loved filling.Then the protagonist sets his house on fire, ok, but how the hell is that going to solve anything? Symbolically, he leaves behind everything, I get it, but what is he supouse to acomplish with this? The war clearly can't represent something internal, it affects the people arond him, so the explanation? Probably Andrei just wanted to make an awesome shot, congragulations! You did it!, you were a very talented director, but a mediocre or, at least, a lazy writter, this is more clear when you remember two of his best movies (Solaris and Stalker) are adapted from books and their worsts (Zerkalo, Nostalghia and Offret) aren't, I bealive that's the reason why they are so empty, Tarkovsky was just a director and a poet, not a fiction writter.My opinion only watch it if you want to complete a list of Tarkovky films, great flims according Vatican or Cannes/BAFTA/something awarded, this film it's a waste of time.However, despite all of that, I admire the effort Andrei Tarkovsky put in his movies, he clarely loves them, and that's something, may he Rest In Peace.",

So Deep, I don't think we really have people like that in English-speaking culture; we have plenty of clever people, but not Deep; our cleverness is ingenuity, not wisdom. Or if we do have such people, they can't express themselves for want of appropriate instruments.But of course, it is the mark of genuine genius that it is able to fashion an instrument suitable to express itself. And that's what Tarkovsky did with his films. It's no wonder people struggle to describe them; he struggled, himself, to explain what he was trying to do; and I think the reason is that it's really beyond words. And yet at the same time it *is* helpful to hear what he had to say about how he saw his art; in fact I think you would struggle to understand his work fully without that.And unlike some who have imitated his visual style - like Poliakoff say - it's Deepness for a reason, so that you never feel it is just beautiful imagery for the sake of it; nor does he descend into desperate cynicism like a Lars von Trier. His films - even such a sombre one as this - are filled with meaning and hope. In the hands of such a person cinema is, as he himself believed, the supreme art.That's not to say this is a perfect film - it isn't. It was made of two different stories spliced together, and the joins still show. But it would be petty to cavil about that. The details of the story aren't that important - not to Tarkovsky, and not to us. It's the overall effect that is totally absorbing, almost overwhelming. It's a film that, even if they might not want to watch it every week, everybody with pretensions to humanity should see at least once.",

There is a lot of serious talk, and some reflection, and then a military jet roars overhead, and everything changes. A politician appears on television, and informs people that a nuclear war may be immanent. The power goes out.The film grows increasingly mystical after this, and the final scene is among the most bizarre and powerful moments in film history. I had to look this up online to figure out what was going on, but once i did, it all made sense.

Many no doubt will find this to be as pretentious a European art film as ever was made.

Despite having only made seven films (he made a few more short films and a documentary for television, but he made only seven feature films for cinema) they are all true masterpieces, making it difficult to choose the best of them all.This Sacrifice is the last film by the Russian director, made in the final stages of his life, sentenced to death for the same lung cancer that had killed his wife a few years before. There is, in fact, a strong probability that the lung cancer that would kill Tarkovsky, his wife Larissa Tarkovskaya and actor Anatoly Solonitsyn had its origin in poisoning at the chemical factory where Stalker (1979) was filmed.The quest for faith is a recurring theme in Tarkovsky's work, at least since Andrei Rublev (1966) and gained quasi-religious tones in the two films after Larissa's death, Nostalgia (1983) and This Sacrifice (1986).Tarkovsky's cinema is always very complex and open to multiple levels of reading, but Sacrifice, as its title indicates, is a final work by someone who knows he will die soon and wants to leave a message of faith. Not exactly a religious, institutionalized faith, but rather a sincere, individual, ethical, artistic faith, something that came from the previous film Nostalgia and which also had in common the fact that it has the Swedish Erland Josephson as the actor who embodies this mystical revelation. .\nThe Sacrifice is a beautiful, profound and provocative film, as it challenges even non-believers to reflect on faith and the human condition.

And this is what has really intrigued me.The Sacrifice is now 34 years old. And reviews from that time describe it as a film about the power of religious faith. It's even approved by the Vatican of all things! But that wasn't what I saw when I watched it.Instead of faith, I saw a nervous breakdown. A middle aged man, with doubts about his professional achievements, doubts about his wife, and an absolute love for his young son, is tipped over the edge by the fear of war. He does everything he can, including pleading with God, and sleeping with a witch, to try to save what matters to him. He wakes in the morning, and all is quiet, so ninja-like, he burns down his house and is taken away by the men in white.I was a boy in 1986. But I recall that the fear of a nuclear holocaust back then was real, and religion was of much greater importance in public life. As time has passed, our fear of war has changed - wars aren't final, they go on and on. And religion is now on the fringes of British society (couldn't speak for Sweden/Russia).So burning your house down as part of a deal with God seems like the actions of a madman, rather than the natural consequence of salvation.But it's a beautiful film about a man losing his mind.

            "content": "My 3rd Tarkovsky movie. Isn't the maestro's best, But is still a Masterpiece. As always, his long shots create their own cinematic language. Use of reflections in mirrors is remarkable. It's a Swedish movie ( Tarkovsky's second and final movie out of Russia) and often reminds one of a Bergman movie. Sven Nykvist( Cinematographer) coincidentally was a regular collaborator with Bergman. Bergman and Tarkovsky always shared mutual respect for each other's work. This movie probably was a bit of a tribute to Bergman from the latter. The ending is hauntingly beautiful. Watch it to witness the end of an era. The end of Tarkovsky, who merged art with movies, like no man ever did.",

Tarkovsky captures beauty in his own style, always with a magnificent cinematography and bold creativity. He is truly a master and his movies a lesson to his followers. Offret is no different, everything is there like it's predecessors. I was delighted once again.Knowing of his own upcoming death, Tarkovsky turns to religion as never before. I am an extreme atheist, i can't tolerate religions. So this was a great disappointment for me. I didn't ever expect Tarkovsky to suddenly become a poor old man at the verge of his end. I found his early works to be spiritually richer than this movie. There is always some magic around his movies. Offret ruins all that magic, forces you into an expressionist Christian world and then it ends. Surely some will say i didn't get the movie, others that i have to see it again maybe when i'm older. But no. If you're a friend of Nietzsche than keep your distance from Offret's meanings and enjoy the ride on this beautifully directed movie.Still i can't give it any less than an 8.",

            "content": "I make this review in two parts. First the review about how well the movie was made and the acting second about the quality of the story.\nI mostly watch non English language movies mostly Asian and European. I find Hollywood movies unwatchable . I watched Solaris and Persona (not the same director) a while back and thought both were very good movies specially Solaris which was very gripping.\nThis movie however was long and slow. The acting was wooden specially the secondary characters. By the ends of the movie little is known about the personalities and sympathies of the characters. Maria for example we only assume she is a witch because a character says so. Her entire screen time prior to this declaration is 20 seconds. This movie is a story told by mainly 2 characters from a far. You don't even see their facial expressions. I found this to be like, I am reading a book by a novice writer!\nNow about the story; I had read that the story is about sacrifice. After watching the story I can see why some have said that. I say however, the movie is about the writers misguided idea of what sacrifice is; that is why the story does not satisfy. This world is replete with Sacrifice! The seed is sacrificed to give rise to a plant. The egg is spoiled and sacrificed for the chick. A mother sacrifices her body for the unborn child to develop. Even an electron when moving orbit sacrifices its location to release energy for us to use. In spiritual realm is the same, which I don't want to get into. But in all cases the sacrifice is release of one's energy or substance and being in order to give rise to other states of being. In here however we are dealing with delusions of the writer about what he thinks sacrifice is. The postman says few nonsensical and meaningless things about the maid being a witch - The postman could have called her a vampire and would have been as plausible! So we are told that he should seek her out and lay with her then somehow this is a sacrifice.... The actor also does pray but not in serenity or with devotional detachment but in fear and desperation. Obviously the writer had no idea about spirituality or value of sacrifice. And this shows in the movie despite the directors talent in trying to pass the writers ineptitude as deep and artful to his audience.\nI give the direction and acting 4 and the story 1 a total of 2.",

            "review_title": "Of belief, art and sacrifice",
            "content": "This turned out to be Andrei Tarkovsky's last film. Like it is almost always the case with his work, this too is about faith. Alexander, the protagonist worries about society and its lack of spirituality. The opening scene has him plant a tree with his young son. The last scene has the son, the only one not involved in the chaos everyone is, rest under it.Sacrifice is the closest Tarkovsky and Bergman came to making a film together. Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer, Erland Josephson as Alexander and Allen Edwall as Otto the postman were all longtime collaborators with the great Swedish director and Tarkovsky was apparently in awe of Bergman and his films. Through Nykvist and his magical control of light and the slow, meticulous, long shots set to Bach, Tarkovsky makes a work of extraordinary beauty. The story (or so) is about Alexander saving the world from a fatal war by making a string of personal sacrifices. We don't know how much of this is just his dream. Black and white shots are interspersed with shots of desaturated colour, the timeline is non-linear and it is possible that everything that happens is indeed a long dream. There is perhaps value in analysing the film as a study, but I am loath to do that. My experiences with such films have always been about curiosity. The questions this curiosity asks is mainly the \"how did they do it\" variety than the \"what does he mean\" kind. For instance, there is an early scene with Adelaide, Alexander's difficult wife and Maria, the housemaid who could also be a witch. Maria asks the lady if she can leave for the day. The scene is set in such a way that Adelaide paces left and right, while also getting closer to the camera with each turn. Maria is placed bang in the middle of the frame and her eyes follow Adelaide's pacing. At the end of it all, Adelaide ends up walking behind the line of the camera while Maria is staring at it. This is the sort of thing which elevates a film to a different plane. There is the story, the acting and the music yes, but this is something unequivocally cinema. The camera, the actors and their respective movements. In another scene, Alexander is shot as a reflection of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci (Adoration of the Three Kings). Apparently, Tarkovsky felt this would appear as if he was part of the painting and now he has come out of it. What a thought!",

So far I've seen all of his films apart from Ivan's Childhood and I thought Andrei Rublev and Stalker had a kind of bold and profound magic about them but I couldn't get into The Sacrifice, despite trying hard.Tarkovsky is good at mixing contemplative dialogue with incredibly beautiful photography but here it felt like the script was turgid and maudlin, and there really wan't that much to be entranced by when it came to the visuals either. There were lots of long, dark interior shoots that came across as boring for some reason and it was only after I finished the movie that I realised it was due to a lack of Tarkovsky's usually rich sound palette - raindrops, wind, and so on.Apart from the last scene, which is spectacular, The Sacrifice comes across as quiet, dull, and self-indulgent. I really wanted to like it and have been able to watch all the other Tarkovsky creations without pausing them, but with this one I kept having to take breaks. I just found it to be a slog.Perhaps the subject matter didn't resonate with me. Maybe this was an older man's film, dealing with themes I can't yet relate to. Or there's a chance I am missing or misinterpreting something in the movie's themes or story. At any rate, and with reluctance, I have to give this a middling mark.",

Tarkovsky was certainly influenced by his illness and imminent death, and he felt the need to portray a story where disaster can be averted by simply asking for forgiveness from God while surrendering a part of yourself.I won't mention any plot elements, just watch it for yourself... even though it's lesser Tarkovsky... it's still Tarkovsky.",

That was when the existential dread started to creep in and I found myself consumed by the sheer eerie, almost lifeless meditating atmosphere.Watching a Tarkovsky sure is not easy. Tarkovsky makes films like writing poetry: you cannot understand the depth of a piece of poem but you can still feel it while reading and ruminate on it afterwards. Tarkovsky is probably the most intellectual filmmaker in history alongside Stanley Kubrick. FIlms about the inner space and outer space of humanity.

            "content": "First of all - this is my first comment on IMDb. What made me write it - an explosive realization that came to my mind when re-watching \"The Sacrifice\" for the 3 time. \"The Sacrifice\" is not a movie. It is a testament, a confession, a premonition, a warning, and as such - an action. The dying genius, as this is the last Tarkovsky's film, gets out of the screen and penetrates our minds to influence the actions we - his spectators - will take. \"Here the actor is, himself, his own creation, his own work of art.\" we hear before Alexander parts to Maria's house. The authentic meaning of this, which in the English translation can be attributed to reflections about the art, all of a sudden flashes out in the Russian version - from this point on the author makes his own final decision not to remain a mere artist, but to act, to become a creator of the future.So what is Tarkovsky's intention, what does he see that compels him to take upon that responsibility? Through a sequence of beautifully shot scenes he rubs the painful truth into our faces - the course the humanity has taken so far leads us to an imminent destruction, a theme that according to his own diaries was haunting him during the last years of his life.And though there might be hope as Tarkovsky presents it, it is up to us to find the genuine answer. The ending stands in many ways open and ambiguous - Tarkovsky dedicated \"The Sacrifice\" to his own son he had left upon emigration in the USSR - his home country to the downfall of which he very much contributed.

Filmed profoundly, and exquisitely; it is so pleasing to the eye; a director, at the height of his powers; pure patience, in the frames. There are many frames within frames here; *spoiler*; perhaps this represents the characters isolation? Existentialist Terror/Harmony awaits here. Wise. Profound.Truly, what is greater, than a film of this nature? A director, who creates philosophical examination, unlike any other; meditations, and streams of pure philosophical consciousness; true joy; refreshing; endearing. It is a joy for anyone, who is stimulated by deep, heavy, philosophical life thought. It muses on death, and existentialism. It muses on materialism, but not in particularly buying materialism, but materialism in how we treat the earth; the nature materialism, earth's materialism. It muses on machinery; verses nature; man verses nature. How we may decant ourselves to a high plain, but alas, return to earth, and destroy. How we destroy ourselves, destroy the earth. Disillusionment with life, all. It is truly chilling, and devastating. It is a philosophical piece of lecture; it can be examined many times over. How faith, in a case, can be pursed from self-destruction; loss of self; hopelessness; this is when faith is pursued; when our fears are eternalized, and hope is lost; spiritual belief is lost, that someone may seek out their faith; our primal fears. Tarkovsky is one of the directors closest to capturing philosophy on the screen. The switching between black & white, and color, immortalizes the scenes, and drives them into your subconscious; exquisite. It considers how truth, and knowledge, can lead to existential suffering; though which can lead to profound wisdom; do we find comfort in terror? It is a reflection of ourselves.Some sayings remind me of 'As A Man Thinketh'; a profound, beautiful, and special book. I imagine the actors became wise, from merely speaking their thoughts of the character; profound questions are asked, and it gives you questions, like good philosophy does. It is extraordinary and unique; the levitation scenes, and the one's that follow it...there is nothing like it in cinema; like a steam of memories; of terrifying but profound scenes...truly ethereal. The fire scene is.....something that is not of this world. There are filmmakers/directors, and then there is Tarkovsky; he is a pillar; a person, who, him himself, and his films, seem so unreal as to exist. This film......really makes you believe there is magic in the world; like seeing a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting for the first time. Something, which is like a portal, to another world; something that elevates you to a higher, magical, ethereal realm, and fills you with pure joy as to something like this could possibly exist.",
