            "content": "A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for Spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by Alice Walker. One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, SCHINDLER'S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as the tortured Celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive Danny Glover, who she only knows as \"Mister\". The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with \"Mister\". The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel. This is not \"The Burning Bed\" in Georgia by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. Goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.RATING: 10 of 10",

            "review_title": "A true affair of the heart",
            "content": "Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, \"Schindler's List\".Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. \"The Color Purple\" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support, though his \"Moses\" was a superior turn for him in \"Places in the Heart\". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video",

            "content": "The film version of Alice Walker's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel (written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so.In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force of change for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as preacher Samuel.Beautifully paced and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama.",

            "content": "In 2005,this will be the 20th Anniversary re-released of one of the most unforgettable motion pictures ever devised for the screen. However,this movie is worth seeing since it comes from one of the most distinguished directors in Hollywood......The man who brought us the greatest films ever made...\"Jaws\",\"Close Encounters\",\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\",\"E.T.\", \"Jurassic Park\",\"Schindler's List\",\"Hook\",\"Poltergeist\",\"A.I.-Artficial Intelligence\",\"Minority Report\",and so many more.But this movie,\"The Color Purple\" was one of the most powerful and meaningful films ever made and to this day it stands out as a classic example of great cimema at its finest. Based on the novel by Alice Walker(who wrote the screenplay with collaborator Menno Meyjes),and directed by Steven Spielburg.I saw this film at a premiere they had in 1985,and to this day it moves me in such a way that I had never felt,and it is moved me to tears every time I see this masterpiece,20 years later. This film showcased a lot of brilliant talent,since it had an all-African American cast which starred Danny Glover,Whoopi Goldberg,Margaret Avery,Oprah Winfrey,Adolph Caesar, Laurence Fishburne,Rae Dawn Chong,Akosua Busia,Desreta Jackson, Willard Pugh,Leonard Jackson,Carl Anderson,and a lot more.The film is worth seeing! Highly recommended! Grand performances all around! Anything that has to be directed by Steven Spielburg is worth seeing. Great drama at its best! It also goes to show how unfairly African-Americans were really treated back then,not just by their white counterparts,but by their own race as a whole,and this movie shows that how really cruel that is.  It was one of the top ten grossing boxoffice movies of 1985,and was nominated for an impressive 12 Academy Awards including Best Picture,Best Director,and Best Actress(which Whoopi Goldberg should have won!)not to mention musical score from composer Quincy Jones.

The film deals with the maturity and independence of a mistreated black woman (Whoopi Goldberg in an Oscar-nominated role) from the years 1909 to 1947.  The audience gets to experience all of her triumphs and tragedies through the film's running time.  A very strong cast of supporting players make the film memorable as well.  Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Rae Dawn Chong, Margaret Avery, and Oprah Winfrey (the last two Oscar-nominated) all shine with the great screenplay and Spielberg's subtle direction.

            "content": "Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisaical purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjective understated can be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.",

This statement is neither hyperbolic nor exaggerated, one of many reasons I suggest you see this film.The film opens in 1909 when Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her feature film debut) as a young girl, as well as a victim of incest, impregnated by her father. Unattractive and unloved, separated from her beloved sister and children, Celie has no other option than to be wedded to an abusive, impoverished, and philandering husband named Albert (Danny Glover), a man who treats her no better than a slave. However, Celie's life forever changes when Albert returns home in accompaniment with his mistress Shug (Margaret Avery), a beautiful Blues singer.In spite of the seemingly hopeless situation the film's plot provides Celie with, the Color Purple is not a tale of her despair, but rather her triumph, one which is immensely inspiring. Stellar in every aspect this film is, including Stephen Spielberg's highly credible direction, the acting, especially of the four most prominent stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey (both quite impressive in their debuts), Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery, the plot, etc. As one of my most revered novels and films, I definitely recommend the Color Purple.

            "review_title": "Powerful Colour Purple",
            "content": "Alice Walker's book is truly riveting, being hard-hitting, powerful and incredibly poignant. Anybody who hasn't yet read it, it is very highly recommended.In 1985, a film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg was released garnering several well-deserved Oscar nominations but sadly winning none. While the book is more detailed and has more depth, and the film is not quite as hard-hitting (though hardly sugar-coated and definitely not Disneyfied), this is in no way denouncing a wonderful early effort from Spielberg.Not quite one of his best films (not among his worst either), but, despite the worry as to whether his style would mesh with the tone of the story told, 'The Color Purple' is a strong sign of Spielberg taking on a very mature subject early on in his career (being before 'Schindler's List') and making a film, that regardless of how it compares to the source material, that's still powerful and moving. For me its only fault is that for my tastes everything felt too neatly wrapped up at the end.Spielberg directs impeccably however, under him the powerful drama never gets heavy-handed despite that it easily could have done and it is also genuinely poignant without falling into over-sentimentality that Spielberg has often been criticised for. 'The Color Purple' looks wonderful, being exquisitely shot and with evocative production design.Quincy Jones' score works remarkably well too, one that sears and soars with ease without being jarring or intrusive. The script provokes a lot of thought and has a lot of honesty and emotion. The hard-hitting story is as hoped told powerfully and movingly, not trivialising the horrors of its themes and the consequences of what happens to the characters.Whoopi Goldberg was rarely better than she is in 'The Color Purple', a wonderful performance with her face and eyes telling so much and one can really see how much damage what she went through has done. Danny Glover is sublimely nasty in one of his best performances worthy of an award nomination but overlooked. Pre-TV career Oprah Winfrey is in a different role, and does remarkably well, while Margaret Avery is affecting.Overall, a powerful and moving film, a worthy adaptation of an even better book. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This is a truly wonderful film from the guru of directing, Mr Steven Spielberg. This great director has suffered much criticism throughout his career. He was slammed by a lot of the press for 'never really growing up' and it took SCHINDLER'S LIST to quiten these critics. However almost ten years before his remarkable account of the Holocaust Spielberg directed this gem.It is the moving tale of a young black girl born into a male-dominated world, and tells the story of her gradual loss of identity followed by her defiance in reclaiming the life she lost. This was Whoopi Goldberg's remarkable screen debut that assured her of major stardom, and it is not hard to see why. Her fear towards her husband is frighteningly real, as is her silent rebellious side that ventures outwards in the last section of the film. Danny Glover paints a horrific image of a cruel husband, and still manages to give us a valid reason why he acts the way he does, before a moving conclusion to his character's development. The part of Sofia is also expertly played by Oprah Winfrey, especially during the Christmas reunion scene when the viewer can't help but share her pain through to joy. A special treat is an appearance by Laurence Fishburne (then Larry) in a small role.It is cinema such as this that proves Steven Spielberg's genius. You will often forget that it is him you are watching (not least by the lack of another genius, Mr John Williams), but it only adds to this director's credit that he is so versatile. If anyone passed over this film as a possible blip in Spielberg's career (as I shamefully did!) watch it now! You will not be disappointed.",

Spielberg guides the viewer through the crowded script quickly and with ease, and the introductions to the characters are jazzy and direct; but, whereas the director is terrifically at home with his cast, he doesn't seem to know how to stage this story. It's mounted like \"Gone With the Wind\", with a sweeping grandeur that treats the material with cartoonish reverence. Results are both moving and sticky, with finely-wrought sequences quickly followed by banal whimsy and heartache. Whoopi Goldberg is terrific in the lead, and some of the dialogue has a haunting, evocative feel, but we're never aware of this as anything but a movie, staged and mechanically set-up to wring tears. **1/2 from ****",

This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies.

            "review_title": "A White Supremacist's Wet Dream",
            "content": "\"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that.\" - Lucius Shepard Set in the Deep South during the early 1900s, \"The Color Purple\" opens with Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters. They're playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif \u2013 innocence interrupted by men \u2013 permeates the entire film.Director Steven Spielberg then launches into a series of short sequences. Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry local widow Albert Johnson, a violent oaf who repeatedly rapes her, forces her to cook, clean and look after his children.All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that \"The Color Purple\" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time.The film is often said to deal which \"racism\", \"sexism\" and \"black culture\", but this isn't true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel upon which \"Purple\" is based, is an in-the-closet lesbian who attempted to write a quasi-feminist tale of female liberation, self-discovery and which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. For Walker, women must bond together in a kind of matriarchal utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.Spielberg's film, however, re-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the supposed \"natural\" cruelty of men. A film in which Albert is a bumbling fool who constantly finds himself in ridiculous situations. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs.This is a film in which blacks are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which blacks are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and in which black men are completely inept. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from \"Gone With The Wind\", MGM Muscals, \"Song of the South\", Warner Cartoons, \"Halleluha!\" and banned Disney movies. In other words, it's the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV. It's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion, the film ends with family bonds being healed. Walker's novel, meanwhile, was resolutely anti Christian. Walker's women think \"God is a white man for white folk and hates women\", and even used the Bible to mocking prove that \"Jesus was black\" and that white churches are a \"conspiracy of control\". Believing that traditional notions of Christianity operate to suppress women and blacks, they then turn atheist, ditch their minister fathers, and then, upon renouncing patriarchy, begin to trace a movement away from Christianity and traditional, Western family units and toward an African, tribal form of spiritualism and/or community (paganism, lesbianism etc are just some of the means by which Walker's characters symbolically reject all white conventions). Spielberg reverses all this. His women reconcile with their fathers, the film focuses on Christians and Christian churches, and all hints of a spiritual alternative outside of patriarchy are erased. Because Spielberg is uninterested in the wider black community, and in any socio-historical context, the film eventually turns into both a hate letter to black men, and a bizarre caricature of black life. Elsewhere Spielberg's camera busily fights for attention (Celie's kitchen contraptions belong in a cartoon or \"Home Alone\" movie), every emotion is over played, sequences are loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, racist caricatures, emphatic musical cues and inappropriate musical numbers. Couple this with Quincy Jones' ridiculously \"white\" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: a feminist tract filmed by a daddy-loving white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith and scored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.Problematic too is the lack of white characters. Note: the film's men aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which emasculates. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of socio-economic factors.And so there's a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that persecution is implicitly their fault; be good in your own minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.3/10 \u2013 Despicable.",

All of the performances were excellent and I think none were better than Danny Glover as Mister aka Albert. He was so good at being such a horrible human being.Some of the broader themes from the book were a bit muted in the movie. It was still about Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) and her plight and that couldn't be missed. What was toned down was the lesbianism on the part of Celie as well as the misandry. The book is filled with both overt and subtle misandry to the point that you get the clear impression that the author herself hates men. There's hardly a man in the book that is free of being some type of oppressor of women.The movie never conveyed that as much as it conveyed Celie's horrible experiences with her father and her husband. Kudos for whoever adapted it for the big screen because it became a better production.",

(She was nominated but did not win.) Now, with all due respect to Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover... this film just did not appeal to me. Not that anyone was bad, but I just never really got into it. I suspect this has something to do with Spielberg, and his need to be overly sentimental.

Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey(oh lord!), Danny Glover, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that \"sinners\", indeed, \"have souls too\". The always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(I'd say sir)Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film! The photography, the music, the director and the music makes this beautiful, soulful movie into an experience of life. You don't want to miss it! \"Sista'...remember my name...\"",

            "content": "Even though this made some changes from Alice Walker's novel that made some audience members and critics furious, this is still one of the best films to come out of the 1980's. As the revival of the hit Broadway musical version trods the boards of New York once again, a return visit to it is necessary as is the need for me to see this beautiful film once again.The cruelty of most of the male characters keeps the tragic prone Celie away from her beloved sister Nettie and her two illegitimate children, fathered through rape and cruelly taken away from her at birth. Celie, allegedly ugly, and Nettie, a sweet but strong beauty, are separated twice-first by their abusive father, and later by Mister, the demanding husband Celie is forced to marry simply to be his slave. Watching the shy, insecure Whoopie Goldberg suffer the way she does is often heartbreaking, and hers was one of the strongest film debuts in Hollywood history.In spite of her circumstances, Goldberg's Celie adds a sly smile to her persona, devoted (or at least fearful) to husband Danny Glover in spite of his cruelty. She may hate him, but she gets to know him inside out, even aiding him as he prepares to meet his sexy mistress, Margaret Avery. Whoopie gets a boisterous step daughter in law in portly Oprah Winfrey (another film debut) who along with Avery becomes Goldberg's guardian angel when they see Celie's true inner beauty. In spite of her relationship with Glover, Avery's Shug comes to understand the importance of sisterhood, creating a beautiful bond between these complicated women. Not all of the men are as nasty as Celie and Nettie's papa. Even Glover's Mister has his soft side, and as his cruelties catch up to him which he must atone for, he makes a choice of retribution that certainly saves his soul. Glover may be an s.o.b., but there are layers hidden beneath his brutality. Willard Pugh is the most likable, but he is a bit of a buffoon. His Harpo is no match for Winfrey's sometimes obnoxious Sophia, and often their relationship doesn't seem real. It also makes no sense that Celie, a victim herself, would shyly advise Harpo to beat Sophia. Winfrey comes to life in her confrontation with Goldberg, and her performance is heartbreaking when she is beaten up for saying \"Hell no!\" to flibbertigibbet white matron Dana Ivey who wants Oprah as her maid. Stage veteran Ivey shows several different angles to this do-gooder who may have sweet intentions, but causes more harm than good. Adolph Caesar is appropriately obnoxious as Glover's father (showing the audience some of the reasons that Glover turned out the way he did), while Rae Dawn Chong is bubble headed, but ultimately showing strength, as Squeak who finds out that \"Fine by me\" ain't so fine for her. The colors of the country are enhanced by Quincy Jones' excellent musical score. Two songs are thrown in, but neither were in the musical. Director Steven Spielberg was snubbed for an Oscar nomination in one of the biggest scandals in Academy Award history. There's no denying that professional jealousy was partly behind it. How a film which details triumph over tragedy could be completely overlooked for even one award remains a mystery to this day. The triumphs of the finale will have you in tears. Make sure you have a full box of Kleenex out. Regardless of how many times you've seen this, the tears are absolutely going to flow.",

And I'm not knocking 'Out of Africa' (which won in '85) either; but it was, to my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cryer.Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?",

I don't know if it could possibly be worse for anyone, much less a person of color. The story is heart rending yet inspirational at the same time, as Celie perseveres through her misfortunes to become a person of noble character and inner strength. The race between her mentor Shug Avery (Margaret Avery) and the clock in that scene when Celie was about to shave or cut her husband's throat was one of the heart pounding moments of the film. Knowing what happened to Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) for sassing a white woman and knocking down the woman's husband, it would have been one of those life defining moments had she followed through on her righteous anger.

            "content": "Before I get to far into this review I need to give a few details from the novel, which was titled the same as the film. The novel tells a story from a number of diary entr\u00e9es about a young girl named Celie, who is constantly abused and neglected, who lived in the 1920's and 1930's. Written by Alice Walker in 1982, it has become her most recognized work.The film follows the growing up of a woman that lived in the Southern United States, the girl's name is Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Celie, 14 at the time that the film starts, has already had two children by her father, yes you read it right, and has already been subjected to the cruelty of her father. Celie's father forces Celie to marry a man that she calls \"Mister\", his real name is Albert (Danny Glover). Albert, who had his eyes on Celie's younger more, attractive sister named Nettie (Akosua Busia), treats Celie like a slave (making her clean the disorderly house, take care of the unruly children and so forth). He beats her often, making Celie go mute (for fear of being beaten for talking) and causing her to go into complete submission.Now Celie's sister comes to live with them and wouldn't you know it, Albery tries to rape her. She kicks him away too many times and he kicks her out. A few years later, Celie is a grown woman and has spent a good number of days crying in fear of her abusive husband. Albert is now spending time with his mistress, a jazz singer named Shug \"Sugar\" Avery (Margaret Avery). At first Celie and Shug don't get along, then they start having a friendly relationship that begins to drive Albert crazy.Shug hasn't been living the life of leisure, in her mind that is. Her father, the reverend, has completely removed her from his life because he regards her as a slut. In another part of town, one of Albert's sons is having trouble with his wife Sophie (Oprah Winfrey). Sophie has also lived a hard life were the men try to make her feel inferior. She is strong-spirited and doesn't like to be hit. Harpo (Willard Pugh), the son of Albert, gets advice from Albert and hits Sophie. She leaves him, but her freedom is short lived, she hits the mayor and spends some time in jail. After eight years, she is commissioned to be the Mayor's wife's maid for twelve long years.To make a long review look shorter, Shug helps Celie find the long lost letters from her sister, she had thought her sister dead, and she succeeds in convincing Celie to leave Albert. After a few years Celie is reunited with her sister and her two children that had been raised in Africa.Beautifully portrayed and enhanced, the film shows what happened during the 1920's and 1930's. It gives an example to how women, mostly black women, lived during the time that women's right's weren't yet realized. I gave this a perfect ten our of ten, one of my family's personal favorites.",

            "content": "The Color Purple (1985) ** (out of 4) Alice Walker's novel about a mistreated black woman (Whoopi Goldberg) takes us through her life from the years of 1909 to 1947. Along the way we see the abusive relationship with her husband (Danny Glover) as well as with a woman (Oprah Winfrey) who starts building a little courage in her. THE COLOR PURPLE is hailed by many to be a complete masterpiece but to me I found it way too pretty for its own good. I'm going to place 100% of the blame on director Steven Spielberg because I think he simply made this film way too pretty with way too many melodramatic moments and moments where he just seems to be reaching for the sky. When I say he's reaching for the sky, I'm basically saying that he wants every single scene to be some sort of major, emotional pay-off and it just doesn't work because it makes the material seem over-dramatic and fake. There really wasn't a single moment in this film where I had an emotional connection to because Spielberg wanted every single scene to be something epic. Usually these big moments happen at the end of the film or there might be two or three scattered throughout the running time. With this film trying to have one every minute, whenever something big does happen it's power is just drained from everything else that has been going on. I also think the film runs on way too long as there are so many sequences that could have been cut and they wouldn't have hurt the main story. What keeps the film moving are the terrific performances with Goldberg and Winfrey really standing out with their wonderful work. Glover is also very effective in his bit, although I'd say he was underwritten throughout the picture as just the villain. The cinematography here as well as the costume designs are major pluses but in the end THE COLOR PURPLE is just too safe for its own good.",

It also turns out that Nettie has been living with missionaries in Africa and sending letters to Celie but Mister has been keeping them from her.I feel worn out by the overwhelming oppression that befalls Celie. Steven Spielberg does it with a light touch that keeps it from being dark and sullen. Nevertheless I feel for Celie and suffer along side her. It's a big melodramatic farce period piece. I won't go as far as saying that this is one big stereotype. It does lack a certain realism. It feels like a folk tale. It says something about women empowerment.

            "content": "This is Celie's reponse to the venomous enumeration from Albert, Danny Glover as the man who took almost thirty years off her life.And Celie is Whoopi Goldberg, in her first major role: a virtuoso performance where she bravely dilutes herself in the soul of a woman supposed to be dull and ugly, but only waiting for the right moment to bloom. And the moment came with the ultimate triumph when she finally found the courage to stand against Albert. She doesn't deny all the physical attributions, she's poor, she's black, she may even be ugly, but God, she lives. And after having witnessed two hours of a true hell of a life, we can only share the happiness that suddenly inhabits her heart.The reason I started with this scene is to remind how emotionally effective \"The Color Purple\" is. It might not surprise from a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, both admired and loathed for his capacity to exude great emotions on screen. And there is so much to be criticized, the contrast between the realistic drama and the whole postcard-like setting or some feminist undertones \u0085 but the story transcends all these flaws, elevated by the performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, all women seriously roughed up by life, and overcoming the racist and misogynistic adversity with what was at their hands. Indeed, \"The Color Purple\" provides a thought-provoking approach of the South, where another form of racism was prevailing. In the social ladder, a White had more rights than a Black man, but within the Black community, a man had to respect his father as his son would respect him, but women were powerless. But not equally powerless. Margaret Avery plays Shug, a sexy cabaret singer who could command men with her body. It's ironic that Albert, the bullying husband turns into a puppy with Shug Avery. And if a woman couldn't control people with sex appeal, physical and moral strength worked too. This is Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sofia, the wife of Albert's son, Harpo. She grew up in a family of men, and learned to state her presence the hard way.Both Shug and Sofia embody the fight of Black women, at the expenses of their dignity. Shug's own father, a pastor, disowned her, for she was the local slut, in return, she lost every faith in men and life, but at the end, she finally realized that there was some place in her heart for pure love, by befriending Celie. On the other side, Sofia had the most tragic character's arc, when she refuses to be the maid of the town's mayor through an unforgettable 'hell no', retorted by a severe pistol-punch on the eye, an 8-year sentence in jail, and maybe the worst punishment: finally working in the very job that got her in jail. The energy, the inner strength, the colorful attitude that made her character so irresistible in the beginning, had been totally drained out: she looked prematurely older, and only at the end, in the very scene I described, her dead spirit finally resurrects.Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, both Oscar-nominated, are only supporting characters; yet they add a lot to Celie's own journey. Celie is a Black woman who not only was labeled as ugly, but also didn't even have the privilege of ugly women by remaining single. We meet her when she's fourteen and pregnant. She gives birth to two children and is quickly married to Albert who initially wanted Nettie, her much prettier sister. The father refused to give Nettie's hand for some reasons we guess to be personal, so Albert, who needed a woman to clean the house and take care of the \"young ones\" resigned to take Celie. Yet his eye is still interested on Nettie, and after an attempt to take advantage of her, he forbids her to visit her sister, a punishment worse than any slapping, beating or insult. What remains in Celie is the memory of her sister and the capability to read inherited from her teachings. And unlike Sofia with Harpo, Celie could never have the 'upper hand' on Albert, and unlike Shug, she didn't have the sex appeal. She was as low in the social ladder as any Black woman could be at the time, poor and ugly, yet the movie is about her realization that she deserves better. The most pivotal and emotional scene is when Shug teases her so she stops covering her smile, and then, with a magic that only cinema can apply, she smiles and bursts out laughing to the mirror. The 'mirror' scene is even more significant because it's not just Celie who starts appreciating herself, but also Shug who's inspired by Celie's genuine attraction to her. The following kiss is probably a more sugar-coated version of what the Alice Walker's novel featured, but the essential is that both women found reasons to be proud of them.Another miracle happens in the dinner scene, when Celie lets all his anger finally go on Albert, Sofia starts laughing and recovers from the wounds of the past. Celie has her 'hell, no' moment but with enough intelligence not to pull a knife on Albert's throat, which would have been as disastrous as Sofia's punch on the mayor. There is a lot of learning in \"The Color Purple\" and even Albert finds a way to redeem himself. After all, if there is one thing learned in the film, it's that it's never too late to change for the better, and no flaw, nor physical, sexual or racial can prevent a person to seek her own happiness. We all have an inner strength that could help us to overcome any adversity, \"The Color Purple\" is an invitation to find ours, through the triumph of three women, that we joyfully share with them, at the end of the film.",

She lost the Oscar to Geraldine Page, the perennial Oscar loser, who finally won for \"The Trip to Bountiful.\" In a very close observation, Page was better but Goldberg gave her all in this meaningful picture.Black men certainly were depicted here as slave drivers, mean and rotten to the core regarding the lives of the women they came in contact with. Brutal is basically the word to be described that women such as Cele, Shug (Margaret Avery) and Oprah Winfrey, as Sofia, endured in this film. All received acting nominations and they were all outstanding.This is truly a gritty remembrance of the black experience. Redemption comes at the end of this superlative film.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg is, ironically, the most unfairly underrated man in Hollywood. There are so many directors that are content to make blatantly unoriginal works but Spielberg is the most original and ethical crowd-pleaser in America. And yet he is considered one of the men who ruined cinema. People complain that his Jaws was so successful that it encouraged producers to make hackwork movies that will undoubtedly make millions (bringing Hollywood cinema to where it is today). First of all, George Lucas's Star Wars is more responsible for this. Secondly, who are we to blame Spielberg for the deeds of the producers/filmmakers who were (superficially) influenced by him? What annoys me even more than this is that so few people realize that his films keep getting better as his career goes on (with the exception of Schindler's List, Amistad, the Jurassic Park movies, and Saving Private Ryan). Jaws is probably his least impressive extremely impressive film he has made. The Color Purple, for example, which was made in the 80s, is one of his best films to date. It is so dripping with complexity and detail; it differs from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan in the sense that, when you watch it, you don't think, 'Oh this is a movie about the life of an African American family in the early twentieth century.' 'Themes' and 'topics' fade away and the film just becomes\u0085life. It is about people, not historical figures. Danny Glover plays Albert, a nasty man who marries Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). He is furiously disappointed with the fact that he did not get to marry Netti (Akosua Busia), Celie's sister. As a result, he beats Celie and, as a result of that, Celie becomes painfully quiet and unable to smile without putting her hand in front of her mouth. The relationship between Celie and Albert is hard-hitting, melancholic, and funny. Neither character is treated cartoonishly and both actors play their characters with fairness and delicacy. This is not a work of easy melodrama. It makes you think about subjects such as femininity, the black population's quest for independence at the beginning of the new century, and the eruption of violence in a relationship without ever cheating or faltering a single step.",

I suppose there was a part of me that didn't want to watch a depressing lesbian film, but I was so surprised by just how enjoyable this story was.In the same way he did with 'Empire Of The Sun' (1987), Stephen Spielberg managed to make this quite hard film in to something quite kind. Not for the characters, who suffered in quite awful and unthinkable ways, but for the viewer, as the more grim elements were heard of, but not often seen. As such it made it a lot easier to watch and more easy to connect with, because I didn't feel nauseated by the horrific things that have been on screen in films like '12 Years A Slave' (2013) and 'The Impossible' (2012). Both outstanding films, but journeys that I felt I was going through with the characters, because of the awful trials they faced.This film was a prime example of why sex education and education in general is important for everyone and why women and children still need better protection not only in the wider world, but in their own homes too (And of course some men and older people too).But despite that harsh and sad content, it had a somewhat lighthearted tone to its delivery, with plenty of humour dotted throughout, which was not inappropriate or unfitting.Fuelled by some cracking performances from all, but especially Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, I thought that it was a travesty that this film was overlooked at the Oscars, for these two ladies in particular.It was unusual to see Danny Glover playing such an unpleasant character and I don't think that his characters actions later on atoned for how he had been.I did have to wonder how civilisation as we know it ever came to be, when films like these show sexist, racist and homophobic attitudes that were still so awful less than a hundred years before this film was made, although the world we live in currently still has a long way to go too.It wasn't quite the story I was expecting. I thought it was going to be more about a group of women coming together to fight their oppressors and two of them finding love, so I was weirdly and pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't what I had believed, but much better.It was adorable and thoughtful and I don't think that It would have been out of place if it had been made more recently. I see that it's being remade for 2023, but personally I would just digitally remaster this one and re release it, because there's not enough to improve upon.Although that will be a musical version, which sounds very odd and probably quite depressing in my mind.Also, for the eighties, the ageing effects were very good, without having to go through lots of different actors to play each new generation or being too reliant on wigs. It wasn't until the end when I realised that they had aged, that I realised how cleverly they had slowly introduced a wrinkle here or a grey streak there. I appreciated those little details.Overall I was very happy to see this one, with nothing negative to say about it at all. It is definitely one that I will recommend.859.34/1000.",

            "content": "These days Spielberg's \"The Color Purple\" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.The story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but I didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiffed.As already mentioned, Spielberg didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top-notch. I'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones's score but it's not below average by any means.In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night.",

There are many sad scenes that hit hard, but at the same time other scenes are so stereotypical it's painful to watch. Also, it is supposed to be a depressing film, but there is a lot of humor and it really ruins the mood it was supposed to set up.

            "content": "One of the things the magnificent film THE COLOR PURPLE will go down in history for is that the Academy, while giving the film ELEVEN Oscar nominations in every category from both Lead Actress and Supporting Actress to screenplay to score to cinematography and even Best Picture, but failed to give a nod to director Steven Spielberg despite the fact that this film was his masterpiece up to that time. And the snub was compounded when the film did not win a single award on Oscar night.And all this, while interesting enough, is rather a pity, because while prizes are nice, what matters is the film. And this was indeed Spielberg's finest work up to that time.Menno Meyes's screenplay is a masterful adaptation of Alice Walker's epistolary novel. Perhaps the most striking thing about it is that Meyes kept the epistolary form as a way of driving the plot forward. Most of the letters are read in voice over by Desreta Jackson and later Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, and Akosua Busia as Celie's beloved sister Nettie, the only person in the world who loves her and from whom she is cruelly separated by Albert Johnson, a man she is forced to marry by her father. Celie's father is himself a cruel man who raped Celie repeatedly and fathered two children by her before she was fourteen years old. Her father took the babies away and Celie never saw them againThe sweeping narrative covers Celie's life over the course of some thirty years and encompasses all the people in it. Trapped in an arranged marriage with a man who loves another woman, Celie realizes early on that she has been married off as nothing more than a domestic servant with benefits (for the husband). She seeks solace in religion, having no other outlet for her feelings.Then one day the woman her husband loves shows up at her door: one Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), a singer with a reputation for loose morals (somewhat justified) whose father is pastor of a nearby church and from whom she is estranged. Shug's first words to Celie have gone down in film history: \"You sho' is ugly!\" But that changes soon. When Shug arrives she is not well, and Celie cares for her. A bond soon develops between the two women that eventually becomes a love affair. Spielberg came under some criticism for his handling of the Lesbian affair; it is much more explicit in the book, but while he soft-pedals it in the movie, it's clearly there.Meanwhile Sofia (Oprah Winfrey in a performance that has made me wish she had done more acting), Mister's daughter-in-law, runs afoul of the town mayor and is sentenced to a prison term followed by involuntary servitude as maid to the Mayor's wife, a shrill and unpleasant creature who plays at Lady Bountiful where the \"coloreds\" are concerned but whose own true colors come to the surface all too soon.I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I've loved it since the very first time and it never seems to get old. Spielberg would, of course, top this one with his masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST eight years later (and finally get the Oscar recognition that he had been denied for so many years), but for those eight years this was his unqualified best film, a great adaptation of a great novel that not only did justice to the source material but provided entertainment value as well.

            "content": "Director Steven Spielberg has the very nasty habit of undertaking deep subjects and then trivializing them with a simpering sentimentality more appropriate to a second-rate Walt Disney film than the actual subject at hand. To make matters worse, with THE COLOR PURPLE he also dumbs-down Alice Walker's brilliantly story of a depression-era black lesbian's slow and painful spiritual journey toward self-knowledge, removing as much as he dare from the story lest it offend the middle-class audience at which this film is very clearly aimed.Fortunately, THE COLOR PURPLE is remarkably blessed in its cast. Whoopi Goldberg's performance is a revelation of unexpected artistic depth, touching, funny, tough, and entirely honesty. Ophra Winfrey and Margaret Avrey are equally fine in complex supporting roles, and Hollywood's failure to make successful use of these actresses following their appearance in this film says quite a lot about the down-side of corporate film making. The power of Goldberg, Winfrey, and Avery--as well as every one in the entire cast--is such that the performers largely transcend Spielberg's ham-heavy touch to make the film memorable.The art direction is merely so-so, and I'd be willing to bet that neither Spielberg nor any of his designers actually bothered to visit the rural deep south before designing the show; the resulting look of the film is very hit and miss where authenticity is concerned. On the other hand, the cinematography is exceptionally fine and deserves a great deal of credit for making the film as enjoyable as it is. The script, as noted, is essentially a very weak adaptation of the novel, touching on but inevitably ducking the issues which made the novel so interesting. The Quincy Jones score, however, is stunning and deserves every one of the accolades heaped upon it.Watch this movie for the deeply moving performances, cinematography, and score. Then go out and buy the book. And if you've neither read the book nor seen the film, for heaven's sake DON'T read the book until you've seen the film: seeing the movie won't spoil book, but reading the book will certainly make you even more acutely aware of the film's already obvious failings.Gary F.

For me, this still taints the entire process. It deserved of at least the awards for actress, supporting actress (Margaret Avery, not Oprah) and cinematography.

            "content": "I've read the book, and Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Menno Meyjes turned it into a masterpiece. There's so much they added to the story, so much they cut out, so much they enhanced, that it almost defies description. I know there are those out there who really appreciate the novel, but there's one thing we can all agree on: The Color Purple got shafted at the Academy Awards. The eleven nominations (without Best Director, if you can believe it) should have swept up the ceremony, but instead it remains one of the worst snubs in history.One of the signs of an excellent movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you still get more out of it. I've seen this movie more times than I can count (it was even shown on the big screen for study material at film school), and I always find something new that the filmmakers or actors did to make the finished product perfect. It's so perfect that if Hollywood remakes it for added popularity during the current social climate, I won't even rent it. Certain movies, like The Great Gatsby, should be left alone when there's no room for improvement.Believe it or not, there are youngsters out there who have never seen this movie and don't even know what it's about. When they do watch it, they'll in for quite a shock - no, not because of the extremely heavy storyline that starts its opening scene with the pre-teen protagonist giving birth to a baby incested by her father - the shock young folks will find is with the cast. The funny lady on The View was actually an incredible actress once upon a time? That nice old guy who always whispers played villains thirty years ago? And world-famous Oprah once took a supporting role? It's always fascinating when people have a generational career. The first movie my best friend saw Danny Glover in was The Color Purple, and she was scared of him for years. I didn't see this movie until I was much older, and by that time I only thought of him as the nice guy from Dreamgirls. When we look back and see these performances from the women in the cast, it's such a shame that they weren't continuously offered such meaty roles. Oprah took a different path that led to being a world-famous icon, but if she'd been given more chances to show off her acting chops, she might not have left Hollywood. Whoopi Goldberg's performance was so vivid, painful, and real, her make-up Oscar for Ghost was a terrible insult. She was relegated to comic relief parts when she was capable of so much more. Playing a character who has to stuff her feelings inside and also act them large enough for the camera to see is quite a challenge. Aging onscreen and letting the audience see the toll the years have taken on her is difficult, and balancing all the different feelings she has towards all the different characters is complicated and complex. This was a tour-de-force, and the Academy rewarded her by saying, \"Nope. You should stay in subservient roles playing kooky characters the audience can laugh at.\"Danny Glover also had a difficult character to work with, since he was the villain. A great villain isn't truly evil, but instead becomes human and makes the audience understand him. When we see the relationship he has with his father, Adolph Caesar, we understand his need to bully. When we see his insecurity and desire to please his mistress, Margaret Avery, we understand the inner torment he lives with every day. Margaret has her own intense family problems she holds in her heart, but rather than inflict her pain on someone else, she channels it into healing and support for others.I love the scene transitions in this movie; they flow so seamlessly that even though you're aware you're watching a movie, you can't really imagine the lights, boom mic, and camera capturing everything. But since there was all that equipment and technical work behind what we're seeing, we owe a great compliment to Steven Spielberg. His sensitivity to get such wonderful performances from his actors, the detail of his eye to fill the frame with authentic looking props, sets, and costumes, and keeping the big picture in mind while filming all the little pictures; he had an enormous burden on his shoulders every single day he worked on this film. With a movie so full of intense drama, it would have been easy to turn it into a melodrama with every scene featuring a massive catastrophe. Instead, he kept everything realistic and tame, letting the emotions speak for themselves. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for your beautiful work.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Celie is a woman with a lost identity followed by her defiance in reclaiming the life she lost. Through her character the film depicts the problems of sexism, oppression and systematic abuse. The song of Shug for her or when she dresses like her are a few moments of happiness through a harsh and unfair world. For all these reasons, you root for her when she stands up against Albert.\n~The first act of the movie is the best part of the film despite the rough scenes. We see through a couple scenes a woman who is raped and impergrated by her father, gives birth in a dirty barn, forced to marry an older man that constanly beats her and uses her as his slave by cooking and providing for his children. The separation between the sisters is a heartrending moment and makes their reunification in the end emotionally touching.\n~The rest of the cast is fantastic. Donald Glover as the cruel husband, Albert is awesome and you feel disguise for him because he treats his wife like property. Oprah Winfrey gives a powerful performance as Sofia and you feel her pain when she is treated like garbage and doesn't even have the time to be with her children in Christmas. Margaret Avery as Shug is a woman who is an inspiration to Celie and shows that a sinner can have a soul too.\n~Spielberg challenged himself here after his successful blockbusters and his direction is subtle and beautiful. The transition from the sisters playing in the purple fields to the leather belt hanging in the bed is a nice way to prepare the audience for what is coming. Besides this, the music score by Quincy Jones is wonderful and enhances perfectly the dramatic tension.CONS:\n~The film succumbs to many conveniences and doesn't escape from the typical holywood standards. The happy closure of Shug is poorly executed and her singing sequence in the end is awkward. Furthermore , the remorse of Albert by helping the two sisters to connect again is very unrealistic.\n~Another problem of the film is its continuity. After the shocking first act and the attachment to the two sisters, the movie forgets this storyline until the end. In other worlds, you are immersed into the film because of their strong connection and suddenly the movie puts you into other subplots that don't grab you in the same level.\n~The tone of the movie is incoherent in some parts and the humor doesn't work among the serious subjects. For example, the slapstick humor around the character of Harpo is unfitting and the scene with the white lady surrounding by some black men is a bit silly. Also, it is weird that the abuser is played as a joke character in some scenes.",

The Color Purple is not just moving and compelling story which grips the viewer's attention and keeps it to the end, but it does so while carefully walking the tightrope of appealing to as broad an audience as possible, without overstating the race issue in America. If there is one critical element about The Color Purple is that it understates life circumstances for blacks in America at that time. By no means is this a deal breaker, the film is nothing short of an amazing pierce of cinematic art. The story line, script, cinematography, acting and sound track are all exceptional. No expense was spared on this film as it has emerged as a classic of its time.Film making of this type forms a genre of its own, and entry into this class of movie making is a difficult task. Few writers and producers have the skill set to pull it off, and few movie house productions are willing to take on the politics of truth telling. In this class we are talking about films which take on the issue of oppression. Such films include A Soldier's Story, Schindler's List, American History X, and so on. Older films include To Kill a Mocking Bird and In the Heat of the Night.There is nothing shallow about this film, as some of it provides a glimpse into African American culture (comedy, drama, religion, socializing) which only African Americans are privy to. My rating for this movie is a solid ten. The Color Purple was number 4 in terms of box office receipts in 1985. The movies which had greater ticket sales were Rock IV, Rambo: First Blood and, Back to the Future. What people want to see and will pay for, says a great deal about our culture of pursing fiction and fantasy over fact-based story telling. My opinion is simple, people don't want to be reminded of historical and present day ugliness of the human race.If you're seeking a movie to watch and have not seen the Color Purple, you will be deeply moved by both the story and the acting.",

            "content": "Coming in 1985, this was Steven Spielberg's first attempt at melodrama; he had directed Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial 3 and 4 years previously. This inaugural bid for Spielberg as a dramatic director feels a bit clumsy at times, and at times he struggles to portray harrowing oppression suffered by Celie Johnson, the film's protagonist. This may be the result of the film's PG-13 rating, as the harsh themes of domestic violence and incest are at times brushed over too lightly. Despite these issues, Steven Spielberg's dramatic debut is shot tremendously and full of brilliant performances. Danny Glover, while subdued by the film's hesitation to portray violence, is convincing as the abusive husband of Celie. Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic as Celie Johnson, and was undoubtedly robbed of an Oscar in 1986. Margaret Avery is also great as the inspiration to Celie and performs a few great songs, at least one of which also should have won an Oscar. But the real standout performance is from Oprah Winfrey as the empowering Sofia, giving by far the most moving performance in the film. The original music and musical collaboration in the film is superb, adding a lot of heart to the film. If you are a fan of Steven Spielberg, and want to see his origins in drama, this movie will not disappoint. It is a great film for black and female empowerment, but is not as brutal as films like Schindler's List, making it a great introductory drama to Spielberg's decorated career.",

            "content": "\"The Color Purple\" takes place in the deep Southern parts of the United States between 1909-1939 which stars two sisters Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) and Nettie (Akosua Bosia) who lives with their father (Leonard Jackson) who often performs incest on Celie which led to her having two children from him that would eventually have them shipped off to a family of missionaries.Then we are introduced to Albert (Danny Glover) who destined to marry Nettie, even though they've never been in contact before. Alphonse instead gets him to shack up with Celie instead. Albert operates a farm and has incorrigible children who purposely chastise Celie. When Nettie comes over to visit her sister, the once close-knit siblings part ways as Nettie avoids a possible rape from Albert.Throughout her time, Celie gets into a blossoming relationship with a blues singer named Shug (Margaret Avery) who's relationship with Albert while trying to be on good terms is her father who very much disapproves of her. Although Albert lures his charms among other things onto Celie, she has no children from him. All the while Albert's children are not anywhere seen on screen except for Harpo (William Pugh) who ends up marrying Oprah Winfrey's character Sofia.Other well known supporting roles include Adolph Caesar as Albert's father Old Mister, Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo's girlfriend Squeak, Dana Ivey as the liberal-minded Miss Millie and Laurence Fishburne as blues guitarist Swain.The ratings of this movie on imdb are quite high at 7.6. with the majority of fans liking this movie are the women with an 8.1 in favour while 7.6 were favoured by the men. The age range for the men who liked this movie are in the under 18 year old brackets at 8.0 while the viewers over 45 ranked it at 7.5. The majority of viewers will look at the film as a tale of strong, empowered women who stands up against the men who have done them wrong and to refuse being submissive to their immoral demands. And also to show if you stand up for what is right, good things will prevail.The critics will grumble about how the men in this film were badly depicted in this movie. They came across as being savage rapists who commit incest on their daughters and spend their time drinking whiskey until they've become inebriated. And if they weren't drunken rapists they were seen as simpletons like Harpo. But the women here get the hero's welcome as strong, independent and empowered, but only when they're threatening murder on their spouses and placing hexes on them. The white characters aren't treated any better here even though there are very few of them in this movie with maybe the exception of Dana Ivey's character Miss Millie.The thing that really gets to me about \"The Color Purple\" is that too many resolutions happen suddenly and without further explanations. So now Celie lives in the lap of luxury with the people she loves in an estate her biological father gave to her. If her father was so rich, why didn't she and Nettie stayed with him instead of being stuck with some pervert like Alphonse who in the end wasn't her real father? I'm curious as to how Shug was informed about Celie's death threats to Albert? Why did Albert keep all of Nettie's letters? Why would Miss Millie hire Sofia as her maid after spending nine years incarcerated?It should come as no surprise that in spite of being nominated for 11 Oscars not one performer or crew member walked away with one. It doesn't surprise me with the male-bashing and plot holes that leave many questions unanswered. Instead it panders into the mythology of feel-good elements in very similar veins like \"The Shawshank Redemption\". And sure it made Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey household names and the costumes and settings were top of the line, it still wasn't that great of a movie.",

This film is so beautiful and heartfelt and just so wonderfully enriching and thoughtful it really is so enriching you really connect with the film I was really connected to the film I have a strong meaningful connection to the film and that is the strong emotional and heartbreaking story that Unfolds and it never lets you relax right until the end which I won't spoil here I want everyone to experience the film for themselves I just was lost for words and I am now writing this review because I want the film to connect with all who see it I really do feel a strong connection to Celie and Nettie the sisters at the heart of the story and all the other characters Shug Mister Harpo Squeak Old Mister Sophia everyone in this film has a story and a connection to the main story and I feel really strongly that this film is for all time and will live on for new generations to experience and connect with these extraordinary women of such courage and such strength and sheer determination to not tolerate the abuse and the suffering they are forced into it really touched me at the end when everything is resolved because they learn an vital lesson in life stand up for yourself and never tolerate suffering and abuse and the film is very timely for me because the news always reports on sexual violence by dominant men and women which should not be tolerated and it really should not be happening and sadly people still feel the need to treat people with no compassion or dignity or kindness and that is what I took away from this unforgettable film never force yourself to dominant forces of malevolent evil I really feel strongly towards this film that it teaches the world that sexual violence or discrimination towards any race of gender inequality is an act of pure evil and an injustice to all man kind and all race religion and all people! Back to the Film the direction is unforgettable and so pristine it reminded me of the old films of the 30s and 40s it really touched me the film has a strong directional style it effortlessly moves from one time period to the other with ease The film is presented over a 35 40 year period or time frame if you will and the first few scenes are so beautiful because they capture all emotions in a split second Happiness, Joy and wonder when Celie and Nettie are playing together and doing their signature hand clapping motion which is their way of connecting with each other they know they are together because they have connected with their hand clapping motion and song that they sing every time they are on screen together they love each other and are very close you can feel that! Celie at the tender age of 14 is pregnant 14 forced to have a baby by her own father yes her own father and one of the most brutal sequences of any motion picture is when her newborn is taken away from her by her own father I knew I was in for an unforgettable movie experience after those opening scenes because I cried my eyes out I lost all happiness and joy and cried and I cried all the way through in the right places of course and when the end comes you have earned it it just does not happen straight away this a long film but boy is it it worth your 2 hours and a half but you have to watch it alone no one else you need to gather yourself at the end of the film and sit through the credits just so you can process what you have just experienced and to think this landmark Masterpiece was nominated for 11 Oscars and won none is a travesty a real tragedy it is awful that this film was not Best Picture and was beaten by Out of Africa out of blooming Africa it is a real travesty the biggest mistake the Oscars ever made The Color Purple is the Best Picture of 1985 and here's why, the direction the performances the emotional connection you have to the characters and the uplifting ending! One Last note I want to thank Steven Spielberg for giving us this film so we all can share this film with the world and connect with it as much as I did and always will for all time! And no John Williams score can you all imagine what he would have composed for this masterpiece instead we get Quincy Jones why I have no flipping idea! I will always love this film and after the credits finished I cried for hours so I urge all people to see this heartbreaking and thoughtful film as it should be loved and it will always be loved for all coming time!",

Being a straight person, i don't think i'd really want to see the explicit moves there,I think that Nettie as just so sweet and so cute, and it was wonderful that she ended up with her niece and nephew, taking care of them. It showed how back in the day, men did marry much younger women, and also the prejudice that the white people had for blacks to keep them in their place..

            "content": "The Color Purple (1985)4/4One of the best films of the disastrous 1985 holiday season, 'The Color Purple' is an all-new, electrifying experience on its own. This is a movie that is filled with wall to wall feelings, and the director, of course, is Steven Spielberg. At the time of the film's release, this was considered Spielberg's first 'serious' movie. Before 'The Color Purple', he made 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E. T', and made another Indy movie, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. At this point in his career, this is definitely new ground for him, as his movies had never had a serious narrative like this one. While it's not Steven Spielberg's best movie, maybe even far from it, (his 'Schindler's List' is one of the 10 greatest movies ever made for me) it's still fantastic.The film is based off of Alice Walker's classic novel of the same name, and follows Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), a 14 year old black girl growing up in the early 1900's and chronicling her life and the characters she meets all the way through the 1930's.As I mentioned, Celie is played by Whoopi Goldberg, in what I think, is her greatest performance. It's also her debut performance - one of the greatest debuts of all time. She really keeps the movie going, and it's never boring to sit through it. It always keeps your interest, and Spielberg's composure and talent is constantly present. This is a great movie, and one that everyone should see at least once in their life - I loved it.",

In another of many viewings of the movie, I was once again in awe of how wonderful the acting is and how well the story is told through both words and very real emotion.Goldberg and Winfrey had never been in a movie before, so Spielberg casting them in these very important roles was a great gamble on his part.Then again he had a bit of help from Quincy Jones. In only her first role Golberg triumphs beyond anyone expectations, be they little or great. Winfrey almost steals the show with her incredible performance as well.Another big surprise is Danny Glover's portrayal of an abusive, daddy's boy,who,like the men of his time,treats women like property.He takes Golberg for a wife,reluctantly because he wanted her much more attractive sister. The father of the girls wouldn't have it because he was physically & sexually abusing them himself.I don't feel the movie is too \"sunshiney\" as some critic long ago called it nor do I feel it's too slick. Spielberg & co. Put all the right touches into making this book into a wonderful movie.The only thing that would have been the icing on the cake would have been a Best Picture Oscar. Even 1 Oscar for Golberg would have sufficed.Instead, the academy chose Out Of Africa. Now, I don't dislike that film but I'm sorry, I've seen Out Of Africa 4 times.... it's just not as memorable as this film.I give The Color Purple 10 stars. It deserves that rating. (END)",

I don't know what was going on there but they were all over the place.However, despite them, Glover does carry the role, and Spielberg realized that this was a film adapted from a play. He kind of took that and ran with it, so the performances (minus two notable ones) were as earnest as you would get in live theater, the set designs, the camera movements, it all felt less like a movie and a lot more like, well, like you were seeing it live on Broadway.And, honestly, I think that worked.

Then Celie is married off to Albert Johnson, a brutal, uncaring man. After an incident between Nettie and Albert, Albert bans Nettie from his property and it appears that Celie may never see her again.An interesting, emotional, epic drama directed by Steven Spielberg. Very engaging, as we follow Celie's life, its trials and tribulations, ups and downs. The abuses she suffers at the hands of her father and husband are a harrowing ordeal. There's also some interesting sub-plots with the Sophia / Oprah Winfrey one highlighting the racism and injustice of the times.Despite the long running time (2 \u00bd hours) the movie moves along fairly well and generally doesn't feel that long. There are perhaps one or two scenes which could have been cut but the film doesn't feel padded.Performances are all first-rate with Whoopi Goldberg to the fore as Celie. She received a Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey received Best Supporting Actress nominations.Another feature of the film is the excellent soundtrack, written and produced by Quincy Jones. A great mix of blues and gospel.All in all The Color Purple received 11 Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, but, unfortunately, didn't win in any category. This is the record for most Oscar nominations without a win, held jointly with The Turning Point (1977).",

            "content": "In the year 1985 (my birth year) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie (Debut role for Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed through rough times. The story begins from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives Celie to him. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero. Celie's story is a true survival story.\"The Color Purple\" is a master-piece and underestimated film of Spielberg. He should make more drama which \"The Color Purple\" and \"Schindler's List\" are good notion.The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as Celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty \"Mister\". I have never seen him in a such an evil role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia.Warning! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like I have with my sister.Big applauds to Mr. Spielberg!",

            "review_title": "A Tale of Sisterhood & Women Empowerment",
            "content": "Stephen Spielberg is objectively one of the greatest film makers of all time. With pop culture classics like Indiana Jones and ET, to beautiful and powerful drama pieces like Schindler's List. This is a man who knows how to make a movie, and the Color Purple is \"one more chalk on his board,\" or whatever the saying is. It's a film with a heartwarming story, amazing acting, and excellent cinematography. I watched it once, and it immediately became one of my favorite films of all time.The Color Purple was a story of sisterhood, and the actual color purple was a symbol of that. We meet our main character, Celie, playing in a field of purple flowers with her sister Nettie. When the sisters are torn apart, the sky is filled with ominous purple clouds. Then after many years not knowing whether her sister was dead or alive, she finally got her hands on one of Nettie's letters, and as she read the letter the room had soft touches of purple on Celie's dress, the drapes, and even the lighting. When the sisters finally reunite after many years, not only are they both wearing purple, but they reunite in the same field of purple flowers we meet them.While it's a tale of two sisters at it's core, there's some much more to Celie's story to not only make you feel emotional, but also empowered. This film is fueled by it's strong female characters and it's theme of women empowerment. During these times, women were property and often abused the way Celie was. Yet the leading ladies here overcome that and really prove they are more. Nettie is well educated and fights for what she believes in. Shug Avery is living large and living freely. Sofia is not afraid to stand up for herself and will literally punch a person if it comes down to it.These strong female influences are what Celie needed. Celie was abused mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually for so long, by both her father and husband. She had no idea how to fight back and felt too worthless to even try. But we see that men never made her feel special. She had Nettie, who was the only one that loved her. Then Shug Avery came and rocked Celie's world. Shug was the first person since Nettie who had a true emotional connection with her. She made her feel loved and helped her become more confident and stronger in who she is.Thanks to these powerful influences, we find Celie at the end of the film as an independent woman, home owner, and business owner. Celie is not only the definition of a dynamic character, but she is also the definition of perseverance and woman empowerment. Her happy ending was well deserved and most satisfying.Not that I was there, nor am I African American either, but it seems African American culture in these times were depicted pretty accurately, in the way that they lived, hung out together, and talked. And while racism wasn't the focal theme of this brilliantly written story, it's very much there as it was in real life. We see it most with Sofia. All she did was speak against a white lady and punched her white husband, and ended up in jail for like 8 years. Systematic Racism right there. Sofia was such a strong headed woman. This experience knocked her down, but then she regains her spirit toward the end of the film; a satisfying end to her arc.That scene where Sofia is surrounded by angry white people was both powerful because of what it symbolized, but also because of the acting. While I'm at it - The Acting in the Color Purple is literally supreme. Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Akosua Busia, Desreta Jackson - I'm talking directly to all of you. I want to thank you and congratulate you on these brilliant performances. You made the film feel so real, so raw, so emotional, so powerful. It was Cinema at it's finest. Spielberg sure knows how to perfectly cast a movie.I do this weird thing that if the acting is really good, I'll smile, even if the scene itself is dark and inhumane. I want to leave a list of scenes that just stood out to me the most, because no words can begin to describe the quality of the acting, directing, and writing that will make me come back to this movie again and again:Sisters separated, Shug's song to Celie, Celie smiling, Sofia's downfall, Christmas reunion, reading the letter, The Final Supper, the Reunion.While Albert is a horrible person, you can tell he is very very miserable with his life. And thanks to scenes with his dad, we can see that he became the man his father wanted him to be. But when Shug reconciles with her father, she say \"sinners got soul too.\" And this is immediately followed by Albert helping Celie's family return home. After everything he's done, there's no chance of redemption for him, and he'll be trapped in the external and internal turmoil he put himself in.But doing one good thing for someone he tormented for so long - that must've given him tremendous inner peace. If he did one thing right, it was this, and he knows it meant literally everything to Celie. As Celie reunites, we see all her friends watch with tears of joy, because they too want Celie to find the happiness she deserved after everything she's been through.To end the review, I want to highlight the moment I found most inspirational: Albert tells Celie she's not going to make it in life because she's poor, black, ugly, and a woman. Her response was \"I am here.\" If that's not the definition of powerful, I don't know what is.",

Furthermore, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies. But in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed.",

What saves this film from being just depressing are a great script, tight editing, but most of all the outstanding performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. I can't resist inserting here that I think Whoopi Goldberg is STILL underrated, and that she belongs among the very greatest of the generation. Even here, in her first feature film role, she acts with the aplomb of a long-experienced star. This is a movie that should be on the \"required\" list high school American History course -- and for anyone else who hasn't seen it.",

He was still a little too infantile to tackle such material head on.  He didn't grow up as a filmmaker, in my mind, until \"Schlindler's List\".What we have here is a lot of unrealism (Celie serves Shug breakfast on matching China?  A poor black family has matching China?), a lot of stereotypes (men=Devils; women=Saints) and some horrible make-up when the characters age.  Best scene for me is Shug's reunion with her Dad who is a Preacher.  Its overdone and needlessly dramatic, but it gets me every single time I watch it.",

We don't like to see our ancestors in such a hideous depiction because it's like holding up a mirror to humanity and saying, \"Take a good look at who you really are\". I like films that disturb our senses and strip away arrogance and false pride. I like films that say \"It wasn't always great to be an American, but whatever we went through, we're still here. We're not dead yet.\" Whether Spielberg gives that voice to difference sexes, races or species, I think it is a message that needs to be heard again and again, because that it where our sense of pride can come from. Not from a false idea of who we were.Beyond the moral issues of this film, the cinematography was wonderful. The luscious landscapes of purple flowers and verdant feels was enough to take my breath away. The performances were just as wonderful. Whoopi Goldberg's film debut proved her ability as a future top-notch actress.

It is a sad but achingly beautiful study of complex characters weaving a complex tale across the vivid landscape of humanity, in whatever colour. For me, this has many 'stars'. Danny Glover, so well known for his comedy pairing with Mel Gibson, portrays an evil abuser who is ultimately saved by his conscience. Oprah Winfrey as the poor women whose inner demons tear her soul apart is utterly convincing, and why she consigned herself to the queen of the talk shows is a criminal waste. But for me, the star is obviously Whoopi Goldberg. She portrays her character with real depth and understanding. Her small triumphs, so often eclipsed by her tragedies, shine through like a blinding beacon of hope. This is a classic film, complex, tragic, sometimes funny. It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and he has crafted it as surely as an old master crafts a portrait or a composer writes a piece that leaves us emotionally drained, but ultimately fulfilled.I would happily give this 10 out of 10",

            "content": "Turning a book into a successful screenplay is an elusive art. Those wishing to do so would do well to study this movie, which turns a wonderful novel into an equally wonderful movie.The story concerns a black woman named Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). We follow Celie's life from the age of 14 to middle age, and it is a tough life. We start out with Celie's molestation at the hands of her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father. Her mother dies, and when her stepfather decides to remarry, Celie and her sister, Nettie (Akosia Busua), are no longer welcome in the house. Celie is old enough to be married off to Albert (Danny Glover), an abusive widower with equally abusive children. When Nettie rejects Albert's advances, he throws her out of his house, and keeps the sisters separate, even hiding Nettie's letters to Celie. But Celie manages to cope with the situation, creating order out of the chaos that Albert's house had become, helping his children and their neighbors, and earning such respect as a woman could earn in that community. She graciously welcomes Albert's mistress, singer Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), when he brings her to the house. Unexpectedly, the women become friends, and with Shug's help, Celie turns the tables on Albert, ultimately getting her life - and her sister - back.The acting is uniformly strong. Goldberg turns in a performance worthy of the critical acclaim it received. Glover plays Albert to perfection, even showing his vulnerability at the end of the film. Oprah Winfrey does an excellent job as the volatile Sofia. Avery's Shug is full of love and compassion. Rae Dawn Chong makes Squeak a multi-dimensional woman, whom you want to see succeed. The characters all become real, and we care about them and their concerns.Perhaps the greatest strength of the film is its taking a novel in epistolary form, and turning it into a running narrative. No small feat. The story is woven seamlessly, and is compelling as we follow it.An absolute classic of a movie, well worth repeated viewings.",

When first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century.  She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth.  Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.Celie (played in later years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married off to an abusive husband (Danny Glover).  The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life.The story is often heartbreaking as Celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children.  Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a tough as nails wife to her step son, and Shug, a loud and luscious saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love.Speilberg's direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances.  I dare you to watch this film and not be moved! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story.  While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine through.I couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me.",

It really got jipped at the Oscars in 1985 in my honest opinion.Whoopi Goldberg's first major role in a fair world would have won her the Oscar. Also, that same year, both Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey were both nominated for best supporting actress. Granted one of them should have claimed that award but since both were nominated it almost ruined the chance for either of them.Margaret Avery as Shug Avery was the gem in this movie in my honest opinion. Her character is versatile and I really wish she had come on stronger as an actress after her success in this film. Whoopi Goldberg as the main character Celie was Whoopi's most powerful performance ever. This film also helped rocket Danny Glover's career. As the abusive Albert, I could never see another person fitting the role better.What can one say about the character of Ms. Sofia??? Oprah Winfrey is a woman of sheer flexibility and anyone who ever saw her performance in this film knows why. Her character was definitely the most flamboyant of the film and the most \"showy\" as far as skills are concerned.I really wish the characters were more developed like in the book but with only a few hour movie it was almost impossible. Maybe Spielberg could have captured the entirety of the novel better with two movies allowing time for characters like Squeak (played by Rae Dawn Chong) to be developed fully.

Whoopi Goldberg plays one of the many unfortunate girls that was \"purchased\" to take care of a lazy, sorry, pathetic man & his kids. This was something very common & extremly sad in its day. The story taps into many areas of abuse...between mental, physical, & emotional. The character that Whoopi played was forced to stay away from her family by the man who used her. He kept her away from \"real life\" because he knew he really \"needed\" her instead of her needing him. So, after years of being treated like she is completely beneath this berserk & crazed man, she finally relizes (with the help of his friends, his other girlfriend, & his family) that she is worth a whole lot more.

The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: \"Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life.\" This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife Sophia's real name, \"Oprah,\" backwards. Spielberg isn't above such \"cuteness.\"It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion.

So he decided to get very serious by directing \"The Color Purple\", a period film with no special effects. Spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie. But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give Spielberg any respect. \"The Color Purple\" received 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, but Spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for Best Director. It got worse on Oscar night when this film didn't win a single Oscar. It got completely shut out. That wasn't right. \"The Color Purple\" should have won a couple of Oscars including one for Whoopi Goldberg's spectacular film debut as Celie, a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by Danny Glover), then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends. Oprah Winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as Sofia, one of those friends' of Celie. Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known Winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide). Like Goldberg, what a film debut! Margaret Avery is terrific as Shug Avery, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of Celie's rotten husband. All three actresses received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their work here (Goldberg for Best Actress; Winfrey and Avery for Best Supporting Actress). Set in the south during the first half of the 20th Century, \"The Color Purple\" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end. It also made me laugh at times too. Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating Spielberg for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. But Spielberg would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time. But he should have gotten nominated for this movie. The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like \"E.T.\" to a serious drama like \"The Color Purple\" was remarkable.\n**** (out of four)",

There is her vengeful and sadistic mother who masturbates her level of comfort through the shambles of her horrible pitiful life. There is also her robot like, seemingly indifferent cardboard kind of a grandmother and the cruel senseless garbage quality of her environment. All of it cannot crash down on her to squash her spirit. And, if all of that was not enough, she is handed an almost certain death sentence which infects the viewer with sadness, guilt and ....yes optimism. A miracle! The film presents almost nothing cinematographically new. It has the \"cookie cutter\" \"cold cuts\" of miserable/deprived/crude/ungrateful bunch of inner city kids and a kind, loving, do-good teacher. Mind you, she is a lesbian, therefore goodness gracious etc. What else is new? \"Precious\", that's what. The heavy gold persona of this huge/little girl (her mother is of lead) makes all the difference. We do love her. We sympathize, empathize, resonate with her misery, defiance, resistance and applaud her resilience and the steadiness of her soul.

The Color Purple is one of these profound movies: deep, and spiritual.  The Color Purple is why movies are made:  to tell an amazing story. This movie was made a year before I was born, so I only now have the pleasure of seeing this movie.  I first saw it a couple years ago and since have been profoundly impacted by this movie.  Not only are there great lessons throughout the movie, about women overcoming unjust circumstances, but it is a great lesson in Karma.  That ending is just about the most powerful I have seen, with the exception of some scenes in the Lord of The Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring.  I have a sister and I don't know how I would go on knowing I wouldn't see her for so long, or whether I would ever see her at all. The Color Purple shows the power of family, the power of friends, the power of laughter, the power of being freed from a restricted life.  It is, in short, about the powers in life.  Though it is a long movie (it seemed about three or so hours), it is time well-spent, and you won't regret it.My advice for going into this movie is, well, be ready to cry.  Keep an open mind, though, and let yourself feel the full force of the movie.  I have never cried more for any movie, so guys, if you plan on watching it with your girlfriend, don't expect to be able to sit through it without some waterworks.  It's okay, though.  Real men can cry.",

            "content": "Most critics consider this film to be the best of 1985 and obviously so. It's akin to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, CASABLANCA, and Spielberg's own SHINDLER'S LIST.  They are films that transcend years, rise above awards, and have a role in movie history that most Oscar winning films would gladly trade their statues for.  Simply put, it's one of the best films ever, regardless of lists that try to categorize films and select accordingly. Even so, it is commonly spoken that no other blunder in Oscar history has even come close to the shut out that this film received (OUT OF AFRICA won that year to prove the point).  There were a lot of reasons for this, but ironically none have to do with the work itself (Hollywood Jews hating Blacks, Blacks hating Hollywood Jews, old Hollywood hating the then relatively young and overly successful Spielberg, established actors and their agents hating unestablished actors, etc...)  For those that believe that it's points of humanity are not as focused as in the book, well then, read the book again, apparently Alice Walker didn't get through to you the first time.  The only group to judge the film fairly were the directors who's Guild awarded Spielberg it's top prize that year.  When Ron Howard was still new and cutting edge to the theatrical director role (yet with more Hollywood experience than most other directors), he was asked his opinion outside the Guild awards banquet on Spielberg not receiving an Oscar nomination despite THE COLOR PURPLE's 11 other nominations.  He was outspoken and remarked 'of course it was wrong' and said the directors that night were sicken by the continuation of Hollywood politics and aimed to correct at least a portion of the Academy's blunder.  This film is five stars out of five.  That is not to say it is without it's faults, but like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, it's postive moments go so far beyond what we consider perfection in a film, they more than obscure it's faults.  Whoopi Goldberg's performance is possibly the finest of any theatrical debut.  It still touches people today, sometimes uncomfortably, however, those with heart and a love for humanity will be rewarded with a beautiful film that will bring tears of joy.",

            "content": "WARNING! THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS! READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK!The first half hour of The Color Purple is extremely flimsy, plot-wise. There is only one interesting situation in that time, when Mister (Danny Glover) attempts to rape Nettie The plot picks up at last right before Whoopi Goldberg takes over as Celie, who has until now been played by a rather un-likable, amateurish actress. Here is the scene that kicks this huge improvement off: as young Celie prepares to shave Mister, he tells her he will kill her if she cuts him. Suddenly, she becomes terrified, and extremely uncomfortable close-ups of the razor going across Mister's neck are employed to their maximum potential.From then on, the plot constantly skyrockets further, except for one bit. After escaping from a fight in the local \"juke-joint\", Celie and a character named Shug have a woman-to-woman moment. Now, I'm not a big fan of such \"girly\" (as I like to call them) scenes. All of a sudden, to my alarm, Shug began to kiss Celie, and a few shots suggest just what goes on off-screen. I was rather alarmed. This movie's plot had plenty of promise by now: was it going to degenerate into a miserable lesbian romance film, when I was most interested in Celie's relationship with her abusive husband, Mister? Luckily, it did not linger on this for long. Spielberg admitted in an interview he regretted toning down the lesbian romance from the original novel, but I think this was a good choice: after wasting enough time, we get back to what we're really interested in, and that's the central conflict between Celie and Mister.(By the way, the author of the novel, Alice Walker, initially was displeased at the adaptation. After an enthusiastic audience reaction at premiere, however, she changed her mind and loved it. Curious, don't you think?)Whoever knew that Whoopi Goldberg, whom I've known mainly for her comedy roles, is such a great serious actress? This marks her film debut, and certainly remains among the finest debuts in film history. I'm not a fan of Oprah Winfrey, either, but here, she does quite a fantastic job as Sofia, a rather hefty woman full of confidence. (The two characters are powerfully contrasted\u2014Celie overcomes her abusive husband and the way the world has treated her; Sofia is arrested for an altercation with the Mayor, and after brutal beatings in jail, she emerges with her spirit completely crushed, ending up as a maid to the woman whose job offer led to the arrest in the first place.) Danny Glover proves to be a great villain in this film.However, for all its charms, The Color Purple is a deeply flawed film. After refusing Mister's sexual advances, Nettie is thrown off his land. She and Celie, however, hold onto each other, refusing to let go. Very touching at first, but the scene dragged on and on and on, and I finally got really bored of the whole \"You-can't-separate-us\" moment. Here is perhaps the reason I disliked the first half-hour of the film: the black people are portrayed in a far-from flattering way. The women are treated as commodities (when asking Celie's father permission to marry Nettie, Mister's request is denied, but he is offered Celie instead. He admits he hasn't noticed how she looks like, and so, Celie parades herself in front of him. They get married.). They are also brutally abused for minor things. But after that initial half-hour, we begin to see into these male characters and their motivations: Mister has a father he's afraid to say \"No\" to; he wants to please him desperately, etc. But here is the film's ultimate flaw: the women are all portrayed as free-spirited, overcoming all the difficulties the world throws at them eventually. But the men are shown as pushovers, weaklings, or to put it bluntly, losers. And another thing: I refuse to believe that black characters who read Oliver Twist would use phrases such as \"I is\". It just doesn't work.As for the music\u2014 dear LORD. Quincy Jones' music is awful. When Celie reads her sister's letters, it should be HER moment. But Jones' music just ruins the entire effect of the scene. (The one exception is the spirited, lively gospel song near the end of the film.)But Steven Spielberg proves more than ever his directing capabilities. His masterful intercutting makes the boring task of reading letters into a true cinematic experience. Celie sneaks a letter into her Missal and reads it during the church service. The congregation fades away\u2014except for Celie, who remains, quietly reading. Cut to the front of the church, which is suddenly ploughed through by a bulldozer, which is exactly what was going on in the letter, set in Africa. It's that kind of cutting that makes the movie so much more exciting. This technique culminates in one of the later scenes, as Celie is about to cut Mister's throat while shaving him. Spielberg cuts from her preparing to kill him to Shug running to stop her to an African sacrificial ritual. The resulting tension is overwhelming. And of course, what other director but Spielberg could make a mailbox into a character with mere camera movement?Overall, The Color Purple is very entertaining. It was quite publicly snubbed at the '86 Oscars, grabbing 11 nominations, and winning zero. I give it a thumbs up\u2014good? Yes. But far from a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I don't mind a film which uses tragedy to pull at heart strings, but it has to be intelligent and tasteful. The Color Purple is no such film. Spielberg lays the tragedy on with a thickness which makes it seem ludicrous. It seems the vast majority of the film does little more than try to insist upon its viewers that this woman's life is sad and unfair using methods which are so exaggerated and transparent that it distracts the viewer from getting lost in the story and simply keeps reminding them that they're watching a film which is trying far too hard to make them feel something.Some examples of this over-reaching can be seen in Whoopi Golberg's portrayal of Celia; the ridiculous state Celia first finds her new home in; the way Celia and Shug read in turn; and the irritating mood music played on cue each time Spielberg tries to saturate us in whatever emotion he's trying to evoke in us. The concept of subtlety has been completely lost on Spielberg in this film.The film does have its saving graces however. Apart from Goldberg's overdone portrayal of Celia, the acting is good, particularly from Oprah. The story itself (which I have not read) would quite probably be very emotional and interesting if it hadn't been told with such awkwardness. Margaret Avery's singing was divine, truly the only thing in the film that made me authentically feel something other than the urge to stop watching. For these things I give the film a 4. Had Spielberg not corrupted it so badly it quite possibly might even be worth the 7.6 stars it currently sits at on IMDb.",

            "content": "Sprawling, rambling Spielberg take on the American Negro experience in the early decades of the 20th Century, focusing, interestingly enough, almost entirely on the dynamics within the Negro community. As a result, the usually all-pervading outside influence of the white community is almost entirely absent. The film is beautifully shot with many imaginative tableaux imaginatively portrayed by the director and the pacing of the film is well-handled, even as the narrative is naturally episodic as it follows the course of the Whoopi Goldberg character's life. However it's impossible not to defend Spielberg against his old failing, sentimentality. Perhaps this is due to a striving to garner a more universal screen censor rating and thus wider distribution for the movie but certainly it seems that the incest, violence, lesbianism and rape scenes are watered down, unnecessarily in my view. This applies particularly in the depiction of Oprah Winfrey's character whose incarceration for speaking back to a white woman sees her go from a sassy mouthy individual to a damaged, passive maid, who even so, miraculously comes around in time for the uplifting conclusion of Goldberg's reunion with her detached family. To me this leaves too much to the imagination and over-stretches credulity and I could say the same also for the brutality rained down on her and her sister by firstly their abusive stepfather and even more so her \"arranged\" husband. There's also a plainly daft sub-evangelical meeting near the end at which everyone gets to clap hands, sing and generally get healed in front of the reverend father, almost offensive in its patronisation and stereotyping and with all the depth of a pop-video. Perhaps the scene was a sop to Quincy Jones, the film's musical director but even so it jars and is clearly misplaced. As for the acting, I found it only passable if often mannered and no one, for me, giving a particularly award-worthy performance. Comparisons with the slightly earlier hit TV mini-series \"Roots\" are obvious (there's even a duplication of the famous scene in the former where Whoopi Goldberg serves a drink to her cold father-in-law, replete with added spit). It's years since I avidly watched \"Roots\" and yet it has and will I'm sure stay longer in my memory than Spielberg's flawed would-be epic.",

His maudlin, well-intentioned approach to liberal message movies is completely at odds with Walker's spare, unsentimental storytelling. But, all in all, the results could have been much worse. Yes, Spielberg paints a painfully one-dimensional picture of poor blacks in the 1930s South. Yes, his way of exorcising his white guilt is to make the sole white character in the movie (played by Dana Ivey) a dithery twit, and his way of dealing with Walker's feminist elements is to make all of the male characters idiot buffoons. But the movie does have its good points, like a luminous performance from Whoopi Goldberg in the role of Celie, the ugly young woman who finds the beauty within herself, and an equally lovely performance from Margaret Avery, the sultry nightclub singer who helps Celie with her awakening. Oprah Winfrey huffs and puffs her way through a caricature of a performance as Sofia, the big black woman who goes around telling people what's what.Mr. Money Bags Spielberg ensures that the film has top-notch production values, and indeed it does look beautiful, and Quincy Jones provides a warm, pleasant score.Not the stunning film that could have been made from such good source material, but not a disaster either.Grade: B+",

It featured an all-star ensemble with the likes of Danny Glover, Whoopie Goldberg, Adolph Caesar, Oprah Winfrey, Margeret Avery, and Laurence Fishbourne, to name a few. Never mind that the script was adapted from the best selling novel by the distinguished Pulitzer prize winning author, Alice Walker. Every detail of it was orchestrated with precision. The legendary Quincy Jones' music, the cinematography, the makeup, the costume design, and other behind the scenes aspects were all stupendous. The story of how two sisters(Oscar worthy performances by both Goldberg and newcomer Akosia Buria), unwillingly separated as adolescents, finally reunite after years of trials and tribulations is the stuff legends are made of. The only way to describe this historical event is that it is spiritually uplifting, expertly crafted, a genuine and majestic tearjerker in the vein of earlier classics such as \"Imitation of Life\" and \"Gone With the Wind\".

It's a piece, that some may call powerful, however I found it depressing, sad and way too long, to hold anyone's attention. It continued to drag on and on, and just when you think the story can't get any worse (depressing wise), it does. Whoopie Goldburg, leads the cast of a few notable actors, in this period piece, set in the south from the 1920's, through the 1950's. A young girl who is raped and impregnated at the beginning of the film, by her father twice, is forced to give both babies up for adoption at only 13 years old. Her sister, and she live alone with their father after their mother dies, and within only a few months after her second child is born, her father gives her away in marriage to a man, at least twenty years her senior. She is treated with nothing but beatings, slander and worthlessness. And, after her sister is literally ripped away from her at fourteen, she is for the rest of the film, alone with no one who loves or cares for her. For approximately three decades we follow her through her struggle, and reality that she must face as her life, day to day, and it is painful at times to realize, that this is someone's life. Her only comfort in life, is her husband's mistress, who she falls for herself, in her own confusion of who she is and who really loves her in the world. Although it was an interesting story and certainly poignant, and touching, I don't know if two and a half hours of it, is good for the mind. It really does bring you down, and is not uplifting in the least bit. The last two minutes of the film are certainly the best, and I enjoyed those two minutes the most of the whole film, however I don't know if I would recommend watching the whole movie just to get to those last two minutes.Whoopie Goldburg was excellent, and probably the best performance of her lifetime, and I can see why she was nominated, but not why she didn't receive the Oscar.Again, it's good, but not one that is up there on my \"best list\".

When I was younger, I would always would watch the movie without any sense of the plot, theme or who was in the movie. When I had to watch the movie in high school for an English project, I started to grasp the concept of the movie and gained a perspective of the story that was being told. I was aware that The Color Purple was adaptation of a book unto the silver screen, but after viewing the film this week, I would be interested in reading the book this summer. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job bring to life the story told by Alice Walker in her 1982 book.The lighting was natural on the set and very organic with the flowers blowing in the wind and in the bar scenes were well light to showcase Shug's musical performances. The full screen angles shot in the field helped me gain an understanding of life in Georgia for African- Americans and I thought acting was superb giving the experience of the cast. Spielberg tremendous job of pacing the story, so that you did feel like there were details left out that did not try into the plot. The re-watch value of The Color Purple is really high and as I stated before I want to check out the book to get more depth of the characters.",

The film certainly isn't typical of his style, but it is powerful and gripping nevertheless. Morality movies like this are hard to put across on screen without seeming awkward, but we are drawn into the world of the central character and sympathise for her. \"The Color Purple\" is most famous for not winning a single Oscar giving that it was nominated for 10. Thats a shame because the film is at the highest on every level. Brilliant performances all across the board from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Averi and Danny Glover.\nWhile melodramas like this are an acquired taste \"The Color Purple\" is a solid example of it's type.

There are none on that list that I would want to watch again - except, for The Color Purple.  The movie is perfect - from the opening strains of Quincy Jones' exquisite score, to the end credits, it is perfect. Even if any of the people involved in the film had never made another one, their places in cinematic history would be forever cemented at the very top. Although the film does not present every aspect of Alice Walker's incredible novel (most notably, Spielberg downplays the sexual relationship between Celie and Shug), it captures the heart and the soul of Celie's journey to becoming her own person.  It is riveting.  You don't want the film to end - what happens next?  You come away from this film refilled, replenished.

            "review_title": "Beautifully written classic",
            "content": "The Color Purple is a beautifully interwoven story about the trials one woman faced growing up in the early 1900's, during a time where women and especially women of color were frowned upon. Celie, who is the character played by Whoopi Goldberg, was given the hard road from the time she was old enough to know better. At the age of fourteen she had encountered things most women would never have to face. Yet throughout all the challenges she grew strong and learned to love herself. She eventually got others to love and respect her too. I feel this is the ultimate theme of this movie.This movies theme is subjective in nature and centers around the life of Celie as she embarks on a journey to find her place in the world she has been a victim of. The focus of the movie is centered on Celie's character and the challenges she has to overcome. This movie shows the complex nature between the various relationships of the characters involved. It allowed us to get a close up view of the growth of friendship between Celie and Shug Avery, who was played by Margaret Avery. There also was a bond that grew between Sophia, who was played by Oprah Winfrey and the other women.The theme of this movie is universal in the light of the occurrences. The challenges faced by Celie are not uncommon in society, and unfortunately these challenges are the reality of many young women today. Celie was molested by her father and bore two children that she didn't get to keep. She was given in marriage to a low life man named Mister (Albert). Mister abused Celie in every way possible. These are just a few of the traumatizing effects of growing up in Celie's world, which are directly related to the theme. The use of symbols in the movie helped to build appreciation for their value. The color purple was one symbol. It was important because it bared the title of the movie and it had implications of beauty, change and awareness of self. The use of the sun in this movie is also a symbol of happiness. The director Steven Spielberg also used a similar thematic element in Citizen Kane. He did this by focusing the theme on the main character in each of the films. There was also the use of motifs within the film. A big one was the letters from her sister Nettie which Celie didn't receive until the climax of the film. The receipt of the letters is what allowed Celie to recognize she was worthy of love and that someone loved her. The theme of The Color Purple resonates from its beginning to its end. It showcases a range of emotions and the plot is fully seen through the various cinematic effects. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and root for Celie's success. Although the movie was written over two decades ago, its theme still fits the society we live in now. The Color Purple is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed for years to come. I love this film, and encourage everyone to view it at least once in a lifetime. It is well worth watching!",

Luckily she got the help from Shug. She became self-confident and independent. In the end she left Albert and started her new life. More happier was Nettie came back to meet her with Celie's two children.There were many touching moments in the movie. One of them was Shug sang excitingly the gospel song and reconciled with her father. Their hug was such a touching moment.Whoopi Goldberg convincingly played the sympathizing Celie. Steven Spielberg directed many blockbusters. Maybe he is the most successful commercial director in Hollywood. My favorites are Schindler's list, The color purple, The terminal, Saving private Ryan.A touching work. 8/10",

            "content": "When Spike Lee first saw this Spielberg's film of The Color Purple, he noted in his journal \"He's Gotta Have It\" a complaint that Mister (Danny Glover) - while shown to be a product of his mean father, and somewhat redeemed from a distance - is portrayed as a menacing figure without explicitly showing cause and effect that sources his anger and rage back to the white men that keep him down. If this matter were addressed in filming, the movie would not be improved by it. This perspective \"look what the white man made me do\" does not allow Mister to own his mistreatment of Celie, the character from whose perspective the story is told so effectively both in the Alice Walker book and the Spielberg film. If discussing this film with a lesbian movie fan, she may be dismissive of it and eventually reveal her disappointment that the intimacy with Shug is not more overtly sexual. Even though it would stick out like a sore thumb in the more tender and spiritual-focused film as a whole. As Celie eases into a sense of self respect and value, the film avoids what would read on screen as a diminishing of that into sexual terms. The focus of the story and narrative is right.My own fear any time I consider watching this film yet again is that the emotion can sneak up on the viewer and if Spielberg wants the us to well up it will most likely happen. Some call that manipulation. I call it effective and engaging film making. Steven Spielberg directs the attention of the audience with care, introducing scene transitions he had not attempted before in his work and carrying us from exuberant moments to trauma and uplift. Spielberg's love of cinema and the craft of directing does come first, as people are divided as to the repeated use of western movie head-turns and slow takes before a punch is thrown. This is used to comic effect in most cases, though the most provoked and consequential punches thrown are off camera or obscured in the moment of impact. We may see the moment before, and feel the inevitability, and the aftermath and consequences. Even with Quincy Jones taking over the music from John Williams, there is an aesthetic of emotion that is palpable from the start. The separation of two sisters can be as jarring and shattering as a shark attack. Watching this film decades later, the way characters are presented allows you to see Celie without remembering Whoopie as a host of The View and Danny Glover without being distracted by the legacy of Lethal Weapon. Oprah Winfrey going through the indignities her character endures lends resonance to it all because of her iconic status. To various degrees, this can be said of many now familiar faces in the film. In the hands of a lesser director, a straightforward recording of the content might be too uncommitted. Steven Spielberg takes the mundane and the gentle and makes it just enough larger than life that it finds emotional truth.",

The only person on the world who loves Celie (and vice-versa) is her sister Nettie. But the cruel fate made Celie marries with Mister/Albert (Danny Glover) and her life turns into a sorrowful hell. She is separated from her sister (the most sad scene of the movie), and her happiness seems to end on that moment.

The only reason why this film has the name of a classic is that people feel obliged to find it a classic. I cannot tell why this movie is so bad. Is it Steven Spielberg in his early days, or do the actors perform so poorly. This film just strains after effect. And that's it. Steven imagined a cinema full of crying people. That should have been what he wanted. This is only a good film for uncritical watchers. Movie addicts simply cannot like it.My first point of criticism contains the acting. This film is totally destitute of any form of nuance. When miss Millia starts the car, every civilian runs away. This film is not meant to be funny, don't try to mix it with humor either. When Albert brings Shug to her car heading for Chicago, Celie carries all the bags and suitcases. This is stereotyped. I cannot believe that the book by Alice Walker is as exaggerated as the film.I don't think you can make a film on Alice Walker's novel that is both funny and serious. Alice Walker meant this to be a serious, emotional story. The film should be serious too. The character of miss Sofia, funnily performed by Oprah Winfrey, is exaggerated. So much exaggerated that she is funny. Oprah should have performed less like a comedian. She is a strong woman, but she should not be a woman who makes the audience screaming with laughter.Another unclear scene is when Shug Avery and people in the church start to sing for God. This is totally in veracious. Why such an enthusiasm of all people at the same time? Why such a oneness? It is not made clear by Steven.I guess the only reason why this film has begotten any popularity is that it might strike people who are not into films that much. It cannot strike critical watchers unless those watchers are not critical enough.",

And sure her sister isn't smart enough to send some of them to other people in the town with a note to take them to her sister- NO, she just keeps sending them to the same place for 20 years even though no one answered! Never crossed her mind to send them, say, care of the local church, postman, relative, friend, bank, or Western Union Office.

At times it is rather hard to watch some of the scenes as the subject material is rather heavy and dark for the first hour, but it is well worth it in the end.

The clothes, the hair, the location, the props, the language (or lack thereof), everything lends to a true authentic picture of black life from about 1910 until the late 1930s. Whoopi did a wonderful job as \"Celie\", as did the young lady who played the younger version of the character (the one who took the brunt of the abuse). Glover was perfectly cast as \"Mister\". With one or two exceptions, Oprah hasn't been as fine of an actress since she was \"Sophia\" (though, when you're the richest woman in the Milky Way, who needs to be consistent?! You GO girl!) Margaret Avery was the spirit and breath of \"Shug\" and Tina Turner was right to turn it down; she would've been awful, I think. Rae Dawn Chong, Larry Fishburne and the rest of the lesser characters gave the movie the appropriate fullness and depth needed to truly capture the spirit of the book. My one problem? I wish they would've added the last scene of the book as the last scene of the movie! Come on, Stevie, baby! You could've given us those extra two or three minutes!",

            "review_title": "The Color Purple (1985)",
            "content": "What an incredible Steven Spielburg did with his first attempt at a \"serious\" movie. The Color Purple takes place in the south during the early 1900s to the late 1930s.The Color Purple film is about an underprivileged African-American woman named Celie Harris, played by Whoopi Goldberg. She endures abuse from her father at a young age and continues into her adulthood by her horrible husband she calls Mister, played by Danny Glover. Mister takes Celie home to his three kids and right away Mister starts physically and sexually abusing her. The filming and editing techniques were really good in this film. Spielburg used a lot of track-in shots. This type of shot is when the camera physically moves in on the subject, typically going from a medium close-up to a tighter close-up to draw attention to an important moment in a character's story. The movement is smooth, the background is blurred, and it makes the audience feel the emotions of what is happening. An example of a track-in shot is when Mister takes Celie home for the first time and forces her to have sexual intercourse with him. The track-in shot zooms in on her face to show her expression. The film's most touching and heartbreaking moment is when Celie and her sister Nettie are separated. Mister banned Nettie from his land because she would not sleep with him. Spielburg did a great job with scenes that made the audience feel the emotions that the character was feeling. The film's cinematographer, Allen Daviau, did a great job capturing the emotions between Celie and Nettie. His main focus was on each individual character. He paid attention to each character's talents and potential in the story line, self-actualization. The meaning of this film shows great strength in the belief of God. Even though Celie has physically and emotionally been through a nightmare, her strength in God keeps her moving forward. The film also shows how strong her love for her sister and her children are. The meaning of the title symbolizes when Shug Avery says that she believes that it angers God if a person walks by the color of purple in a field without stopping to notice and admire it. In this statement, Shug summarizes her religious philosophy; to her, God is not some distant deity living on high, but a genderless, race-less being that wants people to appreciate and enjoy life. It is also significant that she chose the color of purple, for it is the color of royalty; and yet a really deep purple seems almost to be black. My take exactly is that the field of purple represents freedom and Celie, Nettie, Adam, and Olivia being together at the end. When I saw the movie, I believe that the main focus was on Celie and how she tells her experiences. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is going through a hard time. Watching this movie will open and inspire anyone's mind to understand that things will get better.",

            "content": "As much as I love Spielberg, I never have been too fond of his more dramatic movie attempts. The drama in his movies often feels very melodramatic. This movie was his first real, straight-forward, dramatic endeavor and though I also have some real problems with this movie, people seem to forget and fail to see that as far as the genre goes, this still truly is one excellent movie. People look at this movie and see that it's not up to Spielberg's usual high standards of entertainment and film-making but that doesn't mean at all that this movie is an horrible one.There is simply no denying it that this is a skillfully made movie. It has all of the right settings and actors in it, as well as a compelling dramatic story, that focuses mainly on an African American woman, living and trying to survive life in the early 1900's America. She has to face lots of ordeals, such as the forced split-up of her and her sister that she was incredibly close with, taking beatings and rape. It's not necessarily a movie about racism, though it still plays some part in the story but it's more one that focuses on African American society, in rural areas, in the early 1900's and on its women and their position in particular. It follows its characters for some decades. Some things change for them, while others keep remaining the same. It's a good character driven drama with a compelling story, that ensures that the movie is always going and good to watch, even though the movie is being a bit of a long sit.It really is a movie that foremost works out thanks to its characters and actors that are portraying them. Amazingly enough two of its key characters are being played by d\u00e9butantes; Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey but what a fine debut it was! Both are truly excellent and its hard to recognize them in this movie, not necessarily because they look different and younger but more because of their performances, that is unlike anything they have ever done since. I truly wish Whoopi Goldberg would had continued playing more roles like this, instead of choosing a more comical career. How different her career must have been but she wanted to stay loyal to her comical background instead, which is of course her right to do. But with all this talking about Winfrey and Goldberg, people tend to forget how great Danny Glover is being in this movie as well. But this is also only because the movie is being a sort of ode to African American woman and their strength and also tells the story from their perspective.It all combined ensures that \"The Color Purple\" has something that a good drama requires; some good powerful emotions and drama. It's a touching movie that perhaps goes a bit over-the-top at times but overall as a whole still works out as some powerful and memorable.Can't say I'm too fond about its last 30 minutes though. The movie tries to desperately to wrap everything up needly. Everything ends well for the 'good' guys and gals and the 'bad' ones end up badly. It feels a bit forced, as if Spielberg was too afraid to that his movie would end on a downer and would leave its audience depressed. This is actually something quite a lot of Spielberg movies suffer from; they desperately try to end on a positive and uplifting note. Even \"Schindler's List\" somewhat does!It's far from my favorite Spielberg movie and it's also far from the best thing he has ever done but this movie still remains one fine, effective, powerful 'colored' drama, that by the way still really is missing a John Williams musical score.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "From Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), I remember watching about half of this film in college, but I didn't remember it well and never finished it, it was probably the first film I ever saw dominated by African American stars, so I watched it again. Basically, set in the Southern United States between the 1900's to mid-1930's, at seventeen years old Celie Harris (Desreta Jackson) has given birth to two children, after suffering abuse and rape from her father Pa Harris (Leonard Jackson), he has taken both of them away from her. Local farmer 'Mister' Albert Johnson (Danny Glover) wants to marry Celie's younger sister Nettie (Akosua Busia), but their father refuses to let her be wed, so he lets him have Celie. Mister neglects and abuses her as they live together, and he forces her to be his slave, cleaning the house, shaving him and making his meals, and then Nettie comes to live with the because of their father continuing to be incestuous. After failing to have his way with Nettie, Albert angrily forces her out and away, never to come back, leaving Celie distraught, but she promises to write to her until death, of course she never receives any. Years pass, Celie (introducing Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Whoopi Goldberg) is now a woman still forced to have a miserable life, but she keeps to cope with her routine, while her still sometimes abusive husband has a lover with jazz singer Shug Avery (Oscar nominated Margaret Avery). Celie and Shug do become friends though, and her confidence is lifted, they even begin an affair themselves, and she also finds a friendship with Sofia (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Oprah Winfrey) who is also beaten badly, but she fights against it. As the years have passed and no letters have come for her, Celie has believed that Nettie may be dead, but in fact she been living in Africa with missionaries, she and Shug find dozens of her letters hidden away. After almost slitting his throat, it is after a dinner, with a permanently disfigured Sofia attending, that Celie finally finds the strength to stand up to and leave Albert. She explains that she knows he kept the letters hidden from her, and she, Shug, Shug's husband Grady (Bennet Guillory) and Squeak (Commando's Rae Dawn Chong) - girlfriend of Albert's son Harpo (Willard E. Pugh), are coming with her. Finding a new peaceful life in Tennessee, and opening a new \"one size fits all\" clothes shop, Celie finds out that her father was not her biological father, but her stepfather, and she inherited the shop and a house from her real father. Albert meanwhile has let Celie's hateful words get to him, and he has realised he really was bad to her, guilt finally catches up with him, and unknown to his ex- wife, he pays his money to immigration to arrange a reunion with her sister. In the end Celie is tearful and overjoyed as she and Nettie are finally reunited, as well as Celie's two grown up children, son Adam (Peto Kinsaka) and daughter Olivia (Lelo Masamba), Albert smiles from a distance, and Shug smiles at him for doing the right thing, Celie and Nettie play their childhood hand clapping game as the sun sets. Also starring Dana Ivey as Miss Millie, Laurence Fishburne as Swain, John Patton Jr. as Preacher and Carl Anderson as Reverend Samuel. In her first screen performance Goldberg is superb as the leading character living through the years of abuse, standing up to it, and of course finding hope in the company of others, Glover is great as the nasty husband who beats and mistreats her, Avery does very well with her singing and being sympathetic, Winfrey - before her chat show began - is terrific as the also beaten wife who can defend herself, and the other cast members do well too. Spielberg is a good choice as director, because it was apparently a difficult novel to make into a mainstream film, but it is done without becoming too glossy, it is done with great dignity and aplomb, a most impressive period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Music for Quincy Jones and many more, Best Song for \"Miss Celie's Blues (Sister)\", Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",

This film hits closer to home and it speaks an emotional, historical truth about a race who has been rejected in America from the birth of the nation to very recently. This movie is about how the black ladies want to be a part of society, not outcasts. There are provocative scenes in here proving just how racist people were in the early 20th century as evident by Mrs. Millie and the townsfolk. The story and direction are amazing. This film is also beautifully shot and this is a majestic masterpiece to behold.Spielberg's film is tells the story of a black woman named Celie from her teenage years to nearly thirty years later. The film talks about how she suffered abuse all her life from her father to her abusive husband, Albert. But she finds the strength to overcome her abuse when she meets two strong-willed women she finds comfort with.The acting is marvelous. Whoopi Goldberg, in her first film role, is excellent as the shy, weak-willed Celie. I've always thought as Danny Glover as one of the main good guys in Lethal Weapon, but now that may be overshadowed in his villainous, abusive role as Albert. Margaret Avery as Shug does an excellent job as Celie's role model. Likewise for Oprah Winfrey.Overall, The Color Purple is an incredible story about how this one woman overcomes the struggles of poverty, sexism, and racism to lead a good life and become closer to God. Her character is strongly defined as the movie progresses and her personality makes a unique change. There is a shed or two to be shed at times. The film may be just a tad long and some of the story could have been fleshened out, but this is definitely a personalized masterpiece. I rate this film 9/10.",

The utter nerve!But I digress...as the film itself is a harrowing piece of work, wonderfully told in its span of four decades early in the 20th century; \"The Color Purple\" chronicles the life of a young African-American woman (Whoopi Goldberg), and her struggle to survive and cope with the obstacles around her. In an Oscar-nominated acting debut, Goldberg is especially (and surprisingly) effective in her amazing turn as the main character. In addition to that, supporting performances by the likes of Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey and others are of first-rate quality. The rural backdrop, complete with old-fashioned attitudes towards race and gender, provides for some isolated moments of quiet poignancy. This is a horribly underrated classic, and I feel it deserves all the acclaim it got (and still gets) for its excellent portrayals of hardship and love.A beautiful, beautiful film.

I have to admit when I had heard Oprah had done this film and won a nomination for her role of Sofia, I honestly thought it was because she's Oprah and this big star, and like an idiot I thought that fact helped get her the nomination, little did I know that she was one of my more favorite characters in any movie I've seen, she was amazing. Her performance has to be one of the best performances by an actress I have ever, EVER SEEN; how she captured the vivacious and full of life Sofia, who's life behind bars and as a maid, broke her spirit and will to move on dazzled me. I've never been more impressed by any actress than I was about her. I began to forget she is the multi-billion dollar woman who is on our televisions everyday and believed she was this amazing woman Sofia. All I have to say is Fantastic JOB \"O\". Whoppi Goldberg blew me away, I love her comedy and her role in Ghost is one of my favorites, but her heart-breaking performance as shy, timid Celile has to be another one of the best performances I have ever seen. I just felt for this character so much, and just wanted to save her from her disgusting situation. Her timid smile and sweet personality captivated me and I fell in love with this character. She was and still is an amazing actress, but this film was one of her best. The rest of the cast of Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, and the rest of this amazing cast kept you in the story, thinking that this was a documentary with how realistic their acing was. It was the first movie I have to say gives you an almost true to life feeling of raw human emotion with its gorgeous cinematography, true to life characters and deep symbolic messages of hope and love. It was a shame and I think it completely wrong that this film was not given any Oscars or even a nomination in the Baftas because in my book this film is a masterpiece and should go down as one of the best films ever made. Mind you they say Citizen Cane is the best movie in the world and it did not win Best Picture, so I guess not all great films have to win an award to be a classic, but it still is a disappointing shame. I recommend this film to anyone, especially those who believe in hope and KARMA. Enjoy!!!!",

Not only could the cast sing very well, their acting was flawless. I must commend Oprah for having producing the play, for having the Angel net work as recipients, and for everything that she does - a truly gift from God she is.I enjoyed the twist to the play with Mista (Albert) actually asking Ms. Celie to marry him! What was even better - she told him No.I can't say enough about the book, I have read the book several times and have written an Essay paper on the Color Purple.The movie was so very touching - The play, the book, the movie are all quite entertaining. I continue to find myself crying throughout different scenes of the Color Purple. Somehow, it has that effect on many people.Hats off for an excellent piece of work.",

There are some people that feel Steven Spielberg's adaptation did not do Alice Walker's novel any justice - but books and movies are never going to be able to convey the same things. This movie should be watched with anyone interested in equality, freedom, and human rights - but more importantly, it should be watched by those who have not yet learned these values.The Color Purple is, undoubtedly, the most powerful and, dare I say, best movie I have ever seen. My first viewing was when I was about eight years old - the story has haunted me ever since - I remember hiding my face in front of my parents, as I didn't want them to see me upset! The characters became part of my play-time - my brother and I would pretend to act out certain scenes - we'd usually play Sofia (Winfrey) - I guess her spirit was inspiring to us. Over the last 18 years, I have watched it numerous times - each time noticing something new. I recently read Alice Walker's novel, which made me see the movie differently once more. The Color Purple is also the only movie that has ever made me cry - I cried on my sixth viewing! I will always remember Sofia charging into Mister's house and setting her ground-rules, and I will always remember Christmas time when she is reunited with her family, only to be allowed to stay for a few minutes. I will never forget the moments when Celie and Nettie are separated, and when they finally meet again after so many years apart. The Color Purple is heartbreaking and wonderfully uplifting at the same time. Thank you to all the people who were involved in its creation.If you have not seen The Color Purple yet, please do - it really could change your life.",

From the opening scenes with the girls over-the-top hand clapping (we did they as kids but better rhymes) and cheesy smiles, and that Pollyanna music...... I had my doubts. The girls cuddling, kissing, not wanting to be apart...too much.We get it, the girls had a rough ride. Celie's husband giving orders....saddle my horse, clean the house, I want my supper, don't talk back, don't mess with my mail box. Yes, yes we get the pointHow Celia cleans that dump of a house so that it's sparkling clean is er, a little hard do believe. How does she keep the front garden so nice and the lawn clipped? The photo of the woman by her husband's bed, supposedly taken before 1909 - is also unbelievable. It's obviously modern.There are some annoying scenes - when Celie's husband is getting ready to go out and she stands (head bowed) with the shoes, then the tie and something else, is pathetic. Also Celie's oh so sad facial expressions and looking up through lowered lids was just oo much. Then we have joyful expressions waiting for the mail, turning to (aargh) sadness. Then close ups of Celie's sad, smiling face. Her looking 'scared' all the time. So much overacting.The ugly woman (Shrug) calling Celie 'ugly' is obviously miscast. When Celie makes the perfect breakfast in the sparkling clean pans...... oh dear.. And what was Shrug's 'singing' and 'dancing'. - dire. I nearly switched off several times, but waited for it to be better. It didn't.The film was just schmaltz (not a word I ever use) with some pretty poor and over the top acting and dreadful music. The attempts at comedy were pretty poor (Harpo trying to make a stand with Sofia, Albert trying to cook, are prime examples).Maybe it was good in its day.It's a no wonder Oprah gave up acting!

Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary Zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none West Africa ---- and most of all why get the people to speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speaks Swahili??

In my opinion this is one of the finest films ever made, such is the plethora of emotions which it envokes in the audience. Having also read the novel, i feel that Spielberg captures the essence of the story well, weaving in the African segments which he could have easily glossed over or even omitted entirely. The acting is superb, and i cannot think of one person who's acting spoils the film or who is not believable in the character that they play. The scene where Celie finally reads the letters that her estranged sister Nettie has sent and which have been hidden by 'Mr', never fails to have me sobbing like an idiot! And the end of the film makes your heart want to burst out of your chest with happiness for Celie, for Nettie, for the redemption of the whole human race! The musical score is fantastic.

Obviously Spielberg got the entire thing wrong: I thought SCHINDLER'S LIST was extraordinarily well done, but his first experiment outside \"pure entertainment\" could be said to be a failure.  Absolutely nothing happens in the film for the first 100 minutes - rather, things DO happen but not so you'd know.  It's always difficult to adapt a sprawling novel to a film with limited runtime, but, to me, Spielberg glosses over some very important issues near the beginning: he could have expanded these (such as the father's influence on the two girls), and left out some fairly trivial scenes through the middle and towards the end.  Again, I'm not sure how the book finished, but to climax in such a contrived \"happy ending\" is almost demeaning to the audience, who should have been sitting there for well over two hours absolutely engrossed in the on-screen drama.  Things like this simply don't happen - Whoopie Goldberg's husband, for instance, changes his personality overnight and arranges a reunion between her and her sister. Where did they get this stuff from?!!  I felt, as I was watching it, that I could never really relate to the characters: they were presented, but not explored.  Noting that Spielberg, for all his great qualities, is still a white man, one can understand this: he never had any real feel for the oppression of the characters.  The film, in fact, became more of a comedy - again, I'm not sure how the book was written but I'm sure that even if it did contain humorous notes throughout, the sheer tragedy of the situation would have come through loud and clear.  All in all, I was disappointed with this film: a great director handling a (reputedly) great story, and it fell in a heap, with only an emotive happy ending that was any good.  Rating: 6/10.",

She was compelling, she tugged at your heartstrings, and you can't help but cheer for her when she finally stands up to Mr., her husband who had made her life so miserable up to this point. Another performance I very much enjoyed was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. I was surprised, to say the least, that she could act this well. She was funny, strong, but she was also weak in some respects, like any other person.Now, as with all movies, there were a few things I would have changed. I wished it could have been more like the book, where Celie and Shug Avery are full-on lovers, complete with cheating and reconcile, whereas in the movie, all they have is one little kiss, and after that are only friends! The former, in my opinion, establishes Celie as different from others, and sort of makes her more sympathetic in that respect. Another thing I liked better in the book than the movie was that Mr., AKA Albert, apologizes to Celie for all he's done to her and becomes her friend, sympathizing and trying to help when it is found out that Shug has been unfaithful to her. In the film, this development of his character is present, just not very clear.Even though it has flaws, what movie, no matter how wonderful, doesn't? It's still beautiful, sad, the acting is still top-notch, and I guarantee you, if you don't at least FEEL like crying at the very end, you must have ice-cold water running through your veins.",

            "review_title": "A Powerful, Emotional Gut Punch!",
            "content": "Steven Spielberg is probably the world's most gifted storyteller. As children, he enlightened our minds and made us feel emotions in gems like E.T and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He terrified our souls with that one shark film we all know as Jaws. Up until 1985, Spielberg used science-fiction or fantasy to develop his incredible gift of storytelling. Just like any excellent filmmaker would, he made us cry tears of sadness and tears of laughter. With his first attempt at serious filmmaking, he does the same thing except within the framework of a serious topic. This movie had me grinning and bawling my eyes out. With eleven Oscar nominations (and sadly no wins) it shows that Spielberg has a hand for this kind of material. I was not expecting much, but Spielberg delivered an amazing film.The film, written by Menno Meyjes, is based off the literary classic by Alice Walker. Many people thought the story, about a young black girl suffering from men most of her life in rural Georgia, was unfilmable. The book was a series of letters from the main character, Celie. She would write to different people, but most importantly God. The book is darker than the film depicted. The movie also notches down the idea of lesbians to a simple kiss in which Spielberg defended as trying to keep his movie PG-13. Unfortunately, that does make sense. Some people complained that Spielberg and his trademark sentimental ways of storytelling made the film a happier place and time. To me, I think all that did was add heart. The film could have been utterly depressing, but Spielberg made sure there were moments of joy mixed in with all of the ugliness. On top of that, it gave the film a more of an epic scope. Those feelings mixed with the excellent cinematography skills of Allen Daviau and Quincy Jones's score gave the film that feeling.Given the subject matter, the film is an important story to tell. Even in today's society, it remains relevant and timely. Spielberg has received some backlash from people claiming, as a white man, Spielberg is not the right man to tell an African-American story. In 2020, I do not think he would touch this project. But in 1985, he treated the story with respect and with grace, and I believe that is one of the main reasons why the film continues to get amazing reviews. As director Oliver Stone mentions, Spielberg was probably the only one who could have gotten the film made. The film could have been more confusing in any other director's hands, but we all know the gift of storytelling the auteur has.The film takes place over a span of thirty years. Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg) is a tortured young woman who hasn't seen much love over the span of her young life, outside of her sister Nettie. Her incestuous father (Adolph Caesar) kept getting his daughter pregnant and giving the babies away. He eventually marries her off to the evil farmhand, Albert (Danny Glover) or \"Mister\" according to Celie. Albert abuses Celie in a horrible fashion. The turning point in Celie's life is when she meets Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), Albert's lover. Shug considers Celie really ugly at first, but she becomes more attracted to Celie as they get to know each other more. Through Shug, Celie may find that there are reasons to smile.For her screen debut, Whoopi Goldberg nailed her scenes. What a juicy role to begin your career with and she was even nominated for an Academy Award. Her character was a tortured soul, and Goldberg really pulled that off. Margaret Avery is also incredible, although I needed to warm up to her character. Danny Glover can play jerks very well as we see twice in 1985 with first Witness, now this film. Also, Oprah Winfrey! Yes, that Oprah! She plays a soul who seems to get everything she wants but goes through a complete personality change after standing up to a local white mayor. Oprah is definitely a presence!Despite some sentimental presence, prepare yourself for some heartbreak. The biggest scene to me is when Celie and Nettie are ripped apart from each other. Gosh, it felt like my soul was being shredded. The way that they have their hand games is very touching. I felt really bad for Celie with everything she has been through, but she will earn her strength. The name of the film/book comes from the beautiful purple fields and flowers. Daviau did an amazing job capturing those poignant scenes. Despite the mental torture and the beatings, there is no senseless revenge acts. This is a movie that attempts to find joy within the ugliness.The Color Purple is a straightforward drama that packs many emotional punches. This is Spielberg's most mature film. Despite the serious subject matter, we can see his trademarks. Fun trivia fact. This is one of the few films he directed that is not composed by John Williams. Anyhow, the subject matter is prevalent. Black women are often mistreated by black men, as this film shows. It's not so much of a film about race as it is about the treatment of each other within one race. This is a powerful and a must-watch.My Grade: A",

I suppose that one of the reasons that this movie is so highly considered is that it was truly groundbreaking for much of white America.

I rank this film higher than his others: Empire of the Sun 1987, Jaws 1975, The Indiana Jones trilogy: Raiders Of The Lost Ark 1981, Indiana Jones And Temple Of Doom 1984, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade 1989, Duel 1971, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind 1977,Catch Me If You Can(based on the true story of Frank Abagnale), Amistad 1997 and lastly, Jurassic Park 1993.The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Alice Walker. It introduced actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey who would later achieve much success in the movie industry.Plot: Taking place in the Southern United States between Winter 1909 and Autumn 1937, the movie tells the life of a poor African American woman named Celie Harris (Whoopi Goldberg) whose abuse begins when she is young. By the time she is fourteen, she has already had two children by her father Alphonso \"James\" Harris (Leonard Jackson) and is pregnant with another. He takes them away from her at childbirth and forces the young Celie (Desreta Jackson) to marry a wealthy young local widower Albert Johnson, known to her only as \"Mister\" (Danny Glover), who treats her like a slave. Albert makes her clean up his disorderly household and take care of his unruly children. Albert beats and rapes her often, intimidating Celie into submission and near silence. Celie's sister Nettie (Akosua Busia) comes to live with them, and there is a brief period of happiness as the sisters spend time together and Nettie begins to teach Celie how to read. This is short-lived; after Nettie refuses Albert's predatory affections once too often, he kicks her out. Before being run off by Albert, Nettie promises to write to Celie saying, \"Nothing but death can keep me from it!\".Verdict: I was very much impressed with Spielberg's style of direction in keeping with the settings of that period of time. Oprah Winfrey immediately captivated me with her sincere and mature acting. Actor Danny Glover is a big favorite of mine and he gives a thoroughly professional performance as Albert Johnson, a man who treats women as mere sex objects. Other notable actors are Willard E. Pugh(RoboCop 2 1990), Rae Dawn Chong(Commando 1985), Margaret Avery and veteran actor Laurence Fishburne(Just Cause 1995).",

Every actor gave his/her best and I must admit the movie excluded several details in the book but it was already long...making it longer would turn it into \"Roots\".Okay, so, this highly emotional and moving story centers around Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Alice Walker presented The Color Purple as a combination of Celie's letters (diary format) and some narration from Celie, an abused African-American girl who is married to a man she does not have feelings for. she goes through life being treated as the scum of the earth by ignorant folks and even her own \"persumed family. abused as a child and as an adult, separated from her sister, battling spiritual demons, Alice Walker slowly, but triumphantly, takes us through the dark hallways of Celie's life and delivers a resounding climax as Celie makes peace with herself, her enemies, her family and reunites with her sister and children. If the book was a page turner, the movie is comparable. Great work. Great direction, production, acting, casting, great everything (editing could've been better). I love it! How can you not love it?

Yes I include Out Of Africa in that statement. It's not my favourite movie of 1985 (so many more easy to watch, enjoyable movie experiences that year) but it's the best. It's so powerful.This is an insanely brave move by Spielberg!! Looking for a bit of credibility from his peers he chose to make a movie about subjects that are not suited to the movies! It is not an easy movie to sell, nor is It an easy movie watch. The main character Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) endures rape, incest, sexism, an abusive husband, domestic violence, chauvinism, the loss of her sister (The only person who truly loved her) and the loss of her children at birth. Danny Glover is one serious piece of $h\u00eft in this!! He is vile, evil and despicable. Great acting. All of the cast is superb, none more so than Oprah Winfrey, she is superb as Sophia (what happens to her may be the saddest part of the movie) likewise Margaret Avery and Willard E. Pugh (who is the comedy relief as Harpo) Laurence Fishburn has a small role too. And then, at the center of the movie is Whoopi Goldberg in what must surely rank as one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history. She should have been the winner of the Academy Award for best actress that year. She is perfect. Sady we lost a great serious actress when she started going down the comedic route. I only have real complaint in that there should have been a tender and touching scene for Winfrey, but for some reason Spielberg decides to go for a slapstick scene that misses the mark. Once again a Spielberg movie had me in tears, the end is one of the great heart-rending moments in the movies. The Academy's prejudice against Spielberg is blatantly evident in the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director. The movie received 11 nominations, for Best picture, Best Actress, has 2 nominated for Best Supporting Actress, Best Writing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinamatography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Song, Best Score and Best Make Up, and a Best Director nod is conspicuously absent. And although The Color Purple had 11 nominations, it won not a single Oscar. His movies made too much money and were too popular for him to be considered a real film maker. The Color Purple was the fourth highest grossing movie of 1985 (behind Back To The Future, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 and Rocky IV) grossing $179 million at the domestic box office.",

It would be so easy to simply discount his films as commercialized and mainstream, and some *are*, but they are almost always excellent.  That was why I was so astonished by Schindler's List when it was released \u0096 instead of sharks and superhero archaeologists, suddenly we had this incredibly profound film that was *so* well done.  Having said that, I would have been less astonished had I seen The Color Purple first.*Possible Spoilers*The Color Purple follows the tragic life of Celie (Goldberg) who has to contend with being impregnated twice by a family member, is essentially sold to a man so she can be his wife, a mother to his children from a previous marriage and resident slave and whipping post, all before the age of fifteen.  Through the years she goes from being completely beat down and oppressed to gaining a voice through the help of friends and other loved ones.  I was completely riveted while watching this film, despite its length.  The characters are so rich, and the story so full and well paced that it was impossible to get distracted, rather I wished that the film was actually longer.  There was one moment that gave me pause, when Glover's character suddenly had a change of heart, but at that point I was so enamored by the film until that then that this made me raise an eyebrow, but it was easily forgiven.  While the entire film is brilliantly executed, one particular scene to look out for is the scene when Celie is reading Nettie's letters.  The incredibly creative way that Spielberg mixes the content of the letters with Celie's surroundings is almost awe-inspiring.  The Color Purple is not an entirely feel-good film, but it is a compelling and one and masterfully done.--Shelly",

The film follows the character Celie of Whoopi Goldberg who is basically a servant and sex slave to her abusive husband (emotionally and physically) who separates her from her sister who was her pillar. Over the course of the film we see Celie develop from a terrified and tentative girl to a strong and independent woman and a passionate and persevering woman! The film is a little over 2 and a half hours but is packed with such great performances from Glover, Goldberg and Winfrey as well as the supporting cast that there is no wasted screen time and while it struggles in a few moments, makes up for it with such loving care in the way it is shot and executed that you absolutely forgive its faults.",

It is the the story of Celie, a young black woman who is forced to marry a hateful man. This man is only known to her as Mr. He throws out Celie's sister, Nettie; the one and only thing she loves. When Celie grows up into a beaten woman, something happenes: Mr's. old girlfriend comes to stay with them. She turns Celie's life around and brings a new strength that she never thought she had. There is much more to the story than that, but as I said, it is very complicated.The tears of joy and pain are well deserved in The Color Purple. It is emotionally charged. but also funny. It is the story of two special woman, claiming a life of their own. They swear that nothing will ever drag them down as long as they can hold on to eachother. Whoopie Goldburg is fantastic. Along with her supporting cast!The Color Purple should be at the top of your viewing list. A flat out masterpiece! 10 out of 10!",

There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with.  Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption.  Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie.  Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. \nAnd the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent \"Beloved\" did.

            "content": "Love. Not just romantic love, love, any love is a gift given to everyone at birth. Love for going for a walk, love for athletics, love for spaghetti, love for your family and friends, love for horror movies. We all have different levels at which we love, but it's all there in our hearts somewhere. Our lives are shaped by how tight we allow love to grip onto our lives, what power the grip has over our wellbeing if love is denied, and how we move on with our lives using the leftover love. To love is what I believe to be the purpose for existing on this blue and green planet, and love is the nucleus to The Color Purple.The thing that makes The Color Purple the potent film it is, is the concept of love, not just for your partner in life, sometimes the people who come in and out of your life, but most importantly yourself. You have to love yourself for any of the time you spend here to mean a damn. The Color Purple also is about the people who occupy our lives. Each person in our life means something unique to everyone. Some people are here to break your life, others meet you to heal the scars and get you where you need to be. The Color Purple is about everyone, it's about ourselves. There's so much communication and understanding between the film and the viewer, that you feel connected to this film as if by an umbilical cord.The Color Purple may look on the page as if its bitten off more than what could fit in its hypothetical mouth in terms of political issues and bonds in life, but it carries each issue with poise. The most obvious explored topic is race and the tribulations of being an African American at the beginning of the millennium. Not only just a woman, but an abused African woman. Better yet, a bisexual, physically abused African woman. Wait, a diffident, bisexual, physically abused, African woman. To top it off: a diffident, bisexual, physically abused, African woman that bore two children from her own father. The Color Purple studies these issues with a firm, fully developed, emotional handle. The film also soars in its relationships within the family.Steven Spielberg may be famous for the adventure genre and the creativity that lies in this blockbuster hits, but The Color Purple proves of his knowledge of human beings and our complex feelings. In a story about love, Spielberg's supplied the film with a sensitive mood and a heartwarming touch, with so much sentimental spirit, you would assume a woman, reflecting more on her inner life, would've directed the picture. There are some scenes of high intensity and violence that are really well cooked. Spielberg involves the audience so much in the story, that each of those \"high intensity\" scenes become 3-dimensional, making us believe we are the characters in those situations that could result in anger and sadness.When I think of the look a picture, I forget that there were some beautifully captured films before the 2000s because of the technology that has been invented to make movies nicer to look at. The Color Purple is one of those examples where the photography is everlastingly beautiful to just sit and stare at. To add to that, each camera angel, shot, and cut has a symbolic meaning to the characters. It's a fulfilling level of narrative, telling the story within the story through the camera-work. Not only does the story unfold within the characters and the action of the movie from the expertly written novel, but the cinematography adds another layer to the tale. A trademark of The Color Purple (besides the exploding color of violet all over the film) is the silhouette shadow visionary shots.The acting ensemble takes the heavily progressed characters and works hard to become one memorable cast. It's hard to believe Danny Glover's fiery work was ignored here by the press and audiences, however one could easily have been distracted by the women's grinding efforts. We all know Whoopi Goldberg for a good laugh from her work in Ghost, Sister Act, and hosting The View, but The Color Purple holds the truth of her range. It is her movie. Celie is like a can of soda being shaken by Danny Glover's character for years and the moment Celie finally snaps is like opening that can of soda and watching it rupture, which may be Goldberg's finest scene in the film. Her work stands taller than any other work of 1985. Oprah is just as tough and strong in her role as she is years after the release of this film in real life. Margaret Avery full of warmth and charity in her remembered character.The Color Purple is a treasure that kept me engaged through it's lengthy running time. It's a film that derives its powerful narrative from strength and love, filled with performances that have stood the test of time, a director filling the screen with what's in his heart, and cinematography that is intellectually and visually stimulating. It's a adaptation that just a glorious, burning time at the movies.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",

            "content": "This is by far my favorite Spielberg movie.  He pulled off the transition from shark-at-large scarefests and Reese's Pieces loving extraterrestrials beautifully.  A faithful adaption of Alica Walker's diary-like novel,  The Color Purple follows the life of a woman in the deep South through some thirty-five years or so of hardship,  abuse and tremendous change,  both within and without of herself.  Impregnated twice by her cruel,  incestuous father,  then robbed of the two children she bore,  14 year old Celie's one consolation in life is the love of her sister Nettie.  When a local widower (Danny Glover) comes to the house asking for Nettie's hand in marriage,  the girls' father casually tosses him Celie (a brilliant, brief performance by Desreta Jackson),  and she becomes trapped in a loveless union which offers nothing more than verbal and physical abuse fueled by her husband's resentment that he did not get the woman he had his eyes on,  but rather her homely sister.  The cruelest form of expression of his hatred for Celie is not the beatings,  however.  \"Mister\" ultimately prooves to Celie that he hates her by chasing Nettie out of her life,  and by allowing Celie (whose role is assumed by Whoopi Goldberg) to think that Nettie is dead,  thus killing the last shred of hope Celie had that anyone loves her.  What \"Mister\" didn't bank on though,  is the friendship that forms between Celie and his favorite girlfriend,  a juke-joint singer named Shug Avery (Margaret Avery).  Celie and Shug may not have a thing in common physically,  but spiritually,  they are sisters,  and Celie is loved once again. Goldberg shines as Celie.  Glover made me hate him,  so he did a terrific job too.  Avery was passionate and compassionate as Shug.  The ending will have you sobbing.",

            "content": "In cinema, the 1980s are remembered for their action-filled blockbusters, gross-out comedies and weepy romances, but the most awards and critical praise of the decade went to mature, moving and inspirational dramas. Now we were past the age of censorship in the classic era and the stylistic excess of the 60s and 70s, and now more than ever great stories were being done justice on the big screen. And yet, the decade was still conflicted enough for things to be done wrong. The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's beautiful 1982 novel, but was directed by prolific maker of blockbusters Steven Spielberg. The result is an unfortunate clash.This was the first time Spielberg had done an adult drama, but he had proved himself to be no stranger to deep and emotional touches, especially in E.T. However, for The Color Purple he comes across as overwhelmingly na\u00efve, splurging on shots that simply call attention to themselves, continually casting shadows or flashing close-ups before us. All this is to the detriment of story and character. Take for example the scene in which Sofia is arrested. The moment she hits the mayor is done tantalisingly with a close-up of her hand, followed by a long shot, with the actual deed obscured by a passing car. All very clever, but this isn't the time for the director to be clever, it's a moment for the actress to shine, yet Oprah Winfrey's performance is sold short by the arty camera-work. The staging in this scene is horribly corny too, with all the white folks standing in a circle wagging their fingers, like some pantomime act. As for the various attempts at humour, these largely fall into the slapstick category, such as Harpo repeatedly falling through the roof or people scrabbling to get away from Miss Millie's driving, and they are simply undignified and inappropriate for this picture.And it's a real shame, because the acting in The Color Purple is of the highest calibre, and we ought to be able to see it with greater clarity. Whoopi Goldberg has a demanding task because Celie is a woman of so few words. However Goldberg is able to convey so much with a gesture, a glance, or an enigmatic half-smile. It's clear she understands the character, constantly feeling Celie's thoughts, and yet retaining enough mystery in her performance to keep it interesting. Margaret Avery has wonderful passion, her presence filling the screen. Although Oprah Winfrey may be a little exaggerated sometimes in her movements, her expression and vocal delivery are commanding and heartfelt. Danny Glover is great too, making his character menacing and abhorrent without descending into caricature.Indeed, there's a lot of professionalism gone into this movie. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, with sharp foregrounds against misty backdrops. The musical score by Quincy Jones (and others) is a little overwrought at times but has some lovely melodies to it, and the song \"Sister\" is a lovely slice of laid-back jazz. And Spielberg has his good ideas too, making endearing little shots like the snowman in the background when Sofia is reunited with her family. And above all things the powerful words of Alice Walker shine through, telling us a truth that has a universal and timeless meaning. This motion picture version of The Color Purple has a lot wrong in its execution, and yet there is enough to its raw material to leave us with something of value.",

But than again, is there any director who has made nothing but excellent movies? I can't think of one, but if you do, please let me know. But let's talk about this \"The Color Purple\" now. I first saw it on DVD when I was looking for the movies \"Trois Couleurs Rouge / Blanc / Bleu\" and this one stood right behind them. I didn't know much about it, but after reading the text on the box, I was intrigued. I didn't buy it, but I decided to put it on my To See-list and now that it was finally shown on television, I immediately taped and watched it.The movie tells the story of Celie, a 14 year old black girl who lives in the early 1900's with her abusive father and her younger sister. She is pregnant for the second time from her own father and when immediately after giving birth, a man comes to ask for the hand of Nettie, her better looking sister, her father tells the man that he can't have the youngest, but that he wouldn't mind if he took Celie with him, saying that she is damaged goods, but still able to work hard. She goes with the man and nothing really changes in her life. The man is as abusive as her father and only thinks about another woman: Shug Avery. But when Shug finally arrives, a lot is about to change and it doesn't take long before Celie finally dares to stand up against everybody who has done her wrong in the past, finally taking her life in her own hands and doing everything to become happy...A movie that takes about two and a half hours to completely explain its story is something that you don't get too often and I'm sure that many people don't like it a bit. They want some easy entertainment that takes only 90 minutes to tell what it has to say and that's something that they certainly will not get in this movie. And yet it is worth waiting for the last second of the movie to come. At first, I didn't like this movie all that much either, not yet knowing that it would take that long, but when the credits were rolling over the screen, I knew it for sure: This too is one of the better Spielberg movies.Thanks to the interesting performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey,... this movie is more than just worth a watch. Especially Whoopi Goldberg surprised me in this one. Normally I'm not a great fan of her work, but in this movie she really showed a lot of talent. Also special was Danny Glover's performance. The man is best known for his role as Roger Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon movies and I must say that its nice to see him play that role, but it's also nice to see him play in a completely different kind of movie, in another kind of leading role. I saw him in \"Bat*21\" before and liked him in that movie, but in this film he was even a lot better, in his role as the abusive father. This time there was absolutely no humor around his performance or character, making it possible for the man to show that he's able to do a lot more with his talents than what most people know of him.Overall this is a very good drama that will probably not appeal to some people, just because of its length. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, because I'm already used to watch longer movies, but I'm afraid that several people will stop watching it after one hour and a half. And that's too bad, because you have to finish it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. I liked what I saw and give it a rating in between 7.5/10 and 8/10.",

A second film showing her struggle and triumphant return would have been more appropriate than the rushed ending. I want to see what happened to Celie to turn her into the confident returning heroine.Despite these flaws, the movie triumphs due to the great characters and fine acting.",

It was one of the most shameful acts they did (actually didn't do): Not a single award was given out of 11 nominations. Juxtapose this with a film a decade later; \"The English Patient\" (1996). Superbly directed by Anthony Minghella, it is still the only film to be nominated for 10 Oscars and win all 10. I am not taking anything away from that brilliant film. I only want to point out how bad racism is so deeply rooted, in all walks of life (even here in 1986). Regardless, in a couple of months, it will be the h35th anniversary of The Color Purple's release date (February 7th, 1985). Honor it.",

            "content": "Despite Whoopi Goldberg being a famous comedienne, she started her career off in this dramatic Spielberg film that everyone forgets about. It got 11 Oscar nominations and didn't win any of them. Now I know this is no guarantee of quality (witness Gravity's success this year) but that is a serious case of bad luck. Thankfully, the film is good enough to be worthy of it's somewhat lofty pedigree.It's all about the tragic life of a young black girl, born in the Deep South during the early 20th century. From the time she was a child, she was physically and sexually assaulted by her abusive father, and had two children courtesy of him (Both of which are taken away). Later, she is forced into marriage with a man who treats her like a domestic slave. Her only friends are her sister (Who she loses contact with soon after her wedding) and a traveling female singer with whom she has a somewhat um, intimate relationship with, for the period anyway...This is for the most part a rather depressing piece, as it relates the tale of the heroine through 30 miserable years. There are occasion chinks of light, but they're quickly snuffed out by her brute of a husband and the ever present racism back then. Only towards the end, do things start to look up. The auditions must have gone well, since every actor chosen gets under the skin of their character and never strikes a false note. Spielberg manages to involve us in the fates of all concerned, and when they experience tragedy or ecstasy, we feel it too. It's a fine film. Not sure what the title means though, despite it being explained in the movie itself... 7/10",

It seemed like he was just looking for more ways to make the audience cry.  Looking at it now that I'm older, I can't help but question Spielberg's involvement in this film.....could he have been truly sensitive and geniune to the plight of Blacks, being that he's white?

            "content": "Movies like this are very emotive & force you to confront your own attitudes towards the social convention issues presented in the movie - regardless of the historical period, modern thought or future implications.The part of this movie that I find fascinating as well as funny, is the part where 'Shug Avery' returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband, Grady. Oh the excitement of having two married ladies in one household is such an important step in the right direction for Shug that she can hardly contain herself....And when the reverend - who turns out to be Shug's father passes Mister's house, he really does pass by in disgust of seeing his wayward daughter. This is such a big let-down for Shug as she retorts, shows off her ring & presents herself as \"I's Married Now\" - \"I's Married' - as if that makes everything all right, but she was totally ignored by the reverend.I love those two scenes which are in the same segment. Why? Because it's unbelievably difficult to imagine that back then, poorer older, divorced or unmarried women with no kids, had no stability, no status & no way of earning a living let alone having a place to live by themselves, if they weren't working in 'brothels', or working as criminals, 'escorts' prostitutes or 'showgirls'. The only way out of poverty was marriage. That's not to say that women weren't allowed to earn their own money, but marriage put a 'worthy' 'spin' to the domesticity of a woman's life or lot. Without benefit of marriage, women were society's rejects. The only thing that gave women a real sense of importance was the marital status of being married - even if the men in your life do't think highly of you.Mister & Grady, were 'partying' all the time while trash talking their women in the room next door and in earshot or in front of 'the children'.What I also like about that segment or 'Act' as the theatres would call it, is, upon Shug & Grady's arrival, it's the only time you see Celie & Mister put on a united front to show that they 'both got colds'.Celie never did take the driving lessons that Shug promised her, and we never got to see the car again - ie: where it was kept or parked or when it was washed during Shug & Grady's stay with Cellie & Mister.",

When Celie and Nettie are first separated by Mistah (Nettie cries out, \"Why?!\"), when Shug goes to the mailbox and retrieves the letter, again when she presents the letter to Celie.  And of course...the ending. Truly beautiful.  Marked with controversy from the beginning, many black groups protested that the movie portrayed black men in a negative light.  Tina Turner was Speilberg's first choice for the role of Shug Avery, but she turned down the role stating that the role hit too close to her own life and felt it too painful to recreate.  Interesting.  Although we all know of the multiple nominations and no wins...but I do truly believe that there were some, that really should have won.  Cinematography, Art Direction, and Score.  The score was beautiful and incredibly moving.  Put that score up against the winner, Out of Africa, and you I bet you would remember Purple over Africa.  The acting nominees were up against some stiff competition that year, but they at least were deserving of the noms.  With its flaws, the movie still is one of my favorite top 5 of all time.

            "content": "From the director of Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark & E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, The Color Purple finds Steven Spielberg stepping away from his usual forte to try his hand at stories dealing with serious subject matters and although it isn't as refined & accomplished as his later features, it's still a brave attempt that's emotionally dense & powerfully moving at times.Set in rural Georgia during the early 20th century, The Color Purple centers on an oppressed black woman as she struggles through life enduring rape, incest, poverty, sexism & domestic violence but eventually finds her self-worth & identity with the help of two strong female companions. Her tale spans 40 years, covering the abuses she suffers and the transformation she undergoes.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film finds the visionary filmmaker outside of his comfort zone yet determined to broaden his area of expertise, and he makes fine use of his skillset to deliver a tale that's rich in emotions, characters & dramatic depth. A few trademarks still make their way into the final print, it even manages to find some humour in what's a discomforting experience, and it's well narrated.The era-appropriate props & rural location provide the story its required timeline, Cinematography makes controlled use of camera, color tones & lighting to capture each scene in wonderful detail, Editing begins the story on a gripping note but it starts wandering in the middle and is lethargic in the final hour, while its background score marks one of the rarest occasions when a Spielberg film wasn't scored by John Williams.Coming to the performances, The Color Purple packs a strong cast in Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Avery & Desreta Jackson. The film marks the acting debut for both Goldberg & Winfrey, and both ladies are terrific in their respective roles, especially Goldberg who is the heart & soul of this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is no slouch either and pretty much everyone does well with what they are given.On an overall scale, The Color Purple is an emotionally absorbing cinema that isn't an easy sit but what it puts on the screen is powerful, disturbing & thought-provoking stuff. Sure it's sentimental at times, runs a tad too long, and ends up overstaying its welcome, but it's also worthy of respect for what it attempts to bring to light. A scathing critique of sexism & a celebration of sisterhood, The Color Purple may not reverberate with all but it will nonetheless manage to leave its imprint on the viewers. Worth a shot.",

It's an exciting film, although the director makes a huge effort to avoid sentimentality (not always with success). Goldberg also shone, was totally at the level of the character in front of us, and proved to be extremely versatile, especially if we consider her to be an actress more accustomed to humor characters or a considerably more pronounced personality than Celie Johnson, a A woman clearly traumatized and accustomed to keeping her head down. Very different is the character who stunned the yet-unknown Oprah: Margaret Avery also came downstairs and knew what it was like to beat a man but her strong personality taught her to fight back. A final word for the scenarios, careful and detailed, appropriate to the time portrayed.",

At the time of its release, there was a huge outcry from the left wing elements of the African American Community that it negatively depicted a black man. Well, how many white men have been negatively depicted. Bad people come in all colors. Jerkdom is an equal opportunity employer. Danny Glover was superb as the man you love to hate. Whoopi Goldberg gives a career defining performance. Oprah Winfrey shows she could have been a superstar actress instead of a billionaire talk show host. Now, if you think actors work in a vacuum you know nothing about film, television or video. It takes a great director and an excellent actor to deliver a fantastic performance.

Around the age fifteen, her father forces her to marry a man just as abusive as he is to her. Celie is rather content about moving in with her new husband, Mister (Danny Glover), because she can remove her sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia), from her father's house. However, after Nettie lives in Mister's household for a short time with refusing his sexual needs, Mister kicks Nettie out. Celie's life becomes uneasy, as the only person that ever loved her is snatched from her. Nevertheless, her life makes a complete turnaround when Mister makes Celie take care of his ill mistress, Shug (Margret Avery), until she is well again.Celie suffers frequent abuse from the male figures in her life and she reacts by shutting down emotionally and being obedient to their needs. Many women in this movie are suffering from many types of abuse. The African-American male figures in The Color Purple, throw their masculinity around very often. They rape, and abuse black women, their wives, to make the women feel inferior. However, some try to overcome the abuse that is given to them; they try to show they are strong, black women that will stand for no man to put their hands on them. So Celie tries to find the strength and the willpower to overcome the abuse and find herself again. The movie The Color Purple, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a very appealing film to watch. It shows how so much pain is put into one person, Celie, over so many years that basically, that's all she knows and feels as though its normal. Then someone, Shug, comes in her life and teaches her love and the concept of the color purple, how you're suppose to enjoy life and not always be in pain. One viewer states that Celie \"has such a horrible life, she's not stopping to smell the roses, and she's just surviving.\" Eventually, Celie does learn to live, and to love life.",

            "content": "It begins in 1909 in Georgia and continues into the late 1930s. It tells of the coming-to-independence of several decades of a young African-American woman who lives through poverty of spirit and incredible abuse.Celie Harris (Desreta Jackson and Whoopi Goldberg) begins as a 14-year-old girl sexually abused by her father (Leonard Jackson). She has a son and a daughter by him, and they are immediately taken from her. Her 12-year-old sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia), is more conventionally pretty, and Celie fears what will happen to her. An older recent widower, Albert Johnson (Danny Glover), wants to marry Nettie but accepts Celie at her father's insistence.Albert, known throughout as \"Mister\" by Celie, is a brutal man who has passion only for his mistress, Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), a jazz singer whose father, Samuel (Carl Anderson), is the local minister. Celie becomes extremely submissive to avoid being beaten by Albert. When Nettie flees her father and comes to Albert and Celie, \"Mister\" tries to take advantage of her and throws her off the property when she resists. Celie and Nettie promise to write to each other, but Celie believes Nettie has died because she never receives a letter.A parallel story is that of Albert's son, Harpo (Willard Pugh), and his wife, Sofia (Oprah Winfrey). Harpo is not as brutal, and Sofia has a strong personality that dominates Harpo to Albert's disgust. Harpo and Sofia start a \"juke joint\" in the countryside where Shug sings. However, Sofia has a run-in with the mayor, after which she spends significant time in prison, which appears to break her spirit.Shug leaves Georgia for a time and returns a few years later with a new husband. While staying with Albert and Celie, Shug and Celie develop a close relationship. Celie also learns that Albert has been hiding letters from Nettie, who now lives in Africa, helping to care for the children of missionaries. These children are actually Celie's missing son and daughter.Through her relationship with Shug, Celie finally talks back to Albert and leaves with Shug, her husband, and Harpo's second wife. As the film rapidly closes, we learn how Celie finds new life, Shug reconciles with her husband, and Albert appears to come to his own epiphany.This is a very emotionally moving film, with wonderful performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, and Oprah Winfrey. Danny Glover plays a brutal man well. Unfortunately, there is some distraction because Steven Spielberg cannot avoid making an epic film. Sometimes the scenery does not match the reality of the life experience. Sometimes almost slapstick humor subtracts from the grim storyline. Some of the scenes in Africa are over-the-top static. Frankly, the movie should have been directed by someone like Spike Lee.",

Even so, and as with many more recent films, key plot point pass almost un-noticeable in a moment of muffled speech. Very frustrating to have to read a synopsis in real time to maintain understanding.The look, feel, and visuals, are excellent and Whoopi Goldberg deserved more awards then she received. A superb, stoic, controlled performance, ably supported by a fine ensemble. A word too for the 'young Celie'.I felt the overall pace was let down by the need to crush all the redemption into the last 20 minutes. It lacked credibility, given the pace and content of what had gone before. Would 'Mister' really pay for the transfer of Celie's family from Africa after all that had gone before? I think not.A great film for 2 hours and a feel good film for the last 25 minutes.",

            "review_title": "Steven Spielberg's powerful portrayal of abuse and racism",
            "content": "The South has had a tainted history, and it dates back at the pre-Civil War era when many African Americans fell victim to slavery and unsettling maltreatment. Even after slavery was abolished, the tension between whites and blacks still lingered and to extent, still lingers today. For a film dealing with a crucial subject like racism, an inspiring script and a director with wit and smarts is a must. Steven Spielberg gives a profound treatment, thought somewhat flawed, treatment on his riveting drama based on the acclaimed novel by Alice Walker. Though it doesn't scale the tower of Spielberg's other works, especially with this being his first effort on a serious topic; it's efforts to capture the heart and adornment of the viewers prove to be successful. Set in a rural town of southern Mississippi during the 1930s when Africam Americans were bare of civil rights, the film follows Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg), a young African Americna teenager growing up in poverty with her abusive father Albert (played by Danny Glover) who's impregnated her with a child, only to give it up for adoption. She finds some light in her tormented life with her sister Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) who lives with her for a short time, only to be exiled by Albert. For the next few decades, we follow Celiw as she struggles to discover her true identity while coping with relationships with her father's former lover Shug Avery (played by Margaret Avery) and her sister-in-law Sofia (played by Oprah Winfrey). When approached with the project, Steven Spielberg was initially skeptical about tackling this film due to his marginal knowledge of life in the Deep South. Ultimately, he changed his mind and what he brought to the screen to his brutally powerful drama granted by a performance by Whoopi Goldberg that only be described as profound, and even this feels like an understatement. She's astounding in her portrayal of the lead character, bringing her character from Alice Walker's novel to life, and the story progresses you can't help but experience concern for her character and the tyranny she endures from her father played by Danny Glover who succeeds his commitment to his cruel-hearted role. The film journeys through her life as she deals with racism, domestic abuse, incest, and a questionable relationship with her father's former lover. Spielberg handles these themes maturely and realistically, even when the film feels emotionally manipulative. These elements rarely feel forced. The depiction of the Southern culture in terms of their jazz music, spiritual lifestyle, and of course the racially charged society. The screenplay doesn't come without its flaws. While the story moves along safe standards, it tends to get a little clumsily in some places. In some sequences, the story either temporarily loses focus or feel weak, the best example lies in one scene of Celie discovering her homosexuality. Ultimately, the film overcomes its flaws through Steven Spielberg's intelligence and smart direction. The film may go on longer than necessary, clocking at 153 minutes; but overall there is plenty of more good to experience than cons. The Color Purple is both a riveting and inspiring work of art by Steven Spielberg, and boasts incredible performances by such a talented cast. Though not one of Spielberg's most memorable works, it still shows the universally acclaimed director as the brilliant mind he is. Many could debate whether or not he's handle this subject matter of racism here as maturely as he handles topics dealing with war in this other works. Nonetheless, the film strives a powerful edge.",

In fact, this film deals with strong subjects such as racism, poverty and sex discrimination. We can say that this motion picture has a strong anti-racist message.Despite being dramatic and touching, I don't see \"The Color Purple\" as a great movie. I personally think that the first half is much better than the second half. The first half is more sentimental, emotional and touching, while the second half is too boring.However, the best things about this movie are the beautiful sceneries and Whoopi Goldberg's performance (definitely one of her best, despite being one of her earliest roles).\"The Color Purple\" is one of the few movies entirely with black people. After all, it is about black people and it shows us very well how they were so badly treated in those times (this movie takes place between 1909 and 1947).While not one of Steven Spielberg's best achievements, it isn't however one of his worst films.However, after this Steven Spielberg made plenty of more serious movies, such as \"Empire of the Sun\", \"Schindler's List\" and others.",

Walker's work is raw, gritty, heartbreaking and powerful, written in the first person by Celie without an ounce of self-pity. I have read it several times, and it has never failed to move me.The following year, THE COLOR PURPLE came to the screen. A group of us from the English department went to see it. We were horrified by Spielberg's Disneyfied treatment of a work we all cherished. Between Spielberg and Menno Meyjes (who wrote the execrable screenplay), the original point of Walker's story was completely lost. What a waste! The film could have been magnificent in more competent hands, but its terrific casting, location, cinematography, and acting were all wasted on this saccharine and often incredibly dull, loose adaptation.My suggestion: Read the book before you watch the film. You'll be surprised by the difference in nearly every aspect.",

            "content": "The Color Purple is set at the turn of the 20th century and focuses on the relationship between two sisters facing extreme adversity. The acting in The Color Purple is what I believe makes this film stand out from other films of similar topics. Celie has meekness drilled into her, and Whoopi Goldberg portrays this concisely by constantly sheltering herself, her feelings, and most importantly her smile. Sofia, the character Oprah Winfrey plays, also is one of my personal favorite characters with her witty remarks, spiritedness, and capturing life throughout the movie. Both of these actors were able to effortlessly convey complex emotion ranging from oppression to freedom, and to despair to optimism. The lives that these women lead in the early 1900's are truly eye opening. They face prejudice and lack of control in their own lives that very few deal with today. The cast of The Color Purple is a very diverse one indeed, and has a wonderful array of talented actors to offer. I also believe that the choice to cast Oprah Winfrey as Sofia was very wise, as today she has become one of the most influential black women in the world. The film score is another element to this movie that I feel was very powerful. Quincy Jones did a remarkable job of strengthening the most powerful moments in the film, as well as beautifully complimenting the course of events throughout the story. I believe that most films are practically useless without music to back the action and this film is a perfect portrayal of that principal. All in all, the story that is portrayed in this film is truly moving and quite honestly somewhat disturbing at times, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt drama focused on overcoming adversity that wasn't though possible to overcome.",

Alice Walker wrote the book and did give the film her blessing. Treated like a star in this but not so famous is Margaret Avery who certainly acted like a queen. There are lesbian undertones between her and Goldberg.Spielberg's visual style is actually very similar to E.T. and the Indiana Jones movies. It goes from subtle to not so subtle and the protagonist Goldberg goes through an effective arc.She goes from a poor, defenseless, sweet girl to someone who has power once she discovers the letters her daughter's been writing to her has been hidden away from Glover. She even goes through another change when she sees her African children for the first time. She is believable even if the story at times is not believable.For instance, why would Glover keep those letters with his money box? He's quite the antagonist for Goldberg for most of this and picks up the wrong lessons from his father Adolph Cesare that partially explains his behavior. Still, blacks were treated like second class citizens and black men could only take it out of black women.But one that wouldn't have any of that is Oprah Winfrey who whoops her mate Harpo. But she becomes a sad victim of her blackness after getting jailed for hitting back a white man. Hard to say what her movie career would have been like because she truly became a force onto herself on her own TV show. In a small role one finds Lawrence Fishburn, who will become a major star in his own right.Was the happy ending a dream? Avery reunites with her preacher husband with a lot of song and dance. Glover arranges for Goldberg's kids to come without them knowing more than a few words of English. But it made the viewer feel good and for me, that's good enough.",

Honestly, I gave the film a 6 out of 10 because if you read the book, you would probably consider the film to be a downgrade and a snoozer, although it is a beautiful story. If we were rating the book, I would give it a 10. A major difference between the film and the novel, are the parts where Nettie discusses her time in Africa. In the film, Nettie's experience in Africa is shown very briefly although in the actual novel, her experience is written in numerous letters between Celie and herself. I believe that is a crucial part of the Color Purple because the differences between Africa and America are very important to the different areas of woman-ism, sexism and racism that was occurring during that time period. On the other side, the story of Celie being abused by a man who she thought was her father and going through the same abuse from her husband Mr.____ , also known as Albert, and then meeting Shug who inspires her in more ways than one to stand up for herself, is an amazing storyline.

And while I don't doubt his good intentions, I felt a little uneasy about the portrayal of African-Americans, which comes dangerously close to caricature at times. But I must say I was relatively engaged throughout, and invested in Celia's struggles. Schmaltz and sap can sometimes be effective, and I confess to getting a little choked up at times.

            "content": "The Color Purple outlines the life, marriage, friendships and family of Celie Johnson played by Whoopi Goldberg an African American women at the turn of the nineteenth century in the southern United States. Celie is essentially given to her husband she refers to as \"Mister\" or Albert Johnson. Albert is in need of a women to care for his children as he is widowed. Celie has great difficulties in life and relationships with the exception of her sister Nettie played by Akosua Busia. Celie evolves greatly within the film and develops strong relationships with other women in her life as she longs for her sister. Celie is determined to survive this life and frequently prays to God for help and salvation.Celie feels alone in her life with little enjoyment. Celie befriends her husband's mistress Shug Avery played by Margaret Avery and relies on her immensely to get through life with a husband she despises. Celie's step-son Harpo played by Willard Pugh marries Sophia played by Oprah Winfrey- Celie is ill prepared to give marital advice to Sophia as Celie only knows violence in her relationship. Celie silently observes her family around her and as she narrates the film allows movie goers know her thoughts. The Color Purple is racially charged as Sophia is punished for defending herself to a white man. Another movie that a deals with the injustice of racism is 42 a movie about Jackie Robinson. Different scenarios yet two people that overcame racism in pursuit to find happiness. The determination of the female characters- Celie, Nettie, Sophia and Shug to create a bond and a family in a time that was difficult for women and African Americans. The director used angles to zoom into times when Celie was so angry at Mister has she contemplated revenge on him. Along with the sound of sharpening the razor to shave Mister. Celie uses voice over narration during the film as her feelings and thoughts are not allowed to known to anyone but herself. This is impactful to the theme as Celie struggles to be a person in this film as she feels worthless and is conditioned not to speak for herself. The film is thought provoking and can even spark anger at the great injustices that take place throughout the film. Ultimately admiration arises for Celie as she develops as a person and friend all the while her prayers are answered.",

            "content": "Far from reaching the level of excellence of Alice Walker's original novel, the movie is still a good one, with great and heart-warming performances from Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery. When the movie was released in 1985, it was a very unusual thing with an all African-American cast and a story devoted completely to the lives of non-Caucasians in the US. \"The Color Purple\" is still in many ways a milestone and movie that deserves being watched.",

            "content": "I saw this film the year it was released. A truly powerful film with such a great story to tell. The challenge of being a woman & African American, living in a time where slavery remained a distant memory & where woman could be kept under control so easily. The unfolding of power and the challenges along the way. The character played by Oprah showing only too clearly how black people had to remember their place. The importance of music & food & culture to hold people together through challenges. When I watched the film again last night, I could not remember when I had seen it last. Certainly more than 20 years ago. Still brilliant. Still with powerful messages for all. And the final message remains that it is never to late to change, to claim what is yours or to act with integrity.",

            "review_title": "Spielberg surprises me",
            "content": "The Color Purple is one of Spielberg's best films.  How amazing to see this movie from the same director of Return of the Jedi  and Indiana Jones. He proves that he can actually make movies that matter, though he could conceivably have done a better job representing Alice Walker's masterpiece. Still, one has to question whether any white male could have done a better job telling a black woman's story.The story is a harshly beautiful account of the inner strength and spirit of a woman.  Celie leads a rough life of drudgery, undervalue, and abuse until her husband's lover, Shug, shows her the way to love and to God.  The two women share a poignant romance in the novel that is downplayed in the film, yet still holds much meaning.  Instead of the passion felt in the novel, the movie transforms the relationship into more of an intellectual and spiritual journey.  The two women unite against their struggles, ask questions, and find the answers, learn to love, and learn to cope.  Shug gently teaches Celie about life's truths, and shows her `the color purple,' tangible evidence of God.  Most importantly, though Shug teaches Celie to love herself, transforming her from a downtrodden workhorse to a self-sufficient, self-supporting, strong woman.Though the film stays somewhat true to the themes of the book, it does downplay the feminist undertones somewhat.  Spielberg perhaps makes Celie's husband into a more believable person, and I certainly felt sympathy for him and saw where he was coming from, but it was sympathy that shouldn't have been there.  The movie provided the men with excuses to treat the women the way they did-excuses that were not given to them in the novel.  Spielberg undermines the destructive role of the men in the film, and in so doing, fails to maintain the feminist mood.  The focus changes more from gender, the main focus of the book, to color in the movie.Still, overall, Spielberg surprised me with a wonderful film.  The cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was fabulous.  Whoopi Goldberg performed better than I've ever seen her, Danny Glover was incredible, and Oprah Winfrey was superb.  I was able to completely see from each character's perspective better than in the novel.  I wish I had been able to see the movie in 1985, when my perception of the actors had not yet been so pronounced.  Seeing it now, when each has led a distinguished career, I did find it a little bit more difficult to separate the actors from their characters.  This was definitely a new picture of Goldberg for me, but she did an excellent job.  In spite of my preconceptions, I loved the film.I would give this movie a nine out of ten.  I definitely recommend this movie, but watch it with a box of tissues, and nothing but waterproof mascara.  No one can come way unchanged from such a touching, moving, and beautiful portrayal of one woman's resiliency, courage, and hope.  It's a classic.",

            "review_title": "Classic Film, Overly Sentimental",
            "content": "This film will always be a classic. However it suffers at the hands of 'the Spielberg effect'.Character development - there are inconsistencies in the character arc of Glover's Albert; one moment the menacing bully and the next comically bumbling and hapless. Some of the more slapstick comedy moments shoehorned in are out of place with the somber subject matter and is jarring. Celie's own character development is also inconsistent, afraid to speak around Albert most of the time but suddenly happy to sit smugly watching him fumbling in the kitchen and hurting himself (in real life he would almost certainly have taken out his frustration on her and she would at least try and stay out of his way).The soundtrack is sweeping and beautiful, but overly sentimental, almost cheesy. The jazz works well.This film takes a gritty subject matter and makes it all glossy and pretty.That being said it is highly enjoyable and well acted. I've not read the book so can't comment on that but it feels like fiction to me.",

            "content": "This film is a great portrayal of Alice Walker's the Color Purple. I remember upon studying the novel at A level, being shocked at the level of violence that women like Celie had to endure. I was very glad that the film didn't water this down. To have done so would be a grave insult to the women worldwide who had to suffer this treatment.Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut in the Color Purple and she was great in her role as the grown-up Celie. I've always liked how she can bring a naturalness and realism to her acting. The Color Purple is no exception. Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/ykObxL",

            "content": "The Color purple is story narrated by the main character(Celie). I gave this film a 5 out of 10 since i read the book. The book is more descriptive and offer more of a plot. In both the book and movie it shows Celie's struggle to achieve her goals. They showed the sexism, how women hood play a part in her success, and child abuse.Some important parts in the book aren't shown in the movie, in the book Alice Walker uses imagery which allowed me picture Nettie's explanation to Celie about things going on in Africa, which allows for deeper insight about Nettie's experience in Africa. Also Celie is abused by a man who she thought was her father and going through the same abuse from her husband Mr.____ , also known as Albert throughout the book and movie. One thing movie excluded was how Mr.___, tried to be reacquaint himself with Celie or how they thought Nettie died on the way back to America.Ramon Martinez-Period 7",
