            "content": "Although my personal favorite among Errol Flynn's films is The Sea Hawk, most will argue that his career role was this one in The Adventures of Robin Hood. It certainly has a deserved enduring popularity that's lasted for generations.Just about every version of the Robin Hood legend from Douglas Fairbanks's silent classic to the one in 1997 with Kevin Costner, deals with the same story facts. A young nobleman, deprived of his lands and title by Prince John and his cohorts, takes to Sherwood Forest and gathers a band which practices their own form of financial leveling. Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor until the day comes when good King Richard the Lionhearted comes back from the Crusades and sets things right.Were there ever a more attractive and idealistic a pair of young lovers on the screen than Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland? If there were, I'd be hard pressed to name them. They did eight films together from 1935 to 1941 and this one is probably the best. Errol all dash and charm and shy and retiring Olivia who just lights up the screen with beauty and romance.Directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley photographed this in some gorgeous technicolor. And they put together an almost perfect cast. You can't tell at all which scenes were directed by Curtiz and which by Keighley so seamless is the film's fabric.The small roles are truly memorable. The best comic moments in the film come from Melville Cooper, the not quite so bold Sheriff of Nottingham and from Herbert Mundin and Una O'Connor as Much the Miller's Son from Robin Hood's band and DeHavilland's maid. Herbert Mundin was the first one in this cast to die, he was killed in an automobile accident just two years after this film was finished. He was a funny little man who played nervous types, a kind of English Don Knotts. But in what was probably his career role, he literally decides the fate of English history here in a superb act of bravery. We expect bravery and courage from the Errol Flynns on the screen, but Mundin's performance shows the virtue can be found in some of us you wouldn't expect. His is my favorite performance apart from the leads.Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains make a superb pair of villains as Prince John and Guy of Gisborne. Rains covets the throne and Rathbone covets Olivia. They both provide the right touch of menace and make their performances real.As I write this Olivia DeHavilland is the last surviving member of this classic film. During her career she fought hard with her studio to get roles where she would be more than the crinoline heroine waiting for her man to finish his brave deeds. She knew her worth and talent and got a pair of Oscars to prove it.Back in the day DeHavilland dismissed films like The Adventures of Robin Hood. But several years back she attended a revival of both The Adventures of Robin Hood and Dodge City two very different type films she did with Errol Flynn.As she watched it she saw the reverence and respect the audience had for both of these classics. When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now, she was real proud to have been associated with these films.You have every reason to be proud Olivia. And we're real proud of you.",

            "content": "Michael Curtiz received only a single Academy Award for directing the best of wartime espionage movies \"Casablanca\" but made great classics like \"Captain Blood\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"The Sea Hawk\" and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\" orchestrating enthusiastically great stars and skilled technicians... He refined with charm and elegance plot and character with fluid camera movement and exquisite lightning, mixing action with peculiar sense of humor capturing with brilliant photography the natural look of Sherwood Forest, the cool tones of Nottingham Castle and the inn at Luton with its crackling fireplace...The film had great marvelous scenes: When Robin decides to tackle with a staff Little John (Alan Hale); Robin's swordsplay with the gallant Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette); Robin and his Forest outlaws giving a warm welcome to Lady Marian and to the treasure's wagon lead by Sir Guy and the High Sheriff ; The Archery Tournament; Robin's Merry Men entering Nottingham Castle; and the magnificent final duel, with a masterful score, between Robin & Sir Guy... Errol Flynn was the best swashbuckler of the sound era... He was ideally cast as the Saxon knight Sir Robin of Locksley who became a rebel outlaw robbing the rich to feed the poor... With his Merry Men he saved Saxon England against Norman ambitions... His most frequent enemies were the noisy High Sheriff of Nottingham (Melvin Cooper), the evil Bishop of Black Canon (Montagu Love), the eloquent chief conspirator Sir Guy of Gasbourne, and Prince John...Flynn's splendid figure 'leaping, jumping, scaling and swinging' made him a great leader of men sheltering the old and the helpless... He was a romantic hero 'twinkling' with malice, gallantly courting the exquisite Olivia De Havilland... Olivia De Havilland was a pretty and delicate woman in love with a brave and reckless outlaw...Basil Rathbone, superb as the arrogant Sir Guy of Gisbourne, spreads terror by torturing, rivaling Robin for Lady Marian...Claude Rains was the treacherous prince John who orders his Norman knights to oppress the helpless Saxons suffocating them with thefts, and burning their farms... He vows that Robin must be captured...Winner of 3 Academy Awards (Art Direction, Original Score and Film Editing) \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a delighted tale of high adventure, a tale of action and colorful pageantry, a great film for all the family...",

            "content": "How does one start a commentary on such a perfect specimen of film making? Is this exaggeration. I think not.Every aspect and element of the movie is absolutely top of the line in the cinematic Arts & Sciences. Once again, where to start? Casting is so important. Who could find a better line up of Actors than this. Starting with Errol Flynn. Never was there a better screen Robin Hood; not Douglas Fairbanks, not Richard Green, not even Kevin Costner. Mr. Flynn was sure a handful for the studio in real life and a lot of this surely rubbed of on his screen persona. Added to a great Athletic ability, probably a natural athlete.* Next, we have delicately, beautiful Olivia de Havilland who brings not only her feminine pulchritude to the movie, but also an innate sense of class and intelligence too. Her Lady Marion was much more than a helpless female. Was she a damsel in distress? Oh, most surely she was that, but not a screaming, whiny helpless girl.Basil Rathbone (Sir Guy of Gisbourne) was perhaps the best villain in the business. Next to his characterization of Sherlock Holmes in all those films (and some Radio & TV work as well), as well as being a top fencer. Ironic it is that this master swordsman lost so many screen duels with the likes of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power (THE MARK OF ZORRO).Claude Rains as Prince John gave th story a somewhat foppish, prim and prissy version of a Bad Monarch, which this future King John surely was. His type of person could never do some of the assignations and executions that he ordered, but saw no difficulty or remorse in ordering underlings to do so.The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British Actors in Hollywood or a role call of regular Warner Brothers players. Just consider the following: Melville Cooper (Sheriff of Nottingham) Una O'Conner , Alan Hale (Little John**), Eugene Palette (Friar Tuck), Patric Knowles (Will Scarlet) and so on and so forth, en ad infinitum! To these talents add the great sets and the forest of the Pacific Northwest. They had such great Castles, Towns and Tournament Fields. And how could simple B & W film do any justice to the beautifully tailored, multi hued costuming. This is Technicolor Work at its very best! Please let's not go any further without remembering our sense of hearing, or namely the musical score. The theme (Overture) and the incidental music by Erich Wolfgang Kornkold is at once classical, exciting and multi-faceted. It plays no small role in moving the story along as well as underscoring action, danger, solemnity and even humorous moments. It belongs right up there with compositions by some of the guys like Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikowsky, Chopin, Rossini, etc. (you get the idea!).A well written, tight, intelligent script was the foundation for this once in a lifetime true work of Art. When a fine script meets able talent in the Director's chair the two elements act to make the final product even better and better and better.............* Errol Flynn was a member of the 1928 0r 1932 Australian Olympic Boxing team, a talent that no doubt, made him a candidate for the Lead in GENTLEMAN JIM four years later.** Alan Hale, an all purpose supporting player who portrayed a tremendously wide variety of types. From Mongol Chieftan Kaidu in MARCO POLO to James Cagney's Father in THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE. He must have really liked portraying Little John, for he was the Big Quarter Staff Man in Douglas Fairbanks' silent screen ROBIN HOOD(1922),a role he re prised not only for this picture but also for ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FORSET (1950).",

            "review_title": "In like Flynn - the ultimate Sherwood classic",
            "content": "This film *is* the Robin Hood of the screen: it's merry and witty, tender and bold, impudent, dashing and brightly clad... and an undoubted legend in its own lifetime! I recently had the chance to see it in the cinema for the first time, with the release of the remastered print, and wondered if it could possibly hold up to televised childhood memories. The joyous answer is that indeed it does. It's not only the breathtaking adventure I remembered; it's a fiery and surprisingly gentle romance that isn't afraid of laughs.It's unthinkable, once you've seen it, to imagine this film with anyone other than Errol Flynn. Every subsequent interpreter has had to struggle to reclaim the part from the memory of his roguery and grace - and most modern 'Robin's have been handicapped by an insistence on authentic mediaeval murk and grime. In the 1930s, with Technicolour the latest craze, mud and homespun were the last thing a studio wanted. Flynn's Robin Hood sports the Lincoln green of legend and a forest as brightly coloured as a painted backdrop, and the rich furs and silks on show at Nottingham Castle are straight out of fairy-tale; or an illuminated manuscript.The story itself is purest escapist magic. Greedy barons, a wicked usurper, a rightful king in exile, and a proud beauty in distress... and, of course, England's eponymous outlaw hero, robbing the rich to give to the poor with a jest on his lips in true swashbuckler style. The script sparkles. And the stunts, in those days before wire-fu or CGI, are all for real and still take the breath away. Flynn was in superb physical condition at the time - co-star Basil Rathbone, who played his proud opponent and would-be suitor to Marian's hand, Guy of Gisbourne, described him simply as 'a perfect male animal' - and misses no opportunity to show off his flamboyance.Unlike today's pretty-boy heroes, however, Flynn shows a surprising talent for acting with his face alone. The expressive reaction shots throughout his boudoir scene with Marian tell a different tale to the quickfire banter of his words, and, like Marian, despite ourselves we are drawn in. Olivia de Havilland, as Marian, is somewhat ill-served by her period costume - she is at her most beautiful in this scene, without her hair confined in her wimple - but together they duel their way through a classic tempestuous romance of the high-born lady and the outlaw, ultimately risking their lives to save each other. Marian is no anachronistic action heroine, but no-one, not even Robin, can keep her from what she thinks is right.As Guy of Gisbourne, Basil Rathbone is also playing one of the landmark roles of his career, and gives a superb performance. His Gisbourne is no cardboard villain, but a clever, arrogant man, who matches wits and blades with Robin as a worthy rival, and whose courtship of Marian is not without grace. And his wily master, rufous Plantagenet Prince John (Claude Rains, in a small but well-cast part) is no fool either. He knows precisely what he wants and what he can get away with, wasting no time in bluster or empty threats.Comedy of a broader nature is provided by the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and by Bess, Marian's maid. But even Bess's farcical courtship with timid Much (she has buried more husbands than he has had kisses) is not without its tender moments, and perhaps only the Sheriff is entirely a cut-out figure of fun.Few people can whistle 'the theme from Robin Hood'. But the famous Korngold score, with its full orchestral depth and rousing fanfares, is as familiar today as it was seventy years ago, when it won its Academy Award. From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel, when Robin and Gisbourne meet \"once too often\", this picture richly deserves its reputation as *the* Robin Hood on film - from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned.",

Errol Flynn,by far gives the most credible performance of the Robin Hood character.He oozes charm and wit,here.This film is a great trip back to a special time in movie making when we didn't need extreme sex and violence to entertain us.Now that I have seen it,this movie definitely goes on my video shelf.If you have children,or if you love to feel like one,as I do,I highly suggest you give this a look.Great film.",

            "content": "This is the definitive version of Robin Hood and helped elevate Errol Flynn to mega-stardom. That's because everything is so perfect about this film, as Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops and spared no expense to make one of the greatest action-adventure films of all time.The cinematography is stupendous for 1938, having the richest and brightest colors available at that time. Some may find the boldness of the colors a bit odd, but I love it as it makes it look \"better than real-life\"--like a fantasy world.The music is amazing--bold, exciting and grand. Subtle? Nah. For this film it's lots of fanfare and a grandness that perfectly match the film.The cast is amazing...absolutely amazing. They gave Flynn the best and most perfect lady for his love in the form of Olivia DeHavilland. This was a very good choice, as she starred in Flynn's breakout film, CAPTAIN BLOOD just three years earlier and she radiated beauty as well as goodness! Heck, after seeing her, I fell in love with Ms. DeHavilland the first time I saw this! Along with her, practically all the best supporting actors were provided. For the baddies, we had Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone and as for the heroes, we had Eugene Palette (yeah), Patric Knowles, Ian Hunter and many other fine actors. Plus, for once, Una O'Connor was able to give a subtle and restrained performance--not the shrieking idiot she played in films like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN! Oh, and of course, lest I forget, Errol Flynn in the lead--a perfect blending of manliness, sex appeal and athleticism! He was born to play this part and no one comes close to him in his interpretation of the character.So with all these ingredients, excellent writing and direction were combined to create a masterpiece. Fun, exciting and timeless. This is one great film.FYI--Historically speaking, \"Good King Richard\" was NOT a nice guy, but in fact one of the cruelest and most horrid kings of England. He hated ruling and got his kicks killing people in battle as well as murdering innocents and plundering their cities. Why he was chosen in ROBIN HOOD and IVANHOE to be a hero makes no sense at all if you know your history.",

His ambitious and evil brother Prince John (Claude Rains) takes over the throne and oppress the Saxons increasing the taxes and hanging those that cannot afford to pay.

When he meets Lady Marian (Olivia de Havilland), they immediately fall in love with each other. But Robin Hood and his men are hunted down by Sir Guy and the notorious Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper).\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a nostalgic and delightful adventure, in a naive version of the outlaw hero. It certainly is one of the most delightful adventures ever made in Hollywood. Errol Flynn is amazing in the role of the cynical outlaw Robin Hood and Olivia de Havillnd shows a perfect chemistry. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" should be mandatory for the youngest generations to see how to make a wonderful film without CGI.

The adventure is fast-paced, the editing is crisp and the direction fully competent. The film looks stunning with lovely scenery, gorgeous Technicolour and beautiful cinematography. Swashbuckling legend Errol Flynn gives possibly his best performance as the handsome, brave, gallant and charismatic Robin Hood, and Olivia De Havilland is lovely as ever as Maid Marian, and I felt their romance was very believable. I have to mention the villains, Prince John being played with real demeanour by Claude Rains and a more suave, haughty and charismatic Guy of Gisborne is played wonderfully by Basil Rathbone. The sword fights are energetic and fun, especially the climatic one between Robin and Sir Guy, the dialogue has plenty of wit to amuse kids and adults and Korngold's music score is absolutely superb. Truly terrific, definitely one of a kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Relevant in every department. Acting to start with. Errol Flynn was not considered a great actor, never an Oscar nomination or anything like that. Bette Davis was always frustrated for having to work opposite him rather that Laurence Olivier. But, look at him now, 80 years later - Erroll Flynn' s performance is as fresh today as the day he filmed it. Compare that with Oscar winner Russell Crowe's Robin Hood (2010) - Russell Crowe even had the impertinence of mocking Erroll Flynn's version. This bit of tribia kuind of depressed me after the high of seeing again this Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here, everything works. Other than Erroll Flynn - even if when's he is on the screen is difficult to pay attention to anyone else - we do. Mostly because Claude Rains, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and the rest of the sensational cast.

            "content": "The other early romanticism take on the Robin Hood legend, aside from the silent Douglas Fairbanks version. This one puts famed Hollywood hell raiser pirate Errol Flynn in the title role of Robin Hood. As would be expected of that scoundrel/scallywag Flynn's famous devil-may-care-heroics, the Flynn Robin Hood outrightly refuses to support Prince John when he commits what Robin views as treachery - trying to get himself made king and abusing the land and the people in what may or may not be the aftermath of his older brother King Ricahrd the Lion-Hearted's death while battling in the crusades. After nearly getting killed by John and Gisbourne's men, Robin goes on the run, with Will Scarlet and along the way acquiring Much, Little John, a cantankerous Friar Tuck, and a whole army of merry men in tights. From there, he becomes the great outlaw we all know and love, fighting Gisbourne, the bumbling Sheriff and Prince John anyway which way he can and sweeps that adorable sweetie pie Maid Marion off her feet.Sure the costumes may look fake today and the film itself overly colorful, but it's still a fun time. Sure Errol Flynn doesn't have a well articulated British accent either, but at least he doesn't sound like he's from the heart land of America. Flynn is certainly a lot quicker on his feet than Kevin Costner was, which comes in handy when you're in a duel to the death. Basil Rathbone is a fairly menacing Gisbourne, smarter than the Robert Addie or Michael Wincott versions (he looks kind of like Christopher Lee), and Olivia de Havilland is a very pretty Marion without being overly sexual and slutty about it (as was the case with many leading ladies back then). Out of the versions I've seen this is probably the only one where the Sheriff is an idiot and Gisbourne is the real menace (Gisbourne died early in the Kevin Costner verison of Robin Hood, and on TV's \"Robin of Sherwood\" he was just this weird neurotic guy, and I'm afraid I don't remember the Patrick Bergin version of Robin Hood very well).There are least five big action sequences here, namely Robin's two escapes from Nottingham, an ambush in Sherwood Forest and the climax between Robin's & King Richard's men at Nottingham castle. Naturally, there is a duel to the death that features shadows on the wall going at it while the actors are off screen. Good stuff, especially for the children.",

            "content": "Possibly the greatest (and most celebrated) of swashbucklers, it's also the best Robin Hood film (once again improving on Douglas Fairbanks' already impressive Silent version) and Errol Flynn's finest hour: delightful script (not only providing several great lines for the actors to sink their teeth into - Claude Rains' Prince John in particular - but it's put in the service of a plot which remains absorbing despite its over-familiarity), beautiful three-color cinematography (by no less than three top-notch cameramen!) and costumes, an outstanding and Oscar-winning Erich Wolfgang Korngold score (he virtually composed all of Flynn's swashbucklers and some of the best Warner Bros. films from this period), expansive sets (Hollywood credibly standing in for 12th century England - Carl Jules Weyl's art direction receiving another Oscar, with a third going to Ralph Dawson's exciting editing).It might well be the epitome of Hollywood entertainment during its golden era with the colorful legendary characters - all flawlessly enacted by one of the best casts ever brought together for one film - supplying comedy (and not just that involving Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin, which I didn't find as icky as I remembered it!), drama and romance (Flynn and Olivia De Havilland's Maid Marian not only are cinema's last word on this famous fictional couple, but their pairing here also proved to be the highpoint of their lengthy on-screen collaboration which stretched to 8 films); not forgetting, of course, countless unforgettable and stirring action scenes: the ambush in Sherwood Forest, the contest for the Golden Arrow, Robin's escape from the gallows, the final storming of the castle (highlighted by one of the best-remembered duels ever to grace the silver screen between Flynn and Basil Rathbone's Guy of Gisbourne), etc. Interestingly, three actors - Rathbone, Eugene Palette and Montagu Love - would go on to co-star together again in another equally renowned swashbuckler, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940; which I also just rewatched): Love, then, can be seen as well in yet one more similar film - the definitive 1937 version of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (which is forthcoming on DVD from Warners as part of a \"Literary Classics Collection\" and coupled with its inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake); incidentally, all of these classics virtually constitute the three top titles in the entire swashbuckling genre! Curiously enough, the film was started by William Keighley (apart from having helmed the Flynn swashbuckler THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER [1937], he had been responsible for Warners' previous venture into three-strip Technicolor GOD'S COUNTRY AND THE WOMAN [1937]). However, studio executives were dissatisfied with how the action sequences had turned out and summarily handed the film over to Michael Curtiz - who had directed Flynn in his two most popular vehicles up to this point, CAPTAIN BLOOD (1935) and THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (1936); neither he nor Flynn, apparently, were happy with this decision as they despised one another: nonetheless they made all of 12 films together, several of them bona-fide classics.In the end, this has certainly made me want to pick up the \"Errol Flynn Signature Collection\" (also featuring a documentary on the notorious star) a.s.a.p. - especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)! Needless to say, there have been scores of films about this popular character and, going by the IMDb, apart from the afore-mentioned 1922 Douglas Fairbanks ROBIN HOOD, I've also watched the following: THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN (1952; a live-action Walt Disney version), SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1960; a Hammer Films effort directed by Terence Fisher and co-starring Peter Cushing as the Sheriff of Nottingham!), ROBIN HOOD (1973; the Disney animated feature), ROBIN AND MARIAN (1976), ROBIN HOOD (1991; TV) and ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991). Still, the IMDb listings appear to be incomplete, as at least the first two among those I would like to watch are omitted: THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1946), ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1950; Alan Hale's third and last stab at the character of Little John, following those of the 1922 and 1938 classics!), THE MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1954; if only because it's directed by Val Guest), ROBIN AND THE 7 HOODS (1964; a musicalized version featuring The Rat Pack and reset to 1920s Chicago), A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD (1967; another Hammer Films variation), L'ARCIERE DI FUOCO (1971; a \"Euro-Cult\" obscurity directed by Giorgio Ferroni and starring Giuliano Gemma) and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (1993; the inevitable Mel Brooks spoof which, amazingly, I've yet to catch up with in its entirety!).",

Greatest adventure of the centuries \u00a1 , greatest thrill of the screen \u00a1 an adventure the world has thrilled to for centuries , in a picture it will never forget . He lives again , a hero of every villain , friend to those who have friends . In 13th century England , dashing Robin (Errol Flynn) and his band of marauders confront corruption of wicked Guy Gisbourne ( Basil Rathbone at his evil best ) and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power , foiling evil Prince John ( arguably Claude Rain's greatest character). When the Norman Lords begin oppressing the Saxon masses in King Richard's absence , a Saxon archer named Robin Hood ( Errol Flynn at his swashbuckling best ) fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army . The legendary Sherwood forest's hero Robin Locksly again and Lady Marian (lovely Maid Olivia De Havilland) along with his Merrie men brought by him : Will Scarlett (Patrick Knowles) , Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette) and Little John (Alan Hale). Story is indirectly based on historic events and is developed after third Crusade when Richard Lion Heart (Ian Hunter) conquered Acre . In route England Richard was captured by Leopold II of Austria and ransomed by his own subjects . But Richard returns England to put down a revolt against him though his brother John without Land takes over the kingdom with his underlings evil Sir Guy of Gisbourne and Sheriff of Nottingham .This swashbuckler has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , adventure , romance , outstanding final dueling and is pretty entertaining . There are great action sequences including the battles in forests and the ending confrontation at the climax of the film . Casting is frankly magnificent , the famous main players as stalwart Errol Flynn is very fine and Olivia De Havilland is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate heroine . They are backed up by excellent support actors as Alan Hale , Una O'Connor , Herbert Mundin and Ian Hunter . Special mention to treacherous Guy Gisborne magnetically performed by Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as evil and crazed king in a sensational interpretation as Prince John . Even the smallest characters are well represented as Montagu Love , Melville Cooper , Robert Warwick , among others . Breathtaking and stirring soundtrack by the classic by Erich Wolfgang Korngold who deservedly earned an Academy Award . Colorful cinematography in glimmer Technicolor by Sol Polito ant Tony Gaudio . Impressive lavish sets and overwhelming art direction also won an Oscar . Musical score , settings , cinematography , great performances abound , all of them help place this classic movie the very best adventure film . I found it fun , entertaining , thrilling , well-acted, and fast-paced . The motion picture is magnificently produced by Hal B. Wallis and stunningly directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley .The film is partially based on true events. Although Ivanhoe didn't exist, John Lackland was king of England from 1199 to 1216. Few monarchs have been subject to such appalling publicity as John . Although by no means lovable, he was an able administrator and spent more time in England than his predecessor and elder brother Richard I but he was jailed by Leopold of Austria, returning from Crusades. Being dead king Henry II , then Richard Lionheart was crowned until the third crusade (intervening along with Philip II and vanquished Acre) which was crowned John with no Land . The English domain over France will cause length conflict known the hundred years wars(1339-1453).Robin Hood, also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom, is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations . If Robin Hood did exist, it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon , though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland.Other versions about this famous personage are the following : \u00a8Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) \u00a8 by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freenan , the same year was exhibited \u00a8Robin Hood\u00a8 by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation . Furthermore , recent and revisionist version titled \u00a8Robin Hood\u00a8(2010) by Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe , Cate Blanchet and Oscar Isaac .",

            "content": "When King Richard is captured while abroad, his treacherous brother Price John uses the situation as his opportunity to seize the title for himself. With his wicked ways he oppresses the people, boosts taxes, hangs those who refuses to pay them and generally rules with an iron fist. Out of this situation a hero arises, Sir Robin of Locksley, who forms a band of outlaws to disrupt the actions of Prince John's men and steal the money back that they have stolen from the citizens of the land. However with Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham, Prince John makes plans to capture Robin and make an example out of him \u0096 but they've got to find him first!This film often sits high on many critics' lists along side many films that would be considered worthy because they would be called 'art' or generally be classic films in the traditional sense; indeed this film also sits high on the top 250 list on this site \u0096 and long may it continue to do so! Although this film is hardly the sort of stuff that the high-brow critic would pick in his top 100 list, the fact that it usually appears there says a lot for just how good it is \u0096 not as a classic and deep piece of art but as a really enjoyable adventure film. We all know the basic story and the film sticks to it well \u0096 although to be honest I can never remember if I know it from this film or from the legend itself! The plot is engaging but it is the manner of delivery that makes this film so much fun to watch.The action is hardly groundbreaking (how could it be after 60+ years?) but given that it isn't based on effects, it has stood up really well and is enjoyable to watch \u0096 it's an overused term but the action here is what I would define as 'swashbuckling' fun! For my money the even better aspect of the film is that it manages to take this vein of good clean fun and run it through the entire film. Most enjoyably for me was the dialogue that was often laugh out loud funny \u0096 some lines were hardly of the period but were funny none the less! Outside of the comedy in the dialogue, the film manages to retain the sense of fun in all but the odd darker scene. This sense of fun is passed through (and sustained by) the performances, which are led by a typically cocksure (pardon the pun) Errol Flynn. He plays Robin larger than life, and rightly so. He is tremendous fun in the lead and he is major part of making sure it all comes off. Rains has a minor role but he is not a straight bad guy and has a strange humour about it \u0096 he may not have the ham that Alan Rickman would later bring to the role but he does it very well nonetheless. Playing a more traditional bad guy was Basil Rathbone \u0096 a good actor and made all the more enjoyable performance for me because I rarely see him in anything but the Holmes movies. De Havilland is pretty but doesn't make much of an impression as Marion but luckily Robin's merry men are roundly good with fun performances from Pallette, Hale, Knowles and others.Overall this is a great film \u0096 not because the story is really deep or the special effects are astounding but simply because it is a really fun (and funny) swashbuckling adventure. With a real sense of fun running though the script, the cinematography (and wondrous Technicolor), the dialogue and the performances this film has stood up effortlessly over the past 60+ years and it will continue to do for long after my generation are dead and buried and other ones come to discover it.",

            "review_title": "Vintage Errol Flynn film, probably the best film he made and his best role and performance",
            "content": "This is one of the best films of the year 1938. There will be spoilers ahead:Warner Brothers did films like The Adventures of Robin Hood extremely well and Robin Hood was an \"A\" picture for them. It shows on the screen, in the details. The sets and the costumes are extraordinary, the cinematography is beautiful, the script is excellent and the cast is peppered with talent, even in the lesser roles. Special mention must be made with regard to two aspects of the film that are as significant as anything else-the technical work behind the archery and the fencing. Howard Hill was the archery expert and is in the film in a bit role as one of the archers Robin contends with in the archery contest. The archery is breathtaking in the film. The fencing consultant, if I recall correctly, was Fred Cavens and the fencing is likewise remarkable, particularly the scenes between Basil Rathbone and Flynn.The Robin Hood plot is well-known, so I'll give it a bare-bones sketch here. King Richard is taken hostage and his brother, Prince John, assumes control from the regent. John and his Norman allies begin to squeeze and oppress the Saxons.A Saxon noble, Robin Hood, organizes an opposition the Prince John's despotic rule. His band of followers take to Sherwood Forest and regularly are a thorn in the Normans' sides. Various scrapes and close calls occur, Richard ultimately returns to England and is restored to the throne and John and his followers are banished from the kingdom for the remainder of Richard's life and all's well.Standout performances (apart from the two leads, Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, whose chemistry is magnificent) include Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne. Alan Hale, Sr. as Little John, Eugene Palette as Friar Tuck and Claude Rains as Prince John. Una O'Conner, Herbert Mundin and Melville Cooper are delightful in smaller roles as comic relief.This film is available on home video and is well worth watching. Recommended.",

            "content": "Historically, this film is a heap of hooey. If Robin Hood ever existed, he would have lived about 150 years after the period in which the film is set. Modern historians are of the opinion that good King Richard and bad King John should be the other way around. This film should be thus regarded as fantasy.The fact that so many Robin Hood films have been made since, and not one of them remotely measures up to The Adventures of Robin Hood shows just how good the film is.Favourite scenes? Well, there's the scene in the great hall at Nottingham castle where Errol Flynn gives cheek to everyone. The escape, the ambush and the final showdown with Sir Guy of Gisborne. (Basil Rathbone makes a superb villain.) I'm very impressed with the sharpshooting. This was done by Howard Hill. Howard Hill appears a few times in the film. In the escape from the great hall he is the only archer among Guy of Gisburne's crossbowmen. In the archery tournament scene, he is Owen the Welshman (in spite of what it says in the credits at the end.) It has been said before, and I'll say it again: Errol Flynn did not play Robin Hood; he is Robin Hood.Performancewise, the cast are superb, with hardly a poor performance among them.I did at one time think that Una O'Connor was hamming it up a bit. However, I have recently worked in Buckinghamshire with a woman with exactly the same accent and - yes - exactly the same laugh. (Absolutely true). Therefore, Una O'Connor, who plays Marian's servant who resembles Chaucer's Wife of Bath, is brilliant!",

Errol Flynn leads a remarkable cast that seems to jump off the screen in their Technicolor brilliance. Flynn seems born to play this role (or any Swashbuckling Role for that matter). I urge all fans to read his highly entertaining autobiography My Wicked, Wicked Ways. After reading it you see that if he wasn't born to play these types of roles then he certainly spent his life practicing for them. The co-director Michael Curtiz is responsible for so many of the films one thinks about when the 'golden age of the studios' is mentioned \u0096 the list is amazing with Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy among them. And just listen to the music! Erich Wolfgang Korngold's musical score is without a doubt one of the finest pieces ever written for the silver screen. If you are a listener of classical music on the radio you are bound to hear the score to this film at least a few times a year. One cannot blame Hollywood for not matching this level of perfection in other Robin Hood versions. Does lighting ever strike in the same place twice?",

Here he brings just the right note of grinning mischief to the proceedings, looking just like the handsome storybook hero. We're not supposed to take the combat too seriously since much is choreographed tongue-in-cheek style. Oh sure, Rathbone is a glowering villain, along with an epicene Rains, both playing their parts to the hilt. Still, the production's a little like those old time melodramas where everybody hisses at the villain and cheers the hero. And who wouldn't risk life and limb for the beauteously wide-eyed de Havilland. It's a perfectly cast adventure film right down to the Merry Men. And get a load of those vittles. Looks to me like they're eating half a deer in one sitting. I'm hungry just thinking about it. Also, bring your sunglasses because the costuming is bright and colorful enough to fill up any screen. What more can you say about an all time classic that's almost flawless down to the last jot and tittle of pacing. I was overwhelmed as a kid 60-some years ago, and am just as impressed today. And I defy any of today's digital wizardry to mount a better, more humane, adventure film.(In passing\u2014as a kid I had no idea about the fuss over Normans and Saxons. Now I know the Normans are descendants of William the Conquerer who left northern France to subjugate England in 1066 AD, while the Saxons were England's older inhabitants. No wonder Robin had a bone to pick with the Normans.)",

Add to that Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as Sir Guy and Prince John, two of Hollywood's best character actors. 102 minutes of pure fantasy from a creative team totally on top of it's game, not forgetting the marvellous Korngold score!OK, all well and good, but the HD DVD version I bought this week was restored using a process invented by someone at Warners called Ultra Resolution that digitally re-aligns the three strip Technicolor film to the original state it was in when shot in 1938. The result is amazing, the detail is such that you can count the chain mail rings and see the embroidery on the costumes. As for the colour you can see why they used to call it Glorious Technicolor, it's like a painting brought to life. Stunning.

Herbert Mundin - who played Much the Miller's son - was already dead even before the start of World War II and Errol Flynn died the year I was born; yet the lovely Lady Marian is still with us today at the age of 104!Most people tend to forget he was even in it, but Claude Rains as usual probably gives the film's best performance as Prince John, the definitive portrayal of smiling malice; the good cop to Basil Rathbone's bad cop.",

I've probably seen it more than 15 times. It's one of those movies that I can't pass up when it's shown on TV.I'm not a huge Errol Flynn fan, but this movie hits all the right buttons for anyone that loves adventure. The correct elements are in place for fantastic entertainment, and I can't imagine a movie that does fantasy adventure better. Lots of good guys killing bad guys in great fights (no blood, of course), horse chases, rescues, the hero saves the damsel, comic relief- it's all here! No need for high tech theatrics.Naturally there is some suspension of logic here, as is pretty much mandatory to keep a good fantasy movie moving along. One noticeable flaw is that Robin apparently has a never-ending quiver of arrows (something I never noticed until I was older). This is in plain view when Robin first comes to Nottingham Castle to confront Prince John. Upon close inspection we can see he has five arrows in his quiver (with perhaps a sixth hidden behind others). During his escape from the castle he shoots 10 arrows, and when he hops on his horse to escape to Sherwood Forest, he still appears to have five arrows left. This is the Sherwood version of the 6 shot revolvers from 1930's western and gangster movies, which could often shoot 12-15 times without reloading.I cannot give a movie more than a \"classic\" rating, but this one merits it.",

            "review_title": "Best Swashbuckler Ever",
            "content": "The legend of Robin Hood has been filmed many times, but probably remains the best-known version, despite the fact that it was made nearly three quarters of a century ago. It sticks closely to the traditional story. Robin is a dispossessed Saxon nobleman, the Earl of Locksley, during the reign of Richard the Lionheart. Richard is being held prisoner by his enemy Leopold of Austria, and his brother Prince John has usurped power in England and is plotting to usurp the throne. Robin leads a rebel army against the tyrannical John and against the corrupt Norman barons who are oppressing the Saxon commoners by imposing heavy taxes on them. A subplot deals with Robin's romance with Maid Marian and his enmity with the wicked Sir Guy of Gisbourne, a prominent supporter of John and his rival for Marian's hand. Filmed versions of the Robin Hood story often reflect the periods in which they were made. The Richard Greene television version from the fifties reflected the patriotic sentiments widespread in a decade when many Britons were talking about a \"New Elizabethan Age\". Richard Lester's \"Robin and Marian\" from 1976 was a dull, pessimistic film for the dull, pessimistic seventies. Kevin Costner's \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\", made in a more optimistic period following the end of the Cold War, restored something of the swashbuckling glamour to the story but, in keeping with nineties political correctness, introduced a prominent black character. The recent Russell Crowe version gives us a grittier, more egalitarian Robin, no longer an earl or a knight but a man of the common people.\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was made in 1938, only a year before the outbreak of war, when Europe was confronted by the menace of Fascism, and clearly reflects many of the concerns of those days. Robin and his men stand against both tyranny and racism. Although they are fighting for the rights of the oppressed Saxon peasantry, they do not hate the Normans. (\"It's injustice, not Normans that I hate\", says Robin). They are not fighting to reverse the Norman Conquest, to restore a Saxon to the throne or to expel the Normans from England. Rather, they recognise Richard as their rightful King and dream of a future in which Normans and Saxons can live in peace together with equal rights. Despite this stress on the Rights of Man, however, the scriptwriters may have thrown a sop to that influential lobby which wanted America to keep out of foreign wars; towards the end Richard makes a speech regretting his involvement in the Crusades and promising that in future he will devote all his energies to his own country. The continuing appeal of this film, however, has nothing to do with its relevance to thirties politics and a lot to do with the dash and style with which it was made. It was shot in Technicolor, still very much an innovation in 1938 even for swashbuckling adventure stories. It starred in the leading role Errol Flynn, probably the most charismatic adventure hero of the period, who gave one of the most perfectly judged performances of his career. Flynn's leading lady was (as so often was the case) the lovely Olivia de Havilland; this was the third of eight films they were eventually to make together. The director Michael Curtiz was to direct Flynn and de Havilland in another film, \"Dodge City\", the following year. The film gives us not one but three memorable villains, all carefully differentiated from one another. Claude Rains plays the smooth, scheming Prince John, Melville Cooper provides comic relief as the cowardly, inept Sheriff of Nottingham and Basil Rathbone almost eclipses Flynn as Gisbourne, a man whose aristocratic demeanour barely conceals the fact that he is really no more than a crude thug. His final, justly famous, swordfight with Robin provides the great climax to the film. The swordfight is one of a number of great action sequences- others include the archery tournament and the scene where the Merry Men ambush Gisbourne's party transporting tax money through Sherwood Forest. (And Sherwood does look convincingly like an English woodland, something which was not always the case during this period in Hollywood films supposedly set in England. The rural scenes in another Flynn movie from the following year, \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\", were all too obviously shot in that corner of England which is forever California). Flynn was one of those actors who had a fairly small range but could give some excellent performances if he remained within that range. (In \"Elizabeth and Essex\", for example, he was perhaps straying a bit too far from his comfort zone). As a swashbuckling hero he had never been surpassed and never, really, even been equalled. (Tyrone Power and Stewart Granger have perhaps come the closest; Burt Lancaster's efforts in the genre, like \"The Flame and the Arrow\" and \"The Crimson Pirate\" do not really measure up). \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is perhaps the best swashbuckler ever made. 9/10",

Heck, the Fox in the Disney version of \"Robin Hood\" and Cary Elwes as \"Robin Hood Men in Tights\" were better Robin Hoods than Costner! No, Flynn was meant to play this role.The supporting cast is also incredible. Claude Rains as Prince John was priceless, and charming in his own malevolent way. Basil Rathbone, Alan Hale, Patric Knowles, and Eugene Palette were also memorable for me in the film.And, of course, you can't write a review of this film without mentioning the chemistry of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Past or present, very few on-screen couples possess the natural chemistry those two had. They just looked at each other and you could tell there were unresolved feelings there (and there were, both admitted later on). They were just magic on screen together.There is really something for everyone in this film, and I recommend seeing it.",

History, uh, no, there's none of that here. It's all very mythic and fairy tale. The continuity errors shouldn't even be called errors; they are pretty much continuous (so when I found out it won Best Editing at the Oscars I laughed). The score, made much of on the DVD case, and an Oscar winner at the 11th Oscars, is bombastic, repetitive and completely at odds with the scenery at least 80% of the time, IMNSHO.That said, the dialog still crackles, the costumes are UNBELIEVABLE and gracefully shot, Olivia de Havilland is stunningly gorgeous, Basil Rathbone is young and evil, Claude Rains plays John as gayer than a go go dancer on Pride day, and Errol Flynn takes effortless het masculinity and a beautiful smile further than it should legally be allowed to go. All the bit parts are well cast, and while it's not possible to know for sure, the whole production looks like everyone in it had a scenery chewing bang up good time. The bit parts are SO well cast, that Roy Rogers bought Trigger, the horse that Olivia de Havilland rides, and Trigger then rode out into history.And when Olivia exclaims \"You speak treason!\" and Errol replies, purringly, \"Fluently!\" you'll smile.

            "content": "According to the new two-disc DVD of this movie, it wasn't until the 1950s that Olivia de Havilland realized how fantastic a movie she had been involved in. That was when she saw \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" for the first time in many years in a packed theater in Paris and caught the buzz of the people seeing it around her.It sort of makes sense. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was made as popular entertainment, designed to amuse and thrill rather than make audiences think. It was probably a drag to make, especially with bad weather, clumsy new Technicolor technology to accommodate, and the harsh director Michael Curtiz ordering everyone around like Colonel Klink. De Havilland was in \"Gone With The Wind,\" she won Oscars playing much more serious roles than Maid Marian. The words of Sir Guy might have rung in her ears, as they have been echoed over time by certain less-kind judges of this film: \"Very charming, but not exactly clever.\"But as Olivia discovered in that French theater and so many of us have been discovering ever since, \"Robin Hood\" is audaciously clever, a perpetual-motion motion-picture machine when it comes to delivering the goods. Beginning with the performances, and carrying forward with the script, the set design, the Technicolor camera work, and especially the fantastic Erich Wolfgang Korngold score, \"Robin Hood\" is one of those older films actually gaining stature over time, as it becomes clearer how much of a miracle it really is.Taking elements of the Robin Hood saga, both from longtime legends and screen treatments like an earlier Douglas Fairbanks Sr. silent film, the scenarists manage to create an upbeat story of wit and pace fully in tune with the merry cast and score. As played by Errol Flynn, this Robin doesn't die in bed an old man, and his banditry is underplayed in favor of a historically incongruous but richly satisfying freedom-fighter figure trying to save his fellow Saxons from the predations of their Norman overlords. He meets Marian, a proud Norman maiden, and, while showing her how the people suffer under the yoke of her fellows, they fall in love.Making Robin a little less radical, and more palatable to mainstream audiences, is the fact he is actually loyal to England's real king, the usurped Richard. This could have been mawkish but sets up a terrific reveal later that jump-starts the last act of the film.There were two directors on \"Robin Hood.\" My guess is that both brought something important to the table, and together created a film neither would have been able to on their own. William Keighley set the gorgeous template, a nod in the direction of N.C. Wyeth's storybook illustrations as Raul daSilva of New Haven has already noted, and as an actor's director, gave useful pointers to the cast, especially the bad guys, who uniformly give subtle, off-center performances. Then, as Keighley wrestled with his bete noir, action, he was replaced by the great Curtiz, who took Keighley's sturdy framework and cracked the whip to liven things up.People wouldn't celebrate \"Robin Hood\" as much without the rescue-from-the-gallows sequence, or the final duel between Robin and Sir Guy, both of which showcase Curtiz at his best. But you wouldn't have so much invested in the principals without Keighley's help in giving the actors the proper space and depth to connect with viewers.You can run out of room rapidly singing the praises of a film like this, a classic adventure that works as a love story and makes one laugh, so effortlessly and all at once. Flynn was never better as a Robin that sacrifices grittiness for humanity and crack one-liners. And De Havilland is quite possibly the most gorgeous woman ever filmed, at the very least up there with the likes of Maureen O'Hara in \"The Quiet Man\" and Cameron Diaz in \"Something About Mary\" for the way she glows on screen, her gorgeous browns gazing up at Robin in a way that inspires a sad sort of rapture, at least for me.There has never been a film since that did the things \"Robin Hood\" does, but I find that less remarkable than the fact a film this good was ever made at all.",

I first saw the film when I was a small boy and I have deliberately avoided buying the DVD on the basis that over-familiarity could breed contempt. I much prefer the serendipity of finding it scheduled on a wet winter Sunday afternoon. Then I can relax in front of the fire and just revel in Errol's hammy balletic performance as Hood, or the simply too-beautiful-for-words Olivia in soft focus or the delightfully dastardly duo Rathbone and Raines...superb! Just do yourself a favour occasionally and let this Technicolour wonder wash over you - forget that it bears no relationship to actual history; just accept this Hollywood version of how England once was (and should still be).

Basil Rathbone is a worthy foe and Marian is the conduit to the powerful. Robin Hood and his men are honorable and have the good of the country in mind.

            "review_title": "The Character That Best Harmonizes Errol Flynn's Persona (Also: Bonus Information about Medieval England before and after Richard)",
            "content": "With the introductory credits highlighted in lush Technicolor and a grand musical score, we know that we are in for a rousing swashbuckler adventure. A herald reads to crowds that King Richard I, the Lion Heart (Coeur de Lion), as he was returning to the West from the Third Crusade, has been captured (1191 in the movie, but actually 1192) by his sworn enemy, Leopold of Austria. He is being held captive for an incredibly large ransom (150,000 marks, or 100,000 English pounds). Taking advantage of the situation, Richard's brother Prince John (Claude Rains) deposes the legal regent (Longchamps) and seizes control of the Kingdom of England. John's chief henchmen are Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper). John promptly raises taxes, ostensibly to raise Richard's huge ransom, but in reality to build up the resources to maintain his power structure.When the English (Anglo-Saxons) protest the exorbitant taxes, they are oppressed, beaten, and tortured, and lose their properties. Taking pity on the oppressed Saxons, Sir Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn) and sidekick Will Scarlett (Patric Knowles) begin to protect them. Eventually known as Robin Hood, he and his \"Merry Men\" inhabit Sherwood Forest and become wanted outlaws. King John confiscates Robin's properties. The revolt becomes full-fledged as new men are recruited, like John Little (or Little John, Alan Hale) and Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette). In the meantime, Norman Maid Marian Fitzwalter (Olivia de Havilland) is firmly in John's court and corner in the beginning. But after Sir Guy's treasure guard is defeated, captured, and temporarily held by Robin's forces, she realizes that Robin is caring and is most sincere about real justice for the common people. She eventually falls in love with him. After being foiled many times by Robin, King John, advised by the Sheriff, sets a trap at a national archery contest. He captures the outlaw. At a tavern, Lady Marian tells Robin's men where he is held, and thus just before his scheduled execution he is dramatically freed. Meanwhile King Richard (Ian Hunter) has been released by the Austrians. (It is assumed that the ransom was paid by Robin's men.) The rightful king and his entourage travel incognito in England, gathering information relating to local events. Richard soon meets up with Robin's Merry Men, who, upon recognizing the king, kneel in homage and express their loyalty to the true crown. They are determined to unseat the usurper. Meanwhile Marian is arrested and condemned to death for treason by John and Sir Guy. John, falsely believing that Richard is dead by a (failed) assassination attempt, plans a full-fledged coronation ceremony at his castle. The denouement involves the attack by Robin's forces at John's coronation when the disguised attackers appear and surprise John's knights. There is a spectacular sword-fight between Robin and Sir Guy and Robin that ends the action. Richard is restored to his rightful throne, as John and the Sheriff are banished. Robin becomes Lord, Baron, and Earl, and Lady Marian and he have Richard's permission to marry. Errol Flynn as the dashing Robin Hood (Sir Robin of Locksley) is in his best role. He owns the part. His love interest is perfectly matched with lovely and petite 22-year old Olivia De Havilland (Lady Marian). Basil Rathbone, a superb swordsman in real life, is excellent as the haughty Sir Guy of Gisbourne. So is Claude Rains as the evil Prince John who persecutes the Saxons. The other castings are equally first-rate. In short, there are superior photography by Gaudio and Polito (in California, not England!), excellent Korngold music, colorful Anderson costumes, good direction, nice script by Raine and Miller, and great sword-fights! What an adventure, one of the best of the Middle Ages ever filmed! The American Film Institute twice issued its listings of the top 100 movies of all time. Both times \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" did not make the list. But AFI's listings did include movies like \"The Apartment\" (1960), \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\"(1967), \"Network\" (1976), \"Tootsie\" (1982), and \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989). I assure you that \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was superior to those in virtually every method examined. Watch and compare. But one may ask, \"Does this movie portray the real medieval England?\" Probably not, and there are historical inaccuracies. But watch it anyway (more than once), as it ranks as one of the all-time great adventure flicks in world cinema!BONUS INFORMATION: As written by the Venerable Bede, the Angles and Saxons (and Jutes) from northern Europe invaded Britannia (England) in the fifth century and displaced the Romano-Briton population. The Jutes were soon absorbed by the Saxons. Over time the Angles and Saxons (English) became more civilized, and in the seventh century England was reconverted to the old Christian faith of Roman times. In the ninth century, King Alfred (d. 899) united much of Anglo-Saxon England and fought invading Danes, establishing Europe's first national State in the process. In 1066, the Normans successfully invaded the nation (Battle of Hastings) and consolidated their power. In 1189, Richard I inherited his kingdom from his Norman father, Henry II. Upon his return from the Crusades and Austrian captivity, Richard forgave his brother John and again made him his heir (1194). But Richard spent little time in England. In March 1199, as he was besieging a castle in France without wearing his chain mail, he was struck by a crossbow arrow in his left shoulder and eventually died of gangrene poisoning in the arms of his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. John became king, but had his problems with rebellious barons. So it was that they forced him to acknowledge political reform, the Magna Carta (Great Charter), at Runnymede near Windsor Castle (1215). John died of disease a year later while campaigning against the rebels in the First Barons' War.",

            "content": "Errol Flynn would be the first person to admit that he was not a great actor, but he gives an outstanding performance as Robin of Loxley, a folk hero who during the regency of Prince John while Richard the lionhearted was away stole from the rich to give to the poor. there are also two fantastic villains in Claude Rains as Prince John and Basil Rathbone as the Sheriff of Nottingham, as malevolent as Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" whom Rathbone would play the following year in \"Tower of London\".Mixing history, adventure, romance and comedy with terrific Technicolor photography and fabulous music, this is the best Robin Hood out there. For romance, is Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian (Richard the Lionhearted's ward) whom Flynn romances while trying to get her away from the evil Prince John who has sentenced her to be executed. Una O'Connor shrieks delightfully as de Havilland's devoted lady in waiting who flirts with Herbert Mundin, one of Robin's men.Then there's Alan Hale Sr. as Little John (far from little) who battles Flynn to allow stream crossing and gravely voiced Eugene Pallette as the determined Friar Tuck who may seem as if he's no challenge but proves Flynn wrong after Robin makes the mistake of humiliating him. Ian Hunter is quite the noble King Richard, showing up in the nick of time and upsetting Prince John's plans. This of course leads to one of the screen's most famous sword fights, often duplicated and spoofed, but never surpassed. Historical epics and swashbucklers can't get any better than this. It's a feel good film in every respect that reaches every emotion. Seeing it again after many years had slight tears coming to my eye, a rarity that only occurs when a film is heavenly bliss.",

            "content": "The knee-jerking reaction of watching this Technicolor swashbuckler is holy cow how is it possible this picture was made in 1938? Its brightly rich palette, advanced back projection technology, meticulously tailored garments and detailed mise en sc\u00e8ne, must be cutting-edge and it did cost a great amount of fortune to make it happen, the most expensive film for WARNER BROS. at its time, but the reward was also colossal. The second Flynn-de-Havilland cinematic fare out of 8, this version of Robin Hood (Flynn)'s tale is chiefly diverted to his romance with Maid Marion (de Havilland), Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Rathbone) assumes the duty as his sworn enemy and he takes this job very seriously, joining the collision with the treacherous Prince John (Claude Rains is a pitch-perfect villain with debonair), declares a Norman war against Saxons. Among the cohorts of Robin Hood, we will get to know Will Scarlett (a cloyingly jolly Knowles, so tell me there is no gay innuendo and I am not the only one), Friar Tuck (Pallette), Little John (Hale) and his equally valiant servant Much (Mundin). There are enjoyable action sequences bordering on acrobatics, one notable example is the guerrillas are hiding in the trees, waiting for the right moment to leap on the cavalries like some amusing escapade, the hand-to-hand combats are never large-scaled, fencing and archery are the main feats, great stunt work nonetheless. The characterisation never intends to be profound, Flynn and de Havilland are jumping on the bandwagon of star-making and embody all the virtues which that era requires, itwas a massive crowd-pleaser and eye-opener at the same time, even today, its flair will not diminish too much thanks to its top-notch teamwork, leads by directors Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA 1942, 9/10) and the lesser-known studio journeyman William Keighley, more significantly it beckons a wonderful cinema year of 1939.",

            "review_title": "The Medieval Superman, fighting for truth, justice and the Lion-hearted way...",
            "content": "Michael Curtiz and William Keighley's \"Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a swashbuckler all right, but it's a little more than that: the film is a time capsule of Hollywood's Golden Age (tainted with emerald brilliance). Even if you didn't see, you certainly saw countless movies that owe something to it, starting with the score from Erich Wolfgang Korngold, the European composer who intuitively knew that a score should be composed of various and light motifs, indicating a different shift of tones, romantic, ominous, thrilling, but with a main musical theme to overarch the whole thing, Korngold was the James Horner of his time.Since the score is the first notable quality, it was a necessary preamble, now, what's the second thing you notice? Exactly. When you think of masterpieces in color, your mind prompts you to 1939 with \"Gone With the Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\", movies that are impossible to imagine in monochrome. Maybe you would also think of Disney's milestone \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" of 1937, but don't overlook the year between them. The glorious Technicolor picture, with a unique and defining pastel-like saturation, came from Warner Bros, of all the studios, the one that built its reputation for black-and-white gangster pictures. But the studios had a trick in their sleeve, a dashing new leading man for a dashing hero, no time for baddies!And Robin Hood is perhaps the most enduring of all heroes, an outlaw who rebels against a tyrant and leads a guerrilla like a Medieval \"Che\". There's something so timeless about his crusade, \"stealing from the rich to give to the poor\" is a rather revolutionary notion, and the film insists in showing the oppression inflicted by despotic and despicable Prince John (Claude Rains as cunning as his Captain Renault but without the warmth), they allow Maid Marian (OIivia de Havilland) to reconsider her opinion about the King and Robin, but it also helps us to free our hearts from any mercy when the villains are shot. This is no \"rebel without a cause\", like Zorro or Superman, Robin fights for truth and justice and the just way, not the Norman or Saxon way.And just like these superheroes, Robin Hood has the outfit: the bow and arrows, and the hat that put 'conic' in iconic. Sure, legends, ancient writings suggest various versions of Robin Hood (even Lionheart's reputation seemed to be closer to Scar than Mufasa) but still, the 1938 version features the definite green-clad Robin Hood, king of the bucolic scenery of Sherwood Forest and leader of the Merrie Men. So many good things depend on this representation: gentle giant Little John (Alan Hale), comic relief Much (Herbert Mundin), Friar Tuck, Prince John, Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone as the perfect nemesis) and buffoonish Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper). I grew up with the Disney version but this film made me feel at home, it had everything, even the archery tournament, which I thought was a Disney invention. And Errol Flynn even managed to surpass the fox, I was surprised by how good he was. When he confronts Prince John, there's something defiant in his eyes, in his razor-sharp wit that almost equals John's evil suaveness. And his eyes aren't just there to deliver stares, look at him watching the door being closed and anticipating his escape, , this is not your grandstanding hero making all solemn poses, he's a man of action, conventional maybe, but aren't getting all too cynical about things? I'm the first New Hollywood fan, and I love my character edgy, cynical, antiheroic, I love my story to be a multilayered bag of contradictions, of delightful and dark ironies... but sometimes, I'm wondering if we're not giving too much credit to villains? Maybe heroes are tougher to play because the actor has to make them look interesting, Robin Hood isn't just about archery and fights, he's got charm, wit, charisma, even nobility and Errol Flynn knew how to convey these virtues because you could tell he took his role seriously yet had fun playing it, unlike comatose Kevin Costner in \"Prince of Thieves\" or Russel Crowe as 'Maximus in tights'. A good thing James Cagney declined the role for only an actor of Flynn's stature could play Robin Hood with such gusto, like Douglas Fairbanks a decade before. The Warner producers noticed his energetic and flamboyant performance as \"Captain Blood\" and knew he had the right stuff, the hero we immediately idolize, the man's man. And the woman's man as well.Olivia de Havilland's youthful beauty is so adorable and breathtaking she's the perfect match for Robin, an Alpha woman for an Alpha male, she's as brave as he's fearless, as noble in blood as she's in spirit and even she has a funny lady-in-waiting in Bess, played by the irresistible and fidgety Una O'Connor (her flirting with Much was cute beyond words). Robin's journey couldn't do without the romance and the beautiful balcony pledge of love, but once again, the film challenges your expectations and instead of ending with a conventional ride into the sunset, it ends with a funny line and an abrupt ending that respects the spirit of the hero and doesn't overplay the romantic tone.Now, I started by saying that it's more than a swashbuckler, but let's keep in mind that it's one after all, and the ultimate one. The swordfights (especially the climax) are wonderfully executed. While most action movies today mix messy fights where people get shot for real fights, looking at the stunts involving the arrows, the way Flynn ride the top atop the castle, you can tell they're not perfect but that's because they're real. For all it's old-fashioned look, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" still holds up today and is so generous in fun, thrills and colors that it's a school-case of classical film-making and entertainment, a game-changing milestone to content any movie lover.",

Good support from Olivia de Havilland (as Lady Marion), Claude Rains (as Prince John), Basil Rathbone (as Sir Guy of Gisbourne) and a host of others.Another standout feature is the costumes. Very well done and they work well with the colours of the movie. Lady Marion's outfits are particularly good.Only sour notes are the performance of Ian Hunter as King Richard - it feels a bit weak, especially for a king - and the some scenes feel a bit clumsy.

The highlight of the many action scenes is the duel between Flynn and Rathbone as they overturn heavy tables and candelabra, all the while exchanging some blustery dialogue.As for Flynn and de Havilland, their screen chemistry was never more obvious. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone make a memorable pair of villains and the remarkable cast includes sterling performances from Melville Cooper, Ian Hunter, Una O'Connor, Alan Hale, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love and Patric Knowles.It's a fairytale version all done up in gleaming Technicolor, the action and romance made even more impressive by Korngold's exquisite Oscar-winning score. The romantic highlight is the scene in Marian's bedchamber, a Romeo-and-Juliet-like moment with Flynn climbing a vine to her balcony to woo his damsel in distress. The archery tournament sequence is a joy to behold--and de Havilland was never more beautifully photographed than in her reaction close-ups as she realizes the tournament is a trap.Una O'Connor is a joy as her loyal servant and Alan Hale makes a wonderful Little John. In fact, all of the supporting roles are perfectly cast.Rousing entertainment that has charmed the socks off everyone since its release in 1938 and outclasses the Kevin Costner version in every way possible. Long live the bandit of Sherwood Forest!! And last but not least, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic score remains one of the finest film scores ever, sweeping, majestic and always complimenting the on-screen action and romance.The new Ultra-Resolution process on the 2-Disc DVD gives an image that is probably better than when actually released in 1938, when it opened to rave reviews at Radio City Music Hall.",

            "content": "This film essentially begins with \"King Richard\" (Ian Hunter) having been captured and held for ransom by the Duke of Austria. This results in King Richard's brother \"Prince John\" (Claude Rains) to subsequently take this opportunity to seize the throne. To further consolidate his hold on power he decides to utilize the powerful Norman nobility to disenfranchise the Saxons and further enrich himself in the process. Naturally, the powerless Saxons don't particularly like these actions and eventually one person \"Sir Robin of Locksley\" (Errol Flynn) decides to take action and stage a rebellion until King Richard's return to England. Needless to say, this infuriates Prince John and his Norman sycophants who decide that they must kill the man now known as Robin Hood at all costs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this is one of my favorite movies and richly deserves the praise that critics have lavished upon it. Not only was in nominated for \"Best Picture\" at the Academy Awards but it was also selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. High praise indeed. That being said, I heartily recommend this film for all viewers and have rated it accordingly.",

            "content": "The Adventures Of Robin Hood (1938): Starring Errol Flynn, Claude Rains, Olivia De Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Melville Cooper, Patrick Knowles, Eugene Palette, Alan Hale, Ian Hunter, Una O'Connor, Herbert Mundin, Montagu Love, Robert Noble, Leonard Willey, Kenneth Hunter....Directors Michael Curtiz, William Keighley...Screenplay Norman Reilly Raine, Seton I. Miller.Released in 1938 in the new Technicolor of the time, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was the one film that not only launched the career of actor Errol Flynn but that of his co-star Olivia De Havilland as well as director Michael Curtiz and even elevated Warner Bros Studios to a new level of greatness, simply because this film boasts a strong cast and oozes with grand old Hollywood spectacle. The popular folk legend of the heroic outlaw Robin Hood is an old one, dating back to the time of the Medieval Crusades and the reign of King Richard the Lion-Hearted. Errol Flynn brought the familiar character to brilliant life in every detail of his performance; from the physicality of his acting (he did all his own stunts!) to the accurate \"Robin Hood\" mannerisms, language, accent and even laugh. He was exactly what audiences felt Robin Hood should be. It's even likely he inspired the later Disney animated version of Robin Hood in the 60's, in which the characters were animals. The story of Robin Hood has endured over the years because it's at heart a classic tale of heroism. The social outcast Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men,despite lacking the comforts of home and titles, save a then feudal England from the corruption of the Sheriff of Nottingham and the usurper Prince John. While righting wrongs, Robin Hood falls for the noblewoman Maid Marion. Can he defeat the evil Prince John and restore the rightful king Richard to the throne ? A notable cast heads up the film. Rising star Olivia De Havilland is pretty, elegant, charming and yet very resourceful as Maid Marian, and her chemistry with Robin Hood is electrifying. She would later become far more than just Errol Flynn's leading lady and win two Oscars for strong dramatic performances in the 40's for \"To Each His Own\" and \"The Heiress\" and her acting career lasted over 30 years. What we see in her as Maid Marian is a young Olivia De Havilland, a new arrival in Hollywood. But the rest of the principals were established stars. Actor Basil Rathbone, who plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne, had been a silent film star of swashbuckling adventure films. Claude Rains (Prince John) was popular at this time and would continue to enthrall audiences with great performances over the years, including his memorable films \"The Invisable Man\" and the \"talkie\" \"Phantom Of The Opera\". Claude Rains as Prince John is a nasty piece of work, blinded by ambition and ruthless in his pursuit of power, hoping to rule England in the absence of King Richard (Ian Hunter) who is portrayed as a lost adventurer himself. Having fought in the Crusades, he comes home to an England he hardly recognizes and one that does not recognize him. Melville Cooper portrays the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham.The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, including Patrick Knowles as the dashing Will Scarlett, Alan Hale as the burly Little John and Eugene Palette as the godly Friar Tuck are also what audiences imagined they would be. When the characters are not fighting, plotting or saving the day, there is a considerable amount of humor, especially in such characters as Bess, portrayed by Una O'Connor, who serves as lady-in-waiting to Maid Marion. This film had two directors, Michael Curtiz and William Keighley because during this time in Hollywood, the more ambitious, expensive or difficult-to-produce films normally needed extra direction. But it is Michael Curtiz who garnered fame and he would later direct Errol Flynn in other successful films such as the Elizabethan adventure \"The Sea Hawk\" and the pre-Civil War epic \"Santa Fe Trail\" in which Flynn was once again paired with Olivia De Havilland. This film is a winner and a classic slice of old Hollywood.",

            "content": "One of the greatest of all swash-bucklers and forever the definitive version of the Robin Hood legend (despite any number of very good subsequent TV and movie adaptations).It just has too much going for it to ever fail, with Flynn in his greatest ever role, De Havilland never lovelier and Rathbone in his element as the wicked Guy of Gisbourne, never mind a great supporting cast including Flynn perennial Alan Hale as Little John, Claude Rains (in a ridiculous red-haired wig) as the evil King John and Eugene Palette as the rough, gruff but amiable Friar Tuck. My only objections on the acting front concerns Melville Cooper as a too effete Sheriff of Nottingham (this character's malevolence has been built up in many of the subsequent revisions indicated above), his effectiveness reduced further for me by the actor's resemblance to the faint-hearted lion in \"The Wizard Of Oz\" and a way-too-old Much the Miller's son (again another character who has changed for the better since this movie, usually by being made correspondingly younger). Significantly, again unlike more recent versions, Robin's Merrie Men here runs into dozens giving principal director Curtiz ample opportunity to display his flair for crowd scenes (not a CG special effect in sight!).All the best remembered aspects of the Robin Hood legend are present and correct including Robin's initial encounter with Little John, the archery contest-cum-trap and the return of King Richard, all conveniently telescoped into one time-frame. The apogee of the film of course is the stirring sword-fight between Flynn and Rathbone with the striking imagery of their shadows played out on the castle walls before Rathbone's realistic death as he falls over the staircase. By way of contrast, Flynn and De Havilland's love scenes are wholly natural and endearing - I can still recall several years ago my then infant kid sister (now aged 36) expostulating \"they must be in very big love\" to the amusement of the rest of the family as the lovers kissed! To crown it all, the whole thing is depicted in ravishing colour with wonderful exterior and interior sets, superb costumes, to a rousing soundtrack by Erich Korngold.\"The Adventures Of Robin Hood\" doesn't just define swashbuckling movies alone, it defines Golden Age Hollywood movie-making itself.",

You can tell throughout the film that he has great fun with the role. His previous Captain Blood had already made him a star, this film added to the legend. His supporting cast from Alan Hale Sr. to Olivia DeHaviland is excellent.This film is so good, that in the 1960's when Disney studios made an animated version the sequences in a fair part of that film were copied from the live action sequences in this movie. That is the greatest compliment that can be paid to a film when even the Disney animators liked the imagery so well, they created drawings of the same images.This film features some early work with unique camera angles to look for in the sword fight sequences. This work shows the shadows of the fights on the castle walls before the live actors show up. The sound effects for the arrows were actually copied in later films when they were studied & understood how they were created for this film.This film will always hold up as a great film as the story is timeless & because of that has been remade several different times since & in several different ways. It is good to view this one first, because this one makes you appreciate the hurdles later film makers had to over come when trying to remake a classic. The only living cast member as of today is Olivia De Havilland (Maid Marion) age 100 on 7/1/2016.",

Loyal \"outlaw\" defeats the ambitions of usurping Prince John.NOTES: \"Unfortunately, the action scenes were ineffective, and I was forced to replace the director in mid-production. I felt that only Mike Curtiz could give the picture the color and scope it needed. Why hadn't we used him in the first place? Errol wanted Keighley (who had directed him in The Prince and The Pauper).\" \u2014 Hal B. Wallis.Dawson, Weyl and Korngold all won awards in their various categories. Also nominated for Best Picture (lost to You Can't Take It With You). Number 8 on the New York Times Ten Best list. Number 7 on the Film Daily Ten Best. Shooting commenced 27 September 1937, finished 15 January 1938. Negative cost: $1,900,000.COMMENT: We can be thankful that Warners saw the error of their ways. Fortunately, there is far more Curtiz than Keighley in the picture. It starts off with Curtiz in the great castle confrontation between Flynn and Rains and then goes into the weaker Keighley stuff in which Una O'Connor is allowed to put on her usual tiresome antics as Maid Marian's maid and Herbert Mundin is encouraged to overact atrociously.Olivia de Havilland is also extremely wet \u2014 a fact that Keighley seems to have realized. He asked the photographer to give her some extra allure by soft lensing her reaction shots. Patric Knowles is likewise a far too colorless a Will Scarlett, and even Rathbone seems somewhat bland in the Keighley segments. He's much more powerful under Curtiz where he really delivers his lines with as much relish as he wields his sword. What a shame Curtiz wasn't permitted to re-shoot more of the Keighley material! Richard is weak too, while Littlejohn and Friar Tuck are also disappointing \u2014 Curtiz would have given them far greater impact. But Flynn is always perfect \u2014 a dashing Robin Hood whom it takes no less than three villains to balance: Rathbone as the fastest swordsman in the north, deliciously blustering Melville Cooper, sublimely egocentric Claude Rains. Fed with some marvelous lines, these three are absolutely admirable in nastiness. As for all the action with its stupendous climactic duel between Flynn and Rathbone, plus the sumptuous music score, the gorgeous sets, pacey film editing, exuberant color . . . Robin Hood is simply unbeatable.",

            "content": "This vintage swashbuckler is a rightful classic and a colourful, enjoyable adventure romp for all generations. While the story of Robin Hood, his merry men and the wicked Prince John and his cronies is by now familiar, the sense of spectacle that this film possesses is truly wonderful, as well as the vibrant Technicolor which made this one of the most beautiful films of the '30s and beyond.Errol Flynn is cast as the charismatic hero and uses his athleticism as an advantage for the film's many action sequences, where he leaps on to tables and from rope to rope while using the enemy guards as pincushions for his arrows. With him stars Olivia de Havilland who has the largely thankless role of Lady Marian, given little to do aside from standing around and looking pretty. Thankfully, the film has three wonderfully villainous performances from some old pros. Melville Cooper plays the Sheriff of Nottingham, mainly a comic and unthreatening character here; Claude Rains (THE INVISIBLE MAN) is Prince John, a corrupted, selfish and pompous little man with delusions of grandeur, and Basil Rathbone (TOWER OF London) is the evil Guy of Gisborne, full of wickedness (such as removing people's eyes, ears and tongues!) and baleful glares.The scenery is lush, the costumes are bright and there's a superb climax wherein Flynn and Rathbone indulge in the mother of all sword fights before the inevitable occurs. Before then we have fine acting from all members of the cast, plenty of romance, some intrigue, an unbelievable archery contest, a few traitors, lots of fights, a wild party in the woods and plenty more to keep us occupied so that the two-hour running time flies past. The phase \"they don't make 'em like this any more\" is particularly apt for this classic piece of epic entertainment.",

I truly love this combination of Flynn and Curtiz for popcorn adventure.Beside that, this film is *easily* the best treatment of the Robin Hood legend on film. It's Flynn's best role and he was never more charming, daring and sexy. The storybook techno color gives the film an illustrated feel that makes the visuals pop.

            "content": "\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was made with sublime innocence and breathtaking artistry, at a time when its simple values rang true. In these cynical days when swashbucklers cannot be presented without an ironic subtext, this great 1938 film exists in an eternal summer of bravery and romance. We require no Freudian subtext, no revisionist analysis; it is enough that Robin wants to rob the rich, pay the poor and defend the Saxons not against all Normans, only the bad ones: \"It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.\" The movie involved a couple of firsts: The first Warner Bros. Film shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, and the first of 12 times Flynn would be directed by Michael Curtiz. It was the fifth of eight films that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland would make together. It is a triumph of the studio system. The producer, Hal B. Wallis, was the most creative executive on the Warner Bros. Lot, and when the studio's biggest star, James Cagney, walked off angry and left \"Robin Hood\" without a star, Wallis had the clout and daring to cast Flynn in the role--Flynn, a young man from Tasmania with only one Hollywood hit, \"Captain Blood.\" There are moments in \"Robin Hood\" as playful as a child's game, as when Robin and his men rise to the bait of Prince John's archery tournament. Are we to believe that the most wanted men in the kingdom could disguise themselves simply by pulling their hats low over their faces? And there are moments a little too obvious, as when Robin takes Marion to a part of Sherwood Forest occupied by some of the Saxons he has helped, and they skulk about like an engraving of tired and huddled masses, rousing themselves to express gratitude to him. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is like a textbook on how to get that right.",

            "content": "Has there been a more dashing swashbuckler than Errol Flynn in the late 1930's? As this 1938 classic attests, Robin Hood is the role he was born to play. Wearing his green tights, speaking medieval dialogue, and brandishing a sword with equal aplomb, Flynn is at his charismatic peak in one of the liveliest adventures filmed during Hollywood's golden era. Hands down, this is the most definitive version of the legend of Sir Robin of Locksley, and much of the credit needs to go to veteran director Michael Curtiz and his predecessor, William Keighley.In successive turns (due to an astute studio decision), Curtiz and Keighley bring the fanciful tale to vibrant life with breathless pacing, elaborate sets and costumes, memorable dueling sequences and a clever script written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller. For all these virtues, the most lasting impression one has in watching the film now is the amazingly rich Technicolor courtesy of the sharp cinematography by Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito, and from my perspective, even more hue-saturated than the camera-work in the following year's \"Gone With the Wind\". The colors pop vividly, especially in the ornate costumes designed by Milo Anderson and sometimes a bit too excessively as in the Hawaiian Punch color of the wine pouring out of the damaged barrels.Set in 12th century England (though filmed outside Chico, California), the story focuses on Robin's outlaw attempts to thwart the usurper Prince John's dastardly plan to take over the throne from his absent brother, Richard the Lionhearted. Loyal to the true king, Robin collects every Saxon peasant he can find to create a resistance movement, and with his band of merry men, he must face not only John but his crafty henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. As if this wouldn't keep him busy enough, Robin falls for Maid Marian, a Norman royal ward who is at first resistant but quickly succumbs to his charms and courage. This is not the type of movie where you think too deeply about character motivations or the veracity of plot developments because this is escapist fare of the highest order.Casting is perfect even beyond Flynn. The 21-year old Olivia de Havilland is spirited and luminous as Marian shimmering in period costume and looking most breathtaking sans headdress in a diaphanous gown as Robin bounds up to her balcony. Basil Rathbone brings roguish swagger to villainous Sir Guy, and he and Flynn amaze in their climactic sword fight when they move fluidly offscreen and are replaced briefly by their dueling shadows cast on a huge stone pillar. In a severe pageboy wig that must have been the envy of Joan Crawford, Claude Rains plays a rueful Prince John with a mocking malevolence that marks his best performances, \"Casablanca\" and \"Notorious\" included. Others fare equally well, including Alan Hale Sr. (his look-alike son was the Skipper on \"Gilligan's Island\") as a rascally Little John, gravelly-voiced Eugene Palette as a portly Friar Tuck, Patric Knowles as an erudite Will Scarlet, Herbert Mundin as comical Much-the-Miller's-Son and Una O'Connor as Marian's multi-married lady-in-waiting Bess. Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote the heroic music score with fervor. This is superb entertainment.The two-disc DVD set is chockfull of extras, in particular, two hour-long documentaries. One is an informative making-of 2003 feature, \"Welcome to Sherwood Forest: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood\", and the other is the even more interesting \"Glorious Technicolor\" which explains the color film-making process, ideal given that the film represents one of the best uses of the process. Also entertaining is film historian Rudy Behlmer's enthusiastic audio commentary and a Leonard Maltin-hosted replication of what the 1938 movie-going experience was like, including a trailer for \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", a newsreel, a musical short and a cartoon. There are two more Robin Hood-inspired cartoons, ancient outtakes and bloopers and trailers for 12 of Flynn's films. This is one of the more impressive DVD packages on the market.",

In his prime, he was so incredibly handsome, charming, magnetic, and passionate. It's no wonder he rocketed to stardom in Captain Blood and maintained his swashbuckling, leading man status with The Adventures of Robin Hood.In this lush, Technicolor adventure flick, Errol meets all the stock characters in scenes that are famously spoofed in Mel Brooks' Robin Hood: Men in Tights. He battles with Little John on a bridge while crossing a river, hurls a dead deer on a banquet table to insult King John, played by Claude Rains, and splits an arrow in half while in disguise during an archery contest. Maid Marian, played by Olivia de Havilland, and her ladies maid, Una O'Connor, sneak out to Robin's camp because she thinks he's cute. In addition to being riveted by the movie and the title character, you'll also find yourself cracking up as you're reminded of Mel Brooks' jokes inspired by the original.There are so many cute moments in this movie, and the humor is light and delightful. Errol Flynn's carefree persona is so appealing, and it's always a treat to see him in a Michael Curtiz movie, since they made so many great films together. Alan Hale, his famous sidekick, reprises his role as Little John from the silent movie version, and Basil Rathbone gets to show off his fencing skills again!

            "content": "\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" will remain a classic film for all time for its cast, quality and story. Films of this type never become outdated simply because they are set far in the past, whether in history, legend, or fiction. The film was made during a time when there was high interest in the past centuries of knights, fair ladies, pirates and swashbuckling action. It's a fun movie for people of all ages.Watching this movie recently brought back memories of when I first saw it around age 12. That was years after the movie was made, and when theaters in many cities and towns showed the older films at Saturday matinees. It was the early 1950s, and admission for kids was just nine cents, with the extra penny from our dime able to get one a small bag of popcorn. I think the adults paid a quarter for the older film matinees. The new feature films from Hollywood, of course, cost much more -- a whopping 35 cents for kids below 16, and 45 cents above that.In those days, we all knew who Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland and Basil Rathbone were. The first two were the young new stars when Robin Hood came out, and they were in movies made and shown in theaters after that. Basil Rathbone may have been the best known to those of us in the young audience of the day just from the late night running of Sherlock Holmes films on TV. From 1939 through the 1940s, Rathbone made 14 feature films as the famous detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. And he reprised the character on the Suspense TV series in 1951-53.Of course, most young moviegoers then didn't care or think much about the supporting casts in films. All attention was riveted on the hero, heroine, and if there was one, the villain. That's what our parents called them in the silent film days, but by our time, we just knew them as the good guys and the bad guys. That probably hasn't changed much over time. But as one watches older films decades later, our recognition, knowledge, and appreciation grows for the many supporting actors in the casts of films. How could any of those movies been made without the dedicated, talented people to play all of the roles other than the few handful of stars?So, in watching \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" again, probably for my fourth or fifth time - but at least 30 years since the last time, I relished the performances of all the actors, especially the many in supporting roles whom I'd come to know from seeing them in many other films. And what a fine bunch this Warner Brothers film has. Claude Rains as the top bad guy, Prince John, also had many leading roles in his career. With four Oscar nominations in his career, Rains will always be recognized by most movie buffs as the Vichy Police Capt. Louis Renault in the great 1942 classic, \"Casablanca.\"But two of the supporting cast were frequent players in many Hollywood comedies during its golden age - Eugene Pallette and Una O'Connor. Pallette had 226 film credits, with nearly half of them in silent films, but nearly 120 in sound pictures from 1929 through 1946. O'Connor played housekeepers, maids and cooks in some wonderful comedies through the 1940s, and then finished her acting career in TV movies, series and shows in the 1950s. Her most memorable role is as Norah in one of the best Christmas movies of all time - \"Christmas in Connecticut\" of 1945, with Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, and Sydney Greenstreet. It's the best Christmas comedy, for sure.More prolific and well-known supporting actors give fine performances in Robin Hood. Alan Hale is Little John, Ian Hunter plays King Richard and Patric Knowles plays Will Scarlett. Hale just lived to age 57 when he died in 1950. But his film credits total 248. He played in everything from Westerns, to mysteries, to war films, to dramas, to sports films; but he excelled in comedies. Hunter was in more than 100 films and TV episodes, in a variety of roles, spending his last active decade on TV in the 1950s. Likewise for Knowles, whose last two decades plus were in TV films and roles until 1973.Well, watching Robin Hood again this week, rekindled my appreciation for all the fine supporting actors who never had the fame nor made the big bucks that the stars received. But they entertained audiences and helped us root for the good guys, and to cheer for victory over them when they were the bad guys.",

            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) is a movie I recently rewatched on my DVR after recording it on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). The storyline follows the classic tale of King Richard thought captured during the religious crusades and his brother taking over the kingdom and abusing his powers. As Robinhood returns he finds his home in shambles and decides to do something about it...This movie is directed by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca) and stars Errol Flynn (Captain Blood), Olivia de Havilland (Gone with the Wind), Basil Rathbone (The Comedy of Terrors), Claude Rains (The Invisible Man), Alan Hale (The Sea Hawk) and Melville Cooper (Rebecca).This movie has a fantastic cast, well created settings, great attire and is perfectly paced. Robin Hood's intro walking in front of the king carrying a deer on his back always cracks me up. The initial proclamation by Robin Hood followed by his escape from the castle is an outstanding scene, as is his interactions with John, Friar Tuck and Maid Marian. The action scenes are very fun, as is the archery contest and the ending is fantastic.Overall this is one of the best Robin Hood movies ever created and an absolute must see. Curtiz and Flynn deliver a masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Olivia de Havilland is also great in her role, as well as Basil Rathbone (nice name) and Alan Hale.The music roars with excitement, and the loud and heroic theme for Robin is like that of Superman it's so creative.The writing is creative, fun, and makes this one of the greats. The dialogue flows effortlessly, the scenes inspire, and the romance is... well, romantic. Even the sword-fighting is great to watch. The fencing is all well done, and some of the battles -- Friar Tuck and Robin's duel in the water -- are beautifully conceived.Overall, The Adventures of Robin Hood is superior entertainment. It has a rich story, a wonderful cast, beautiful music, great sets, and engaging battles. I highly recommend this film.",

Every character and set is done to perfection and the rich early technicolor is a feast for the eyes.This isn't going to win any awards for being the most thought-provoking or technically amazing film ever, but it does to perfection what it sets out to be. A light hearted, action-packed adventure film. The plot moves along at just the right pace, not too fast but not too slow and rich with detail and has amazing and iconic scenes like the archery tournament (where reportedly the arrow stunt was a real shot) and, of course, the famous final duel between Errol Flynn as Robin Hood and the devious but equally witty Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisbourne, one of my favourite villains ever.The stunts are so real and great and the music is in my opinion hugely underrated and I enjoyed it. It's a complete film as well, so no need for sequels of any kind, apparently there was plans for a sequel but they were scrapped due to the war, I would rather have one masterpiece than a masterpiece and a low-budget sequel personally.10/10: I can't fault this film in any way, perfect for what it is",

            "content": "What we have here is possibly the highest achievement of the studio system. Perhaps \"Casablanca\" as well, but there the idea was control. Here it is excess. Today, in order to make a successful film you have to depend on one person's vision to make sure that all the various effects are orchestrated. You can see that today, the more complex the movie is, the more skills involved and particularly is mixed artificial images, the tradeoff is either less of a single vision, or less adventure in what is attempted.The studio system mitigated this. A studio had a shorthand for creative collaboration that seeped into the corporate culture, and it was never so effective as when the corporation is stretching outside of what it normally does. This was Warner's first elaborate big picture. There's magic in \"Gone With the Wind,\" but that's all story. There's a different magic in \"Wizard of Oz,\" but that's imagination and movement. And Judy.But here what we have is the sort of magic where all the parts of the created world sort of settle into a comfortable alternative existence. This sort of movie-making is about creating a world that is enough like ours that we can see how the mechanics make sense, and not just so far as love and honor. Its all about the tiny things having to do with motion and color and causality. This world is simply coherent. There are edges, but the edges all form hidden story bits that we implicitly acknowledge.Notable are two of the many textures that collaborate and meld on the way to our eye. One is the use of color. Its used architecturally, not attached to things but always as part of a composition, a harmonious composition that conveys sense. Brilliant sense, exaggerated sense, but coherent sense.The second element, no small thing, is the assembly of Olivia's body. She brings parts of this assembly: more articulated thinner hips than popular for the time. The costumer has draped her like fashion designers only leaned to do in the late eighties, when superthin, superhipswinger models were used with rich flowing, rippling cloth so that you got a subtle scintillating movement. Its all part of the world dynamic as presented here. This is a world with eyebrows from the late 30's, womanly subservience from an imagined history but a lower body overt regality that seems to anchor the cosmology we imagined with Warner.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is a film in color and one of the most important in the genre.The film seems simple and true. Scenery is beautiful. In this swashbucklers film, courage and romance alternating. These segments complement each other in a remarkable way. It is a triumph of the studio system. With adventure certainly going exterior beauty. Curtiz becomes recognizable. Picture, costumes and effects of the camera and with hindsight looks impressive. Technical segments are great, but the film would not have been so successful that the actors are not perfect around. The chemistry between Flynn (Robin Hood) and de Havilland (Lady Marian) has been seen. So much for the \"side\" of movie stars that are a perfect fit. I am delighted by the fact that each character given space. There is no place surplus in the story. When compared with the movies it's amazing.For Errol Flynn this is the best role in his career. He was acts in the film as an adventurer. The fact that he is handsome, charming and charismatic'll leave aside. His dominance, arrogance, cheerfulness and good humor that he brought to the role can not be denied. In the film history is one Robin Hood and he is Errol Flynn.Olivia de Havilland was a great natural beauty. It is logical that the camera lingering on her face and rosy cheeks. Shifts in her feelings and change of Lady Marian character is impressive.

            "content": "In 1938 Australian-born motion-picture actor Errol Flynn won the heart of Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) and defeated his evil foes as Robin Hood in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", a legendary motion picture about a Saxon knight who steals from the rich and gives to the poor oppressed people of England, based on the well known English medieval legends. Released in 1938, the film won 3 Academy Awards for art direction, film editing, and musical score, and it was nominated for that of Best Picture. It was also Selected for Registry by the National Film Preservation Board (1995). \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is listed among Warner Bros. Studio's classic films and biggest hits and solidified Flynn's image as the dashing young swashbuckler hero who always saves the day. Robin Hood (played by Errol Flynn) fights against the villainous Prince John (Claude Rains), who took control of the kingdom as regent when King Richard (Ian Hunter) was captured in Austria during his return from the Holly Lands after Third Crusade's end . Prince John conspires with Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and certain Norman Knights against his brother Richard the Lionheart so to become a King and oppresses the poor, yet faithful to Richard, Saxons. Robin Hood and his brave men waylay caravans that travel through Sherwood Forest, including one carrying Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland). Robin Hood woos Maid Marian and helps King Richard regain his throne. Even based on legends, the movie has a quiet accurate historical set and a very interesting depiction of the conflict between Norman conquerors and Saxon vassals, in medieval England. In my opinion this is one of the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Undoubtebly it's the definitive Robin Hood version, where Errol Flynn surpassed Douglas Fairbanks who had played the same role in 1922. Kevin Costner's remake of this movie and newest version (1991) on the same medieval legend, although is quiet interesting and entertaining, seems to be inferior and mediocre in all comparison to this excellent, and brilliant large-scale epic. Flynn's accent, (which sounded very English to most Americans), and the fact that he brought athletic exuberance, dashing good looks, and a sense of boyish fun, made him a natural choice to star as Sir Robin of Locksley. He plays one of his best roles with bravado and charisma ,appearing his great talent that made him a legend. Olivia de Havilland (who's really of Norman descent!!) gives an other great performance as the definitive Maid Marian, a sweetly beautiful romantic Norman heroine who's loyal to Richard and Robin's love interest. Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, Melville Cooper (the coward High Sheriff of Nottingham) and Montagu Love (as the Bishob of Black Canons) are simply perfect as villain conspirators and Rathbone displays his great talent in sword fighting in the magnificent final fencing between Gisbourne and Robin Hood which is one of the most famous scenes in cinema's history. Great and brilliant performances too from Alan Hale(Little John),Eugene Palette (astonishing as Friar Tuck), Una O'Connor (Bess), Herbert Mundin(Much the Miller's Son) and Patrick Knowles(Will Scarlett) as Locksley's loyal companions. Curtiz's direction is marvelous and authentic, art direction and costumes are splendid, Korngold's music score is unique and the Cinematography Color is astonishingly beautiful so that deserved to be awarded. The movie is excellent and give it all the stars that I can.",

Disc one has the movie in all its glorious color, plus a few extras. Disc two contains a number of interesting extras including \"Robin Hood Through The Ages\" and outtakes from the cutting room floor.I was prompted to watch it again in January 2016 right after seeing the movie \"The Last of Robin Hood\" starring Kevin Klein as Errol Flynn during his last two years, 1957 through 1959, when he started up his last affair, and with a 15-yr-old girl. That movie overlaid a fresh perspective on Flynn the person.Watched again in August 2022, always an entertaining watch. An interesting bit of trivia, the horse Maid Marian rode is the same horse that became 'Trigger', the horse Roy Rogers rode in his movies and TV shows.The Robin Hood movie itself is the classic story. It is the 12th century and King Richard the Lionheart is mostly absent on his crusades plus spending some time imprisoned. In his absence his brother Prince John began to make moves to have himself coronated as King, and also during this period unfairly taxing the peasants, often going so far as killing some of them and/or burning their houses down.An honorable man, the legendary Robin of Locksley, expert archer, could not stand for the mistreatment of his people so he began to rob the wealthy in Sherwood forest so that he could help the poor. Thus most of the movie is that theme along with Prince John and the Sheriff attempting to catch him and hang him. But King Richard returns in time and seeing what Robin was doing made him one of his own.The film is beautiful and lots of bright costuming is used. The sound is just so-so, recording techniques were pretty primitive in the 1930s.This may well be the most-known role Errol Flynn ever played, in his late 20s, as Robin Hood, exciting sword fights and escapes, plus romancing the pretty woman. She is Olivia de Havilland, about 20 and beautiful, as Maid Marian. Claude Rains is really good as the dastardly Prince John. And Ian Hunter is effective as King Richard the Lion-Heart, only returning late in the movie.",

I've watched every Robin Hood movie and TV Show (TV Show's in re-runs, with the exception of When Things Were Rotten). Robin Hood is a character who is worthy of legend. He is a character that few can really compare to. And, after seeing Errol Flynn in green tights and cap, I realized, there would never be another Robin Hood.The Adventures of Robin Hood, from Warner Brothers in glorious Technicolor is a visual masterpiece. From the green forests to the dark, castle of the would-be King, Prince John, the colors and textures really come to life. The excellent direction by Michael Curtiz allows the film to fire on all cylinders. But it is the character of Robin, portrayed by Flynn with a great smile and amazing athleticism that really wins over the viewer. We cannot deny that Flynn's smile will win over the heart of Maid Marian. Nor do we doubt when he casts his smile on his victims that they too would be overwhelmed by his charm and style. Flynn's Robin Hood is not threatening. Flynn's Robin Hood comes across as happy and carefree, fighting for what he believes in. When the time comes for Robin to be serious and fight it out with his enemies, we are equally drawn in, ready to believe that we're watching the greatest hero/anti-hero ever imagined.No hero is complete without a great adversary. For Robin, his enemy has always been the Sheriff of Nottingham, but here we have, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, perfectly portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Naturally, Sir Guy takes his orders from Prince John, the great Claude Rains showing a slightly feminine side of a would-be-king. Prince John's associates are all evil and conniving, the Sheriff of Nottingham is played for laughs by Melville Cooper, allowing Sir Guy to be the really bad guy that hates Robin Hood.There is too much about this movie to like -- Robin's \"Merry Men\" are robustly and warmly portrayed by Alan Hale, Patrick Knowles and Eugene Palette as Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck, respectively. The glorious Technicolor vision of Sherwood Forest and the complete cast of characters that includes the Una O'Connor in a fun role as Maid Marian's guardian. There is humor and action and, of course, romance as only old Hollywood could make it. Michael Curtiz deftly moves between humor and action with an amazing style so the view hardly notices the difference.I've watched Douglas Fairbanks, Kevin Costner and Patrick Bergin try their hand at the character, I've watched the old TV series, the Disney cartoon and Mel Brooks satirical \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\", right down to Ridley Scott's great retelling of the story with Russel Crowe. None of these compare to Errol Flynn in the Adventures of Robin Hood. Costner was way too wooden to be a true swashbuckler. Bergin was a little too uptight to be interesting. The TV show was... well, it was a 1950's TV show... Even Richard Lester's \"Robin and Marian\" falls a little short, though Connery is great as an older Robin Hood, complete with a winning, fun-loving smile. Flynn was fun and adventurous. We believe he could split the other archer's arrow. We believe that he could win the heart of Maid Marian and that his men would gladly follow him in to the Lion's den. We cheered for him because he was fun and he looked upon everything with a grin. We believe that he will protect the throne for good King Richard and save all of England, because we see that spark in his eyes telling us nothing is impossible.I'm a huge fan of Robin Hood. If the old stories of Robin Hood did not make me a fan, Errol Flynn did. There will never be another Robin Hood to compare with what Flynn brought to the screen. If you're checking out the Kevin Costner Robin Hood or the Russel Crowe version, take a look at what Flynn did first and you will be amazed by what you see. Allow yourself to go back in time and meet this man who was charming and fun and so full of life that all would gladly follow him. You too will become a fan of Robin Hood -- and probably a fan of Errol Flynn.",

I wonder if either director had seen \"Robin Hood\".\nThe colour scheme of \"Henry V\", often said to be based on the Book of Hours, seems to owe a lot to Carl Jules Weyl's (and Natalie Kalmus's) full-blooded palette. The procession of outlaws disguised as black-cowled monks into Prince John's coronation recalls the oprichniki entering the cathedral behind the Tsar in Part Two of Eisenstein's paranoid epic.Whatever, \"Robin Hood\" is a lot of fun. Kids who see it for the first time don't realise it was shot over 60 years ago. It exemplifies Warner's, and Curtiz's, understanding that a movie must keep moving. It never halts to wallow in its production values; its rat-tat-tat narrative, badinage and use of light and shadows are in line with the aesthetic of WB's gangster pictures. Korngold's score is likewise brisk and stirring, never langorous. Maybe this happy marriage between prestige and the studio's style of taut, urgent storytelling is what has made this unquestionably the most enjoyable of pre-war epics.

That goes for this film in spades, as Hale is Flynn's \"John Little\" The choice of actors was fine with me... I read that this film was to be done with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. NO! NO! -It would have been turned into a musical with two bellowers! And Then Cagney was supposed to play Robin Hood, I'm glad THAT did not happen although I like Cagney very much, Cagney is a lug, the Robin Hood part required an actor that could be elegant: So, Flynn is fine, except his fake laugh all through the film is a bother.Well, I suppose if I had seen this in a theatre when it came out, I would have been overawed. It is in colour... They use real arrows and not CGI arrows... Howard Hill's bulls-eye that split the arrow was real.The story of Robin Hood has been told and re-told for 700 years. This particular telling of it is pretty enjoyable, even though it leaves out some of the other incidents attributed to the Robin Hood story.I'll take this version over \"Prince of Thieves\" any day of the week.An episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" parodied this film, and I did not know how much until I saw this today: They even copied the sword fight choreography. So, when it comes down to it, when you think of Robin Hood, you always think of this movie.",

Yes I had seen it many times before, this time it was a beautiful copy from the TCM Flynn collection. It was the best print of the film I've seen yet. Like when I viewed 'The Adventures of Don Juan' the other day, I found I wanted to pause many scenes to study them like a painting. Especially impressive where the jewels on the elaborate costumes at court, the dresses Ms. De Havalland wore, and the outfits on Claude Rains and the others. This movie has it all, fine acting, action, very witty dialog, Flynn in his prime, Olivia de Havilland at her most lovely, beautiful costumes/sets...and rich Technicolor to show them all off to their fullest. I don't mean to reduce Olivia de Havalland to her appearance because she is of course an excellent actress and not just a very pretty face. We even get two of the best screen villains ever, Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone. Add to all that the talents of Michael Curtiz as director, the rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and you have a masterpiece of cinema. Here are my two favorite lines from the wonderful dialog: Lady Marian Fitzswalter: \"Why, you speak treason!\" Robin Hood: \"Fluently.\" And Will Scarlett: \"Robin, I've just got word of- \" -sees Friar Tuck and breaks off- Robin Hood: \"It's all right, he's one of us.\" Will Scarlett: \"One of us?

The ideal hero must do good, defeat evil, have a good time, and win the girl. The adventures of Robin Hood is like a textbook on how to get that right\".What did they do to get it right? In the first place they took some liberties with the literary sources. To put in some action they added a whiff of Ivanhoe to the Robin Hood story. To put in some romance they added the character of maid Marian.In the second place they treated the directors as craftsmen rather than as \"auteurs\". William Keighley did the exterior scenes, Michael Curtiz dit the interior scenes and other available directors (in between jobs?) did some scenes without the main characters. The directors of the French \"Nouvelle vague\" would have been horrified by such an approach (you don't replace the auteur of a novel halfway, do you?) but in this film it worked well.For the actors the system worked not so good. Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood was a worthy successor of Douglas Fairbanks but would become a victim of typecasting in the rest of his career. Olivia de Havilland playing maid Marian struggled hard for mor serious roles. She had to fight a legal struggle with the studio she had a contract with and was banned from acting in a movie for three years. In the end she survived.",

            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)If Disney was making non-animated features in the 1930s, this is what one would look like. And feel like. It's bright (the Technicolor is amazing), it's snappy, and it's cheerful. It has bits of humor throughout, and a likable hero who is a little super extra good at everything, and it has a slightly fairy tale quality to it all. That is to say, it's pure entertainment, and good stuff at its best.And so it's a long long way from the 2009 Robin Hood which I only saw parts of, but which takes its violence very seriously, and its hero. This 1938 movie was made a year before the \"Wizard of Oz\" (another Technicolor fairy tale) and it dazzles as well as enchants. And even more than that more famous movie, \"Robin Hood\" is for kids. Adults can enjoy it, but it struck me as just silly at times.The director, Michael Curtiz, is one of those malleable experts who four years later would make \"Casablanca,\" and you might not see any resemblance for good reasons. Except that both are so well made. Four years after that was \"Mildred Pierce,\" another masterpiece, and Curtiz again shows his chops. \"Robin Hood\" takes full advantage of its stars (Olivia de Havilland being a little miscast in my view but Claude Rains pulling off his own transformation very well), and it pulls out every larger than life tidbit in the Robin Hood legend, which is great stuff. The story, above all, is one we can relate to, fighting evil with wit and panache and a little good bow and arrow work. It even has some of the tropes of a later classic, \"Seven Samurai,\" as a band of talented rebels is gathered together one by one to fight the oppressive regimes. \"Robin Hood\" ended up just a little too lighthearted for my adult taste, but I know the kid in most of us will enjoy it straight through.",

            "content": "SPOILERS The tale of Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest is one of the most famous stories about English History. Whether Robin ever actually existed or not is questionable, but with characters like Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck and Little John, everyone deep down wants there to be an element of truth. Told by Hollywood on countless different occasions and staring many different actors (Sean Connery and Kevin Costner to name two), the finest interpretation of the story is the original film staring Hollywood Rogue Errol Flynn. Made a year before the outbreak of World War II, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a swashbuckling epic in it's own right with classic lines, romance and enough sword play to last a lifetime.King Richard I of England, known more popularly as Richard the Lionheart, has gone to fight the holy war. Whilst away, Richard's younger brother, the treacherous Prince John (Claude Rains) plots to overthrow him. Only one man stands to protect the King's throne and his name is Robin Hood (Flynn).As a Hollywood star, Errol Flynn was legendary for being a bit of a ladies man. Using that charisma on the screen, Flynn shows all too easily why he is the finest Robin Hood ever. Putting future Hoods to shame, he romances Maid Marion (Olivia de Havilland), he fights for freedom and he makes jokes, and all with a huge grin on his face. His Robin is a fresh faced, almost immature Robin, who attracts himself to everyone and never stops people from caring.As well as the star, his enemy Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) is also cleverly played. Rathbone gives an air of pure evil about his character and he displays a strong feeling of hatred for Robin. Whether this hatred is for his principles, the humiliation or the love of Marion, Gisbourne is portrayed as a man with a simple mission of revenge, and Basil Rathbone does this perfectly.At a time when swashbuckling adventures were all the rage, there were no better films than this. Feeling a bit dated in the modern world perhaps, this film shows us the sort of film which was Box Office Gold. With some credible performances by heroes and villains alike, it keeps the audience entertained throughout and it never ceases to impress. If you want to watch anything staring Errol Flynn, or you want to watch how to do swashbuckling properly, this is your film.",

And if I may say so, Marian (Olivia de Havilland) looks really hot in some of those dresses! There's something else that I notice. Little John (Alan Hale) makes some comments about Friar Tuck's weight. Alan Hale, Jr., as we know, played The Skipper and received the same sorts of remarks from Gilligan!

The Technicolor STILL dazzles, the action STILL excites, the music STILL haunts and it can only get better now this perfect movie has received the Digital remastered treatment for it's DVD release.I won't go into the plot here, because unless you're a visitor from another planet, you will already know about the Robin Hood legend.

Korngold had already written a great score for Captain Blood, and when it came to writing music for 'Period Movies' Not even Max Steiner could touch him.The Robin Hood tale has been filmed many many times and I've seen most of 'em, but NONE of them hold a candle to this beaut.Kevin Costner, Douglas Fairbanks, and Patrick Bergin, are just footnotes when reviewing the cinematic history of Robin Hood. Errol Flynn to me, is the one and only definitive Screen Robin Hood, and I don't think anyone else will EVER come close.If I were a lifestyle guru, I would give three tips on how to enrich your life, a) get married, b) have children, c) watch The Adventures Of Robin Hood.",

            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood holds up remarkably well, perhaps because it focuses on the story elements which have had universal appeal throughout the centuries. Unlike the regrettable Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, which tried to give the hero a ponderous psychological complexity, the 1938 film offers a fast paced examination of what is essentially a man of action.The film is able to dispense with any lengthy exposition simply by portraying its characters in easily identifiable terms - either as valorous champion of liberty, or as hissable oppressor, with no room for grey shading. Although characterization is elementary, the purpose of the story is not;  it was meant not only as a tonic for depression weary audiences, but as a warning to foreign despots who might try to disrupt the world stage.Several elements in the film stand out: the breathtaking colour photography, spirited if not historically authentic battle scenes, and Korngold's vibrant score. What stands out the most, however, are the performances of a flawless cast. Errol Flynn, here at his physical peak, displays both effortless panache and a winning sincerity. In contrast, Rathbone's vicious Guy of Gisbourne is defined not only by his own sneering persona but by  the manifold suffering he inflicts on the peasants. Alan Hale, Eugene Palette, and Herbert Mundin provide sturdy performances and comic moments, but possibly the best performance belongs to Claude Rains. His effete Prince John is a villain for all seasons. The bold, often broad performances are in keeping with the straightforward narrative.The enchanting, storybook texture of the visuals, combined with vivid acting and action, is a welcome relief from some of today's jaded cinema.Trivia Note: During the forest banquet, Flynn blows one of his lines. When talking to Maid Marian, he says \"kindness instead of riches.\" According to the screenplay, it should be \"kindness instead of whips.\"",

            "content": "The story of Robin Hood is one of those timeless classics that has been done so many times it is almost too familiar to make uniquely and special. I have seen many other versions of this story, particularly the Disney version from 1952 and the beloved animated version from 1983. What both of those lacked was a professionalism in the action sequences and chemistry in the romantic scenes. You can't really expect that from a children's movie, but here all is done right and this is certainly the best of all versions as well as one of the finest action movies in history.He isn't mentioned much these days, but I believe Errol Flynn might well be the finest action star in all of the movies. He had such charisma, such ability and such attractiveness that he made the ideal hero; here he is someone who is rebellious and devious and we love him and root for him every step of the way. In their third teaming, Flynn and Olivia de Havilland were magnificent in their scenes, though few there were. Together they brought about the term on-screen chemistry in a way very few actors can do today. Basil Rathbone is every bit a villain in every way Flynn is a hero and their climactic sword fight is a dazzling spectacle of good, old-fashioned stunt-work and swordplay.Director Michael Curtiz, though difficult to work with he was, knew exactly how to bring about a story on screen. Here, he sticks to the basics and injects the many action sequences with bravado and excitement as well as the more quieter scenes with tranquil but lovingly care. Here, it all works. The cast is superb, the plot is simple but straightforward, the sets look terrific and the costumes are so realistic and eye-catching with the array of beautiful colors. This was a common Technicolor spectacle in the 1930s, and it is a great shame we don't get these today. Rather we are succumbed to the saturated bloody violence of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie or an Underworld sequel. Those have very few characters and all bloody carnage. This has neither but a good story, great characters and an exciting fight to the finish. Intolerance is a beautiful thing.",

Olivia DeHavilland looking sweet and innocent as only she could, plays Maid Marion. Claude Rains as the sniveling and conniving Prince John, Basil Rathbone as the evil hissable Sir Guy of Gisbourne and Melville Cooper as the Sheriff of Nottingham are the chief villains of the peace. Alan Hale (in a role he played in the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks version) reprises the part of Little John. Patric Knowles a drinking and partying pal of Flynn, plays Will Scarlett. Eugene Palette is very good as Friar Tuck. The action sequences are now legendary. There is the archery tournament, battles in Sherwood Forest between the Merry Men and Prince John's forces,the first meetings between Robin and Little John and Friar Tuck, the fencing duels culminating with the final duel to the finish between Flynn and Rathbone. Rathbone was an expert fencer in real life and what Flynn lacked in skill, he more than made up for in athletic ability. This made for a very convincing fight where both actors performed most if not all of the action.  Flynn's private life was the source of many headlines, but he was never better than he was as Robin Hood. It is no wonder that this film has endured to this day.

            "content": "The 1938 version of The Adventures of Robin Hood is quite the feat \u0085 for 1938. This adventure film is definitely dated, but don't let that get you down; it is still a highly entertaining movie. I can see how innovative and successful it would have been upon its release and I respect all its achievements. However, it just has that stigma of a hammy, fun story wrapped around sword fights, romance, and political intrigue. It is the definitive version of the story, if not the best orchestrated in my opinion, because you can see glimpses here that were stolen for all the other iterations. Disney pretty much appropriated it all for their animated version and Cary Elwes was channeling Errol Flynn's portrayal of the bandit stealing from the rich and giving to the poor throughout Mel Brooks' Men in Tights. The only question I have upon the viewing is whether Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe will create something truly unique with the upcoming Nottingham, or whether they also will appropriate much from this tale, based on the legends of Robin Hood.Everyone knows the story, King Richard has gone off to fight the Crusades and his evil, treacherous brother Prince John has usurped his proxy to seize control of the kingdom. Conniving to take the throne for good, John raises taxes and makes life horrible for the Saxons as any good Norman would. When the King is rumored to have been captured and held for ransom, the time to complete his coup is upon the nation. Only one man, Sir Robin of Locksley, takes the job of keeping the will of the true King alive. He begins to round up a ragtag army and starts becoming a huge thorn in the Prince's side. The back and forth commences, fighting ensues, romances bud from unlikely pairings, and justice is put up in the air to either be defended or thrown to the side. It's Robin Hood's Merry Men versus the Prince's loyally traitorous entourage \u0085 I wonder what the outcome could possibly be? This is a big studio Technicolor picture on our hands. I have to imagine it was all shot on a soundstage due to the presence of some fantastic matte paintings, (the use of which makes me think it was not filmed outdoors). It is always a pleasure to watch characters move farther and farther from the foreground towards something that doesn't exist. To make that look realistic is definitely a success. And the amount of detail and authenticity is astounding. The Medieval garb and castles are realistic; as is the muddy forest our heroes live and train in.It's all shot well too. The fight scenes are manic and exciting, moving at a speed so fast I have to believe it was over-cranked footage of slower choreography. With many cuts and reaction shots, the story is explained well by facial features and the orchestration of scenes. One cannot forget a wonderful moment during a fight between Robin Hood and Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Prince John's second in command. The battle continues on through the castle until it reaches the dungeons. After going down the stairs, our swordsmen fall off the screen to be illuminated as shadows, looming over the huge stone column in the center of the frame. It is all one continuous take, leading us from a visual of them, to the shadowplay, to the return in frame of the two, still slugging it out. A beautifully shot sequence, it is what I remember most vividly from the screening.My one surprise through it all comes from the character of Sir Guy. Who is this guy? I thought the Sheriff of Nottingham was the main baddie under Prince John's ill-rule. I guess all the other versions I know of have combined these two roles and made the Sheriff into an icon of villainy, when, in fact, he is just a bumbling cop stumbling his way under Sir Guy, the real brains of the operation. It was my one head-scratcher, but a difference I kind of liked. Having the Sheriff a bit of a dullard worked against Basil Rathbone's villainy nicely, because Robin Hood should have a worthy adversary. It was the biggest change of the ones I could spot\u0097many others were just lack of detail and background. Much is glossed over for this blockbuster version: Friar Tuck's drunkenness is alluded to briefly, but never spoken of I believe; Robin Hood's taking from the rich is largely assumed, but never really shown; etc. This telling decided to go more for the high adventure, portraying our hero as infallible, than let any darkness creep in and add a little tension and duality of nature that could work so well in this tale.That said; it was largely about the romance between Robin and Maid Marian. At first two very different people, a relationship the farthest thing from her mind, they soon fall for each other, as you know they will. Olivia de Havilland is effective as the girl needing protection, but she is also much more. There is a sense of royalty with her, always looking for a way to be free and independent. She has a strong will and spirit, never afraid to stand up for her beliefs, no matter the consequences. She is then the perfect candidate to catch Robin Hood's eye. And boy does Errol Flynn take a look. His performance is a lot of fun as he hams up every moment with a witty oneliner as he partakes in a fight with swords or words. His ego is so big that his confidence will never quit. One could say he should fail on hubrus alone, but he is the hero and we love heroes. Flynn does not disappoint in that regard as he dons the tights and keeps Britain safe for his King's hopeful return.",

It was definitely worth every penny: `Robin Hood' is not just the best Robin Hood film ever, but one of the most consistently perfect and entertaining movies ever made.To begin with, the casting was excellent, and I'm not just talking about Errol Flynn.  Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisbourne, Claude Rains as Prince John, Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, Alan Hale as Little John\u0085 those faces and voices are permanently embedded in cinema folklore.  The direction from William Keighley and Michael Curtiz is crisp and tight, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's music carries us along.  But, in the end, the movie belongs to Errol Flynn, the greatest Robin Hood of all.  Flynn practically flies through the movie, carrying us aloft on the wings of his joy.  His Robin Hood (unlike certain non-English-accented Robins) is having a ball.  I really love the way he laughs: planting his hands on his hips, throwing back his head, and laughing long, hard and loud like he doesn't have a care in the world.  To paraphrase the philosopher, if Robin Hood didn't exist, Errol Flynn would have created him.\"Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a time capsule back to a time when big-budget adventure movies didn't have CGI special effects and big explosions to carry them along.  Occasionally, they had to rely on things like a good script, good acting, and a sense of fun.  That's the big thing about \"Adventures\" -- it's fun to watch.  Joy practically explodes from every frame.  I defy you to watch this movie and not come away with a grin on your face.Why, oh why, isn't this movie out on DVD?",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I didn't have this version of Robin Hood - not that it wasn't allowed or anything, it just wasn't on my radar; when it came to my Robin Hood stories, the animated Disney and Mel Brooks versions were more my speed. I wish now, seeing it as a grown man, I had had that experience as a kid, to take in this experience of full on Golden-Age Hollywood escapism. This is a real MOVIE with a capital M, directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and it was shot in that lush, just-starting-out 3-strip technicolor. The color in the movie is the first thing to comment on: it makes everything pop - the costumes, the hats, the sets, the outdoors in the Sherwood forest and at the archery tournament and other set pieces - and it's one of those films from the time that you can't picture not being in full, vibrant color (Wizard of Oz may be the go-to, but also the Archer films, no pun intended, like the Red Shoes and Black Narcsissus in the next decade). It makes me regret I didn't get to see it in a restoration print or a blu-ray, but the DVD works fine as well.You may all know the story of Robin Hood - whether the Normans and the Saxons are always mentioned in your particular version may vary - about how jolly but loyal Outlaw Robin of Locksley (here by the irrepressible Errol Flynn) gathering up a gang of Merry Men to revolt against the dastardly Prince John and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone respectively, the latter is basically the Sheriff if you know the story that way). There's triumphs and tribulations, and a romance that blossoms between Robin and Maid Marian. Interestingly enough in this version, by the way, Marian is the one who really has the most growth in the story, starting as a prissy Norman royal lady, and through seeing first hand what Robin is doing, opening up her mind and heart, she sees what side is really up. That was fascinating to me, at least compared to other versions I've watched.But why see this movie today when you've got so many other versions - aside from the Brooks parody and anthropomorphic Disney musical, you got Costner and Crowe in more recent adaptations? Well... this one is the best, pretty much. Rather, it really is the version of the tale that embraces the full Adventure of the title, how Robin goes about first finding the men who will join him (his first interactions of meeting Little John, with a banter-y fight on a log, and with Friar Tuck and his piece of meat and fish, are unabashedly delightful), and even with its brief depictions of violence and torture it's not a troubling movie. It's meant as a \"family\" movie, but it doesn't pander to kids or adults. It delivers on just being a solid, straightforward spectacle.Every part has to be cast right for a lot of this to work, and boy is it ever! It's a treat find movies nowadays where the hero is so charismatic and charming - usually it's the villain that takes the cake in the personality dimensions - but here, Flynn is a rock and roll star, full of charisma, cunning, and every so often he can play serious just fine, but we want to see him telling off the bad guys, sneaking in through a passage that seems tough to crack, and kissing the girl in the middle of the night via window. It's a part and performance that might seem old fashioned, but it lacks wholly any cynicism, and the filmmaking follows in kind. All the same, it's joyful to see Rains and Rathbone as the villains, especially Rains gets to ham it up a little in a character who is never less than 'I want ALL the Monarchy!' And Olivia de Havilland, beautiful, but also a terribly good actress, especially for this role where, again, she has to be the character to change over the course of the movie - and it all works. (Well, one little nitpick may be Robin's costume at the archery tournament - who are you fooling really, and same goes for a certain King late in the movie, but I digress).Along with the Korngold music, with themes that feel like he's on set giving spot-on directions to every next shot and set up, and especially the fight sequences, it's hard not to feel the influence this has had on action movies ever since; Star Wars being chief among them, to the point where I'm not sure that movie could exist the same way without the high-flying feats and boyish humor. Or, rather again, it'd be nice if this had *more* of an influence. The pacing of the whole thing is efficient as can be; not a story beat is wasted, and things move along without anything dragging or making things unlikely, and it's such a breath of fresh air after many years of modern blockbusters and spectacles which don't have much more depth than this but are much longer in length (Scott's own Robin Hood for one).It's all in all a triumph of Hollywood movie-making - if not one of the \"Great Films\", it's certainly the sort that you should show your kids, for the perspective outside of what they're used to in Disney and such. I imagine, or should just know, that you don't know what made Errol Flynn such a massive figure in the industry without his work here.",

            "content": "\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is by many seen as the best effort on the story of Robin Hood so far. I have not seen the other attempts, so I cannot say if I agree, but somehow I cannot believe that they are all worse as this is not a great film by any means. The first half I have to say was occasionally really bad. Flynn seemed completely miscast and the way he was written with all his cockiness, arrogant and boastful behavior it did not work out at all. Also the fact that he shows up to see John with all these soldiers around is not very credible. So yeah, the script did not wow me at all initially and I was truly disappointed with Flynn's performance. The worst thing, however, is the way he meets his future companions and his awful laugh. It gets a lot better in the second half of the film (the writing and Flynn's performance as both becomes a bit more subtle) and the movie actually becomes pretty entertaining. A lot of that is thanks to the two antagonists (played by the multi-Oscar nominated Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains) and to Olivia de Havilland.The film is directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz, who directed the classic \"Casablanca\" 4 years after \"Robin Hood\". If you have seen the World-War-II classic, you will know that this is completely in black and white, while \"Robin Hood\" is entirely in technicolor. And that is the biggest strength of the movie. It is truly a feast visually. The costumes are great, the sets are simply wonderful and all the beautiful colors really make this film special. The music is fine too and the soundtrack is one of the three Academy Awards wins the film scored in 1939.So, as I already said, the second half is where the film really steps it up. The only scene I did not really like was when Robin goes to the shooting contest despite his friends telling him it is a trap. And of course, he ends up in prison right away. I am just not a fan of the heroic, but not particularly bright Robin Hood in this movie and Flynn did not convince me at all either. The film is a mixture of drama, costume piece, history lesson (Normans vs. Saxons), love story and comedy, although the comedy parts I did not find really funny at all, maybe because of the aforementioned hysteric laugh which I found particularly cringeworthy. Other than that, the film is a good example that you don't need heavy gun fights to include entertaining action sequences. The sword fighting scenes near the end was fun.Pay attention to how Hood kills Gisbourne at the end and not John. Gisbourne was the initial rival for him when it comes to Maid Marian and he also was the more sinister one. Of course, Prince Johnw as evil too, but I felt his wickedness had more to do with thirst for power and Gisbourne was the true sadist. The bad guys get what they hate the most at the end and the hero gets the girl and everything is fine. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is an interesting film and I recommend it to watch for its visual impact, but it is also interesting to consider that when this came out the world was at really dark times, at least as dark as those in the film. And finally, a little snippet of information that Olivia de Havilland is most likely the only person still alive who worked on this movie. She stands at 98 currently and thumbs crossed she reaches 100. She is one of the standouts of the film and really lifted it up in the face of her frequently-not-so-brilliant leading male counterpart.",

            "content": "Of all the swashbuckling collaborations between actor Errol Flynn and director Michael Curtiz, this is probably the best. Although their pictures together generally recycled the same elements over and over, this is the one effort in which it all comes together, and everything is right on the money.First off, this has to be the best screenplay Curtiz and Flynn were given. The story is very tight, unlike the sometimes uneven plots of their other pictures. The first half hour or so is episodic \u0096 literally a series of adventures as the title suggests \u0096 with all the essential Robin Hood characters getting their own introductory scene. It then solidifies into the central story of the villain's plot to get rid of the hero. Historical accuracy is thrown out of the window, but that doesn't real matter. The dialogue is very witty and full of memorable quotes, even if it is a bit pretentiously literary at times.Adventures of Robin Hood also has the fullest and most rounded cast of characters. There are plenty of likable good guys, with none of the annoying sidekicks that sometimes plagued these films. Will Scarlet (Patrick Knowles) isn't really given a personality and he's a bit of a spare part \u0096 but that's a minor worry. With these swashbucklers there was also usually a kind of spread betting going on with the villains, and this is no exception. So you have the campy, dastardly villain (Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne), the calm, detached villain who doesn't get his hands dirty (Claude Rains as Prince John) and the bungling, incompetent villain (Melville Cooper as the Sheriff of Nottingham).The biggest weakness in the story is the obligatory love theme between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Following the same pattern as in Captain Blood, Dodge City and so forth, it has her despising him at first, him capturing her then demonstrating his moral superiority, and her suddenly realising she's in love with him. As a love story it seems a bit bizarre, even sinister to me. Ironically the other love story in this film, the affection between Much the Miller and Bess, is far more touching and easier to identify with, even though it mainly exists for comic relief.Michael Curtiz's direction is at its sharpest here. Although he was very versatile, his real strengths were in the action genre. He had a brilliant eye for crowd scenes and there are plenty of stunning examples here. Also, at a time when camera movements were often shaky and untidy, he handles these huge sweeps across massive sets that are perfectly smooth and expertly planned. He even works in a bit of subtle visual humour in the first scene in the castle hall, where the camera takes in the entire court and, just as the herald announces \"His highness, Prince John\", finally comes to rest not on the Prince himself but on a dog eating off the floor under his table. The Adventures of Robin Hood also contains the best climactic battle scene of any of his pictures. The final duel between Flynn and Basil Rathbone really gets your pulse racing. There's a brilliant use of shadows in this scene (often overused in Curtiz films, in my opinion) when the two duellists disappear off the bottom of the frame, only to cast two huge shadows and continue the action.At this time Technicolor was a rare luxury and many filmmakers were still feeling their way with colour. Michael Curtiz was well ahead of the game. He dresses the villains in blaring, clashing colours \u0096 wealthy but tasteless. The outlaws on the other hand are in warm, natural shades which blend in with the forest surroundings. The cinematography, which deservedly won an Oscar, beautifully brings the countryside to life, and looks like something made twenty years later.Errol Flynn of course wasn't really an amazing actor. He simply had a certain look and a certain manner that was ideal for this kind of character. Here he's at his swashbuckling best. Olivia de Havilland gives her usual worthy but dull performance as the female lead. However the greatest strength here is in the supporting cast. There was a fantastic crew of character actors who cropped up time and again throughout Curtiz's Warner Brothers pictures, and most of them are on display here \u0096 Alan Hale, Una O'Connor, Herbert Munchin, and of course two of the best villains of their era \u0096 Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains. As is so often the case, it's these smaller parts that really make the film sparkle.At the end of the day these kind of pictures are nothing more than good fun, but with a director like Curtiz at the helm they could also be incredibly professional. The Adventures of Robin Hood is probably the most professional Errol Flynn action picture he made. You have the best screenplay, the best acting line-up, the tightest direction and I wouldn't say the best but certainly a very good Erich Wolfgang Korngold score. It's a real treat to watch and still holds up seventy years since it was made.",

Yet....after two viewings - the second being a year or so ago when the fabulous-looking DVD came out, I doubt if I would watch it again. I just had a hard time keeping interest on the second look.Perhaps I just got tired of seeing Olivia de Havilland's typical role in these films where she's always against Flynn until the very end. That gets tiresome, film after film. It isn't her fault; it's the writers.Maybe it was because Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains annoyed me too much, too, although they are the villains and we aren't supposed to like them in the first place. Maybe that's just my preferences as I prefer Rathbone as the good guy Holmes instead of the nasty villains he often played in pre-Holmes days. Whatever the case, I can't knock the movie: it looks great, Flynn is an appropriate choice to play Robin Hood, it's a classic old-fashioned adventure story and still holds up well today, and please watch this on the restored DVD to see it \"in all it's glory,\" as one critic put it. It has to rank as one of the best adventure stories of its day and the colors are astounding. But after seeing a lot of the Flynn films, frankly, I get tired of seeing the two same faces in his movies: de Havilland and Alan Hale's, and the latter's obnoxiously loud boorish characters grow tiresome, too.

By the time that Erroll Flynn played the role of Robin Hood, Hollywood had developed its concept of chivalry and old time story telling up to a high point which has never been surpassed. Possibly the reason is that the ideal way of presenting classic tales of universal appeal, of which \"Adventures of Robin Hood\" is a great example, may always be much the same.Think of those children's classics that have remained popular ever since the 19th century. Like the Grimm Brothers, the creators of \"Adventures of Robin Hood\" and other great Hollywood movies of the golden age have created a standard in story telling that seems impossible to equal, which is quite a challenge to contemporary artists. How many actors today have the swordsmanship of Basil Rathbone or Erroll Flynn, or the ability those two great actors had to toss off classic dramatic lines so naturally it is as if they had arrived in Hollywood straight out of the pages of an old story book.Commentators who complain that classic movies seem dated or artificial and need a lot of updating if remade should see this movie and compare it to films on similar themes made in the 80s and 90s. In spite of the passing years, no one has devised a better approach even for a sophisticated audience.",

The movie simply brings perfect swashbuckling entertainment and it is hard to believe at times that the movie was made in 1938, it still is great, spectacular and fun to watch these days.The movie has a wonderful cast; Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains. Errol Flynn truly was THE biggest swashbuckler hero of all time, he fits every hero role he plays perfectly. Also Basil Rathbone was memorable in his role. He has got such a great charismatic look. Basil Rathbone is probably best known by most people as playing Sherlock Holmes in several movies.The movie's setting is truly epic and has some great looking sets. Only troubling thing are the costumes. The colors of the costumes are so extremely bright that it almost looks ridicules. It's like they wanted to impress the audience by showing how bright they could bring colors to the big screen.The musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is once more spectacular and memorable. He really was one of the greatest movie composers of all time! For this movie he received his second Academy Award. This movie further more received Acedemy Awards for its art direction and film editing. Truly the three right Oscar's that it deserved to win.The action and sword-fights might look a bit simple and laughable at times but it still manages to impress at the right times. But seriously, why did they let the merry men keep on jumping on horses from tree's? It's almost like they put that stunt in every action scene the movie has.The story is told in a good way and it doesn't waste any time on character introduction. We jump right into the action, without knowing exactly what Robin Hood's motivations are but still we immediately understand that he's the hero. Also the love story is handled nicely without ever getting over-the-top or unbelievable in any way.Perfect fun entertainment, even for almost now 70 years later.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

He was a work horse who directed many, many films throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, and he had a tremendous range, from gritty gangster movies like \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" to musical spectacles like \"White Christmas.\" And he gave us what many consider to be one of the top two or three best movies of all time, \"Casablanca.\" But his films have an assembly-line efficiency to them that prevents them from rising to the top of my personal favorites list. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" hits all of its marks, but it feels like it could have been directed by anybody.This film won three of four Oscars in 1938, which was enough to make it the most awarded film in the year that saw the Best Picture award go to \"You Can't Take It with You.\" It won for Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score, losing only in the category of Best Picture. It surely would have received a nomination for Best Cinematography had color films not been made ineligible for the competitive cinematography award and instead granted a special award when color was still relatively new to Hollywood.Grade: B+",

Directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley pull off the time period with effective costumes and art direction suitable at its release. Errol Flynn plays the free spirited Robin Hood full of resources and fight as he defends the oppressed We can expect an action climax of high standards but what we cannot expect is a female lead that pays off. Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian is too straight forward as she has a change of heart and falls for him. She is useless and only serves as the fling Robin steals away from the greedy. In the end it becomes the weakest element of the film. Basil Rathbone plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne who will stop at nothing to have Robin arrested but it backfires every time concluding with his ultimate dismiss. Claude Rains plays the evil Prince John whose greed knows no limits and whose plans will be met with consequences when outsmarted by Robin Hood. Alan Hale Sr play Little John who is sighted as the second up to Robin Hood. While some elements are corny the action is spot on delivered with a touch of humour. Overrated yet often fun filled pointless action farce. Score: 5 \u00bd / 10",

            "content": "Compare this with \"The Sea Hawk\".  It was made for the same studio by the same director with the same stars, the same composer and much the same production crew.  Both films are adventures centred around a swashbuckling hero.  But Captain Thorpe in \"The Sea Hawk\" REALLY swashbuckles, while Robin Hood never quite comes to life, or at least, not as much as we expect him to.  Because of the bright colours, because of Erich Korngold's wonderful score - it sounds better every time I hear it - and because of the aura surrounding the Robin Hood legends themselves, we tend not to notice, but \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" has a surprisingly weak script, and Errol Flynn was one of those stars who was as good as, but never better than, his material.Robin has it too easy.  In the second scene in which he appears, he swashbuckles his way in and out of the heart of the villain's stronghold, in full view, for no good reason, without breaking a sweat - so how can we take seriously the idea that he is ever in any danger?  \"The Sea Hawk\", making no more concession to realism than \"Robin Hood\" did, established that Captain Thorpe's peril was real.  When Thorpe is captured he's well and truly captured - and what's more, he's humbled.  We cheer all the louder when he escapes.Admittedly it's not easy to adapt the Robin Hood  stories for the screen. They're too timeless.  Robin Hood lives in the forest, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor; it's as if he was always there and will always be there, and this isn't an easy situation to turn into a story with a beginning and an end.  The old legends provide us with no very convincing beginning and with two consecutive endings - the happy one we're all familiar with, and a second set years later, so sad it negates the first. (Most films don't even dare hint at it.)I'm straying from the point...  Basically, this 1938 Robin Hood is all very well - good fun, and all that - but try, if you can, to see these:(1)  The animated Disney version of 1973.  Yes, it's studded with anachronisms; yes, it's hard to find two characters who belong to the same species; but that fox is closer to being an ideal Robin Hood than any human I've seen.(2)  The OTHER 1991 version, starring Patrick Bergen.  A strange attempt to be true to the spirit of the stories within the bounds of warts-and-all realism.  It mostly succeeds.(3)  The 1922 version, starring Douglas Fairbanks.  I haven't seen this one myself, much as I'd like to - I'm recommending it entirely for its historical interest, and because surely, surely, Douglas Fairbanks's Robin would be at least as good as Flynn's.  It was a true blockbuster, with the largest sets (according to some sources) of any film ever made; it probably made more money than the Flynn and Costner versions put together.  A pity it's so hard to lay eyes on now.All three films are simply called \"Robin Hood\".  However tempted one may be to use a more gilded title, I'm sure it's bad luck.",

            "content": "I've been wanting to watch this for a long time, and I have not been disappointed. Moreover, I surely appreciate this more now than I might have twenty years ago when I had first aimed to sit for it. For those who seek only swashbuckling action the movie is certainly full of it, with swinging, dashing, horse riding, swordplay, archery, and all manner of stunts filling as much of the runtime as could possibly be done. Yet what here is not to love? The cast is extraordinary, a veritable who's who of stars of the 30s heading into the 40s, and all bless their roles with all the skill and spirit we would expect and hope; might Errol Flynn actually be the best casting for the hero in all of cinema? Could this actually be the best performance that Una O'Connor gave in her storied career? The screenplay is rife with fine wit and repartee in the dialogue, and Robin himself is gifted with an especially sharp silver tongue, making the classic story of a fight against tyranny all the more rich and cheer-worthy. Anyone who has ever seen a rendition of the folktale, not least highly visible tellings like Disney's 1973 animation or the 1991 Kevin Costner vehicle 'Prince of thieves,' should know the saga quite well, yet still there is such an outstanding vitality in this 1938 version - vibrant scene writing and characterizations - that the adventure resounds anew all over again. 'The adventures of Robin Hood' is an indisputable classic, highly recommended for one and all!All the best advances in film-making technology can't dampen the splendor of Technicolor, and frankly I wish it were a process that was still employed today, for every detail in this presentation pops out all the more therewith. This is surely among the most marvelously colorful iterations of the legend if not the superlative, with the costume design being particularly lush, and the fabulous production design and art direction only a fraction of a step behind. Even the hair and makeup work is impeccable across the board, far-flung as it may sometimes be in accordance with the setting. No less colorful is all the terrific acting, the terrifically orchestrated action sequences and stunts - and in their own ways, even the vivid, smart cinematography, and Michael Curtiz's expert direction, arranging every shot and scene and guiding his cast. Such were the benefits of the studio system when the titans were at the peak of their strength, for with the backing of Warner Bros. It surely feels as though no expense was spared to enliven the proceedings with all the biggest and most skilled participants, and all the best wardrobe, props, weapons, and sets that could be mustered.I rather think the worst that could be said of 'The adventures of Robin Hood' is that it's a tad direct in its pacing and storytelling. No matter the mood of a moment, it's not necessarily allowed to resonate with all due weight or urgency. Even at that, for all the unquestionable excellence with which this is otherwise made in every respect, ultimately the matter seems a minor one, not meaningfully dampening the tremendous substance and unswerving fun and heart of a feature that relates such a timeless saga. So flawless is the execution in every other way that the inspiring legend is made riveting and heartwarming all over again. Mind you, none of this should come as a surprise, given the sterling reputation of the feature and all involved, but still one can only be impressed with how stupendously tall the title continues to stand more than 80 years later. It may not be singularly powerful in the way that some films can be, yet the unremitting excellence here is beyond all doubt, to the point that it's simply a must-see. No matter who you are, this is a classic everyone needs to see at least once. 'The adventures of Robin Hood' earns my very highest, heartiest, most enthusiastic recommendation!",

The Adventure Of Robin Hood is certainly The best action adventure of 40s decade and it hasn't lost a single cent of entertainment value till date. I am done with many swashbuckling and action adventures from modern days and i really thought 'Pirates Of The Carribbean' will be the Best in my list but then i saw this film and it proved me wrong. It is hilarious, it is loaded with action, it has delightful theme, it delivers solid dialogues and above all the final impact is nothing short of Nostalgia that should remain forever. When Prince John and the Norman Lords begin oppressing the Saxon masses in King Richard's absence, a Saxon lord fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army. Every single character in the film makes sense, it does exactly what you expect from them and nothing goes wrong in that cinematic theory and i repeat nothing. It is a fantastic comedy providing absolutely hilarious jokes and smart one-liners which i believe are missing in today's technically advanced films. The screenplay doesn't lose grip for a moment because everything goes smoothly and the entertaining factors like Comedy, Action, Romance, Revolt, Good vs Bad battle and the happy ending comes just one after another. Errol Flynn makes the finest Robin Hood, Olivia De Havilland looks so gorgeous that i just couldn't take my eyes off her. Supporting cast is brilliant in physical activities as well as dialogue delivery. Michael Curtis and William Keighley's direction is nothing short of an achievement in adventure genre. This film looks unmatchable even today after 81 years and the credit goes to these 2 genius directors. In short, a Must Watch Action-Adventurous. One word - TIMELESS !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Overall, the combination of screenplay, directing, pacing, music, action, and acting make this not only the greatest screen version of Robin Hood ever, but one of the greatest all-time adventure classics. Adventure movies are no longer made, unfortunately, having been replaced by 'Action Movies.' An Action Movie is an Adventure Movie with a very bad case of ADHD, or maybe an Adventure Movie on meth, with a low IQ. Too bad, Adventure Movies were classier, and could be enjoyed by women and grown men as well as adolescent boys.Errol Flynn as Robin Hood is probably the greatest hero in any Adventure Movie. Just perfect, and the guy did his own sword-fighting, and took lessons from an world-class archer for the shooting scenes.Besides being great entertainment, Robin Hood is very well made from a technical point of view, but does not hit you over the head trying to be artsy-fartsy. The scene where Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are having the climactic fight, and they slide past the camera, while the camera seamlessly catches the perfect, fighting shadows, then seamlessly they slip back into camera is just fantastic.There is strong element of populist social commentary in this film. The poor and working people are in a state of deprivation and tyranny because King Richard has become entangled in a foreign military adventure.My second favorite part is when Robin gives Maid Marion a tour of the medieval equivalent of a Hooverville. This is a movie made in 1938, and it was a wonderful way of reminding the audience, and modern viewers, of what true poverty looks like. Later in this sequence, you can see Robin and Marion gaze lustfully after each other as they eat at the same table with the homeless. For this film's original audience, hunger was never too far away.This film blends the spirit of Romantic Adventure with a strong call to social justice. One of my top 10 all time favorite movies. I could watch it once a week.",

The exuberance of the cast seems extended to the crew - perhaps they all had Korngold's music running through their heads in advance! Think of this without the music - not so good, eh? Or in modern \"realistic\" colour shot on modern film stock, ie drab. How lucky we are to have such a benchmark by which to judge all future attempts, and to wonder yet again why anyone should bother.Downers: The lovely Olivia's head-dresses were a bit OTT at times, Errol's vanity at the archery tournament a bit hard to swallow, the camera looking right through the back of Olivia's head at Errol grinning in the love scene a bit disconcerting, but this particular Saxon/Celtic/Slav dog wouldn't change a thing if he could.

            "content": "Back in the earlier days of television, on Sunday nights we always had to watch \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World Of Color\". Well, this isn't a Disney film, but it is a wonderful world of Technicolor! In the restored version now on DVD, the color is stunning. You might say, \"And a bit overdone\", and you would be correct. But it's still color film to savor.Without any question, Errol Flynn's performance here is one of the most iconic in American film history. He is at his peak, and while he made quite a few fine films after this one, none had the luster of this film. And, this is one of the biggest productions made by Warner Brothers in this era, far different than its typical second class musicals (as compared to MGM) and black-and-white gangster pics.In contrast, Olivia DeHavilland's finest and most notable film performance was still a year away -- \"Gone With The Wind\". Nevertheless, DeHavilland is ravishingly beautiful here. And, keep in mind that the horse she rides became Trigger shortly after this film was made, when Roy Rogers purchased him.Basil Rathbone, who seemed to usually play villains on the screen (except for his stint as Sherlock Holmes), is excellent here, and was every bit as good as swordsman as depicted; here he plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne. Claude Rains as the evil Prince John who is attempting to usurp his brother's throne, does well, although this is so different than all of his other roles. As always, barrel-bellied Eugene Palette with his husky voice is interesting, here as Friar Tuck. Alan Hale Sr. is simply perfect as Little John, and this is just one of many screen appearances he made as Flynn's \"pal\". Herbert Mundin is fine as one of the merry men; sadly, at age 40, he was killed just a year later in an auto accident. Melville Cooper and Una O'Connor provide comic relief, the former as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and the latter as a lady in waiting.As far as the story, it, too, is excellent, with a few raised eyebrows. Would Robin Hood have been so dumb to put himself in a situation where he would almost certainly be at a strategic disadvantage and be captured (the archery contest)? I think not.In the deluxe DVD pack now available, there's an excellent documentary about the making of the film, as well as another about the history of Technicolor. Quite fascinating.",

            "content": "Yes, this is the ultimate happy-ending fairy tale, filmed in vibrant Technicolor: quite a rarity at this time. Errol Flynn plays the superhero, who is characterized as the ideal gentlemanly leader of a brotherhood of political dissidents, who refuse to abide by certain unfair kingly laws or to pay oppressive kingly taxes, and are prone to rob well off travelers through their sylvan realm, to benefit the oppressed. They are loyal to the initially absent King Richard, characterized as a wise and just king, having spent years fighting in the Holy Land, in contrast to his prejudiced and oppressive younger brother John, who is plotting to have Richard decreed dead, replacing him as king.As with Flynn's first starring role, in the '35 \"Captain Blood\", this tale was especially appropriate for Depression-era audiences, who needed some hope that a 'knight in shining armor' would soon lead them out of the continuing economic depression and provide material help to the millions still in desperate economic circumstances. The pledge of friendship between Norman King Richard and the downtrodden Saxons could also be interpreted as a subliminal pleading for unity between the various potential allies against the growing threat of an aggressive fascist expansion alliance. The two 1940 Flynn-starring Civil War-related films: \"Santa Fe Trail\" and \"Virginia City\" also emphasized unity between the North and South with regard to attitude toward slavery abolition fanaticism, in the one case, or the impending reunification of the warring states, in the other. Again, this was an appropriate subliminal message for contemporary audiences by the very anti-fascist Jewish Warners, as the European fascist block-instigated war was already underway. Of course, the other '40 Flynn-starring film: \"The Sea Hawk\", although scripted as taking place in Elizabethan England, has blatant transferal references to the UK's then position with regard to Nazi Germany.Kings Richard and John were real people in the England of the late 12th century, when this tale takes place. Richard, but not John, was a leading force in The Crusades, was a captive in Austria for a period, and John did attempt to seize the English throne at one point in Richard's absence, all of which are incorporated into the screen play. As depicted in the film, Richard was very unusually tall and robust, while John was not. However, otherwise the depicted contrast between the good Richard and evil John is a gross distortion of the historical persons. Their father reigned over considerable portions of present France, as well as portions of the present UK, and the relationships between these 2 sons, as well as others, and the father, was quite complex. In fact, Richard spent very little of his life in England, and hated the climate. He spent most of his youth in his father's French possessions. Eventually, he named John as his heir to the English crown, and John ruled for a good 15 years before his death. Although John and his henchmen are depicted as squeezing the peasantry for their own wants or to ransom Richard, in reality, much money was needed to help finance Richard's military ventures. In the film, Robin is characterized as a member of the Saxon nobility, who gave up his title and wealth to help fight the injustice toward Saxons by the dominant Norman nobility. Historically, this would be very unlikely, as William the Conquerer pretty much confiscated all the titled lands for the Normans. Flynn's Robin seems very sure of his immortality in the face of seemingly impossible odds against his adversaries. This is most blatantly depicted in his unexpected arrival at the royal castle , carrying a prohibited slain deer, and face to face badmouthing of the policies of John and his cronies. Hence, Flynn maintains an almost unbelievable cockiness throughout the film. However, to demonstrate that he is not pathologically conceited, Robin responds well to some mild humiliation in his initial encounters with Little John(Alan Hale) and Friar Tuck(the always charismatic Eugene Palette). Although Will Scarlet is Robin's chief buddy, Patric Knowles is pretty faceless in this role. In contrast, Claude Rains makes a memorable Prince John, as does Ian Hunter, as King Richard. Charismatic type-cast villain Basil Rathbone returned from \"Captain Blood\" to again be Flynn's chief nemesis in the mass sword fight between the forces of John and Robin, near the end.Olivia de Havilland also returns from \"Captain Blood\", as the noble princess, to again be charmed by Flynn's gentlemanly rakish character. Although in the prior film, each was, in turn, bought by the other, thus encouraging an intimate relationship, their romantic connection is much more convincing in this film. Partly, this is because of the Technicolor vs. B&W, partly because their screen time relating to the other is greater, partly because of the many superb close-ups of Olivia's expressions, and partly because Olivia's character decides much earlier in the film that Flynn's character definitely is her man.",

This is a film in which everyone involved seemed to be fully into the spirit of what they were doing: no one strikes a false note (even the American accents on some of the actors can be forgiven, they're so right for their parts), and everything else, from set design to score to the lush colour cinematography, is just right and has stood the test of time.

            "content": "In the late 30's when this picture was made, being an outlaw was not such a good thing. Capone, Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde were in the main considered villains, likely to be played by Cagney and Bogart. In fact, James Cagney was the first choice to play Robin Hood. Somewhere along the line, Jack Warner must have decided that Robin Hood had to be the guy in the white hat completely. Thus, he was made to be super patriotic to his king, which would play well to English audiences about to go to war with Germany, and Robin's speeches were heavily spiced with references to the kind of rhetoric one would expect of a society at odds with fascism. The legend of Robin Hood had evolved a long ways from his primal origins in the 13th century. In those earliest references, the name Robin Hood was applied to habitual criminals.Later, stories and ballads stretched his legacy from a more brutish common outlaw to the romantic hero who fought injustice. As such, he became the symbol of the man of the people who had to become an outlaw to accomplish his good deeds. Thus were created more modern literary characters as Zorro, the American Robin Hood, and real outlaws of the frontier like Billy the Kid and Jesse James took on some Robin Hood-like aspects as their legends were written.Despite the questionable historicity, no outlaw in screen or print ever caught the public's fancy quite like Flynn did in this role.Newman and Redford came close to matching it thirty years later in their Butch and Sundance roles, but Errol Flynn reigns supreme as the ultimate ideal of man against the system.Flynn said he found the part boring, but audiences including this writer have universally disagreed. In fact, it's still my favorite action-adventure film of all time, which crosses all genres from westerns to martial arts to spy thrillers to crime fighters to science fiction. It has it all: romance, comic relief,stirring musical score,beautiful locations, superb archery and swordplay, evil villainy versus likable characters both human and non-human. All it lacks is a Yakima Canutt-like chase scene to make it perfect. {Just a note here about Marian's horse, better known as Roy Rogers' co-star buddy, Trigger: Technically, he should probably have been called \"Golden Cloud\" when this picture was made. Although Roy was probably calling him Trigger by the time ROBIN HOOD was playing in theaters, having purchased him from the stable which had provided some of the horses that were used in this film, it's most likely that he still had the name Golden Cloud when Maid Marian was riding him. Ironically, Trigger made his screen debut as Roy's horse before appearing in ROBIN HOOD, since the latter picture was released a month after Roy's flick, although much of the shooting, including Golden Cloud's scenes, had almost surely had been done before that western was made.} Dale Roloff",

As with any great work of art, once you get the plot down pat and don't have to focus on it anymore, you can take a certain distance and start to study the art with which the work was put together. That's where I am with \"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\" Every time I see it, I marvel at some different aspect of its creation, such as the brilliant use of a great film score, or the use of Technicolor. (Yes, modern movies about the Medieval Ages are probably historically more accurate with their drab colors, but \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" wasn't aspiring to be a history class film strip.) This evening, as I watched it again, I wondered about the extent to which its plot was meant to be read as commentary on contemporary world politics. It was made in 1938, after all, by which time Hitler had annexed several lands, in particular Austria, and driven many Jews out of Germany. By 1938 Hollywood had become something of a refugee camp for Jewish artists who had fled from Germany and then Austria. To what extent was this story of another invader, the Normans, and their unjust treatment of those whom they conquered, the Saxons, meant to be read as a commentary on what had just happened to Austria in March of 1938?---------------------I watched the movie again tonight, three years after writing the above. I still suspect the \"politics\" of the movie - King Richard creates equality for the locals (Saxons) and the invader/occupier (Normans) - was meant to be read with contemporary references, but I can't see how.What struck me again, however, was the brilliance of the finale - for this movie very definitely has an action finale. Flynn and Rathbone dueling through the castle, especially on the stairs, to Korngold's perfectly crafted music is as good as movies get. It's incredibly exciting! From there the movie moves to a swift conclusion, a mixture of high drama and clever comedy. It's really a masterpiece!",

No self-respecting critic is likely to say that Casablanca is a very good film, though overrated and a little dated. And so it is that a garish, gaudy old children's film from the late 30s seems destined to be a \"classic\" for an unforeseen future.For make no mistake, despite it's critical praise, The Adventures of Robin Hood is not a classic work, merely an enjoyable mainstream action-adventure. The production is the type of overblown melodrama where men give women chaste kisses to a crescendo of music, and people throw back their heads and put their hands on hips to laugh \"heartily\". But what really shocks is how camp the whole thing is. To get a feel of it, it's perhaps worthwhile to note that the tagline for the film was the understated \"Only the rainbow can duplicate its brilliance!\" Claude Rains has a wonderfully fey time as Prince John, Errol Flynn ain't exactly butch, and Patric Knowles plays the girliest Will Scarlett ever seen. Only Olivia de Havilland misses out on the poncy fun, being forced to contend with long monologues, speeches and soft focus. There's also a tendency towards risqu\u00e9 humour, particularly for the time, with the outlaw who says, \"I've never tickled a woman's fancy before!\" Kenneth Williams would have killed for material like that.The film is, of course, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and it's fair to say that none of his merry men get a real piece of the action, the titular character commanding all the best lines and scenes. This is perhaps for the better, as the pace virtually never lets up. Some of the swordfights look as if the film has been sped up, though there's a nice moment when we see Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne fighting in silhouette.It's all very well made, and nicely presented, the sort of throwaway fun you can really appreciate on a rainy Sunday afternoon. But an all-time classic? Let's not get carried away... 6/10.",

It has the right cast - even though the voice of Eugene Palette as Friar Tuck is unsuited for such a period picture - and a cracking good story. There are even cameos for the original silver screen Robin Hood and Maid Marian - Robert Frazer and Barbara Tennant - as the parents from whom the beautiful blonde girl is stolen by the Normans in the scenes where Robin Hood's men fight their brutality (The original silver screen Friar Tuck, Guy Oliver, had already died of cancer by the time this movie was finally made).",

            "content": "With a rousing musical score that won the 1938 Oscar for Erich Wolfgang (Wolfie) Korngold, and an outstanding Natalie Kalmus work in Technicolor, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" still stands out as a marvelous film.What a great cast! Errol Flynn is dashing, charming and most provocative in the lead role. He is given phenomenal support by two usual film rascals, Claude Rains, as the evil King John, trying to usurp the throne from Richard the Lionhearted who had gone off to fight in the crusades and Basil Rathbone, as evil as ever as Sir Guy.There is one weak link in this fabulous production. It is a young Olivia De Havilland as fair maid Marion, a Norman, who comes to admire Robin and his band of merrymakers for what they are doing to help the victimized Anglo-Saxons. Miss DeHavilland really lacks the maturity for the part. She is not convincing here but would go to gain that maturity in performances years later.As always, Una O'Connor provides some comic relief as her lady-in-waiting. Needless to say that Eugene Palette, as Friar Tuck, is perfectly cast in his rascal-comedy-like role.While there may be distortion of history at the film's beginning, it is worth it. After all, Hollywood was known to take historical liberties in many of its early films so as to spice up the romantic angle.The costume designs are perfect for this period piece and all concerned are excellent with the swords. Come to think of it, Rathbone, Flynn and others had plenty of experience in that in other films as well.",

            "content": "When reviewing old movies like 1938's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", the reviewer must decide whether to critique the movie based on the era in which it was released or solely upon one's modern viewing experience. I'm going to largely review this classic version of Robin Hood according to the latter.I do like Errol Flynn in the title roll. He exudes such a joie de vivre (\"joy of living\") in contrast to Costner's dour performance and Crowe's dead serious approach. Flynn's rendition comes across as a Medieval superhero with superhuman nonchalance and bravery, not to mention fighting skills. One sequence shows Robin Hood taking on a whole castle of armed foes and easily escaping. I have no problem with this -- superheroes are great -- but it does mark the film as more of a Medieval fantasy rather than a quasi-realistic historical picture.Olivia de Havilland is also great as Maid Marion. She has a lovely face and such a winsome spirit. The pompous villains are excellent as well. As for Robin's merry men, they're serviceable.The film is very colorful and energetic, but sometimes the dialogue comes across so rehearsed. The characters speak so quickly and without inflection that it often doesn't even register what they said until a few seconds after they speak. Maybe it's just the way actors delivered their lines back then but, regardless, this'll strike modern viewers as bad filmmaking and acting.One scene is very eye-rolling -- when Marion comes into Robin's camp in Sherwood forest and his merry men start dancing hand-in-hand. Alrighty then.As far as the score goes, I'm sure it was fine for 1938, but for modern listeners it's verging on atrocious.Still, it's surprising how much \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" holds up and remains entertaining. It's a great film when you want a pleasant flash from the past. But it doesn't hold a candle to more modern Medieval films, like \"Tristan & Isolde\" and \"Black Death\". And Costner and Crowe's more realistic versions are all-around better, even while they're less vibrant. But, again, the 1938 version is great when you're in the mood for a more energetic and colorful viewing experience.The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in California (they do a pretty good job of trying to make Southern California look like England).GRADE: C+ or B-",

            "review_title": "A Classic of World Cinema",
            "content": "This film is a classic of world cinema, the all-time romantic adventure film, with a serious backbone, a great love story but also wonderful action scenes and a great sense of fun to go with a perfect cast, unmatched production values and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's greatest musical score.Errol Flynn is the perfect Robin Hood, romping through the film with a foolhardy confidence which he and his allies are able to back up. He can make an impassioned speech or play a delicate love scene with equal skill. He was doubled a lot more than it seemed in the action sequences but he was so handsome and athletic-looking it appeared he was not doubled at all. You could believe he could do anything. He and Basil Rathbone did much of the justly famous swordfight at the end. It's the one such scene in the film where the combatants really seem to want to harm each other, (in the others they just clang their swords).Olivia De Havilland is a winsome Lady Marian, wearing some of the most spectacular costumes in cinema history. Rathbone is the perfect villain - articulate but arrogant and ruthless. (He was also an expert swordsman who cold run Flynn through at any time - but it would have ruined the picture.) Claude Rains is the effete, scheming Prince John. (How long would it have taken for one to get rid of the other had they won?) Melville Cooper is a comically corrupt but cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, (usually the villain in these things). Alan Hale Jr. is such a perfect Little John that he played it three times - opposite Douglas Fairbanks in 1922, Flynn in 1938 and, of all people, John Derek, in 1950, (Hale's last film, done shortly before his death in January of that year). I think I spotted his son, Alan, Jr., (the Skipper on Gilligan's Island), who would have been a big and robust 16, playing one the archers in the tournament. He's dressed in a tattered brown outfit, standing just behind Flynn as Robin wins the tournament. Herbert Mundin is the unprepossessing but feisty Much the Miller's son. Heroes come in all shapes and sizes. Ona O'Connor is the sharp-tongued lady in waiting to Maid Marian and Much's eventual mate. Ian Hunter provides the necessary presence for Richard the lion-hearted. Montagu Love, the excellent henry VIII in the previous year's 'The Prince and the Pauper', is the dour Bishop of the Black Canons. Eugene Pallette, an unlikely swordsman, plays friar Tuck, also an unlikely swordsman. Poor Patrick Knowles, as Will Scarlett, is given little to do but parade around in a suit of that color that hardly would enable him to hide in the forest.Like most of Flynn's best films, this one kind of winks at history. Richard was no paragon of virtue. John may not have been as bad as depicted. The Normans and the Saxons had assimilated by 1191. Robin Hood is an amalgamation of many tales of outlaws in various ballads over the centuries. Attempts have been made to identify a real source for him and other fictional character like Maid Marian, Guy of Gisborne, Wil Scarlett and others but these attempts inevitably fail. Friar Tuck seems to have bene a combination of two different Friars and there have been sheriffs of Nottingham for over 1,000 years but we don't know which one appears in this story. It doesn't really matter: it's what these characters represent to us that matters: heroism, love, comedy, freedom, cruelty, corruption, deprivation - all the different aspects of the human condition.Korngold initially didn't want to do the score for this, thinking that an action film wouldn't have the emotional content he wanted to display in his music. He was going to go home to Austria but the Anschluss kept him in Hollywood so he composed a score full of emotion that adds so much to this film. Two other experts also contributed mightily: Harold Hill, regarded as the best archer of all time, who unleashed every arrow you see without harming anyone and fencing master Fred Cavens, who choreographed all the swordfights, including the famous one at the film's end.In the commentary on the 65th anniversary DVD, Rudy Behlmer tells us that 'the Adventures of Robin Hood' was the fifth most often presented film on television, behind #1 'Casablanca', then 'King Kong', 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Maltese Falcon'. That's pretty good company.",

But, Robin Hood-- this version-- is unsurpassed as a great story of heroics and romance.  Only the wonderful Robin and Marian comes close...  But, this movie is absolutely seamless.",

            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood has endured for years and is more popular today than ever before, but the credit not only goes to the casting of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavalland and others in the cast, but the direction and mostly the musical score, but more on that later.Every second; every foot; and every scene is used to its best advantage which is the reason that there is no dull moment and the the pace is fast and enjoyable. To think that at one time this movie was to be made with James Cagney playing Robin Hood and Anita Louise playing Maid Marianne. Would it have worked? Maybe, if we can get the vision of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavalland out of our minds, but Cagney placed himself on suspension because of his movie assignments that he disliked, and this opened up the avenue for the casting of Errol Flynn as Robin Hood who was so right for the part. Then Michael Curtiz took honors with the directing, and as far as I'm concerned, Curtiz has been the most underrated director of Hollwood Films. Everyone remembers Casablaca, but does anyone know that he also directed musicals? Which ones? White Christmas with Bing Crosby and Night and Day, the story of Cole Porter starring Cary Grant as Porter.So, with all the great performances and the ravishing Technicolor, what really turns this movie into the classic that it is? Erich Wolfgang Korngolds score for the film. Korngold didn't want to compose the music for the film, but he had no choice. He just didn't think he had it in him to do the score, and this was a rush job, and as a result it became an Acadamy Award Score. Isn't it funny what not wanting to do something and being rushed into it does for a person? It certainly helped Korngold! If you keep your ears opened while watching the movie, you'll hear all kinds of themes for the players and the situations that they are in, but if you really want to hear this lush, vibrant score for what it is; the complete score has been recorded on a Marco Polo C.D. and makes you sick to think that it was a shame they didn't have stereophonic sound for movies in those days.Yes, The Adventures of Robin Hood is Perfection in Movie Marking and has remained a great classic to this very day.",

            "content": "Although this is a 1938 film, and the costumes have that vaguely-loose pre-WWII look, they are in fact quite adequate or better. The direction of the film by Michael Curtiz was as usual crisp and thoughtful; and the music by Erich Wolfgnag Korngold, used mainly to bolster the character of Robin Hood as played by handsome and very young Errol Flynn, has become a legend. There are a number of decently-written parts in this film, partly because Seton I. Miller was one of the credited authors (\"The Mississippi Gambler\", Bengal Brigade\", etc.). But they are uniformly well played, from the lady portrayed by Olivia de Havilland to the villainous Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains and Hugh Herbert to the band led by Flynn which includes Alan Hale Sr. and Patrick Knowles (who should have played the lead on intellect and ability) to supporting actors such as Una O'Connr. As Friar Tuck, Eugene Palette tries manfully and gets away with the part. There are a great many lovely lighting effects, outdoor scenes, visual moments and intelligent dialogue exchanges in this cinematic achievement as well as some fine medieval interiors that even look livable or lived in. The film almost defines an \"A\" budget attempt at historical, heightened-re-rceation in the late 1930s, a year before \"Gone With the Wind\". The color is effectively used, although the film could get by as drama in B/W. In retrospect, there is nothing about this film that suggests it is not a first-rate attempt and something to be proud of. Artistry and continuity of a difficult style are seldom found together in any film; in this production I suggest they are everywhere. A film certainly to be seen far more than once. One may question its championing of peasant virtues of Anglo-Saxon victims, as well as a universal portrayal of male Norman French as venal thieves and tyrants; but the script develops the story in plausible and logical fashion. One of the best.",

There are so much things that I love about this movie besides the fantastic storytelling, I also love the acting, romance scenes (between Flynn and Olivia De Havilland), action sequences, characters, as well as the casting for the movie.

            "content": "The pinnacle of Errol Flynn's string of swashbuckling adventures...The most expensive film Warners had ever made (until 1938),  and in glorious Technicolor, to boot...The film with the most cherished of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's many film scores...The film that literally set the standard for every 'Robin Hood' and 'Knighthood' movie since...One of the greatest films, not only of the 1930s, but of all time...THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is, in EVERY sense of the word, a CLASSIC! The story of Sherwood Forest's favorite bandit had been a movie staple since silent films (Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatic 1922 version was regarded as one of his finest roles), and the WB,  riding high on a string of hits by Fairbanks' younger and sexier successor, Errol Flynn, knew they had all the elements in place to create a grand entertainment that no other studio could match! Originally intended for James Cagney, the property had languished for three years, until Errol Flynn exploded onto the scene, and the studio knew they had the actor 'born' to play the role. Not wishing to run into legal problems with United Artists, who'd produced the 1922 film, an original script, incorporating ancient legends, medieval ballads, a popular 19th century stage production, and a bit of Howard Pyle, was written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller (with some uncredited assistance by Rowland Leigh). Casting nearly all of their \"British Colony\" in speaking roles, the studio brought back Alan Hale to reprise his 1922 role of  Little John (an excellent choice, as Flynn and Hale had terrific rapport), casted rotund comic actor Eugene Pallette (Guy Kibbee was the first choice) as a gravelly-voiced Friar Tuck, and wisely chose Claude Rains to play the fey Prince John, and Basil Rathbone (whose duel with Flynn in CAPTAIN BLOOD was a film highlight) as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Maid Marion's Norman suitor, and Robin's arch-nemesis. In the role of  Marion, could anyone OTHER than Olivia de Havilland have been cast? Flynn and de Havilland had already done two films together (and would do four more, after ROBIN HOOD), and their chemistry was so perfect that 1930s screen magazines were always hinting of a romance between the two (there wasn't; they were simply friends).Not that the production was problem-free; the original director, William Keighley, was axed after the location shooting was completed, as the studio didn't like his approach to the script and actors; Michael Curtiz, who had 'made' a star of Flynn, in CAPTAIN BLOOD, was quickly brought in, adding his sense of drama, lighting (the 'light-and-shadow' climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy was a Curtiz 'trademark'), and style. Both Curtiz and Keighley would share the 'Director' credit when the film was released. THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was Warners' biggest box office hit of 1938, became a multiple Academy Award winner, and it's luster has only increased through the years, being named as one of the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of All Time. This is a classic that TRULY lives up to the term!",

            "content": "I should start out by saying this: I am not much of a fan of adventure movies. Though the swashbuckling swordplay, flamboyant costuming, and retooled good-versus-evil story lines are exciting to many moviegoers, I find the whole genre to be mindless, hokey, and tiresome. Having said that, there are still a few films that are so unique, they almost persuade me to abandon my anti-adventure film prejudice altogether. THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is one of them.So what sets ROBIN HOOD apart from the other corny adventure yarns of its time? The answer is quite simple: it's just really damn good. Errol Flynn brings the title character to life in a way that has since been unmatched. He is bold, funny, charming, loyal, and athletic, though not completely without weakness. Flynn pulls all the punches to make the outlaw hero jovial and likable, despite his shameless overconfidence. You can't help but to root for him. In short, Flynn's performance was utterly perfect. It's impossible to picture a better Robin Hood.The rest of the cast did an equally amazing job: Olivia de Havilland was enchanting as the radiant Maid Marian, Melville Cooper was consistently funny as the bumbling High Sheriff of Nottingham, and Claude Rains had the subtle, bitter disposition of Prince John down to a tee. Even the uncredited townsfolk were believable.The real star of the show, however, is the brilliant use of the Technicolor process. The costumes, set design, and art direction were all specifically tailored to bring out the brightest, most dazzling colors, and they all succeeded unequivocally. Even now, where color is the standard, I have rarely seen such a striking array of reds, greens, blues, and yellows. Heck, even animated films aren't this colorful! ROBIN HOOD won a well-deserved Oscar for its editing, which is speedy yet deliberate. There is no lag in the action, and the film wastes no time with unimportant dialogue. But at the same time, it isn't dizzying or unpleasant to watch. Still, I did find myself looking at my watch towards the ninety minute mark. It's about this time when the movie goes a little overboard with the climactic fighting scene, which was clearly intended for those who enjoy the nonstop, bustling action that these kind of movies are meant to provide. Even so, the fact that I, a person who typically cringes at the thought of watching a swashbuckler, enjoyed THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD as much as I did really says something about how successful and influential this film is.",

The rich guys are bad, the poor guys have our sympathy, and Robin Hood (played by the suave Errol Flynn) always saves the day.The film's action sequences are fun even by modern standards. Galloping steeds, rapid running sword-play, escapes from castles, men swinging Tarzan-like down from trees, the whiz of arrows...the pace never lags.The acting and script are not exactly subtle, but the film's production design demands that things be this way. Everyone wears bright costumes, the characters are all larger than life and Curtiz spends the entire film alternating between scenes of dazzling colour and scenes shot in brown-dominant visuals, the Hungarian-born director using his newly developed 3-strip Technicolor cameras to marvellous effect.Robin himself is your typical swashbuckler: strong, swift, sure, politely arrogant and always flashing a megawatt smile. And of course nothing fazes Robin. Even when surrounded by bad guys he has enough composure to crack wise. \"You speak treason!\" one insulted villain says, to which Robin replies: \"Fluently!\" 8/10 \u2013 A bright and jolly slice of swashbuckle. Watched in the proper context, this 80 year old film still works well. Worth one viewing.",

How could there be, since almost everyone is familiar with the basic outline of the story of Robin Hood, and the movie - well - tells the basic story. There are a few things that seem a bit out of the norm (especially the fact that the Sheriff of Nottingham is virtually invisible here; Sir Guy of Gisbourne being Robin's only serious adversary) but otherwise it's very familiar. Outraged by Prince John's oppression of the Saxons, and (being fiercely loyal to Richard the Lion Hearted) also by John's attempt to usurp the throne, Sir Robert of Locksley becomes an outlaw, and collects a colourful team around him as they battle the Prince's men, all the while waiting for Richard's return from the Crusades.The movie is technically magnificent - certainly ranking among the best made movies of the 1930's. The sets are wonderful and the costumes are colourful. Errol Flynn put on an excellent performance as Robin Hood, and - as you would expect from any movie starring Errol Flynn - there's a lot of very good swordplay. The supporting cast was also very good. The best was probably Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy, and near the end there's a very exciting \"fight to the death\" scene between Guy and Robin. The other really good performance was from Claude Rains as Prince John. Rains captured the essential \"sliminess\" (for lack of a better word) of that very real historical character, widely considered to be one of the worst kings in English history once he succeeded legitimately to the throne. Olivia de Haviland was good as Lady Marian, although the portrayal of the romance between her and Robin seemed a bit forced to me, which I find somewhat typical of movies from this era.This is light entertainment. It's not riveting, because the story is so familiar, but it's lively and fun. 7/10",

One of the most obvious ways was Errol Flynn's portrayal of the title character, Robin Hood of Locksley, who was completely a rough and rugged hero. He was a very charismatic & charming man who seemed to enjoy falling in the water with his clothes on, which he does a few times during the film. The film's obvious damsel-in-distress was the lovely Maid Marian, played beautifully by Olivia de Havilland. She was somebody that the film really made you care for. Towards the end, when she's behind bars, awaiting an execution, the audience is left only to hope & pray that Robin Hood can rescue her in time. In my opinion, there was just enough romance in this film so that it would never drag the story along. Usually in films that went by the standards of the Classic Hollywood Style would present a huge task that the rough & rugged main hero character had to complete before he could celebrate a happy ending with the love interest. In this film, the task was: making sure that the infamous Prince John, played by a ruthless Claude Rains, never took the throne. Once Robin Hood took care of that business, he and Maid Marian ran off to celebrate their victory, and enjoy a happy ending together.",

GET UP, GET UP, sir knight!\"). Of course, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are brilliant as the leads.The duel with swords at the end between Flynn and Rathbone (three guesses who wins!)is one of the longest and most spectacular on film, beaten only by the duel in 'Scaramouche'(1952) which was a few seconds longer at nine minutes. This style of story must have been popular at the time because 'The Mark of Zorro', starring Tyrone Power, was made shortly afterwards and is basically Robin Hood in California! Eugene Pallette and Basil Rathbone reprise their roles in 'Zorro' as priest and villain respectively.

Glorious technicolour, Korngold score, Curtiz making legend come alive and acting talents of Rathbone, Rains, De Havilland, Hale, Pallette...and of course mr. derring-do himself...Flynn! In these days of leatherclad Matrix wannabies sporting big guns and foul mood, the sheer joy of swash and bucklin Flynnster in green tights is proverbial breath of fresh air. This guy really was natural and i would be hard pressed to think any contemporary action man putting THAT costume with THAT attitude and not make a comedy of lowest common denominator. Whatever you may think of Errol as a person or his...extracurricular activities, the sheer presence of the man was simply awesome.Thank you Warner for bringing the legend to the new millennium!",

            "content": "1st watched 12/5/2013 -- 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Curtiz & William Keighley): Bland Hollywood-like interpretation of the Robin Hood legend just didn't do much for me. This was a very popular movie when it was released in 1938 and with it's re-release 10 years later, but I didn't feel like the production or the actors brought much to the familiar story. The character, Robin of Luxley --- played by Error Flynn -- starts the movie already in the Hood character as a rebel against Prince John and always for the Saxons, whom John is exploiting. Robin boldly waltzes into the court of Prince John in an early scene carrying an illegally killed deer and ends up sitting down with them in their feast. Before the scene is over he escapes in a typical swashbuckling Flynn scene keeping his charm intact and escaping the gallows. This kind of sets up the rest of the movie as far as Flynn's interpretation of Robin Hood. There is very little bite or toughness despite the obvious rough situation, but the movie looks great throughout with this early technicolor film. The fighting scenes are numerous with some interesting shadowing done, but the scenes seem obviously sped up like a silent movie which lessons their impact. Olivia deHaviland as Maid Marian is probably the best portrayal -- she is captured by Robin's heart and transforms to a follower of his band before the end to eventually become his partner. American movie-making in this era is sometimes corny and sanitized and this is an example of this -- which loses current moviegoers and this one will do that. Overall I just feel if this story is going to be told straight it needs to have other elements that make it watchable -- we either need to understand the core of the issue or it needs to have good humor and this version has neither.",

Because this isn't supposed to be a documentary film. This is supposed to be an adventure story, a story of idealism, winning fights and fair maidens to boot. And it contains an absolutely marvelous sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of actors in their prime and on top of their game.Errol Flynn plays the title role with an aplomb rarely seen today. He is at once witty and tender, and yet manages to convey that he really does believe in what he's fighting for. This is justifiably called the performance of his career. The swashbuckling, athletic action is a joy to watch, the score is magnificent, and the chemistry between him and oft-time leading lady Olivia de Havilland is a joy to watch.De Havilland, playing the fair Maid Marian, portrays her not as a meek and mild mouse, but as a spitfire, determined, and surprisingly very twenty-first century personality with a definite mind of her own. I cannot say enough about her performance. She is utterly believable in this role, and the chemistry between her and Flynn is unforgettable.Supporting actors provide a wonderful background, making this a must-have movie for romantics and action addicts alike.",

            "content": "Through the different variations of Robin Hood that have been produced over last few decades, the myth of Robin Hood has grown in awareness in western culture. It is easy to admire a character who stands against injustice and the darker side that human morality has to offer. Someone who is so altruistic that it is not always needed to have a motivation to do the things that he does. This depiction of Robin Hood falls into that vein.The year was 1938 and swashbuckling-style movies were a popular genre within the Hollywood system. This influence can clearly be seen throughout this film. (More on that later) The movie holds true to the popular myth of Robin Hood including Prince John as the antagonist, the classic Robin Hood allies (Little John, Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck etc.), Maid Marian as love interest and so on. It includes classic scenessuch as Robin Hood and Little John dueling with staffs on a log bridge over a river, an archery contest used as a trap for Robin Hood and Robin's Merry Men living the good life in Sherwood forest.While all of the familiar elements of the Robin Hood myth in place, the film does have it's own feel to it. It does have the swashbuckler feel to it and you could take Errol Flynn's take on the character and put him on a pirate ship and he could definitely act the part. While this facet doesn't take anything away from the character it is worthwhile to note as it was a popular take on characters during this period.Olivia De Havilland's take on Maid Marian is quite expected. It is through her eyes that we see the arrogance, flair and unpredictability that surrounds the Robin Hood character. Robin is able to win her heart through his altruistic actions. She seems to have more of a character arc than Robin does. This storytelling practice wasn't uncommon during this era as the protagonists tended to not have any flaws.The antagonists are rounded out with Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisborne and Claude Rains as Prince John. They both give excellent performances as two people who rely on each other in order to ensure Prince John's claim to the crown. These two are not your standard bad guys who are bad for the sake of being bad. The motivations are made clear for their evil deeds. The film also features background information regarding the Normans and Saxons which helps to illustrate why Prince John feels that his cause is pure.The movie is fast paced for it's time and I found that it could still hold a viewer's attention. Though we have seen many renditions of Robin Hood, this film set the standard on what it is to be a merry man.",

Here in America, audiences' were first privy to the tale in 1922, although a silent version is said to have been made much earlier. In our time, audiences are accustomed to tying the movie with actor Russell Crowe. In this version (My favorite however), it was Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood. Directed by Michael Curtiz, it was written by Norman Reilly Raine. However, the Legend itself can be traced back to scrolls of the 9th thru the 12th century. Regardless of it's origins, the Silver Screen allows the retelling in fashionable Technicolor. All the wondrous beauty complete with action-oriented and exciting scenes are forever linked to the cast and crew of this movie. To make it more alluring and cinematically romantic is Olivia DE Havilland as Maid Marian. The Part of the villains are non-other than Basil Rathbone better known to discriminating audiences as Sherlock Holmns and world renown actor Claude Rains as Prince John. If you look closely you'll see Alan Hale Sr. Playing Little John. All in all, the cast performs well in this adaption of the Robin Legend, and despite other versions, this remain the Classic with which I grew up with. Easily Recommended. ****",

            "content": "The word that comes to mind in describing \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" is rollicking - it's just a rollicking good time from start to finish. I was most impressed with it's brilliant use of Technicolor cinematography and the dazzling displays of swordsmanship, with many action sequences well placed from start to finish.As others have mentioned, it's hard to picture anyone else in the role of the title character other than Errol Flynn, so it was a surprise to learn that Warner Brothers' first choice for the lead was James Cagney. Cagney however played hardball with the studio, so they went with the actor who made such a splash in 1935's \"Captain Blood\". I tried picturing Cagney in the green tights and involuntarily began to chuckle at the image, but Flynn and his cohorts seemed to look ideal in their outfits. Flynn's natural athleticism is certainly on display here; the scene that really surprised me was the one where he grabbed the rope of the castle gate, the weight of which hauled him to the top of the barricade as he scrambled up for an even better vantage. I guess it could have been a stunt double, but it sure was an impressive maneuver.I recall seeing a documentary on George Lucas stating that he took some of his inspiration for the 'Star Wars' franchise from pirate and adventure flicks of the 1930's. That's certainly evident in the light saber scenes we're all familiar with, but what I noticed here was how much the hooded cloaks of the Jedi Knights might have been modeled after the garb of King Richard the Lion-Heart and his men. Something to think about.I've seen Basil Rathbone before primarily in his portrayal of detective Sherlock Holmes, and only in black and white pictures of the era. So again, it surprised me to see how robust and athletic he was in this picture. It adds another dimension to my appreciation of the actor outside of the stereotype. He also mixed it up pretty well with Flynn in the action sequences, until his demise at the hand of the film's hero in the finale.Then of course there's Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, understated in her charm and beauty in contrast to the way the role might be cast and played in a film made today. A bit of trivia I've always remembered about this picture involves Maid Marian and the horse she rides. A sturdy palomino, it's name was Golden Cloud, and appeared in this film uncredited. That may sound odd, but that same steed went on to become the 'Smartest Horse in the Movies' as the partner of none other than Roy Rogers.",

However after watching the film I was once again remembered to not judge a film by it's age because The Adventures of Robin Hood is a terrific film filled with great acting and amazing characters (except maybe the character Will Scarlett wich I think is pretty much wasted and almost useless in this film). The film is packed with awesome battle scenes and hilarious moments and it's also very colourfull wich makes it in my opinion visualy interesting much like other films of the era wich used Tecnicolor like The Wizard Of Oz, I also really like the colourful costumes worn.\nAnd the cherry on top of the cake is of course the epic score by Wolfgang Korngold\nOverall The Adventures of Robin Hood is just a wonderfull classic that everyone should watch\n9.8/10",

But the all-time classic Robin Hood is Errol Flynn. Indeed, is Flynn today known for much beyond this role? He easily surpassed Douglas Fairbanks.What makes this film a classic is not only the Technicolor (which shows off some very vibrant and interesting wardrobes), but the wardrobes themselves (which were clearly the inspiration behind \"Men and Tights\") and the general whimsical nature of the film.

Everything in this movie like the colour is overblown and extravagant from the huge orchestral score to the posturing of Errol Flynn and that's it's charm a fairy tale brought to life in the most vivid and vibrant way possible. It's easy to see why Flynn was such a huge star back in the day he portrays Robin Hood as the kind of guy we'd all like to be heroic, handsome, popular and dashing. The villains are also excellent Rathbone is all sly charm and menace as Guy of Gisbourne, Claude Raines is excellent as the foppish Prince John while Melville Cooper brings some comedy to the role of the Sheriff of Notingham. The merry men are brought to life in full Technicolour there never can have been a more scarlett Will Scarlett than presented here, Friar Tuck and Little John are all bluster and heroics. Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marion looks the part too. This is a swash buckler in every sense of the word, sword fights (surely one of the greatest in cinema history as Guy and Robin duel there way round candelabras and staircases), chases, rescues and romance. You couldn't ask for more in what is an unashamed good time adventure movie, i'm sure more than a few modern adventure movies have taken the template further (Raiders of the Lost Ark etc.) but this remains a giant in the genre.For once it's true they really don't make them like this anymore 8/10",

Everything seemed to come together in Warner's 1938 colorful story of Robin Hood, the 13th-century legendary outlaw who robbed from the rich only in order to give to the poor.Flynn was at his peak in 1938, terribly handsome without being in the least effete. And he was physically graceful enough to suggest competence in acrobatics and swordplay. Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marion is stunning -- vulnerable, alarmed, brave, sexy. The purity of her features isn't plastered over with an impasto of elaborate make up. Claude Raines is perfect as the sardonic and slimy fratricidal brother. And Basil Rathbone is here in his villainous mode (Mr. Murdstone, etc.), evil and grounded. His swordplay was convincing because he studied the art and became quite good; not competition level but he knew what he was about. Comedy relief is provided by some of the supporting players.William Keighley began directing but his work wasn't considered zippy enough so he was replaced by the redoubtable Michael Curtiz and -- Sire, he hesitates not to undercrank the camera and accelerate the action, nor does he pause before ripping off the shadows of swashbucklers on the castle walls, right out of silent movies with Douglas Fairbanks. The dialog is properly stilted and there are a few slightly surreal lines. Rathbone admonishes the sheriff. \"You couldn't catch him if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow!\" Who thought THAT up? It's all an intensely hued fairy tale of course, done in gorgeous new three-strip Technicolor. Eric Wolfgang Korngold's score is delightfully bombastic. Historically, by the time the Robin Hood stories became popular, there was little friction between Norman and Saxon. People knew their places. The Normans were on top and ate \"pork\" (from French), while the Saxons did the farm work and raised \"swine\" (Germanic). Maid Marion didn't enter the stories until later.Fun, action, and the studio system at its best. Catch it if you can.",

I don't think that kids who grew up on Scharzenegger have the same appreciation for such films as kids who grew up on the classic films...In short, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a film that has transcended its time and become a true classic.",

I've watched this movie several times over the years and never get tired of it. It puts every other version to shame. Errol Flynn is the perfect Robin Hood. And Claude Raines (Casablanca, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Phantom of the Opera) is delightful as ever....as the calculating and devious Prince John. The action is gripping from the start to finish. It never lets up!! It is, without a doubt, the most exciting movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching! Whether it's the bold and audacious entrance of Robin with a deer at Nottingham castle or the tender dialogue between Marian and Robin in the forest, this film is a must see. Erich Wolfgang Korngold's musical score is the best ever. No movie in recent years or years to come will ever come close to capturing the magic of this incredible story. Today's movie makers don't even have a clue! The Kevin Costner version is a joke by comparison. It's refreshing to see a film that can captivate and entertain the whole family...regardless of age.

            "review_title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood `still kicking A' after 64 yrs. 10/10. Spoilers.",
            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (ARH) was so ahead of its time in 1938 that despite wildly swinging experimentation in the wake of silent movies it still got its emoting just right. Everything, incl the pacing, is conspicuously contemporary. It never underestimated its audiences. Consequently ARH established filmmaking conventions forever more.Alan Hale, Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck) and Basil Rathbone, along with Flynn and deHavilland, all strike us as supremely comfortable within their Medieval characters. Unfortunately, the elderly-but-naive/socially impaired characters, Much (Herbert Mundin) and Bess (Una O'Connor), look awkward. Much&Bess' romance isn't believable. Mundin's acting never seems to flow, while O'Connor is embarrassingly overripe. Claude Rains, too, is just so stiff that he LOOKS like a mere vehicle for delivering lines-watch him as he swivels his head and pours the wine. I wonder if he ever `thought of working carnivals'! (Sorry, that's a nod to the hilarious Dr Poole from Oscar (1991)). After 64 yrs I'm not making excuses for Claude Rains!Otherwise, ARH is full of terrific peripheral performances which substantiate the story. Some, eg Hale's spontaneous reactions as Little John, nearly went uncaptured due to the fadeouts. The editor very nearly pared back too far! This became Hale's career-making role, and he's terrific.The rich, lush colour, the rousing music, and the astonishingly contemporary crane-and-dolly shot of the castle dinner, as well as the shadow-swashbuckling, all contribute to our fondness for the Medieval legend. That establishing dolly shot, with its attention to detail (eg the feasting dog), is JUST breathtaking. Ralph Dawson (Editing, won), Carl Jules Weyl (Art Director, won); Tony Gaudio & Sol Polito (Photography); and Erich Korngold (Music, won) all deserved Oscars.ARH (screenplay by Norman Raine & Seton Miller) is the dramatic and credible story of an attempted coup stemming from a siblings' squabble. The King's treacherous brother, Prince John (Claude Rains), felt his ego belittled when denied the Regency of England during the King's absence. He became `bitterly resentful', so he summarily `kicked Longchamps (the appointed Regent) out'-an announcement heard by Robin Hood, cementing his resolve to oppose the traitor.Errol Flynn smoulders in green tights (the whole point of tights was to accentuate men's...erm...virility). Mel Brooks was right; those Merry Men were probably just good `sports' (swingers). But effeminate? -Aw, no, baby.Errol and Olivia had such obvious chemistry that their romance is completely believable to this day....but Robin is reckless: during the Gisborne dinner he gatecrashes, he ends up proselytising about the ransom being used NOT to reclaim the King, but as bribe-money for Prince John to buy himself the throne. Inside the lion's den, Robin first provokes the lion and then makes his escape relying on nothing but his instincts! I'm afraid I found that too reckless to be heroic. (Reckless Robin will strike again.)In the meantime, the speed with which he and Marian decide they're on the same side is perfect, and the pacing of their affair has made this a classic of romance as well as high adventure. Olivia played Maid Marian as demure, but smart enough to figure out the truth about her own kind. In her disdain for the arrogant-and-obnoxious Sir Guy (Rathbone), we discern her personal ethics, for soon afterwards she is first provoked by then falls for the arrogant-yet-charismatic Robin, who `loves a man who can best (him)'-the antithesis of Sir Guy. `It's injustice I hate, not the Normans', confesses the very Saxon Robin of Loxley to the skeptical and still very Norman Marian.King Richard had wanted to unite the Normans and the Saxons into a nation. In his absence, his bad-seed brother instead stirs up hatred between those `classes', just to put himself at the top (of the wealthier group, of course). This is frequently the self-serving means by which a megalomaniac scrabbles to the top. And check out the Bishop (Montagu Love)'s spin-doctored counteraccusation of Robin of the very same thing!\nThe ringleaders of the coup appear to be Sir Guy (the handler) and Prince John (basically a cheap opportunist/\"junkyard dog\"). The famous Sheriff of Nottingham, surprisingly, is played by Melville Cooper as a simple coward! His manner as he nuts out his idea of holding the archery contest to trap Robin is Cooper's best, most realistic scene (although it's hard to believe that Reckless Robin walks into such an obvious trap).Imitation being the highest form of flattery, ARH was spoofed in 1956 as The Court Jester, inspired by the scene in which Robin jokes with Marian up in her tower about King Richard making Robin his court jester. When Errol is recruiting Merry Men, he exclaims, `We need good swordsmen. Good archers. Good fighters!': in CJ, this became `Good stock. Good battle. Good-bye!' Many elements were reworked for CJ-none more obviously than the re-casting of Rathbone 18yrs later, again as the bad guy. Both versions are classics-and stylistically there is nothing between them.My `secret' fav. scene here is the flying arrow which snuffs out a candleflame(!) as the guard is shot in the back, at 24:40mins.Beyond that, the whole 1938 movie completely satisfies our need for drama. Ian Hunter's sensitive depiction of the returning King Richard, for instance, brings a tear to the eye when he assures Robin Hood,`You don't need to search for Richard; he's in good hands, the best in England.' `-Whaddyou mean? Where is he?' demands Robin. `HERE!' cries the King, disrobing, and gobsmacking his protector-and us too (but with emotion instead of surprise).Sadly, the crucial scene of Marian overhearing the plot to assassinate Richard lacks credibility. She's in Prince John's line of sight, moving(!) in that silver dress, so as to draw the eye. If we can see her, so can he-which makes all the fuss about her secretly rounding the corner quite ridiculous. Curtiz&Keighley should've storyboarded (better)!!\nDespite such quibbles, I can't NOT rate The Adventures of Robin Hood 10/10. These quibbles just aren't important enough to downgrade such a classic.",

Directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, the film has a screenplay by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller, and stars Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.Its one of the most popular films of the career of these two actors, who have co on several occasions. In fact, watching the career of one of them means, invariably, observe the colleague. Flynn is one of biggest heartthrobs of classic cinema while Olivia is the eternal damsel in distress. The almost ideal way both collaborate is perhaps one of the reasons why the films they made are still very alive in people's memory, decades after they left the big screen.The script, slightly inspired by the stories about this legendary character, is very imaginative and it fits in we usually find in swashbuckling. The cast was up to the challenge and shone with precise and accurate performances. The theatricality of gestures and speeches, like the idealized and romantic scenarios, helped the charm of the film, with little historical accuracy but with great visual effect. That was the old cinema. One way to make cinema that has passed, but that got us pearls that we still enjoy today.",

Written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton Miller, it was added to the National Film Registry in 1995. It's #100 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list; Robin Hood was voted the #18 hero by AFI. #11 on AFI's Top 25 Film Scores list.Flynn's Robin goes boldly into Prince John's domain to call him treasonous, for wanting take the throne from his absent brother King Richard (Ian Hunter), even as he defies his orders by killing a deer on royal grounds. Of course, he escapes. He then recruits others to join he and Scarlett, including Little John & Friar Tuck, to resist the Prince and help the over-taxed poor. Marian, initially put off by the brash young ruffian, is shown the results of John's treachery, meted out by Sir Guy (Rathbone) et al, by the former nobleman Robin when he and his band of men capture them all.Later freed, the ineffective Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) and Sir Guy devise a way to catch the bandit by holding an archery contest that Robin, as the top bowman, can't resist. After his capture, Marian enlists her servant (Una O'Connor) to get word to Robin's men in hopes of saving his neck.I'm sure you know the result as well as the answer to the question as to whether Richard will return from the Crusades to assume power.

This means the Normans repressing the Saxons, with torture and impossible tax rates. Fortunately, Robin of Locksley sheds his status as Lord in order to protect his downtrodden countrymen. It's clear why this is the classic adaptation that later ones continue to look up to and reference(Mel Brooks also got a lot of inspiration from this one). Not only has it aged well, it's a genuinely great film that delivers what it promises. It's photographed and edited well(do note that the shots tend to last longer than we're used to today), there's plenty of swashbuckling action and adventure(and the fencing and archery is quite well-choreographed, if quite showy) and it's epic in all regards... score, scope and costumes(what's \"flamboyant\" in old English?). This is directly anti-racism, and outspoken about it. It incorporates a lot of stuff from the legend, including things you don't usually see. There's a ton of plot, and it's got a good structure. I can barely believe it fit that much into about 100 minutes. The restoration ensures that this looks the way it should, in all its colorful glory. Yes, it is silly at times, including Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck and even the Sheriff(who's outright goofy), leaving a devious Rathbone as Guy of Gisborne the main foe. Flynn may have found the role boring, but he is a charming and energetic titular character that we want to see win... and end up with Marian, with whom he shares chemistry and who gradually finds herself falling for the lovable rogue(in order to be a proper lady, she must at first distance herself from him, and not be convinced too easily, of course!). Historical accuracy is out the window from the beginning, and with the high pace and continuous excitement, you forget to care even a little. The dialog is clever and well-delivered, with memorable lines. There is brutal and disturbing content in this, if much of it is downplayed. The DVD comes with a commentary of interesting facts by author/film historian Rudy Behlmer, a music-only track, a 13 minute behind the scenes(pretty much just raw footage with the aforementioned expert explaining over it), 11 minutes of Freddy Rich and his orchestra, a not funny 8 and a half minute outtake reel, a 7 minute comparison between this and the '22 version, a 4 minute original trailer(and a 2 minute re-release one), one for Angels with Dirty Faces, a 3 minute introduction by Leonard Maltin, the full theater-going experience back then, one and a half minutes of newsreel, still/poster/artwork galleries and various other things(including the documentaries Glorious Technicolor and Welcome to Sherwood, the short The Cruise of the Zaca, and three Looney Tunes cartoons) that I will review on their separate pages here on the site. I recommend this to any fan of Mr. Hood. It's just plain fun. 8/10",

            "review_title": "Thoughs about The Adventure of Robin Hood",
            "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. It gives the viewers a great insight in on the difference between good and evil, even though the good is portrayed as an outlaw or bad guy. I enjoyed the film very much, with the sound/music, colors and editing of the film, I found myself not only intrigued by the noble acts that Robin Hood performs but the love story behind the storyline was very interesting as well.Almost throughout the whole film, the music seemed to be upbeat and sets the mood of excitement. The music that is played throughout the film is what people think of when they think back to this certain time period with knights and kings. Even though the characters are battling to the death the loud trumpets and flutes help to excite the audience with what is happening in that particular part of the film. Even when Robin Hood was being captured at the archery contest, the background music was still very upbeat, at least until he gets caught and thrown in the dungeon.The colors and costumes are both very bright and dull depending on which group of people are being viewed at that time. When looking at the Norman who are all of high stature, they wore clothing with very bright colors and there seem to be a lot of purple which is the color of royalty. I also noticed that the highest in rank for the Normans like Prince John wore gloves, even when he ate at the beginning of the film. What I got out of this is that other men that are not of his stature to do not deserve the right to touch his hand. On the other hand, the Saxons wore dull and earthier colors which makes sense since they are residing in Sharewood Forrest. Even though Robin Hood is of noble status, he also wears the tights with a dull green cloth which makes him seem more like a part of the Saxon poor that are being mistreated and it give the audience a sense of he does not what to show off his status and makes him seem understanding of the Saxon people. Throughout the movie the color red seems to portray the villains and green is the color of the outlaws fighting for the rights of the Saxon people. In one particular scene, there is a battle between Robin Hood and Sir Guy. In this confrontation, Sir Guy is wearing very bright red and of course Robin Hood is in green, this scene basically outlines what the audience sees with the colors between the good and bad.I thought the editing of the film was very good, there may have been some parts where you could tell that they were either used on a set like when Robin Hood is being chased by some guards in the forest and he turns around to shoot an arrow at them, that particular cut is easy to see that it was shot on a set. But with the technology they had in the 1930s, it was probably the best editing that they had available. In the beginning with Prince John finds out that his brother King Richard has been captured during the crusades, he goes to have a drink of wine with Sir Guy. Prince John spills his red wine and the camera makes a slow transition to focus on the spilled drink on the floor which looks like blood. I interpreted this as maybe a foreshadow of many deaths on the account that King Richard has been captured. In the scene when Robin Hood has gathered all the Saxons and is giving a speech he talks about how they have been treated and the camera is flowing across the crowed and a man wearing an eye patch comes into view and immediately after Robin Hood talks about the Saxons being blinded with hot irons. This scene was edited to give a good example of how the Saxons are being treated with a visual image and in turn the audience should feel compassion for the innocent people that are being mistreated. Another editing technique that the director uses is shadows of the characters against some giant wall. This is used at least twice, and I think the director wants the audience to feel a bit of excitement because they can't actually see the characters and is it's harder to tell exactly what is happening at that particular time. The final effect of editing in this film that I noticed was that Maid Marian is covered up except for the front of her face and it is hard to get a good view of her. In one scene in the film her whole head is uncovered and her hair is down, during this scene she finally admits that she has feeling for Robin Hood. I think that the director planned this to make it as a coming out for Maid Marian with showing her face and admitting her feeling for Robin Hood.Overall I really thought this is a great film. Even though there is death and violence, it had a lot of comical relief with Little John and all the merry men always laughing and having a good time and the music being rather upbeat even thought they are among a very trying time between the Saxons and Normans.",

I have seen a majority of the Robin Hood movies and this is by far my favorite for these reasons...1. This is THE BEST Robin Hood... Some may argue that it is not the best Robin Hood film (I would however), but few can disagree that Errol Flynn is the best representation of the character Robin Hood. 2. It delivers the goods... This movie has plenty of action, adventure, romance, drama and humor. When I say this movie has \"action\" and \"humor\", I mean that it actually holds up. They fight scenes and stunts are fantastic, and I was genuinely laughing throughout the whole movie. 3. -This one is important for me, and will be for a lot of younger generations- It has a nice brisk pace that I guarantee will hold your attention throughout the entire running time.4. It is a movie to marvel at... The sets, the effects, the massive cast, but my personal favorite, the amazing costumes! They all come together to deliver a visual treat that is truly impressive.

            "content": "Few movies are as fun as this one. It may not be the kind of serious-minded movie which first comes to mind when thinking of classic films. But it is a rollicking good time. And this movie, produced over 70 years ago and telling a story which is centuries old, still holds up remarkably well today. OK, maybe not absolutely everything holds up perfectly. To the modern viewer some of the humor may fall a little flat and yes at times things are undeniably hokey. So what? The movie as a whole still works. Set your little quibbles aside and just sit back and enjoy the swashbuckling sensation that is Errol Flynn as Robin Hood.Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood so a plot recap is rather besides the point. As this particular telling of the tale unfolds there are mostly pluses but a few minuses as well. The biggest plus of all is completely obvious. That would be Errol Flynn. No matter how many Robin Hood movies Hollywood churns out Flynn remains forever unmatched. In looks, words and actions he is the perfect Robin Hood. The performance of a lifetime. And he is surrounded by a mostly wonderful supporting cast. Basil Rathbone as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Claude Rains as a somewhat effete Prince John and the luminous Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian all do excellent work. As do the band of actors portraying Robin's Merry Men. It's a wonderfully acted film. But for as good as the cast are their performances are almost overshadowed by how amazing the film looks. The screen comes alive with the most vibrant color imaginable. This movie is a Technicolor marvel. Start to finish the film looks great but the archery tournament scene really stands out in its stunning beauty. This really is an almost impossibly beautiful movie. They don't make them like this anymore. So you've got the classic Robin Hood story, wonderful performances from some brilliant actors and a visual spectacle the likes of which we will never see again. But if that's not enough for you Erich Wolfgang Korngold provides one of the most fabulous scores in film history ensuring that this film is a treat for the ears as well as the eyes.With all that going for it this film can't help but succeed. But there are a few nagging quibbles. While nobody in his right mind would criticize de Havilland's performance there is the sense she isn't given enough to do. Maid Marian really is not developed much as a character, we don't really get to know her very well at all. And that makes the inevitable romantic storyline a little less powerful than perhaps it could have been. There is one character who unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb and that is the Sheriff of Nottingham, portrayed here as a laughable, bumbling idiot. It's probably not the fault of the actor, Melville Cooper, it's just the way the character was written. Guy of Gisbourne is set up as Robin's main villainous foil, the Sheriff of Nottingham seems to be there for comic relief. But it doesn't really work for the poor Sheriff. While the movie as a whole has aged well there are those moments sprinkled throughout that seem more than a little cornball to the modern eye, and concerning the dialogue, to the modern ear. But what do you want from a 70-year old movie? Best to ignore the little nitpicks and enjoy this movie for what it is. It's undeniable fun, a movie which will be remembered fondly forever.",

            "content": "Wow, for star power, it's hard to beat Errol Flynn as Robin Hood and Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marion. Flynn had the perfect devil may care attitude for the part of Robin, and his impudence towards the pretender to the English throne is fantastic. de Havilland is absolutely stunning and plays her part well as the noble who is offended by Robin at first, but is then slowly won over to his humanity and righteousness. The movie features all of the standard sorts of things we've come to expect in productions of Robin Hood - camaraderie, swordplay, honor, and daring escapes, among other things. I loved the stunts, including Flynn cutting the rope to a gate, and then being pulled upwards by its pulley in order to get over it while leaving his pursuers trapped on the other side. The cast is strong throughout, from the main villains (Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains) to charming characters like Marion's old nurse, played by Una O'Connor, who has a little romance of her own.The film is in color and quite a production for 1938, really showing how far movies came over the course of the 1930's. I loved the costumes from Milo Anderson, particularly those for the 22-year-old de Havilland, who directors Curtiz and Keighley wisely took every opportunity to shoot close up, allowing her beauty to shine, and her eyes to display fear, annoyance, anger, and love. Her scenes with Flynn are magical. The only thing I fault the film for is the soundtrack, which I found too jaunty and intrusive, even for scenes which had a lot of action in them, but that's a bit of a quibble. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because the story itself has been done so often that it's lost its shine for me personally, but if classic adventure stories with romance in them are your thing, I think you'll love this film.",

            "content": "I used to watch a ton of classic movies when I was a kid with my parents, Robin Hood of course being on the list. But I haven't seen this movie in so many years, thankfully it was playing on TV and I was able to relive this classic tale of one of the greatest hero's in history, Robin Hood. Now one of the things I love about this film is it's genuine charm, as dated as it is, that actually makes this film more fun. The actors, the fights, the story and just the feel good message of this movie makes me fall in love with it all over again. Olivia de Havilland is absolutely gorgeous and had such amazing chemistry with Errol Flynn, you could see why they did more films together. The classic tale of Robin Hood is told differently each time and with a different vision, this was the more fun and family friendly version. With Errol Flynn's charismatic lead role, how could you not fall in love with him? He is the greatest actor to ever portray Robin Hood and brings you into this world of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor with his merry men.When Richard, the King of England, is taken captive while returning from the Crusades, his brother John takes power and proceeds to oppress the Saxon commoners. Prince John raises their taxes, supposedly to raise Richard's ransom, but in reality to secure his own position on the throne. One man stands in his way, the Saxon Robin Hood. Robin goes alone to see Prince John at Gisbourne's castle and announces to John's assembled supporters and a contemptuous Maid Marian that he will do all in his power to oppose John and restore Richard to his rightful place. His lands and title now forfeit, Robin takes refuge in Sherwood Forest with his friend Will Scarlet. There they meet and recruit Little John. Other men join their growing band. Later, Robin provokes Friar Tuck into a sword fight, but then persuades the friar into joining him to provide spiritual guidance to the outlaws. One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting taxes through Sherwood. Among Robin's \"guests\" are Gisbourne, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Maid Marian. Robin and his men \"liberate\" the tax money, swearing to a man to contribute it towards King Richard's ransom. At first, Marian is disdainful of Robin and his \"band of cut-throats\", but becomes convinced of his good intentions. The Sheriff then comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin. However, Marian warns Robin's men, and they manage to rescue him when he is captured. But now Marian is in trouble and labeled a traitor, sentenced to hanging and now needs Robin to save her.Although it being dated can be fun, it can also be considered a flaw, granted it was the 1930's, so you have to cut it some slack. So sometimes you cannot take it seriously with all the fights or some of the characters. But Errol and Olivia really deliver in this movie and you cannot deny that. The sets and costumes are just amazing as well, everything came out to look so beautiful in this movie. The choreographed fight scenes also are very thrilling as well, the fencing between Robin Hood and the villains were great to watch. But my favorite scene is when he teases the friar Tuck, I just couldn't' stop laughing and having a good time as you see the actors probably enjoyed making it as well. He rides Friar Tuck into the water just to press his buttons, it's a silly scene but makes you smile. When it comes to Robin Hood, this is always the classic tale that is sure to win you over.8/10",

If you're a big fan of this movie, and are thinking about adding this to your collection, only buy it on DVD. Don't have a DVD player? GET ONE! AND QUIT BEING STUBBORN ABOUT WIDESCREEN VERSIONS OF FILMS (even though this ain't no widescreen film)! The story is strong and holds up almost all throughout the film with very little drag, not like early Technicolor adventure films which focussed primarily on love-triangles (or if you've seen the picture, THE VIKING (1928) a quadrangle [as it seems]) and has very quick scenes of fighting towards the end. If you sit down to watch this film, even just to see the first ten minutes (just for the sake of seeing the first ten minutes) you will go further, and then before you know it, you're an hour into the picture!

That it was a 'smash hit' is undisputed, whether it is, or was, the best version of \"Robin Hood\" is a matter of opinion.

What better villain could the studio produce than Basil Rathbone? As for some comic relief; who could better Herbert Mundin as \"Much the Miller's son\" with Una O'Connor as his love interest; and Melville Cooper as a bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham?The production values were,and still are, there for all to see; the brilliant three colour early Technicolor, the superb music score which audibly grabs and excites the viewer into believing (at least for a time) what they are seeing, the excellent sets of medieval England and the superb editing of the finished product which brings it all together.

Robin Hood doesn't like this and gathers up many many men to fight against these evil dictators and takes their riches and gives them to the poor. During this time he falls in love with a lady and makes her trade sides.I have seen a few versions of this film and must admit I like this one the best so far, Flynn did a great job here as the flamboyant Hood. I liked most of the casting choices and thought many did a good job, especially Flynn, Olivia Dehavill, Basil Rathbone, and Claude Raines.The direction was good but seeing as how the director was replaced half way through and not knowing how this film was shot, its impossible to know who to credit these shots to. The music was pretty good and I loved the sets and costumes.The movie has some flaws and it was slow at times, but all and all I think it was a really good movie and recommend it to anyone who fancies these types of films. Also look out for Roy Rogers horse Trigger rode by Olivia in a shot or two.3/10 stars",

At the time in 1938, this film was produced for a then massive $2,000,000, making it the `Titanic' of its day. This permitted, in addition to the top notch cast, for first class production values. The sets are amazing and creative, enough in fact that they received an Oscar. Awards also went to the film editing and the exciting film score of Wolfgang Korngold. With all these virtues, I eagerly await a DVD release by Warner Bros.",

            "content": "The Adventures Of Robin Hood (1938) -This version of the classic story was obviously not a patch on the Disney one (1973) that saw a cartoon fox in the leading role, but it really wasn't bad at all. It was clear that there had been a lot of money spent on it regarding the costumes, props, Etc and I could see why it featured on Steven Schneider's Top 1001 films list. Personally I preferred Kevin Kostner in 'Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves' (1991). Well actually, I preferred Alan Rickman as The Sheriff Of Nottingham and the way that film was made, but nevertheless they were all good interpretations.Errol actually did a great job in the lead and title role of this film and although he did seem to like to laugh a tad too much, he really was the epitome of the man in tights.The film had moments of humour, romance, action and of course adventure, all delivered appropriately and very well for 1938.The fighting was a bit too realistic. I could see moves that I might find in a playground scrap and it obviously wasn't perfectly choreographed, which I supposed was a better, more realistic thing, I'm just used to the other.The swords getting bent during the duels was a bit poor though.The story was very similar to the Disney one actually and the way it progressed could almost have been copied and pasted at points, which probably made it easier for me to follow as I've seen that other version the most often.Some of the extras and supporting artists could have spent a bit more time at acting school or been given better direction, but overall this film had stood the test of time well.617.09/1000.",

Once they both explode into the action, the film starts to take off, but a bit too late to maintain audience interest. However, the duel itself is worth noting because it comes a year after 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Flynn and Rathbone feel each other out first before they aim for the kill. In 'Zenda' they combine their fighting with a combination of repartee and parrying. In this film it is omitted. That may be why it was a dull film overall because there wasn't sufficient dialogue to pull the whole thing together.",

I give it ten stars.  Spoiler: Robin Hood is a knight which becomes a bandit to protect the poor people of England. He is doing this because the real king of England is captured in a distant land during a crusade. Robin tells John (the kings brother which is taking over England) that he will fight him with every means in his power. From that moment forth, he is for ever an out law. He robs the rich to help the poor and saves the money to send to the men holding the king. Robin meets Maid Marian when he and his men ambush a party (prince John tax collectors) with the taxes they have gathered from the people. Robin falls in love with Maid Marian , right then and there. He tells her of why he is an out law, and she understands why he's doing it. Prince John thinks of an Ideal, to capture Robin using Maid Marian as Bate. A prize of a golden arrow. ( for the best archer in all of England). Robin knows it's a trick but he can't resist not to see Marian. He disguises him self, but is still captured. He is going to be hanged. Maid Marian discovers this and helps his men get robin free with a very clever plan. Robin thanks Marian in one of my favorite parts. Where he climbs the tower to speak with her. She admits she loves him. She tells Robin she will stay in the castle to warn him of any other treason which might occur.Next, the king is returning, and the Bishop discovers this and he tells Prince John and they hire a knight to kill the king. Marian over hears this and she tells her maid which tells Robin.  John discovers that she was going to tell Robin Hood and will kill her, when he becomes king, in the morning. Her only hope is Robin to find the king and over power Princess John. Will Robin Find the king in time to save Marian and destroy the evil Princes John and his followers? I know I explained what happened in the movie, but you must understand that you will not know how great it is, unless you go see it for your self. My short sum up is nothing compared to the great movie, which is just begging to be seen again. I wish Holly Wood would make more movies like these ones.",

The magnificent colour, costumes, sword and archery prowess, even the slightly unconvincing sets all contribute to an excellent effort. Errol Flynn leads as the loyal, mischievous outlaw who defies and systematically robs the rich and redistributes to the poor, whilst he awaits the return of the kidnapped King Richard from his prison in Austria. Basil Rathbone, as \"Guy of Gisbourne\" steals this for me; he really does convey a degree of menace and I certainly would rather he had come out on top in the end!! Olivia de Havilland and Claude Rains are brilliant too - as is the underrated Melville Cooper as the hugely incompetent High Sheriff, and Alan Hale who reprises his role as \"Little John\" from the 1922 (Douglas Fairbanks) silent version of this legend. Eugene Pallette and Patric Knowles lead the rest of the usual suspects who make up a wonderfully enthusiastic supporting cast and Korngold comes up with, arguably, his best score of all for this fantastic historical drama.",

            "content": "Prince John (Claude Rains) begins oppressing the Saxons in the absence of his brother King Richard (Ian Hunter). A Saxon Lord and one of the best archers in the country Sir Robin of Loxley (Errol Flynn) is determined to fight against Prince John in Richard's absence and with the help of a few of his Saxon followers he attempts to overthrow Prince John and protect his people at the same time.For what it is this is a fairly enjoyable picture - albeit there are times during the middle portion of the film (mainly when there isn't any action) that the film does suffer slightly. However, the main issue I had with this film is how over-the-top it felt at times. As far as I was concerned, this film was painfully theatrical - particularly in the early stages of the film. One example of this is when Errol Flynn is with his cronies and they are all laughing together; for some reason a lot of these scenes felt too rehearsed and unnatural and I just didn't find a lot of it convincing. The likes of Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone were both excellent, but again they felt more like pantomime villains than anything else and I didn't find them particularly threatening and found them more amusing than anything else - although I'm sure that this wasn't the director's intention.Although I've criticised a lot of the actors for being overly theatrical ironically they are the very reason that the film is worth watching. Flynn's charisma and energy and anti-hero sensibility make him an enjoyable screen presence - the only thing that annoyed me slightly about him was his forced laughter every 2 minutes which started to grate after a while. The likes of Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone were the best actors in this film as the evil snivelling Saxon suppressors.Overall then The Adventures Of Robin Hood is worth watching; it has just about enough energy and charm to make it enjoyable and it has many capable actors on board whom all give 110% throughout the picture. Yes it's overly theatrical, and a tad cheesy, but it's perfect fodder for a wet Sunday afternoon.FINAL NOTE; this film has a U certification, but it does contain scenes of people being stabbed with swords and shot with arrows so it's probably best not to let really young children watch it.",

            "content": "By the end of the 1930s, Warner Bros. had released a string of successful gangster pictures, but consistently encountered difficulties with the enforcement of Production Code. The studio temporarily found refuge from censorship by setting their sights on a swashbuckling historical adventure \u0096 the classic English folktale of Robin Hood, the humble crusader of Sherwood Forest. One of the earliest feature-length films to be filmed in three-strip Technicolor, 'The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)' is a dazzling cinematic adventure, featuring unparalleled sequences of action and sword fights, a classic romantic subplot, and superb characterisations from an impressive cast. Errol Flynn, one of the earliest Australian actors to strike it big in Hollywood, is the charming and dashing titular character, a mischievous but venerable champion of the poor and oppressed Saxons. William Keighley was the picture's original director, but \u0096 perhaps due to illness, or because the studio wanted to \"spice up\" the action sequences \u0096 he was later replaced by Michael Curtiz; both men received on screen credit. With an epic budget of $200 million, the 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' was reportedly the most expensive ever made, but proved a major success for the studio, who immediately cast Flynn and co-star Olivia de Havilland in another two Technicolor epics {the Western 'Dodge City (1939)' and 'The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939)'} \u0096 the pair had already starred together in two films previously, both directed by Michael Curtiz. Screenwriters Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller play heedlessly with British history, but to adhere strictly to the facts would have been to rob the film of its fanciful, good-natured charm. Olivia de Havilland is sweet and elegant as Maid Marian, though I daresay that much of her beauty goes to waste hidden beneath a headpiece, which she only removes for one scene. The film's two major villains are played with wicked charisma by Claude Rains, as the treacherous Prince John, and Basil Rathbone {before he immortalised himself playing Sherlock Holmes} as Robin Hood's sleazy romantic competitor, Sir Guy of Gisbourne.This film was not the first to feature the adventures of England's favourite folk hero; Robin Hood had appeared in no less than ten films previously, though Douglas Fairbanks's 1922 incarnation is the only popularly-known example. Countless subsequent versions have followed, but few have even come close to approaching Flynn's dashing portrayal of the master marksman. Whether he's swinging gleefully from a rope, or splitting his opponents' arrows in two, Errol Flynn's Robin Hood is a hero that the audience can really cheer for. He can be a rascal at times, and has a haughty chuckle that infuriates his enemies, but, when the time calls for it, he can be suitably serious and determined, not to mention unflinchingly patriotic. It's the role that Flynn will always be remembered for. 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' is certainly not the most sophisticated film you'll see from 1938 {Michael Curtiz's 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)' is currently my favourite}, but it's just so jam-packed with action, comedy and romance that it's difficult to find another film that delivers so effectively in sheer entertainment.",

Most of the characters (and the actors who played them) were interchangeable with the same roles in other, similar costume dramas (note how Alan Hale played Little John alongside both Flynn and Fairbanks), and there was never any agreement about how the story should be told: compare this version to the silent epic starring Douglas Fairbanks, in which Little John is Robin's squire. But although it wasn't the first or the last it still remains the definitive Robin Hood movie, with the humor, the heroism, the romance and, above all, the good old-fashioned sense of adventure so vital to the Robin Hood legend (and so lacking from subsequent versions: step forward, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe) preserved in a vivid palette of colors befitting both the storybook setting and its early Hollywood source. Robin's 'steal from the rich, give to the poor' philosophy must have appealed to audiences struggling through the tail end of the Great Depression, but with his high spirited wit and energy it's unclear whether the Lord of Locksley turned rebel for the good of the people or just for the fun of it.

Robin, of course, will find time to win the hand of Maid Marian along the way as well.  I'll say the same thing I said in my Captain Blood review, they just don't make em' like this any more.  The wonderful costumes, the magnificent sets, to make a film like this, today, would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and of course, would be aided by computer effects... That's the magic for me, you see, knowing that everything you see, the extras, the costumes, the sets, were all real!  This was, and is, an example of movie-making at it's finest. The cast, well what can I say that hasn't been said?  I know Errol Flynn hated the fact that he was and always would be known as Robin Hood, and many of the critics would say he was cast on his looks, and not his acting, but he WAS Robin Hood to me.  I can't say it any more plainly then that. Olivia De Havilland was more beautiful then ever, and her scenes with Flynn are some of the best the film has to offer. Flynn buddy, Alan Hale was terrific as Little John, and Friar Tuck, playedby Eugene Pallette, steals many of the scenes he is in.  The villians, Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy, and Claude Rains as Prince John equally hold their own, and the duel at the end of the film between Sir Guy and Robin, has been the inspiration for countless imitations... Well, if you are looking for THE film in which all adventure films should be measured, you will have found it in Robin Hood...one of the all time greats. If you want to kick back, turn out the lights, and snuggle up to someone close, The Adventures of Robin Hood is the film for you...I only have one question?

Nobody was ever better as the dashing rogue swinging from trees,waving his sword or flirting with Maid Marion(the beautiful OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND).But Flynn is not alone.He is joined by what is my opinion the best supporting cast ever assembled in an adventure film. Claude Rains is brilliant and the evil and despicable Prince John.Basil Rathbone(one of the very best screen villains)plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne to the max.                      Little John is played by the always wonderful Alan Hale(Flynn's on and off screen buddy),Eugene Pallette is a hilarious Friar Tuck and Montagu Love adds to the fun as the corrupt bishop.The film is further enhanced by the early use of three color technicolor and the outstanding music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.William Keighley and Michael Curtiz both sat on the director's chair for this film and both give their touch to it.The climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy is by far the most imitated and influential sword fight in cinema history. So for those out there who want to see something worthwhile i recommend THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD,not only for being Flynn's greatest role or being the best of all Robin Hoods but for being one of the greatest adventure films of all time!!!!!!AN EASY 10 OUT OF 10",

One of the most splendid entertainments ever devised.\" - David Shipman***************************Included here is a check-list for the 1938 Techni-Color masterpiece \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\". A favorite of mine and many others.***************************The best Flynn film. Check. The best Robin Hood film. Check. The best Techni-Color film. Check. The best swashbuckler film. Check. The best film of the 1930's. Check.****************************Truly one of the most spectacular films of all time, The Adventures of Robin Hood is indeed a very special movie (the Library of Congress see's it that way too) and if you love epic adventure film's, this one's absolutely not to be missed. The story-line and/or plot should be known to all by now, which hinges on the systematic torture, theft, oppression and murder of all the Saxon's in the shire, by the sword n' spear of the Norman knights under the cruel reign of their leader, the treacherous Prince John. A revolt is in order! And Errol Flynn is, very much so, the right guy for the task!Starting with it's casting of Errol Flynn, Olivia De'Haviland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains (and many others), this classic film boasts one of the best casts ever and their used most effectively, from the movies opening frames till it's end. This opulently-staged adventure-classic has stood the test of time for nearly 80 years and for the many people who worked on it, it remains a collective career-high. One of the earliest full-length features to be filmed in the newly developed 3-strip Techni-Color process, The Adventures of Robin Hood is brilliant showpiece and was the state-of-the-art in it's day; dazzling audience's with it's gorgeous splashes of Techni-Color and rousing musical score. As others have said, I'm not alone when I say that this is the most strikingly beautiful of all the films shot in 3-trip Techni-Color (and era spanning from 1934 to 1955), sure there are some strong rivals - but none that surpass it. Rarely does an adventure film (or any film for that matter) \"move\" better then The Adventures of Robin Hood, it's pacing is phenomenally exciting and never the slightest bit boring at ANY time. The reasons for this are many, here's some: a brilliant cast of characters, award-winning Techni-Color cinematography (my favorite aspect of the movie), award-winning musical score, award-winning film-editing, amazing costume designs, supremely masterful feats of archery (including the splitting of arrows), one of the best sword duels ever captured on film, rondevu's of \"forbidden\" romance and a dash of high-spirited rope-swinging! Never a dull moment. On the matter of the spectacular music heard throughout this movie and as film music buff's world-wide will readily attest to, the renowned Austrian maestro Erich Wolfgang Korngold, created the best score of his career, which, in a very big way, further enhances the grandeur of this sweeping Techni-Color classic. Now obviously, this goes without saying, it's main man Errol Flynn in the title role, who's the biggest reason for this movie's initial success and for it's long-lasting appeal - generation after generation. But he also had a lot of help - as mentioned earlier the supporting cast is faultless, Olivia De' Haviland as Maid Marian, Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisborn, and Claude Rain as Prince John - the casting in this film is entirely grand and every scene is a true pleasure to watch. It's been mentioned by others, but I'll repeat their words, Flynn, our hero in the film is granted not 1, not 2, but 3 grand entrances throughout the course of the film; my favorite is the second entry, where he defiantly interrupts the royal banquet of Prince John and the knights in \"the great stone hall\" of Nottingham Castle, entering the scene carrying a deer carcass over his shoulders, while at the same time beating back two meddlesome guards with said dead deer, then moments later throws it down on the table directly in front of Prince John. Truly inspired entertainment. Also this movie boasts several instances of some of the best, no-margin-for-error archery ever seen (or \"stunt-shot's\" as I refer to them) such examples are: the splitting of arrows (at the archery tournament) / extinguishing candle-flames (that's, without, hitting the candle) / the shootings of numerous moving human-targets (again, no-margin-for-error) / the disarming of evil foes by literally shooting their weapons from out of their hands / slaying enemies by way of arrow-shots fired, at night, backwards on horseback while galloping hell-for-leather at full-speed and a defiant \"exclamation point\" to a regal document; a royal decree of a kind. Not to mention the arrow-shots sound incredible!Having seen this grand classic dozens of times over the years, the way I see it, even the most discerning of viewers, try as they might, will find it remarkably difficult to find any real weaknesses; and to my way of thinking, The Adventures of Robin Hood is easily one of the most perfect movies ever made. With an immense budget (for it's day) of over two-million dollars, Warner Brother's clearly knew the grand potential of this project and thus they gave it their all, to insure that it would be a top-notch film and for nearly the past 80 years - reality reflects just that. An Ageless Wonder. As of yet I've never seen a film of this vintage, which over the years has proved to be so resilient to the unrelenting trials and tribulations of time and age - as this movie show's no sign's of age what-so-ever. An agelessly radiant Techni-Color document of a by-gone Hollywood-era. This is my favorite of the Robin Hood flicks, with Prince of Thieves right on it's regal Techni-Color heels and then we have Russel Crow's & Riddley Scott's charisma-less monstrosity.........Conclusion - The Adventures of Robin Hood is a Techni-Color masterpiece and one of the most popular films of all-time. For good reasons.",

It's a 1938 vintage, and one of the first colour movies. But what colour! Flynn was one of those special actors who really did deserve the term 'star'. His unique blend of athletic action, debonair personality and chivalrous behaviour effectively defined swashbuckling. There was, and never has been, an adequate competitor or replacement. He was the Daddy. Slim, lithe, rather effete by today's standards of champion, his nearest comparison today would be Johnny Depp. How sad and inadequate is that? Just watch the flexibility of Flynn's expression, between passion, humour and fury, and check-out the vigorous sword fights.Basil Rathbone and Claude Raines play the unscrupulous, conniving villains. Olivier deHavilland is the comely Maid Marion. Sets are solid and believable. Locations fit the piece, lighting, editing and sundry technical issues each hit the spot. All the memorable elements of the legend are here - the battle with Little John on the bridge, piggy-backing across the river by Friar Tuck, feasts in the forest, the archery tournament etc.This movie is such a fun-filled romp it's like a musical with the songs omitted. But it's got plenty of tension, too, and a decent script that's well worth hearing. Korngold's anthems and pompous fanfares perfectly suit each scene, though once or twice I find them a little heavy on the eardrums. And modern viewers may find the thigh-slapping bonhomie slightly camp. The restored double DVD contains more 'extra' than you can shake a quarterstaff at. But it's the movie you're buying, and it's an ageless classic that's fit for all the family. More recent remakes are wooden and dull by comparison.",

Actually \u0096 Robin Hood was originally intended for Jimmy Cagney, but when Errol became a star they knew he was made for the role. Warner Brothers really went out on this one \u0096 period costumes, glorious Technicolor, (it looks like it could have been made yesterday \u0096 yet it was made over 65 years ago!), cast of thousands, mind blowing sets and much, much more! If you want to have a true cinematic experience then I strongly suggest The Adventures of Robin Hood (which I keep wanting to call 'The Adventures of Errol Flynn'!).This movie, of course, is about the man who steals from the rich and gives to the poor: the handsome, young chap named Robin Hood who creates a lot of trouble around Sherwood! Trouble arises when Prince John (Claude Rains \u0096 almost didn't recognize him!) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men! The cinematography is purely masterful - take the climatic, exciting fight scene towards the end. The use of shadows and light is very clever and unusual. The acting is excellent too, with great performances from all. Olivia de Havilland is wonderful as Maid Marion - her beauty is divine. I found the beginning a little slow, but as I got into it (especially when there was more Robin and Marion scenes) I couldn't stop watching it.Robin Hood is a classic tale of good vs. evil packed with action and adventure and sure to take you for a ride. I re-watched it simply for the colours and costumes! Anyone can get a kick out of this movie. Fantastic.",

Curtiz was \"indiffirent\" to his maniacal direction while Flynn complained about this matter, despite doing like 4 more movies with him, oh well. Doing this for entertainment is inexcusable. Poor creatures. Respect the animal kingdom. This is my initial review before learning of this:[Title:What else to add to this juggernautThis has it all, except maybe the sets of the silent R.H. movie (that has world record of biggest movie set built with a multi-story castle) have anything to compare, otherwise this movie has it all, and the next two decades R.H. movies had to deal with the juggernaut this movie is.That has not been already over checked. One thing the silent Robin Hood movie does slightly better is just the sets, the actual life size castle built for the movie retains a world record of biggest single set ever built. Otherwise this movie has everything else on point. The inclusion of Will Scarlet in here should be a mainstay in all the RH movies as like a second-in-command to Robin. Also there is a 'Green Knight' (and rogue like RH except a badguy) in the mythos who is sort of infused into Guy of Gisbourne who wears green colors occasionally.] Oh well. My advice is stick to other RH movies made in the wake of this such as Bandit of Sherwood (46) Prince of Thieves (48) Rogues of Sherwood (50) Men of Sherwood (52) Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men (55)",

The problem is that it just hasn't aged well compared to modern movies. The stunts and costumes - good as they were for the time - just don't hold up, even with period pieces that came only 10 or 20 years later. The dialogue has a very cheesy or 'quippy' quality to it, that makes it hard to believe in the characters.

You can't get more entertainment from a film, fun, adventure, and action, than the 1938 classic great The Adventures of Robin Hood. It's the greatest cast ensembled in a film, with the greatest and entertaining actor of all-time of Errol Flynn, the second most beautiful woman ever in Hollywood, Olivia de Havilland, and the greatest supporting cast of all time, of the very talented Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, Alan Hale, Eugene Pallate, and Patric Knowles. Also included, the director Michael Curtiz, who I think is the greatest director of all time. Also throw in the greatest musical score of all time by the amazing Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Other great aspects of the greatest film of all-time are, the greatest set decoration, film editing, cinematography, and grand finale of all-time with the thrilling sword duel between Robin Hood and Sir Guy of Gisbourne. The Adventures of Robin Hood should rank in Hollywood's top five of all time. The hell with the other so called greats such as Casablanca, The Maltease Falcon, Citizen Kane, or Gone With the Wind. Those films are boring. A great film is a film the makes you feel good and a film that is worth watching every minute of, and The Adventures of Robin Hood is that film. ***** out of ****.

It feels like they'd been doing color for years.Another \"wow\" is Director Michael Curtiz who directs Claude Rains (Prince John) and Flynn two years after this picture in the color-free The Sea Hawk (Olivia de Haviland turned down the part)and again two years after that Rains is sporting French Foreign Legion gear in the film that doesn't get any black-and-whiter: Casablanca. Make a weekend of it and see all three together, you'll be spoiled for anything else.The energetic tempo of the film surely influenced the Academy to award the editing Oscar (Ralph Dawson). Without seeing the original footage, it's sometimes hard to be impacted by something as seemingly mundane as editing, but the pacing and clarity of the scenes (the classic \"Welcome to Sherwood, my lady!\" is 3 different shots, but feels seamless) and all of the battle and escape scenes are easy to follow who is where.",

She was surprised when he entered through the chamber window, high in the castle wall. She was embarrassed to realize that he had overheard her confession of love to her maid Bess. Denying her feelings of love, she excused her thoughts as a \"game.\" In an amorous conversation exhibiting one-upmanship, the two bantered and jested with each other. They shared a tender, innocent, storybook romantic scene on the open balcony - they were equally in love with each other, and shared an embrace and kiss.So overall this is one of Errol Flynn's best films with plenty of adventure and humor...I loved it.",

I guess there was nothing really memorable about the movie for me to be excited for when I watched it recently, and that still holds true (I watched the whole film this time, don't worry).For one thing, the plot is extremely simple, and to add to the filmmakers wanting to make things clear for the audience, at several points in the movie a paragraph of text is displayed to explain what is going on in certain aspects of the story. Don't worry guys, we can follow this plot. The king of the nation goes missing, and his brother John is trying his best to take the throne for himself. He begins to tax the poor even more to collect a \"ransom\" since word is spread that the king has been kidnapped, but really this is a way for him to buy his way to power.On the other hand we have the hero, Robin Hood, an outlaw who for the sake of the use of color in the film is often seen wearing very bright green clothing (and tights). It would make sense for him to dress more raggedly like his followers, but I think at one point it is stated he was a nobleman. This character recruits people of the lower class to reclaim the money Prince John is stealing and return it to the true king, Richard.With a large set for the castle and many extras, the best moments of the movie are the swashbuckling scenes in the castle, well- choreographed to get the most action they can into the frame. Not to say the action is amazing, but that it was well-done for when this film was released.Overall this was a pretty average film, very simple but fun to watch at points, and never too violent - I don't think a single core character is killed in this film.

It's execution, however, felt disjointed.The way this was put together would be like combing the following films:\n\"The Three Musketeers\" (1948)\"The Court Jester\"\"El Cid\"Is this a comedy? Is it drama? Is it adventure? How do you reasonably combine opulent costumes and levity with\nkilling and savagery? Well ... this was just that.Does it work? Well yes and no. As a whole it fumbles along, but it's terribly disjointed in finding a personality (or genre).ACTING:\nGreat cast and they do a very good job here, which is what saves an otherwise mess of a film.Unfortunately, I got tired of listening to men laugh boisterously so much, as they did in \"The Three Musketeers\".TEMPO:\nMoves along nicelyCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nFor a 1938 film I thought they created some very believable sets.DIRECTING / WRITING:\nThis co-directing shows how two men just didn't sync up and had diverse approaches. This is probably shy the film felt disjointed to me.Oh, and by-the-by, co-director Curtis hated Flynn (who also was married to his ex-wife). Even more reason for a film to lack cohesion.Is it a good film? It's OK.Should you watch this once? Yes.Rating: 7.3.",

There are also great performances from Basil Rathbone, who makes a brilliant sneering villain and Claude Rains as a slimy Prince John.Lavish costumes and action scenes make this a spectacular romp. The music is great too and it's a shame that modern films do not approach films like this in terms of sheer splendour.I particularly liked the archery contest where Flynn (Robin) pretends to be a tinker and beats all the other archers to win the prize. The cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) attempts to hit Robin after he is captured but receives a good kick instead. Cooper's Sheriff played as a coward is the perfect foil to the great sneering villain Guy of Gisbourne (Rathbone).A true epic made in the days of great blockbusters and without modern special effects.

            "content": "I've long considered reviewing this movie before but it's hard to do it justice. For my money, The Adventures of Robin Hood is just too dam perfect a film, every element fits together to an nth degree; I could put this movie under the microscope and not find a single thing I dislike about it. Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Raines as the villains, the Technicolor, the sets, the action, the romance, the music, just the sear escapism of it all. It's the type of film that fuels imaginations and makes you feel like a kid again. This all may sound hyperbolic but the more think about this movie the more I fall in love with it and have even gone as far as contemplating to label it as my favourite movie of all time, maybe not quite but I put it in my top 10. The Adventures of Robin Hood Is just so dam perfect that I am actually envious of it.Just the first four names billed names in the cast list would make The Adventures of Robin Hood one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Who can play a more ridiculously charming lead hero than Errol Flynn? Who can play more loathsome villains than Basil Rathbone and Claude Raines? Rathbone being unabashedly evil while Raines surely most have helped popularise the trope of the effeminate villain. Likewise, the flawless beauty that is Olivia de Havilland as The Lady Marian isn't just some useless damsel in distress but a central figure in the plot's progression, acting as an insider after Robin has red pilled her.Along with the masterful direction of Michael Curtiz, these talents coming together in the same picture is one in a million. It's hard to talk about any Michael Curtiz directed film and not praise the film on a technical level. Let's talk about that eye-watering Technicolor. Where the middle ages really this colourful? Every frame of this movie is oozing in beauty and with sets featuring such an astounding level of detail, those gorgeous matte paintings or the brightly coloured outfits (especially those worn by The Lady Marian); I just love staring at it and can never take my eyes off the screen. Really, The Adventures of Robin Hood is my choice as the most visually arresting movie ever. If you have contemporary film directors who resurrect the use of black & white cinematography, then why isn't anyone resurrecting the use of Technicolor? There also isn't a frame in the movie which doesn't have an eye-pleasing composition with layers of props in the foreground and background.Every action sequence is unbelievably exciting, with the film's climactic sword fight being one of the most intense action sequences ever filmed. Also, that shadow effect is just so dam stylistic and cool; no one could implement shadows into the frame better than Curtiz (one of his visual trademarks as a director). Such scenes wouldn't be as effective though without Erich Wolfgang Korngold's highly melancholic and at other times adrenalizing score. I do rigorously listen to this soundtrack in it's entirely on a regular basis; there is no other film score which evokes a greater sense of emotion from me.On top of that, every time I watch Robin Hood it's felt like a different experience every time, even as if I was watching the movie for the first time. I swear I'm not making this up but on every viewing, I've had with this movie has the weird, uncanny effect of having scenes I have no memory of seeing. Normally when I say I don't remember a scene that would be a criticism but not in this case. That's just the magic this movie possesses and the reason it is my number 1 choice of desert island movie. If you have not viewed its perfection then what are you waiting for? That's not a recommendation, that's an order! There will never ever be a better Robin Hood movie...ever!",

            "content": "We first saw this movie along with our Father on the Bill Kennedy Show with commercials. The introduction of the ITV Television Series ROBIN HOOD (1955), with Richard Greene shooting an arrow at a target served as the lead in to the return to action. Even back then, in black and white, this was a rousing tale of adventure and a delightful way to spend a summer's afternoon resting your head on your father's pot belly while he lapsed into snoring. Kennedy would eagerly open up his paperback copy of Errol Flynn's MY WICKED, WICKED WAYS during the breaks and share with us his anecdotes about the Hollywood Lifestyle.Later on, when I was taking courses at the Rackham Memorial Building and staying at Wayne State University Apartments, I used to wander through the Cultural Center and would sometimes end up at Cass City Cinema. Besides seeing NOTORIOUS (1946) there, I happened to see one Saturday afternoon THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938), as luck would have it. I believe that version was also in black and white. But the thing that stood out to me as I sat in a packed house that afternoon, was the unreserved and unqualified approval Errol Flynn elicited every time he appeared on the screen. This feeling of a whole crowd being behind a hero, not in some kind of mocking or cartoonish way, but really being with the protagonist and believing with him through every confrontation and trial is something you would have to experience for yourself to understand completely.The thing that was refreshing was to see a main character who was a rebel, but not an anti-hero. There is nothing cynical about Flynn's portrayal of Robin Hood. There is humor and wit counterpointing every scene, and yet the whole production has the enchanted sincerity of the young child who believes in Santa Claus. Flynn's portrayal of the Man from Sherwood Forest has the same thing going for it that Linda Carter's Wonder Woman or Dwayne Johnson's Hercules or Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes in the early years had going for him. No matter how boring Flynn might have found this role to play, he is Robin Hood exactly as we always imagined he would be. Maybe not the way he really was, but hey, are you taking this ride or not?And because Errol Flynn lends such credibility to the title role, of course you are. Along with Alan Hale Sr. as Little John, Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck, Patrick Knowles as Will Scarlet, Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Melville Cooper as the High Sheriff of Nottingham, Claude Rains as Prince John, Una O'Connor as Bess, Herbert Mundin as Much, Montague Love as the Bishop of the Black Canons, Ian Hunter as King Richard the Lionheart, Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, and not a false note in the bunch. I remember all these characters so vividly because of their performances and lines and because they seem so right, like Flynn, for their roles.When I started seeing this film on Cable in glorious Technicolor I was surprised at how, well, colorful it was. The costuming is actually as good or better than anything you might find in the Marvel Universe of Cinema. Elmer Ellsworth and team create attire that is lush and begs to be taken as historically authentic whether this is the case or not. The landscapes as handled by Michael Curtiz and before him Director William Keighley give the whole movie an outdoorsy feeling like the Olympics or some other kind of sporting event. This gives the entire story a tremendous appeal ranging across a bright, sunny playing field.Finally, there is the music and man, does it go well with the horseback riding, and the romancing and the contests of skill and strength between the Merry Men and Robin Hood walking into the Lion's Den and fighting his way out with a little help from his friends. There is Howard Hill as consultant making sure that the bullseye arrow gets split down the middle and Maid Marian riding Trigger to the Sherwood Forest Banquet and Erich Wolfgang Korngold conducting the fight to the death between Rathbone and Flynn with memorable elan'. The visuals flow so well with the music that you even want to congratulate James Duff for the way he crafted the bows and arrows for the Film.Every time I see THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD it seems to be better than the last time. I suppose that's the Law of Increasing Returns. Something you only find out about in Sherwood Forest.",

            "review_title": "The must see \"Avatar\" of 1938, whose time has come again",
            "content": "To a kid watching this on an old black and white TV, The Adventures of Robin Hood looked like just another old fight and chase adventure movies you took for granted. I never would have suspected what a gorgeous gem this movie is, not even on an early color TV.It must have been quite an experience to see those original Technicolor prints in a movie theater in 1938! There had been some stabs at two- strip Technicolor movies even in the 20s, and 1937 saw the first full- length three-strip Technicolor features. But the mastery of light, color and texture in Robin Hood at this early stage is truly astounding! Technicolor was one of the great mechanical inventions of the 20th century. Because it was made with black and white film, the colors have not faded. The original prints were made with a dye transfer process that produced superior color to any ordinary color film. It surely was the must-see Avatar experience of its day. The use of candles and fires in the foreground framing the interior castle scenes in \"natural\" light gives it an almost 3D effect of its own. Plenty of you are amateur photographers now, so consider the challenges of lighting the producers faced, especially considering the low sensitivity of film in those days. It was not until 60 years after it was made, with the digitally restored edition viewed on a high resolution screen, that the public could see Robin Hood in its full glory again, probably a bit sharper than the original. This changes everything, or almost everything, for if the story were a dog, color, alone, would not be enough. It is hard to separate evaluation of the story from the color, much as it is hard to separate Avatar's story and 3D effects.Those who made the movie must have been pained to see it broadcast on black and white TV. The color is an essential part of the experience that draws you into the scenes and brings them alive, much as the 3D in Avatar does. On the other hand, director Michael Curtiz made a black and white movie in 1942 called Casablanca that showed up now and then on those independent stations, another adventure film we took for granted, until it sunk into the public's consciousness. Casablanca was designed to be seen in black and white with a gauzy resolution that was perfectly suited to old B&W TVs. Next thing you know, this late night movie was a cult classic. But Robin Hood was clearly made for high resolution full spectrum color viewing, and its time has finally come, again.Aside from the technical aspects, Robin Hood is still an excellent film, and it is obvious they spared no expense to make it the best, at least until they ran out of money. The acting and script are very good, and the story is excellent. Compare this to the hammy historical epics Hollywood foisted on the viewing public in the late 40s and early 50s, as Samson and Delilah, Quo Vadis, and other so putrid I didn't review them or couldn't finish them. In the late 30s, it was almost commonplace for Hollywood to turn out masterpieces, but after the war, they seemed to forget how. A mindlessness had set in, encouraged by the HUAC committee. Robin Hood, had it been made 15 years later, probably would have been attacked as Communist propaganda.When it was made, talkies had only been around for about 10 years. If you watch astutely, you will see technique carried over from the great silent historical epics, the wide shots of pageantry, not to mention the story cards. Curtiz's directing career began in 1912, but don't expect him to make a historically accurate film of 1191. I feel only pity for anyone so pathetic as to complain that it is not. As to history, what most kids don't know is who the Saxons and Normans were, and why they hated each other. You could start by watching some old Monty Python sketches. The Normans were the escargot eating French from Normandy, who were ruling England after their successful invasion in 1066. This is why there are so many French words in English; England was a French colony for centuries. This is also why the Brits resent the French (and why the Irish resent the English, and the Americans the English, and the Indians the English, and the other Indians the Americans, etc.). I hope that clears it up. Footnotes: There have been some pretty nasty rumors spread about Errol Flynn, mostly not entirely true, so don't let them spoil the movie for you. He was actually a pretty nice guy, from what I read. What would Robin Hood be without archery? We see a demonstration early on of him knocking a spear out of a man's hand with an arrow. I see that and wonder whether the actor was nervous -- that was a real arrow, not special effects. We see actors shot in the chest with arrows, even an arrow split down the middle with another arrow. Those real arrows were shot by Howard Hill, who makes a brief appearance in the film. He didn't miss.A great follow up would be to watch \"Robin and Marian\" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn.",

There is truth to that, if you can handle its style.This is a 30s movie and, as a true child of its age, it is very stylistic. It puts structure and style above everything else, which results in some strange (to a modern eye) presentation.For example, there is plenty of fake laughter. I'm talking fists on the waste, head raised and \"Ha ha ha ha\". Acting is accentuated and rhythmic, almost wanting to switch to Shakespeare verses.Everybody's costumes look clean, like fresh out of the washing machine. The same can be said for the sets. Even the nature scenes look polished.As a result of this, at no point did I believe anything that was happening on screen.On the other hand, the movie is well structured, well balanced. Scenes flow well and the action looks good, even if it is a bit over-stylized. You understand what is happening most of the time. The pacing is good.I also liked that this movie maintained a historical political basis for the story all throughout the film. There is mention of the Norman-Saxon conflict, kings, nobles and external historical events. A later Robin Hood movie called Prince of Thieves would give a historical background at the very beginning and then forget about it for much of the rest of the film.Overly clean look notwithstanding, I did like the way this film looked. The set up of the shots made sense with some mild symbolism thrown in here and there. I noticed some beautiful image boke in the background during close ups. The cuts are not too quick. Again, everything just makes good sense.The orchestral music really tries to punch its way to the foreground and it is good, except it could have used more variation in its mood. It is all a bit too happy and high energy.Overall, this film feels solid, a high quality piece of work, but it also feels really sterile, as many of the movies of that age tended to feel.",

We will probably never know.Approached as a stylized product of a quite alien culture, there's much to enjoy here, from Korngold's deliciously overcooked score to the Technicolor wantonness of the visuals.  Best performance comes from Claude Rains as an effete, diminutive Prince John; Flynn is great too - athletic but physically relaxed somehow, verbally quick and with a rather good smile (to make up for the abominable laugh). De Havilland can't do anything with a horrible role, except demonstrate what big eyes she has (perhaps she's really a Disney cartoon). The king-in-disguise motif is handled nicely - but this is really just a big dumb action movie, with choreography instead of computer effects, and it's that element of sheer virtuoso craftsmanship that speaks across the aesthetic gap today.",

            "content": "I won't bother to review the film...it's got legs enough of its own to reach clear into immortality. It is one of my favorites, and I really think that no one but Flynn ( like Connery in 007) can actually bring Robin Hood to mind by mere mention of his name. It is a grand swashbuckler, and I looked high-and-low before I found it...but I found it. Just a few trivial nuggets--as opposed to a review--since the film has been reviewed from virtually every angle. Nearly all of the principals in the film are foreigners or foreign born, either of British or Irish ancestry ( Flynn, Raines, Rathbone, De Havilland, etc.). One of the screenwriters, Seton I. Miller, had made his Hollywood rep writing some of the most intense gangster flix of that period, notably \"Scarface\" and \"The Last Mile\". Maybe Robin Hood was really a gangster and we just did not know it. The final duel between Flynn and Rathbone is--and has always been--my favorite and most gratifying sword fight on the screen. Korngold's score is, alone, worth the price of admission. It really sets the mood, as well as setting the standard for a lot of film scores yet to come. There are, I am sure, many other things that some others may be able to point out far better than can I, but I will end this little ditty by observing that the only thing I have encountered that comes close to the quality of this performance of Robin Hood is the series of three twelve inch 78 rpm discs made by Basil Rathbone a year or so later, which featured Rathbone in the title role of Robin Hood. He does a splendid job on these recordings, and the screen role could well have gone to him with a measure of believability. Rathbone did a series of spoken word recordings for Columbia Records in the 30s and 40s, and they are all very good, but his version of Robin Hood with himself in the title role is exceptional. He is accompanied by a retinue of radio regulars of the period, including the late, great Marvin Miller. These have become available once again in recent times. The film is worth a watch, and Rathbone's recordings are definitely worth a listen. Arise Lord Baron of Loxley !!",

            "content": "I was ashamed to not have seen, listen to, or read Robin's story, so I knew for the first time the Robin Hood story. The point is Odyssey Ear. I think that what divides the hero into two and puts it together interestingly is high as a scripting ability. However, it is undeniable that it is a bit too common story in today. But people at that time must have been overjoyed. From view of a script writer it's quite difficult to make an orthodox entertainment. Then, I feel like giving this a little more points.",

            "content": "It was during the mid-50s that I first became acquainted with a reissue of The Adventures of Robin Hood. Our small town independent cinema only seemed to show product from the minor studios and distributors (people would watch anything in those days) but with TV making inroads majors like Warners and MGM were pushing their product wherever they could. Those glorious Sunday evening shows of old classics like The Sea Hawk, The Maltese Falcon, White Heat, The Treasure of Sierra Madre and of course The Adventures of Robin Hood were pure viewing pleasure -- apart from the radio this was our only entertainment and was truly savoured unlike today when teenagers have so much choice from multimedia attractions.The movie made an indelible impression on my mind and in later years was eagerly searched for in the TV schedules. My children came along and were introduced to it as and when and to date two of my grandchildren have enjoyed it and I have two more coming up to the age I can let them experience the magic.What is it about The Adventures of Robin Hood that almost 70 years on can inspire such comments as I have read on your roster? To me it has everything you could wish for in a family film . . . A fast paced story, action, adventure, romance, comedy, inspiring music, clear diction and colour -- put in the context of its release date in 1938, when through the depression and unemployment many people lived in relative poverty and there was the likelihood of another war, a visit to the magnificent movie palaces of that era for three hours of pure escapism was the highlight of their week, it must have felt like being in heaven.I have often thought if I ran a small theatre in a large city or at a theme park this is the movie I would play for the complete golden age of cinema experience complete with an organ interlude, newsreel, travelogue and cartoon . . . plus drapes in front of the screen!! The idea was used on the bonus disc of the DVD but I thought it was a pretty poor supporting program! My wife and I watch The Adventures of Robin Hood at least once a year and even now a lump comes to my throat when King Richard pulls aside his monk's robes to reveal the royal arms to Robin and his men. The combination of dialogue and music has never been surpassed in my opinion. Subsequent attempts to bring the story to the screen have been pale imitations. Through modern communication long may the original Errol Flynn portrayal continue to enthral audiences of all ages. I have now purchased the DVD and the quality of this is stunning. 10 out of 10.",
