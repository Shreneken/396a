            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is a film I unconditionally love; it is so utterly sublime a comedy that I was truly sighing, awed, 'it can't get better than this...' at many points. Yet it regularly does; Hawks keeps the momentum going majestically; it is one incredibly surreal, bizarre tangent going off unexpectedly into another, at every juncture. He photographs and presents his actors in the most charming and amusing possible ways, and the film is certainly a more leisurely, perfectly pitched film than \"His Girl Friday\", which I nonetheless admire. There is a beauty in the photography and simple choice of perspectives and angles that matches the There is not one actress in the annals of film who I adore more than Katharine Hepburn; she is a compelling performer, of great charm, intelligence and wit; of very real, idiosyncratic looks that to this eye are beautiful, vivacious, impish. In \"Bringing Up Baby\" her Susan Vance is a very interesting diversion from her more usual type of character - the slightly superior, in-control ice maiden, as shown in say \"The Philadelphia Story\". She is phenomenal in that film, yet here beguiling in a completely different fashion, playing a slightly scatterbrained, sprightly, charmingly delinquent woman, who seems to have no control over anything; least of all her feelings for Grant. Her giddy, breathless exuberance and anarchic helplessness are really endearing; it's a wonderful film that stretches out the credulity of Grant's wonderfully straight-laced character's resistance to Miss Vance. The ending is a gorgeous, satisfying pay-off, as he finally gives way, as would we all! It's a charming, suitable ending that rectifies the slight fall-off of the preceding jail section of the film. That is very amusing, but in a more predictable, slightly laboured way. In stark contrast to the first 70-80 minutes of the film, which amounts to about the finest sustained American comedy I have seen of that length - \"Way Out West\" and \"Duck Soup\" being shorter in total. Cary Grant, truly an institution of a comedic player, is very different to his more remembered persona of later years. It's remarkable to see this absurd little man, bespectacled, unworldly and cutting an orthodox figure played so perfectly by the suave Grant. This is gleefully played on with the sublime scene where Hepburn and Grant are trying to catch the leopard - Kate butterfly net in hand! She accidentally happens to break his glasses and is even more taken with him without them... The tension between how we usually remember Grant and the character he is playing here does add an extra layer of amusement to the film. Need I really add that the rest of the film's company are note perfect? Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald and many more really give the perfectly matched stars a fine backdrop.I shan't spoil too much of this heady, sublimely silly film... just go and watch it and see Howard Hawks, a master craftsman, at his best - there are no pretensions but making a quite wonderful character comedy - and Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on insurmountable form. With these delightful stars and anarchic, scintillating comic material, what we have on our hands is an unutterably fine film, one of my very favourites of all time. Where else are you going to get such plot threads running simultaneously as: a hunt for a rare archeological find buried by a dog, an absurd upper-middle-class family dinner and an escaped leopard?Rating:- *****/*****",

            "content": "An excellent and wacky rom com inspired by the movies of Laurel and Hardy, during which we follow the adventures of Susan and David from a golf driving range until the destruction of a dinosaur skeleton, not to mention the songs needed to calm down a leopard. Certainly, the scenario is far-fetched but that's exactly the global idea! Indeed, we regularly flirt with the absurd through dialogues of the deaf, misunderstandings and tutti quanti. The manifold gags reinforce the endearing side of Susan and David. Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant excel in these atypical roles, and Walter Catlett is so hilarious. This black and white film of another era, between the Great Depression of 1929 and the Second World War, is a delight to be enjoyed with your sweetheart or with family.",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is the standard for timeless screwball comedy, clever, charming, with tons of heart. It's also probably the most satisfying comedy in both Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant's careers, together and apart, which is really saying something.Grant plays David Huxley, a nebbishy dinosaur expert who plans to get a million dollars for his museum and marry his icy fianc\u00e9e Alice. Hepburn plays ditzy but determined Susan Vance, who sets her sights on upsetting Huxley's plans so she can have him to herself.What could be a protracted exercise in frustration comedy, or else a humorless excursion into the stalking habits of the rich and nutty, is made joyous instead by the way Hepburn pulls us into her zany character and makes us root for her to reel Huxley in. After telling David, who wants nothing to do with her, that she has a leopard in her apartment, Susan trips in mid-call and then gets the bright idea of pretending she's being mauled by the beast.\"Oh, David, the leopard!\" she screams, rubbing the phone's mouthpiece against a fireplace grate for added terror.David takes the bait. \"Be brave, Susan. I'll be there!\" he shouts as he trips for the door. Kate's merry smirk is the perfect scene-capper.Susan is brave, in her convention- and logic-defying way, and one can trace the line from Jo March to Grace Quigley right through her in the panoply of strong, feminist-icon Kate Hepburn roles. But while Hepburn was amusing in other parts, she was never as much so as she was here, taking pratfalls and throwing off non-sequiturs like a Vaudeville clown. Warm, too: I think one of the film's secret strengths is the notion a nebbishy guy could end up with a beautiful, self-assured woman despite his best and worst efforts. The hell with macho: This is one romantic comedy where the guy winds up fainting in the gal's arms.Of course it helps if the nebbish looks like Cary Grant in glasses. Grant did play fusty characters in other films, but there's something about him with the pretty but frigid Alice (Virginia Walker, director Howard Hawks' sister-in-law but a good performance anyway from someone not much seen again), who tells him there will be no honeymoon or \"domestic entanglements of any kind.\" \"This,\" she says, gesturing at the brontosaurus skeleton he has been painfully assembling over the past few years, \"will be our child.\" \"Oh, it's nice,\" David replies, sadly and submissively. He is in definite need of screwball intervention.The film is one of those classics that could only be made in the 1930s, when everything could be played in a light and airy fashion without any pretense of reality. 1972's \"What's Up, Doc\" is a classy replay of \"Baby\" in spirit if not script, but while I enjoy that film nearly as much, it's not hard to see the problem director Peter Bogdanovich had on his hands trying to make us accept such nutty behavior in living color.Bogdanovich's commentary on the \"Baby\" DVD is insightful and worthwhile, and I agree with him that the subplot involving Barry Fitzgerald's drunken gardener is the weak link in this otherwise fine film. I also worry about poor George playing with Baby; does anyone else notice that nasty gash on the poor dog's side? I wonder how many \"Georges\" Hawks went through before he got the scene as filmed.The other secondary characters are terrific all the way through, especially May Robson as Aunt Elizabeth (the one apparently sane character until she complains about waiting for her new pet) and Walter Catlett as the constable, which I have a soft spot for beyond his beetle brows and his way of slapping his hands together like a mad auctioneer. Anyone else notice he shares a last name with Harvey Keitel's lawman in \"Thelma & Louise\"? Given Kate's lawbreaking performance here, I wonder if that was intentional...",

            "content": "In his glorious Bringing Up Baby, Howard Hawks ratchets screwball comedy up to its tautest and springiest level. In clumsier hands, screwball all too often gallops into the frenetic, fraying the nerves; Hawks maintains a presto pace, but never lets the mixups and misunderstandings grow implausible \u0096 he just glides serenely to something else. (And he makes it look easy, which it isn't: Peter Bogdanovich fumbled in his loose remake What's Up, Doc, making it labored and literal-minded.) Hawks could barely go wrong with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant as his leads, but the rest of the cast he assembles, human as well as animal, can't be faulted either (with the redoubtable May Robson earning extra credit). And while he draws on stock characters and stereotypes that probably date back to commedia dell'arte \u0096 the stuffy professor, the blithe rich girl, her crusty dowager aunt, the bumbling sheriff \u0096 he freshens each one up, making them distinctive, memorable and endearing.Behind a pair of repressive spectacles, Grant plays the single-minded paleontologist whose path crosses with that of madcap Hepburn, never again to uncross. The plot revolves around a leopard named Baby, a million dollars, an intercostal clavicle bone, a dog named George who buries it....well, it all makes perfect sense while you're watching.Underneath all the antics, Hawks never loses sight of the pastoral romance that Bringing Up Baby at its core really is (at its most magical in the woods under a full moon, and captured by Russell Metty's lovely photography). Grant's been rooting around in the dirt for so long looking for dinosaur bones that it takes him forever to 'get' Hepburn \u0096 an airborne sprite who never comes down to earth. (Their alchemy here is rarefied, not the commoner sort of reaction they kindled in the stage-bound The Philadelphia Story.) Last but not least, the movie features the canine talents of Asta (n\u00e9 Skippy), who appeared as himself in the Thin Man series \u0096 Nick and Nora Charles' lovable cur. Here he plays George, who, barking his stubby tail off, has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this high-strung wire-haired terrier is and will forever be (pace Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie) Hollywood's top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby, the most exquisite comedy of the sound era.",

            "content": "Casting Katharine Hepburn in the role she plays her would have been unthinkable years later when her image as a feminist icon was cast in bronze. But she's doing some serious poaching on a young version of the kind of roles Mary Boland or Billie Burke would play. Think of the parts these two women played and you can definitely see Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby if you imagine Boland and Burke years younger.Bringing Up Baby is one of those beautiful films that really doesn't have a plot. Try to tell someone verbally the plot of this, it cannot be done. From the moment airheaded Kate gets into uptight Cary's car in that parking lot with him chasing her, it's just one madcap situation after another. Howard Hawks directs this film with the appropriate light touch the material requires.Cary Grant is not the usual suave sophisticate you normally find him cast as either. He's an uptight paleontologist who's biggest thrill up to that point is the arrival of a brontosaurus vertebrae so that he can complete a skeleton. He's also getting married, but the woman he's engaged gives him hints that married life will not be any bed of roses for him. Whether he knows it or not he's ready for the romp Kate has in store for him.Thirties audiences definitely loved seeing the rich at play. Bringing Up Baby is the definition of escapist entertainment. But one who hasn't the means shouldn't indulge it what Hepburn is doing. They've got a padded cell waiting for anyone who's not rich who indulges in this kind of behavior. Only the rich can afford to be eccentric.Baby by the way is a tame leopard who Kate's brother sends up from South America. That would be a jaguar by the way, but that's just mere details. Anyway Baby escapes at the same time another leopard from the circus escapes and he's dangerous. I won't go into the confusion there, I couldn't describe it in any event.May Robson and Charlie Ruggles lend good support. Ruggles who was normally cast against Mary Boland teams up well with May Robson. And my favorite in the supporting cast is Walter Catlett as the small town constable who doesn't know quite what he has on his hands, but is determined to bluff the situation through.",

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I want to say that I really did have a laugh a minute.  Both Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are very adapt at this kind of comedy, in top form here, and work very well together.  They have a great, very funny supporting cast, as well; though most are long dead and forgotten, many were well-known character actors in the 30's.  They knew their craft, and are great at it here.  Howard Hawks must have been some director to be able to fashion such a great movie out of a madcap pace and a script in which everyone talks at the same time and is always ad-libbing. (I've heard those were his trademarks, though.)  One scene after another at breakneck pace, but never a dull moment.  As soon as one laugh stops, another one begins.  In case you haven't gotten the point, I highly suggest you see this movie.  It may be 60 years old, but it's still hilarious.",

            "content": "There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy.Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part.Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.",

            "content": "A complete disaster when it was released, BRINGING UP BABY is screwball comedy to the extreme: absolutely absurd, crackling with dialogue moving faster than a bullet, and unapologetically zany. Starring Katharine Hepburn in her only real foray into playing a \"scatterbrained heiress\" and Cary Grant as a befuddled paleontologist who's life she disrupts from the moment they meet on a golf course, the story looks almost seems like deliberately crazy plotting: An uptight paleontologist loses the last bone he needs to complete his reconstruction of a dinosaur to an heiresses' dog. This heiress is Katharine Hepburn, and she doesn't make it easier for him, since she's totally self-involved with her own eccentricities, and in one hilarious montage after another we see Grant trying to fetch his bone while getting entangled in the wildest of circumstances, one in particular which includes a tame tiger that is meant for Susan's aunt (May Robson).Featuring one classic comic scene after another, BRINGING UP BABY is a prime example of a film that was reviled when it came out, most notably because of the arrogant personality of the lead actress and her stature as box-office poison, but one that with repeated views over the years has gained a strong critical praise. While it may be a little too fast in dialogue (and in self-referential in-jokes that only hardcore movie fans will point out) for some people's tastes, just the absurdity of the situation makes it worth watching, and of course, the remarkable chemistry of an athletic Hepburn paired with a dashing Grant.Remade horribly in 1987 as WHO'S THAT GIRL? with Madonna and Griffith Dunne, it's always good to seek this one out on TCM (which plays it often). Lunatic, but fascinating.",

Furthermore, if he plays his cards right, a wealthy donor will donate $1 million to his museum, to aid his palaeontological collection. Unfortunately, he meets Susan, a woman who seems destined to unintentionally destroy his life. Huxley soon finds himself playing nursemaid to Baby, her leopard.Directed by Howards Hawks and starring Cary Grant as Huxley and Katharine Hepburn as Susan, this movie is ostensibly a comedy classic. That's hard to fathom, unless extreme irritation is classified as comedy. The irritation starts almost from the word go. Somehow we are meant to be believe that someone stealing another person's car and then smashing it up in nonchalant fashion is funny. Susan is incredibly annoying and there is no light at the end of the tunnel - the annoyance continues throughout the movie, down to and including the final scene.It's not just Susan - the whole 'plot' is random and just involves dumb things happening.

            "content": "This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser.O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc\u00e9e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection.Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's \"What's Up Doc?\" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.",

When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.",

            "content": "One of the great examples of the Screwball Comedy, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby was a complete financial dud upon release in 1938 that further cemented Katherine Hepburn's reputation as box office poison and Hawks' reputation at spending too much time allowing his actors to improvise. Hawks ended up speaking poorly of the film in later years, wishing he had made at least one of the characters a more straight-laced character on which the audience could latch their emotional involvement on. I don't know what that would have done to the movie, but I can't imagine it would have done anything good regarding this movie's free-wheeling sense of manic energy propelled by its two frantic leads.Cary Grant plays David Huxley, a nebbish paleontologist on the verge of completing his brontosaurus fossil after four years of work, the last bone to arrive in the mail the next day, as well as on the verge of getting married to his fianc\u00e9e Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) on the same day. The complication arises when David is sent to play golf with the lawyer representing a wealthy woman looking to donate one million dollars to David's museum. His time at the golf course gets quickly derailed by the presence of Susan Vance, played by Katherine Hepburn. She hits his ball and ends up stealing his car, preventing David from spending any time with the lawyer.Everything that makes this movie fun is the interplay between Grant and Hepburn. They're two abnormal people trying to fulfill their own desires through the other with intentional obfuscation on one part. It's a swirl of a certain level of madness that starts on that golf course and grows as they bump into each other at a dinner (where David is supposed to meet the lawyer), and finally we get introduced to Baby when David has to go back to Susan's apartment to fix a pair of wardrobe malfunctions. The titular Baby is a leopard sent to Susan by her brother from Brazil. Tame and cuddly for a fearsome feline, Baby rubs up against Susan's leg like a housecat. This is a testament to Hepburn's bravery because it's obvious that they are in the same shot and interacting directly, as opposed to Cary Grant who's never in the same shot with Baby for real unless there's a plate of glass between them. Scaredy cat.Anyway, Susan falls madly in love with David through their interactions and plots to get him to go with her to Connecticut to meet her family. Transporting Baby up through the country with the final bone in his possession, David is increasingly flummoxed about how he's going to get back in time for his wedding, but Susan cheerfully drives them northward. They arrive at her aunt's house and estate where they have to hide the leopard while waiting for David's clothes to come back from the pressers because Susan stole them while he was showering. She had accidentally driven into a truck carrying an assortment of chickens and ducks, accidentally letting Baby out of the car before eating several of the animals.It's all an elaborate and ever-changing ploy on Susan's part to keep David nearby her until he falls in love with her. She needs to keep him close even while her aunt's dog steal's the dinosaur bone and buries it somewhere on the grounds, her aunt's friend, a big game hunter, comes to dinner, and they find out that she is the proposed donor for the museum. David looks horrible in the situation that Susan has placed him in, so they have to lie about who he is. It's classic comedic set up on top of classic comedic set up, and it all works because of the performances as directed by Hawks.Hawks has a distinct but seemingly subdued style that emphasizes performance over visual trickery. The largest key to how he works is how he directs actors to speak as quickly as possible. This keeps his movies moving quickly, their pace at a rip, which helps in exciting moments as well as comedic ones. The frantic nature of the characters in increasingly frantic situations with a leopard on the prowl, a second, much more dangerous leopard released from a circus in the same area, and a million dollars on the line helps up the comic tension as things seem to be spiraling out of control. Characters talk so fast to each other it can be hard to discern on a first viewing every word, but each word doesn't matter since it's window dressing to get to the next comic situation or joke.That ramping up aspect of the film's stakes, I think, is what makes the movie work so well. It's not just that David needs to get back to his wedding, but he has to catch a leopard first. It's not just one leopard, but there's a second one. Everyone ends up getting arrested because of the befuddling nature of the ruses that are intertwining all around them. It gets to such a crescendo that when we see Susan pulling a leash with the wild leopard across the screen, it's a moment of sheer comic brilliance, timed perfectly within the scene and so audacious in concept that it's shocking and hilarious all at once.I simply cannot imagine how this would work if Cary Grant's David was more sedate. I think his arch nature at the beginning as a professional nerd, essentially, is what makes the film work. He's not just straight-laced, he's comically straight-laced in the beginning, and the movie, well Susan, is all about getting him to loosen up. Taking him from one extreme to another is the arc on which to hang the film's action. Getting him from normal to what at the end would be very different. Since Susan is the agent of the change, the one getting David into the hijinks to begin with, she has to be the zany one. So who would be left to normalize?Doesn't matter, though. David and Susan are their own kind of crazy as delivered by Grant and Hepburn. They work wonderfully together, apparently loving the process of making the movie so much that they showed up early to the set everyday to figure out new comedic business to try and get into the movie. Hawks manages the chaos with a subtle hand that never takes the focus off of the characters as their situations become more and more insane. It's delightful and tense and hilarious.",

            "content": "Mild mannered zoology professor Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant) is excited by the news that an intercostal clavicle (a made-up bone) has been found, but things quickly go from amazing to disaster when an annoying, selfish, narcissistic woman named Susan (Katherine Hepburn) shows up.Directed by Howard Hawks (who I like to think of as a Wisconsin native), I do not know what to say. His directing here was fine. He is interesting to me, because I find that although I like him as a director, he still makes films I do not necessarily care for. This being one, but also I am not big on Westerns.This movie stars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, neither of whom I am particular fond of (though I do like Grant's comedy films). Grant is here a bit more self-deprecating, and for that I like him. Hepburn is younger than in other things I know her from, and that gives her a bit more charm... but she still plays an annoying monster.Hepburn's voice is grating and incessant, driving me nuts. The only character more annoying is possibly the dog with his barking, but even that is hard to say for sure. I'm not surprised that Hepburn was labeled \"box office poison\" after this or that it flopped so hard. One of the worst screwball comedies of its era.There were a few redeeming parts, such as the question, \"Have you ever had jungle fever?\" And I appreciate they used an actual leopard. Then there is Grant going \"gay all of a sudden\"... I thought I took it wrong, but I did not. He really did mean what it sounds like. Today, maybe not funny, but at the time, very funny.I know that a lot of people and organizations put this on their lists for best movies or best comedies, but I have to respectfully disagree. As Hawks himself said, Hepburn tried too hard to be funny and without a straight man the characters seem too \"madcap\". There is just too much going on, and nothing keeping it under control.",

Watching this perennial favorite the other night, one wishes Mr. Hawks would have made more comedies like this one because he shows a tremendous capacity for entertaining his audiences. The screen treatment, by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, made this movie the classic it became to be after not being embraced by the public when it was originally released.The pairing of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn paid off handsomely. Both actors were at their best in the film. Mr. Hawks got excellent performances of his two stars. Cary Grant's paleontologist, with his glasses, and nervous energy, matches perfectly the the socialite that has designs on him. There is a high level of energy in the film that was a requirement for a movie of this genre.The supporting cast is also one of the things that make this film the fun it is. Charles Ruggles, May Robson, Barry Fitzgerald, George Irving, and the rest of the cast do a marvelous job in the roles they created. Even Asta, the Charles' dog, made a valuable contribution to the proceedings by appearing at key moments, even fighting Nyssa, the tamed leopard that is the \"baby\" of the title.The best way to enjoy the film is to let the magic Howard Hawks created put its spell on you.

            "content": "The very essence of screwball comedy, \"Bringing Up Baby\" may be even more frenetic than Cary Grant's 1940 vehicle \"His Girl Friday\", especially in the second half of the story. There's no question Grant went out on a shaky limb with his antics here; where else would you see a leading man risk his reputation by dressing up in a feathery negligee? And did I hear this right - his response to Aunt Elizabeth (May Robson) on why he had the nightgown on - \"Because I just went gay all of a sudden\"! Probably one of the earliest uses of the term to denote a sexual preference in film, not to enter the popular vernacular for at least another couple of decades.Katherine Hepburn is surprisingly funny and witty as Susan Vance, and dare I say it, actually attractive compared to her more mature roles opposite Spencer Tracy later in her career. I'm not sure if she might have been the best choice to play opposite Grant though; mentally I was picturing Rosalind Russell or Ann Sheridan in the role. But you have to admit, her comic timing kept up with Grant and may have passed him by a couple of times, so whatever director Hawks did to coach her through it worked splendidly.As for Baby, I was once again amazed how a picture of the era put one over on the viewing audience. It was common enough in jungle films featuring characters like Tarzan and Jungle Jim to challenge geographical integrity by regularly referencing animals to locations where they did not belong, such as tigers in Africa. At least here, the story line prefaced Baby's arrival with a letter from Susan's brother in Brazil, so when the 'leopard' later turned out to be a jaguar I wasn't surprised. Actually, it looked like both a leopard and a jaguar were used in the picture. The Baby wrestling with George, the intercostal clavicle stealing pooch, was a jaguar, identifiable by those spots within the larger dark circular rings on the body. A leopard's 'spots' don't share the same characteristics, so unless Baby did a quick wardrobe change, there had to be more than one.Notwithstanding the obvious physical humor and improbable situations, it's almost impossible to miss the obvious anatomical references played to the hilt with every mention of the word 'bone'. Not only was Grant's character misrepresented by the unfortunate name, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun while on the chase for the elusive brontosaurus piece - \"My bone. It's rare. It's precious. What did you do with it\"? How many takes do you think it took to get through those scenes? You know, there was something very predictable about the finale when Susan Vance climbed the ladder in the final scene. I was fully expecting that bronto skeleton to wind up in a pile on the museum floor, but not the way Cary Grant made the save with Hepburn swinging at the end of his arm. Could that have been the inspiration for Schwarzenneger and Jamie Lee Curtis in \"True Lies\"?",

But she pulls off the characterization of the mad-cappest heroin/heiress ever portrayed on film. It's NOT Kate. It's Kate brilliantly breaking out of her 1930s typecast. The pace is fast, Cary Grant is brilliant as the professor Kate harasses/helps/falls in love with throughout. And what about Susan's aunt and the major? Priceless! Kudos to Baby, as well. I think maybe a few reviewers have been taking their humor from watching 1930s European comedies. Unless it's all out and out vaudeville or cabaret transpositions you're watching, I wouldn't recommend making those your standards for judging \"Bringing Up Baby\". Worse still if you're judging by American/European standards of the 21st Century. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying since you can't compare this to virtually anything of those, just enjoy the ride. The Acting you CAN compare, though.

            "content": "Possibly the best screwball comedy of them all, it's amazing to realise that \"Bringing Up Baby\" wasn't that great a success on initial release. Grant and Hepburn had appeared together before (they eventually made four films together), but not under the frenetic direction of Howard Hawks. Of course there are so many great ingredients besides, all combining to make it the recognised classic it is today, like May Robson as Hepburn's giddy aunt, Charles Ruggles as a less-than-intrepid big game-hunter and Ward Bond as the bemused local sheriff trying to bring order to the continuing chaos that happens around Grant's mild-mannered palaeontologist David Huxley and Hepburn's kooky, party girl, Susan Vance. That's not to mention two leopards, one bad, one good, a mischievous pooch and a brontosaurus skeleton.The viewer is raced through a succession of hilarious comedic situations right from the start when we first meet Grant as the timid, bespectacled professor, keenly anticipating his wedding nuptials the next day to his so-serious fianc\u00e9e and the arrival of the last bone, the oft-mentioned intercostal clavicle, required in the reconstruction of the museum's prize brontosaurus exhibit. His last task, also on his busy wedding day, is to schmooze a $1,000,000 donation from an elderly, wealthy widow's legal advisor over a friendly game of golf which is where he accidentally runs into Hurricane Kate's dizzy character.From the golf course, to the car park, to a high society dinner where Susan tears his tail-coat and then loses the back of her dress, to her apartment where we meet the docile pet leopard shipped over for her to deliver to her aunt, to said aunt's country house and her bone-loving pet dog, where we get probably the film's most celebrated moment when an end-of-his-tether Grant jumps up in the air wearing a woman's bathrobe crying \"I just went gay all of a sudden!\", I'm almost breathless just writing this down.Anyway, when a second, rogue leopard is introduced to proceedings, via a local circus, things spiral even more out of control as one by one the leads all end up in jail giving Hepburn the chance to deliver a hilarious turn as a hard-boiled gangster's moll, before the climactic final scene where the two by-now lovers seal the deal over a collapsing dinosaur skeleton.Peopled besides by a supporting cast of loveable eccentrics, with Grant and Hepburn in rip-roaring form throughout and directed at breakneck speed by Hawks, \"Bringing Up Baby\" is about as good as film comedy gets.If this doesn't tickle your intercostal clavicle, then you're probably deader than the brontosaurus in Grant's museum.",

There's a dedicated minority of people who hate this movie, mostly I think because they see the things Hepburn's character does as cruel. That's the point. Hepburn's not supposed to be nice -- she's id. We laugh partly because Grant needs to be loosened up, but partly because some of Hepburn's actions are shocking. Ideally, we should be in the same position as Grant in the movie:  half-attracted, half-afraid.\nGreat \"rat-a-tat\" dialog in the classic Hollywood tradition.

He's waiting anxiously for the arrival of the bone, the \"intercostal clavicle,\" that will enable him to finish his four-year reconstruction of a Brontosaurus skeleton. Meanwhile he's trying to coax a million-dollar contribution to the museum from Mrs. Carlton Random. He's never met the elderly woman but has been dealing with her lawyer. During a friendly golf game with the lawyer, he bumps into Katherine Hepburn. She twists his uneventful life into knots. By the end of the movie he has apparently lost his million-dollar grant, his fianc\u00e9e, his reputation, his new bone, his Brontosaurus reconstruction, and his eyeglasses -- except that at the last moment Hepburn shows up and restores everything to order. Well, almost.It's a delightfully silly movie with no aim other than to make the audience laugh and it succeeds wildly.Director Howard Hawks was educated at prep school and an Ivy League university and was not much of a scholar, so he dropped out. He appears never to have forgiven the eggheads who gave him bad grades because he took it out on intellectuals for the rest of his life. Intellectualism became for him a kind of \"false consciousness\" that needed damping -- or better yet extinction -- by giving in to impulses drawn from subcortical structures. I don't want to mix Marx and Freud but that's called \"regression in the service of the ego\", or \"having a good time.\"It's often said of an admired old movie that they don't make them like this anymore. That's nonsense. They remake old classics all the time. They just do a lousy job at it.In this instance I'm not at all sure that they COULD make it again even if they tried. (And they have imitated the style -- Peter Bogdanovich's \"What's Up, Doc?\") But who could direct such an up-tempo film today? If you stopped a DVD of the movie at random, it would likely freeze on three people talking at the same time. The style may have died with Billy Wilder. And who could replace Cary Grant? Katherine Hepburn is good, but she can be imitated by people like Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"The Hudsucker Proxy\"). Nobody could replace Cary Grant. Nobody did befuddlement better. And on those rare occasions when Grant acts goofy without knowing that he's doing so, he's spectacularly naive. Scene: Grant walks into a butcher store to buy food for the leopard. He orders thirty pounds of sirloin steak. The owner gawks and asks if Grant wants it sliced or ground up. \"Neither,\" Grant replies nonchalantly, \"it's going to be eaten raw.\" And when he finishes that line, he's smiling pleasantly and he nods, slightly but emphatically, as if the reasoning behind his part of the exchange is immediately obvious to everyone else. The actor doesn't exist who could reproduce that gesture.The others in the cast are irreplaceable too. Fritz Feld as the all-knowing psychiatrist with a twitch. Walter Catlett from vaudeville as the cross-eyed chief of police. Barry Fitzgerald as the feisty drunken Irish gardener. There simply aren't those kind of character actors around anymore. And no such type would be accepted by modern audiences, let alone an entire cast full of nothing but such types. And the audience has become used to larger, splashier, more expensive films. Would they pay ten dollars to watch a movie in which the Connecticut woods are obviously on an RKO sound stage? In black and white? The indisputable success of this movie raises questions about the nature of comedy itself. How come we laugh at stories like this? (Step carefully, please. We don't want to disturb Freud again.) Well, considerations of space preclude an answer. For a full explanation, see my forthcoming book, \"Laughter: Triumph or Disaster?\", in which I demonstrate conclusively that the ludic impulse in man frequently manifests itself in terms of conflict.",

Non-stop barrage of chatter and pratfalls was highly influential on many future filmmakers, who may have been able to refine this screwball formula somewhere along the way.

Nor is there a comedy, I believe, that has a greater chemistry than exists between the main characters (including the delightful contributions by character actors May Robson, Charlie Ruggles and Barry Fitzgerald). You might then wonder why I'm going to confess I would not put it amongst the Top 10 ROMANTIC comedies. It is, at least on the surface, a romantic comedy. But the romantic side of this doesn't work quite as well as the comedy - for my money. Yet, that being said, I'd still argue it should be listed in the Top 50 top romantic comedies ever (which is still saying something). This is not to take away from the film but to say that romance really isn't a strong component of this film - nor was it (I believe) meant to be. It's just a framework upon which to create a comic work of genius. (I'm not sure many would say Hepburn and Grant had a lot of romantic chemistry here. In other words, unlike When Harry Met Sally or The Shop Around The Corner, the resulting romance at the end of this film doesn't warm your heart quite as much; it's not as convincing or moving as other romantic comedies on a romantic level.) But that's a trifle. To fault it for that is just quibbling. Because here you have two of the greatest actors ever - Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - at their very funniest. You have a screenplay by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde that crackles with wit and hilarity. You have a pace that's like a roller coaster and laughs that will have you on the floor at times. No male actor was better at comedy than Cary Grant and here he sets the standard for how to do it. No actor can best his performance here, nor have they come close - in my humble opinion. (Grant, of course, put in incredible comic performances earlier in The Awful Truth and later on in Arsenic And Old Lace and other movies; yet I still think he laid the law down especially in this movie. This is how you do it.) Katharine Hepburn - who was as good a comic actress as serious - was absolutely inspired in this film and was never better. Was there a better female acting performance in a comedy before this movie - funnier, more convincing, with more energy and sophistication? I'd argue not (although Claudette Colbert was brilliant in It Happened One Night and Irene Dunne was stellar in The Awful Truth, etc., etc.). And you'd be hard-pressed to find a better female comedic performance in a movie afterward - although TV's Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett would later raise the bar even higher, on the tube. But I wouldn't be surprised if they learned some lessons from Hepburn here. This is just a joy ride of genius that - like all great movies - is worth seeing again and again. With its sophisticated side and its more vaudeville-inspired physical humor, this fires on every cylinder and delights over and over again.",

Not only does it stand up to repeated viewings, it seems almost to *require* them; there's no way to absorb everything at one go. The best part is that the funny bits are just as funny on the sixth viewing as they were on the first, if not even funnier, because you've grown to really love the scatter-brained chatterbox Susan, and the befuddled, confused David.It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing either Susan or David: Hepburn and Grant are perfect for their roles, and their characters are perfect (foils) for each other. Most people would consider Hepburn a dramatic actress, largely because of her later body of work (e.g. The Lion In Winter). But BUB proves she is a dazzling, charming comedienne, well able to go toe-to-toe with the funniest men in the business. Grant is wonderfully generous in allowing her to dominate the movie by playing the straight man, and he does so wonderfully as well.Watch this for Hepburn, watch this for Grant, watch this for Hepburn *and* Grant... and, oh yes, watch it for the leopard. ;)",

But that's okay because it's just meant as pure entertainment. This movie is awesome, and especially for a film that is over 75 years old. For some people it's hard to go back and watch old classics and still have fun with them. But with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn you know your getting the best of the best performances.And to be quite frank, this may be Cary Grant's best performance, at least that I've seen. Usually he plays the slick guy who investigates, or leads the women out of trouble. But in this film he plays a character who is insecure, and never accomplished something in his life, and of course unsure of marriage. That is until Hepburn comes in and steals his heart. I liked her in this role even more than The Philadelphia Story, which is considered to be one of the greatest rom-coms in history. In my opinion Bringing Up Baby is better. For a 1938 film, it actually had me wondering how they filmed some scenes, especially with the leopard. Filming a leopard on screen with Oscar nominated actors is more impressive than some of the FX current filmmakers do today.Seriously though, this movie is pure gold in terms of comedy. And normally for old movies like this it has the same old premise, but in fact Bringing Up Baby is a much different film and at times unexpected. It's a 75 year old film had me laughing several times and that is something that's hard to do for someone who's not keen on comedies. It's a highly re-watchable film and among my favorite classic rom-coms. I highly recommend watching, it's a great time at the movies.10/10",

And Bone or David's life would never be the same again!Having finally found the last piece of a four year jigsaw puzzle, a full skeleton of a 100 foot long brontosaurus, the elusive inter-coastal clavicle bone David is happy as a little boy to hear that the rich and animal loving Elizabeth Random Mary Robson, is to give his money starved museum a $1,000,000.00 grant to keep it aloft. It's the screwy Susan, who just happens to be Mrs. Random's niece, who turns things upside down for David by not only getting him on the outs with his stuffy and narrow minded, in her obsession with the museum, fianc\u00e9e Alice Swallow,Virginia Walker, but her Aunt Elizabeth as well! David is also driven insane during the entire film by Susan's pet leopard \"Baby\". Baby happens to be a gift from Susan's brother the \"Frank Buck\" like big game hunter Michael to her Aunt Elizabeth. It's Susan's job to see that Baby gets to her Aunt Elizabeth by the very next evening which incidentally coincides with the luckless David's scheduled marriage to Alice Swallow!Laugh a minute screwball comedy with both David and Susan getting caught up with getting Baby safely back home, to Aunt Elizabeth, and at the same time David's precious one of a kind inter-coastal clavicle bone stolen by the, Aunt Elizabeth, family dog George! Both David & Susan run themselves silly chasing George all over Aunt Elizabeth's 26 acer estate trying to got George to dig up the bone, the inter-coastal clavicle, that he buried there.It's really Baby who steals the movie from right under it's two legendary stars Cary Grant & Katharine Hepburn's noses in the few scenes he's together with them. Baby has the time of his life driving everyone in the movie either crazy of fearing for their lives. It's later that the tame and lovable Baby is mistaken for an escaped, from a local carnival, and vicious leopard who's anything but the friendly type kitty cat that Baby is! And it's then when things in the film, if they didn't already, really start to go bananas!One of the best screwball comedies of all times with both Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, in what was to be her first of many comedy roles, at their very comedic best. Remade some 45 years later with Ryan O'Neal and Barbara Streisand in Peter Bogdanovich's hysterical and modernized \"What's up Doc\" the movie \"Bringing up Baby\" is still the one screwball comedy that all other screwball comedy's are measured by. And as far as I can see will never be equaled much lass eclipsed by any of them.P.S The lovable and mischievously cute leopard Baby didn't look like a leopard at all looking more like a baby or very young jaguar. With his bull-like neck and muscular jaws, the most powerful of all the big jungle cats, and body as well as his over-sized and diamond or rosette-like spots inside of spots coat Baby had far more of a Jaugar then a leopard, who's far thinner and more streamlined, appearance. In fact Baby was said to have been captured by Susan's brother in the Amazon jungles of South America where jaguars, not African or Asian leopards, are in abundance!",

But when it is a fresh entry, that reasons for liking a film or not are too tied to convention and belonging to be teased out. Here we have a seventy year old comedy.When it was new, it was so disliked it drove Hepburn out of Hollywood. Hawks, the director was shunned for a while. Hepburn stopped sleeping with and being paraded by Howard Hughes, determined to change her image. Hawks and Grant considered it a disaster and for their next pairing (\"His Girl Friday\") were careful to get an actress and script that really could carry the weight of a screwball comedy. I'm with them: \"Friday\" was a masterpiece of screwball: frantic timing and highly abstract situations. This is a disaster in all but one dimension.And yet there are people today who think this is hilarious. Enough even to place this on several \"best of\" lists. Its one of the great puzzles in life, this. I mean its a mystery as big as the sun why people laugh in the first place. But why they laugh at different things, just boggles.In my opinion, Hepburn does a fine job in looking truly attractive in a sugared nutcase sort of way. Her incompetence in handling the character sort of works with her one strength: how to manage what's dangled, what's seductive. But her comic timing is all off, and it throws Grant off too. No one can see what Grant and Russell did in \"Friday\" in how they established a rhythm that Hawks could extend into the container of the banter, no one can see that and think this worked. But they do. The only explanation I have is that we now are used to intended incoherence, and we as moviegoers accepted Kate in her re-engineered state. So we project modern measures back on this.I didn't laugh. Perhaps you will.There's an offhand remark at the beginning. Someone is to make a donation of a million dollars.

In fact, its failure was one of the reasons why Katherine Hepburn was labelled 'box office poison' before rebounding in \"The Philadelphia Story\" a couple of years later. However, time has been kind to the movie and it is now considered a classic.The story concerns a mild mannered zoologist who is angling for a million dollar endowment from a wealthy dowager. Unfortunately, his efforts to make a good impression are continually wrecked by a woman who turns out to be the niece of his would-be benefactor. The 'Baby' of the title refers to a pet leopard who instigates much of the action.Within this simple framework, screenwriters Dudley Nichols & Hagar Wilde spin an invigorating tale full of numerous farcical situations. The award-worthy script moves at a breathless pace and is rife with clever dialogue.The stars, Cary Grant & Katherine Hepburn, are both exceptional. Given the poor response to the film, neither of them got any awards attention but it certainly wouldn't have been undeserved. Grant convincingly played against type and Hepburn supplied an energetic, multifaceted performance. The supporting cast is also particularly solid, especially Charles Ruggles, Walter Catlett & May Robson.The direction is trademark Howard Hawks, with the chief attraction being the effortless handling of the film's frantic action. The other technical elements of the film are well handled but the focus is squarely on the comedy, as it should be.All in all, I think that \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a highly entertaining comedy that has aged well in the 70+ years since its original release.

These two films as well as HIS GIRL Friday are all definitive proof that when it comes to classic screwball comedy, Cary Grant was a god!The best part of this film is the weird role played by Katherine Hepburn. She plays against type as one of the ditziest dames in film history--sort of like a livelier and dumber version of Gracie Allen! She just steals the show from Cary Grant, though he, too, does a great job in the film. So, if you are looking for Grant's greatest performance, the other two films are more showcases for his zaniness--though later in the film, Hepburn's nuttiness seems to wear off on Cary, just a bit.Cary plays a \"stuffed shirt\" paleontologist whose two loves in his life are the dinosaur he's trying to complete and his cold as ice fianc\u00e9e. When an important bone from the dinosaur is discovered, it represents the final bone and an end to years of work to assemble it. However, shortly after getting the bone, Ms. Hepburn accidentally kidnaps Grant and the missing bone. And, a short time later, her annoying terrier steals the bone and buries it on Hepburn's huge estate! Cary discovers the bone is missing about the same time \"Baby\" arrives--Kate's new pet Leopard! Well, much of the movie is spent going on some of the screwiest adventures with some of the funniest scenes of the 1930s. I especially like it when Cary is forced to wear a woman's robe. When someone comes to the door, he has a hard time accounting for the clothes and finally says he has the robe on \"because I was feeling quite GAY today!\". If only he knew what this would mean if said after the late 1960s! Anyway, by the end of the film, Cary is ready to kill Kate. However, despite this he also realizes he loves the excitement being married to such a nut and can't marry his cold, icky fianc\u00e9e.

            "content": "The poor schmuck is Dr. David Huxley, a mix between Ross Geller and Clark Kent, a mild-mannered museum's paleontologist whose huskiness is efficiently hiding underneath thick glasses. This is a good start, a leading man who doesn't exactly exude the usual self-confidence but strikes as a gentle and rather passive fellow. Huxley had meticulously reassembled a brontosaurus' skeleton when his fianc\u00e9e and co-worker Alice (Virginia Walker) announces that the missing clavicle has been found after so many years: this is the highlight of the day, and everything goes downhill after that. 'Boneless' Huxley is assigned the mission to convince a lawyer named Peabody to convince her client, a rich dowager named Elizabeth Constance Random to make a donation to the museum. He also learns from the mainly concerned, that there won't be no honeymoon; no children, all the joys of marital life dedicated to science (I suspect 'no sex\" too).The character of Alice solved the main issue I had with screwball comedies: taking our sympathies for granted. In my review of \"The Philadelphia Story\", I hated how the script was trying to make a loser out of the groom while the trinity of actors composed of Grant, Stewart and Hepburn were no better. \"Brining Up Baby\" doesn't suffer from such a case. The leading man is undoubtedly likable, and we certainly believe the rigid (or should I add an 'f'?) Alice won't take him to wonderlands. So whoever shows a pretty face in the next scene, will win our hearts if only by default. I didn't think it would be so immediate.Desperately looking for his golf ball, Huxley bumps into Susan Vance, a rich heiress who's as joyful and flighty as Dory from \"Finding Nemo\". Susan has a unique talent, just when you think you're out, she pulls you back to her. She takes Huxley's ball (only one of the few risqu\u00e9 innuendos the film is full of) and his car, so he gets on it (not in) and let himself be driven far away from Peabody\u0085 and that goes on and on during the whole picture. But it's not much Susan's antics that are funny, but her total obliviousness to the effects on poor Huxley. And this obliviousness never gets redundant Susan is also a sweet, adorable and gentle spirit that is so unlike any character I saw Katharine Hepburn play.Seriously, what a pleasant surprise! I didn't know Hepburn could be so funny and in such a silly and eccentric way, she might have been funny in \"The Philadelphia Story\", but she was playing a serious character, in \"Brining Up Baby\", it's a real Laurel and Hardy pairing she forms with Grant who keeps on mumbling on every nice mess she gets him into. Naturally, we know this is just a matter of time before sweeter feelings get reciprocal but comedy is the priority and the interactions are closer the usual buddy odd-couples movies formulas. And the film sure knows how to handle humor in every single form: slapstick, fall traps, misunderstandings, verbal, visual, and absurd,marking an interesting departure from Howard Hawks's dramatic directing and showing the first signs of his immense versatility. And once the laughs start, they keep on escalating, following a simple, familiar, but brilliant pattern: no matter how hard Huxley tries to get off Susan, Susan or luck finds a way to make her cross his path, or just stick to him. The film smartly avoids redundancy by making her motivated by love, rather than silliness. But as romantic as the story tends to become, it's on the comedy department that it features creative stuff we're not prepared to enjoy. Susan gets a tame leopard named Baby and taking Huxley for a zoologist, asks him to bring it to her Aunt's house. You'd think a leopard would only be the foil to a few 'Boo' gags, don't be so sure, it carries the plot with more confidence than Huxley walking near it.And just when you think that Huxley is finally and permanently over with Susan, we finally get the best twist: he realizes that her aunt, with whom he just had an argument is the generous dowager and is played by the oldest Oscar nominated actress, Mae Robson. She has money, temper but also has a dog named George who seems to love Baby's company and a certain clavicle. And we all know what dogs do with bones. Also joining the party, there's Major Applegate (Charles Ruggles) and since Susan told them Huxley was a big game hunter like him, the dinner is the occasion for a great conversation, spiced up by an argument about the sound of owls and leopards and the intrusion of the drunken gardener (Barry Fitzgerald) who just met the adorable feline. No straight people, the whole cast is equally hilarious.And there's a time in the film where it could stop anywhere, it would be good, but it's like an unstoppable chain of gags, getting so chaotic that you wonder how all the pieces will be reassembled, and the film offers the perfect climax in a prison, where all the joyful cast desperately try to tell a disbelieving officer what the mess is about. The film concludes with the perfect note on the relationship between Huxley and Susan, they love each other, but no need for a Hollywood kiss, it's a comedy before a romance and its treatment of comedy is so modern I wonder if this is not why he wasn't well received at its time. The film was a flop and ill-received by the critics, go figure why.Now, it's a different story, it's included in the AFI's Greatest Romances, Comedies and Movies. Of course, \"The Philadelphia Story\" is ranked in the same lists but \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a title I will sure bring up as when asked about underrated 30's gems.",

I am just so confused from where to start and where to end this madness ride. The story of a zoologist who gets mixed up in mess because of one literally silly but sweet girl and how it leads him to have one of the most hectic as well as most wonderful day of his life. Bringing Up Baby is nothing else but a timeless mania, an outstanding comedy and excellent writing all the way into it. It might take me some years to find a comedy like this where madness reaches the peak and still doesn't look mad at all, rather it keeps making sense. Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant sparkle like never before in this genre and make this top class comedy look even better with thier chemistry and sensational performances. The writing is the soul here and when the soul finds the right chords then the body will perform on right directions. Every character has the feel, the sense, the variety, the madness and what not. I have never seen such a hysterical comedy when the 2 main are made at thier own individual levels but when they come together they generate sensibility unknowingly while they were actually doing mad things knowingly. Hepburn has always been a nuisance but you can never blame her for being wrong and that's my friend is Magic of writing. Dialogues in this film deserved to be stored in the library of filmmaking and if anyone ever wants to make a mad comedy then just go through it to learn how to do it. Bringing Up Baby is a rare comedy that can be enjoyed by kids, teens, adults and even seniors, i mean all 4 generation can watch it together and enjoy it with the same joy. Howard Haws did something which was meant to be remembered forever. I was late though, i just gotto know it after 82 years but that's swell.. But i will remember it forever. An art of telling comedy end up nothing short of a Classic. It's Peculiar !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Because of its box office failure after one or two other films a bunch of \"expert\" movie house owners called Katherine Hepburn \"Box Office Poison\" on a notorious list in the late 1930s. Fred Astaire and Marlene Dietrich were also on that list. One would love to know what other \"great\" prognostications and viewpoints this bunch of yokels made over the years. Did they predict Dewey would beat Truman too? Or that Sputnick proved the Russians would land on the moon first? I only hope that they ended up being laughed into oblivion by their families and friends. For \"Bringing Up Baby\" was one of the funniest movies of the 1930s. It is not flawless - the Katherine Hepburn character is the supreme example of the spoiled madcap heiress of the genre of madcap comedies of the 1930s. And she certainly gives the viewers much to laugh at, such as her impossible readiness to steal objects from golf balls to automobiles, or to try to wake sleeping people up by throwing pebbles at a window, or trying to calm a leopard down from the roof by singing with Cary Grant, \"I Can Give You Anything But Love\". In no other comedy she made is Hepburn so ditsy. But the behavior of Hepburn is the sole problem of the film. She does such a number of things to keep Grant under her control while she derails his marriage plans that she almost makes the viewers dislike her. But Grant is such a dud personality from the start of the film that one can understand why she has such an easy time pulling him around.Howard Hawks made several comedies with Grant, most notably \"His Gal Friday\". But in two of them Grant plays men who each end up being a yo-yo for the women who love them. The other one is \"I Was A Male War Bride\", where Hawks paired Grant with Anne Sheridan, and puts him through a series of humiliations that go all the way to the conclusion. Both are equally funny films, but both are set in their times, one a peacetime film the other a post-war comedy. But the conclusion of \"Bringing Up Baby\" is more memorable - when the life's work of Grant, the anthropologist, is shattered. The fall of the brontosaurus (again caused by Hepburn) is so famous that it was reused in \"On The Town\" (early in that film) when Jules Munshin knocks down a similar brontosaurus.Here we watch David Huxley (Grant) plans to get a million dollars for his museum and his plans to marry his assistant Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) go down the tubes from his constant collisions with the easy going but determined Susan Vance (Hepburn) first on a golf course, then at a restaurant (she causes him to fall by trying to catch an olive which he trips on - see the \"summary line\"), to her apartment (where he meets her new pet leopard, \"Baby\"), to her shanghaiing him to Connecticut. In the end he has to wear a woman's robe (shocking Hepburn's dowager aunt May Robson), pretend he is an insane big game hunter named Bone (and get bored by tales of big game hunting from Charlie Ruggles), dig up a lot of the estate looking for a dinosaur tail bone, wrestle one leopard and release a second one, and deal with a somewhat confused town constable (Walter Catlett in a lovely absent minded performance) and an \"understanding\" psychiatrist (Fritz Feld). The film works despite being really a series of loosely tied together events. They flow from one to another, but due to the standard of lunacy involved the chunks of the film remain in our memories rather than the connecting links. But those are truly golden chunks, and make the viewers simply want to see more. This film is a real keeper for any fan to want to watch.",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\", Howard Hawks' 1938 film that paired Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant is certainly one of the best films of the screwball genre that permeated Hollywood in the 1930's & 1940's. Grant plays Dr. David Huxley, an anthropologist on the brink of completing a dinosaur skeleton (he's down to needing one bone, which is to be shipped to him the next day), and is about to be married to his colleague and fellow scientist. The day before his marriage, he arranges to meet with an attorney who represents a client that has one million dollars to bequeath to an organization, and in order to schmooze him, goes to play a round of golf. At the course, David literally runs into Susan Vance (Hepburn), a flighty debutante whom he ends up encountering throughout the evening (in many a silly situation) and into the next day when, after realizing that she's fallen in love with him, Susan tricks David into helping her transport a panther (Baby) that her brother has shipped to her, to her aunt's house upstate. Of course, it turns out that the aunt is the person with the money to donate, so scene after scene of high hilarity and mix-ups ensue.It is really hard to summarize this film in a coherent paragraph because there are so many madcap moment and weird plot devices that even attempting to do so would probably short circuit my brain. One of the main points of the screwball comedy genre, however, was physical comedy and misunderstanding/confusion, with the plot being secondary to the action. \"Bringing Up Baby\" was Katherine Hepburn's first attempt at comedy, which is pretty surprising since she is simply excellent in it. Her timing, flair and charm are absolutely flawless. Cary Grant, no stranger to comedy by this time, is also wonderful in the straight man role. The two look like they had a lot of fun making the film, which makes the fact that it was a box office failure even more of a disappointment. I'm not entirely sure what made the film gain enough exposure to become one of the most beloved films of all time (it is routinely on \"best of\" lists, including the IMDb Top 250) but it has found a secure place in film history.I had the wonderful opportunity to see this film on the big screen several years ago, and though I had seen it already as a child, I found myself laughing so hard at it that my eyes were running. The neatest thing about the experience however was the absolute adoration the audience had for the film. My nearly constant laughter was completely drowned out by the other 100 or so people, and it was just an overall cool thing to witness. Unfortunately, when I watched the film again two weeks ago, it was an audience of two, and my boyfriend, who doesn't seem to be a fan of the genre, sat pretty stone faced throughout the film while I was slapping the couch and crying from laughter. (Hey, I can't criticize, my reactions are very similar to what his was any time I see 99% of the comedy films or television shows out there, it's just not my bag) But, the classics are my thing, and while it's certain that the frenetic pacing, the extremely fast dialogue and screwball situations are going to turn some people off, particularly those who may not be familiar with that kind of film, it is also going to be a gem of a film for those of us who mostly rely on classic films to make us laugh, since that was when comedy was truly great. 7/10 --Shelly",

Basically Hepburn's character has got a leopard (the \"baby\" of the title), which of course escapes, and various predictable japes ensue. That's it, folks!Unfortunately the studio decided to steam-roller this movie out to 1h40 instead of keeping it more palatable at about 1h10.

One day he runs into a rich woman who instantly falls in love with him and has connections to people who can help him get the money he needs for his museum so he can finish his projects.

Grant and Hepburn are magnificent and how they play off each other is brilliant. The settings and circumstances are unique, unpredictable and very entertaining.

Unless you love screwball comedies, that's the only reason to watch this flick.Cary Grant plays a bespectacled, nerdy professor pursued by silly society girl Kate, and time after time he gets roped into her madcap adventures involving Baby the Leopard. My favorite scene is when Cary's working in his museum up on a high ladder next to a dinosaur skeleton. Kate visits him and winds up holding onto his hand for dear life as she dangles off the ladder! The other famous scene is the meet-cute. Kate and Cary are at a restaurant and they both manage to tear their evening clothes in pretty embarrassing places. It's rather silly, setting the tone for the rest of the film.I'm not really a fan of this type of ridiculous romantic comedy, so I didn't really like this movie.

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it on TV when I was very young, and back then, I only watched it because there was a leopard in it. But as I got older, I realized the (obvious) reason why this movie is so perfect: Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. Two of Hollywood's greatest stars of all time, combined with the brilliant writing of Howard Hawks; this movie is so classic, it's intimidating. It has all the elements of a classic screwball comedy and never lets up. I know I may be taking a risk saying this, but \"Bringing Up Baby\" is the greatest movie in this genre. I know people would say movies like \"It Happened One Night\" or \"The Philadelphia Story\" are better, but I'm still sticking with \"Bringing Up Baby\". The movie is that classic \"opposites attract\" story (which has been done dozens of times even up to present day comedies), and it's done with two of the most likable characters in film history. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn work off each other perfectly in this movie. Cary Grant is the nervous, spineless stick in the mud who can't ever seem to get a break, and Katharine Hepburn is the eccentric, fast talking wild child who seems to be in control throughout the whole movie. This movie has too many great moments, too many great characters, and too many great lines to count. If you were to ask me, \"What's the best moment in \"Bringing Up Baby\"?\", I would probably respond \"The first 102 minutes\". The writing and acting in this movie is so funny, I could watch it a hundred times in a row and not get tired of it. The romance in this movie is really good to. It is a 1930s \"I just met you a few days ago; let's get married\" romance, but it is the most believable I've seen in this genre. And back in the 30s, marriages did happen like that. People were being shoved off to war every day, so some marriages did happen that fast. There's just something about these two characters that make a perfect match. Their chemistry is something that can't be explained (which is the case of a lot of romances), and that's what makes it feel so human, and that's why we want these two to end up together.Katharine Hepburn does steal the show, but she wouldn't be able to do so if it wasn't for her working off the everyman, Cary Grant. I don't think I'm taking a risk in saying this; Katharine Hepburn is the greatest and most important actress of all time. Yes, there were big important actresses before her, but Katharine Hepburn showed that women could be just as funny, if not funnier than men in the Golden Age of Hollywood. What really makes Hepburn stick out is how she was never written as a woman, she was written as person. And not only in \"Bringing Up Baby\"; in \"The Philadelphia Story\", \"His Girl Friday\", and \"African Queen\", she's a person first, and a woman second. This was over 70 years ago, and Hollywood still can't get female characters down right. You just watch Katharine Hepburn, and you immediately want to be just as witty, just as carefree, just as nice, and just as diverse as her. There's just so much life in these characters, they leap right off the screen. Did I mention there's a leopard? Like I said, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It has great characters, great writing, great acting, great story, great slapstick, great everything. \"Bringing Up Baby\" is one of those movies that is so great, I feel the need to bow down to the screen every time I watch it.

            "content": "The screwball comedy, classic romantic sub-genre of the 1930s, may not have one hard and fast definition, but almost all of screwball comedies revolve around the same idea. A man and a woman are thrown together by circumstance take an instant dislike to each other, and yet it is immediately obvious to us that they are made for each other. What follows is simply the fun and games they go through before they realise it themselves. It seems that the closer a screwball follows that pattern and the more it makes those elements work, the better it is.Bringing Up Baby is a perfect example, although rather daringly it pushes the antagonism between the leads further than ever before. With this wild and witty screenplay by Hagar Wilde and Dudley Nichols, it's not simply a case of personality clash. Katherine Hepburn's character is a genuine disaster area, leaving a trail of destruction behind her that puts her on a par with Harpo Marx. And like Harpo, she has that quality that means she would be infuriating in real life, but is instantly likable on screen. Cary Grant, as a relatively regular and rational man, ought to be the character we sympathise with, and yet it's delightful watching him getting wound up by Hepburn's antics. A real turning point occurs in the story when we realise Hepburn is falling in love with him. She suddenly becomes our heroine because we want her to gloriously sabotage his wedding to the frumpy Virginia Walker, and we'll enjoy watching her do it.Of course a lot of this likability and chemistry comes from the actors. Hepburn had occasionally demonstrated a flair for comedy in her earlier films, but never before had she been able to really throw herself into such an oddball creation. The trick to her appeal here is the way she uses her typical Hepburn sophistication to make it look like she knows what she's doing which, along with her impeccable comic timing, makes it all the funnier when things fall apart around her. Grant on the other hand does a perfectly styled reasonable-man-driven-loopy act, his reactions crazed, but no more so than situations he finds himself in, meaning he is both funny and believable. The fact that we can laugh so much at these two tussling makes us want them to become an item.The extra factor here is director Howard Hawks, who had a great touch with comedy. Importantly, Hawks doesn't cut into the scene with two many close-ups or angle changes, generally keeping all the characters in the shot at once in long takes, so that everything is just allowed to play out before us. Whenever he does focus on one character, you know the moment is really important. This is not to say Hawks doesn't pay attention to the intricacies of shot composition. He has a great use of space especially when it comes to the eponymous leopard. Whenever Baby is about to appear, Hawks often has a conspicuously empty spot for him to walk into, for example when he sits down next to Barry Fitzgerald. Earlier, when Grant first encounters him, the leopard is already in shot in the foreground. These brilliant entrances are all the funnier for how Hawks arranges them, in what is a kind of visual and spatial equivalent of comic timing.What's perhaps best about Bringing Up Baby is that it is almost continuously funny. I'm reminded again of the Marx brothers, who a few years earlier saved the talkie comedy by showing that verbal wit that could be just as madcap as slapstick. With its overlapping dialogue and dialogue running alongside action Bringing Up Baby is a fast-moving and witty treat, with barely a quiet moment in it. It proves that contrary to what many modern critics and filmmaker manuals say, this isn't a purely visual medium and actions don't always speak louder than words.Sadly Bringing Up Baby was not received well in its day. This is partly because Katherine Hepburn was not at her most popular, and the sharp change in her screen persona was perhaps a little hard to accept after all the dainty teenage roles with which she had made her name. Mostly however I suppose it was because it took screwball too far into the wackiness and anarchy of more riotous comedy forms, this being an era when breaking a genre's mould generally meant poor box office takings. But often, genres are recognised in retrospect, and it's now possible to see the chaotic silliness as what brings the characters' charms to the surface, and Bringing Up Baby as screwball comedy's finest hour-and-a-half.",

            "content": "Bringing up Baby is an absolute classic of screwball comedy, starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and the eponymous Baby. Grant plays stuffy palaeontologist Dr David Huxley who is due to be married, and is trying to obtain some money for his museum, but all his carefully laid out plans start to unravel when he first meets Susan Vance (Hepburn) on the golf course. From this point on Huxley is subject to an almost continuous series of humiliations and misfortunes.Those who claim that Bringing up Baby isn't funny because of the cruel way that Hepburn's character treats Grant's are missing the point. If the film's events were taking place in the real world then many of Hepburn's actions would be inexcusable, but the point is that these events are happening in a world without consequences where anything goes, and this is the premise on which much of the film's humour is based.The presence of a tame leopard called Baby provides further evidence that the film is trying to distance itself as far as possible from the boring predictability of reality. Much humour is derived from the contrasting attitudes of Hepburn and Grant towards the leopard. Whereas she reacts as if it were a small kitten, despite it's need for massive quantities of raw meat, Grant seems genuinely terrified, even though the animal shows no signs of aggression.One of the most remarkable things about Bringing up Baby is the extent to which it remains enjoyable today. While many films regarded as classics in the 30's seem somewhat dated now, Bringing up Baby seems as fresh as it ever did, thanks largely to the energetic central performances. Grant is terrific as the professor who gradually loses his inhibitions, but Hepburn steals the show as a self-absorbed young woman who wins the audience over through her lack of inhibitions.Films such as Bringing up Baby became far less common as America geared up for World War II and people began to lose interest in screwball comedy. This makes the film all the more significant, as it is undoubtedly one of the defining examples of a genre which never re-emerged in quite the same form again.",

            "content": "By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep.Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.",

            "content": "Bringing Up Baby is just another glowing example of what happens when you place great actors in bad parts. Here we have two of Hollywood's most respected actors demonstrating that they cannot handle such a convoluted story such as this. In fact, give this story to even any of the actors throughout the history of Hollywood this story and I don't think anyone could have pulled it off. Let's get right down to it, the story is what hurt this film. I agree that I don't think Katharine Hepburn should have dabbled in comedy, especially with a script like this, but I guess she could only work with what she had \u0085 which was nothing. Air, space, and dead time would have created better viewing than this story did, but alas, director Howard Hawks decides to fill that space with annoying songs, backwards stories, and characters that never quite leap out of the puddles of mediocrity that they sleep in.What really hurts this story is that there is too much happening to allow any real comedy to develop. From the uncharacteristic meeting between David and Susan to the dinosaur bone to the leopard in the yard, I never quite saw the humor in it. In fact, I hardly laughed at this film at all. I felt Hepburn gave one of her worst performances as this annoying rich girl that gets upset whenever she doesn't get what she wants. Grant tries to counter the horrid acting by Hepburn by playing his character a bit low key, but the chemistry never quite develops. There is no spark between the two. I never felt like they were really in love. Hepburn's comic timing was incredibly off in this film, causing most of the film to follow her lead. The rest of the cast would try to overcompensate for her misjudgment causing even more chaos in this film. One scene that immediately comes to mind is when Susan and David, with the dog, are singing to \"Baby\" on the rooftop. All of their voices together were like fingernails on a chalkboard. Was this to be funny? I am glad that we have evolved a bit further than this in that genre or it may have died directly after this film was made. Comedy is not something that can be taught. You either have it or you don't, and I do not believe Hepburn had it.No matter how bad the acting was, it still didn't compare to the nightmarish story. Perhaps I missed something throughout my 102-minute viewing, but the elements of this \"screwball comedy\" just never congealed together that well. Coupled with the below par acting, this film really never got off the ground. As audience members, we were mislead from the beginning and never quite found our stepping for the remaining moments. For example, during the opening credit sequences and on the discs of the DVD there are images of Hepburn and Grant helping the leopard eat and live life as if it was their child. It shows the leopard in diapers and in other whimsical hijinks, but we were not privileged enough to see that in the actual film. If that had been a bigger part of the story, than I think perhaps the comedy aspect would have been greater. We needed more moments with \"Baby\" instead of trying to build a relationship between David and Susan literally out of nothing. With a lacking chemistry, a poor excuse for a story, and comedy that was perhaps written by \"Baby\" herself, this 102-minute film felt more like 302 minutes of living, breathing torture.Overall, I just could not get excited about this film. This was one of those movies that took me two nights to finish because I just couldn't wrap my hands around anything substantial. I wanted greater comedy, but outside of Grant, our characters just acted annoying rather than funny. Hepburn was completely miscast in this feature, and the entire twenty minutes at the end of the film seemed rather rushed and aggravating than whimsical. I was hoping that this film would be more about the leopard instead of the people, but director Howard Hawks took it in a different direction, which ultimately hurt the outcome. This should have been a movie about a leopard co-starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, not the other way around. I didn't enjoy this movie in the least, and still wake up sweating at nights after nightmares of Hepburn, the dog, and Grant singing to the leopard. Ughhhhhhh.Grade: * out of *****",

Even though \"Bringing Up Baby\" has quite a deal of tense humour, slapstick and farce, it is enjoyable and worth watching for the acting, the plot and the animal training (the leopards, of which one of is Baby and George, the dog, are very well trained). Whatever you like, you will enjoy this film (unless you are on officially grumpy person). In this old black and white film, Cary Grant stars as an obsessed paleontologist, who has been constructing a dinosaur skeleton in the Mueseum of Natural History for five years. He just needs one bone to complete his work. As well as all this, he is going to be married the next day and his wedding gift to his future bride is the next dinosaur bone. However, the tables turn when a little later on, a young woman with a fiery personality, acted by Katherine Hepburn, spots him and falls in love with him. She does her best to make sure that he stays with her...I particularly recommend this film to people who do not mind tense humour, slapstick and farce, to people who like good acting, to people who like old black and white films and to people who like leopards. The recommended age is 11+. Enjoy \"Bringing Up Baby\"! :-)",

I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who wrote that this film compares unfavorably with the likes of our modern day entertainments like \"The Simpsons, Seinfeld and Frasier\". Give me a break. That junk isn't comedy, it's simply gutter writing in a pathetic attempt to get a cheap laugh. Why compare the drivel of today to the clever writing of yesterday? Although this film bombed at the box office when it first came out, it's more likely that people's sense of humor has evolved and matured over the decades and now this film has caught up with the audience and can be appreciated as the unique comedic film that it is.\n\"Bringing Up Baby\" is timelessly humorous and gets its laughs from CLEAN humor: always the best kind of humor. Cary and Kate have perfect chemistry together, they are both such airheads that they are perfectly suited to one another; so what that Kate breaks up the engagement with that sour-faced prune lady? The animals are fantastic (esp. the dog!).

It's rightly famous for the scene where her ripped dress causes confusion in a nightclub.But it's mostly a battle of the sexes between two equally stubborn people and I can only say that Hepburn's Susan drives me up the wall--probably one of the most annoying characters she's ever played with all of her Hepburn mannerisms in full gear. Grant wears horn-rimmed glasses most of the time in effort to look like a handsomer version of Harold Lloyd. He certainly has comic abilities with screwball material.There's nothing subtle about the humor--especially when the two are involved with keeping a baby leopard under wraps. CHARLIE RUGGLES and MAY ROBSON and BARRY FITZGERALD do their best to add some merriment to the proceedings, but the endless sight gags are standard for this kind of fluff and become a little tiresome when everything Hepburn does continues to backfire with disastrous results.Howard Hawks deserves credit for keeping things moving along briskly, but it's never been one of my favorite screwball comedies because none of the characters have a grain of common sense--especially Miss Hepburn's madcap heiress.",

            "content": "What is it with comedy? It is impossible to be judicious about it. If you see a thriller that doesn't thrill, you just shrug your shoulders. But if you see a comedy that doesn't make you laugh, you feel insulted. You hate the movie and you hate the fact that other people think it is a riot.Actually, it is not all comedies that polarise reactions in this way. If the comedy arises naturally from the characters or the situations then movies can be enjoyable, even if they elicit no more than the occasional smile. The problems arise when the characters or situations have no rationale except to be funny. That is the problem here.I find this movie a hopeless, exasperating experience because nothing in it exists except to get laughs and for me it doesn't.The characters are infuriating. Katherine Hepburn never looked better. She is so beautiful it could make you cry, but within about ten minutes I was praying for Cary Grant to strangle this impossible, self-centred, gibbering chatterbox. It probably took Hepburn years to live down the ill-will this movie generated.Cary Grant fares nearly as badly. He was completely emasculated and playing against type. When the Hepburn character falls in love with him you feel she must have been watching his other movies because this ineffectual wimp couldn't possibly have attracted her.Charlie Ruggles is just pathetically begging for laughs. They don't come.Similarly, all the 'comic' situations are painfully contrived. It is one of those movies where people are constantly being misunderstood and constantly doing things that baffle other people. But the comedy is not generated by the perplexing situations in which the characters find themselves. It derives from the fact that nobody can explain any of their actions intelligibly, nobody listens to what anybody else says and nobody is allowed to finish a sentence. If they could or did, it would instantly defuse the situations and kill the comedy. But comedy that relies on relentlessly improbable or unreasonable behaviour is the laziest kind of comedy.To make things worse, the movie has no focus. There are three almost independent comic threads. Firstly, Hepburn is trying to prevent Grant from marrying. This is problematic, because for most of the movie she has no reason to suppose that Grant doesn't love his fianc\u00e9; that she doesn't love him; that she is wrong for him; or that Grant really loves her. If this plot element was isolated, the Hepburn character would be left exposed as a highly unsympathetic, manipulative bitch.Fortunately, this dubious premise is diluted with the business of the dog and the loss of the 'intercostal clavicle' (the best comic idea in the picture). Then, on top of that, we get the roaming Baby and the confusion with the second leopard. But rather than this being a rich comic mixture, the picture seems overstuffed and directionless. To paper over the cracks, the movie races along without any variation in pace or tone and seems much longer than it actually is. It might have some good lines in it, but they are all lost in the machine gun delivery that everybody effects. All this frantic activity is trying to cover for a lack of real comic invention. It sweats desperation from every pore.Comedy probably dates more quickly than any other sort of entertainment. We cannot always judge the impact of a comedy film by our responses today. However, this film cannot be excused in that way. It was given the thumbs down by audiences when it was first released.I have to applaud their good judgement.",

It's mind-boggling to think that just after she made this gem Katie Hepburn acquired her infamous sobriquet 'box-office poison' so quit Hollywood and persuaded Philip Barry to write a vehicle in which she could appear on Broadway (the result, 'The Philadelphia Story' was such a smash that MGM bought it and the film version was shown in a double bill with 'Baby' earlier today. In his first screen writing credit Hagar Wilde (who shared a writing credit with Dudley Nichols) hit one out of the park. The script follows the Rules of farce; an introductory scene, more or less 'straight' which makes as many plot points as possible followed by a rapidly spiralling series of off-the-wall incidents that have their own demented logic. The opening scene establishes David Huxley (Cary Grant) as a zoologist who's spent several months assembling a creature from the Jurassic Age who even as we watch receives news that the final piece, an intercostal clavicle, has been located and is in the post. We learn also that he is engaged to Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) who we know he will never marry if only because Katie Hepburn is Grant's co-star, they will marry on the morrow but tight-haired eyeglass-wearing Walker makes it clear that there will be no conjugal relations and reminds Huxley that he is due to play golf with the lawyer of a possible benefactress who may very well donate a sorely needed million dollars to the museum. From here we can go either way and Grant did just that in North By North West which he began as an equally normal citizen but this time became embroiled in dramatic rather than screwball progressions. Those first few minutes are the only thing even remotely resembling normality. At the golf course Susan Vance (Hepburn) plays Grant's ball and holes it on the 18th green and not content with that gets into his car instead of her own and writes it off before they both drive off leaving the lawyer - on the first hole - to his own devices. They meet again that evening in a night club and a third character, the 'crazy' psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) is woven into the plot and we still haven't got to 'Baby', a leopard that Susan's brother has sent her from Brazil. It's easy to see why the French have so much time for Howard Hawks; in his time he proved himself a master of several genres with such credits as Only Angels Have Wings, I Was A Male War Bride (Grant again), Ball Of Fire, Red River, Rio Bravo, etc. Here he keeps all the balls spinning in the air as the likes of Walter Catlett (Constable Slocum), May Robson (Aunt Elizabeth), Charlie Ruggles (Maj Horace Applegate) and Barry Fitzgerald (Gogarty) keep the plot spinning just this side of out of control (for good measure future names Jack Carson and Ward Bond make uncredited appearances. Though we may question exactly how much the usually sombre Nichols (The Informer, Stagecoach, etc) contributed to this zaniness it's really academic; we have the finished product, that's all that matters.",

But when she set her mind to playing ding-bats, she could be as ditzy as the best of them, and her character here may just be the ditziest ditz ever captured on film.Cary Grant was sort of a male Kate Hepburn in a way. He was never really called upon to act; directors just hired him whenever they needed someone to play Cary Grant. But the befuddled, exasperated character he creates in this movie is sensational, even if it didn't require Grant to flex his acting chops.Together, Grant and Hepburn are an unforgettable pair, and they make an unforgettable movie. It seems pointless to mention specific classic scenes in a movie in which every scene could rightfully be considered a classic.

The situations the characters find themselves in here are not supposed to be overly realistic or believable, so don't expect them to be when you watch this film.

It was regrettable, after films like \"Only Angels Have Wings\" and \"His Girl Friday\", that he turned to film noir like \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"The Big Sleep\", despite the fact these pictures were big hits and made lots of money for Warner, care of Bogie and Bacall. One of the movies great strengths is its hilarious screenplay. No one could have brought it out better than Cary and Kate, experts of comedy. This was Kate's only 'slapstick' comedy film but she and the rest of the excellent cast seem to go about doing it as though it were all completely normal. The second of their collaborations after the even more disastrous \"Sylvia Scarlett\" (\"Holiday\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\" followed) was their best. It was Kate's last film at RKO, the studio that discovered her and at which she had won her first Oscar. It is almost hard to believe this film could have failed. But it was a little too up market for the majority of the audiences, and Katharine Hepburn was in the box office poison period, which obviously drove the audiences away.

            "content": "When originally released, Bringing Up Baby was a commercial and critical flop, and was discarded for some time as something not quite as worthy as other works in Howard Hawks's body of work. Today, after years of rediscovery by fans of the stars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, it's considered a classic of the 'screwball' school of comedy, where the timing was graceful and the structure solid in the midst of madcap madness and silliness that involves specific, quirky personalities that should but don't quite always meld (hence the blueprint for many a romantic comedy for today). For me, it's not a flop nor is it quite as classic as I expected. It's a very fun escapade with two stars who often shine with their qualities to subvert (Grant) and meet (Hepburn) expectations of what they have to offer.Grant is akin here to Clark Kent, nerdy and awkward and just wanting to be left alone, but somehow being drawn into trouble (and, after all, wouldn't Grant make a good Kent/Superman?) Hepburn, meanwhile, can be very charming and lovable and also annoying in equal measure (though I'm sure the latter is part of the point with her character). They're a solid, combined force for Hawks's mildly crazy tale of two people who shouldn't have anything to do with one another but are put together under circumstances of the zany and funny: a dog with a dinosaur bone, and a baby leopard that's tame and actually a pet but is at first thought to be out of the zoo (that is, until, its doppleganger shows up in the last third of the movie). We're led along on their adventures over a day and night to find the bone and the leopard, and how they confound and amuse and annoy those around them from family to policemen to possible betrothed (Grant's character).There are some classic moments, to be sure; I loved how Hepburn talks her way out of prison by sinking down to the level of mimicry that is totally lost on the cop; the chemistry between the two stars fluctuates wonderfully, depending on the scene or situation, like by the fire out in the wilderness; Grant is often so uncomfortable that we forget (for better or worse) how charismatic he usually is in place of this bumbling, meek but curious character; the dress gag, simply, is a riot, as is the bit with the robe (\"I'm gay!\" is a line that gets a laugh for other reasons today). But at the same time it's not totally a riot all the way through, with some moments falling kind of flat or just \"oh, that's funny\" as opposed to laugh-out-loud variety. It should appeal heavily to those who eat up romantic comedies like Hershey's kisses, as should die-hards for the two stars, and if it's on TV on a rainy day it's surely a must-see for at least a few minutes. That it's maybe not quite one of Hawks's best is up for minor debate.",

            "content": "BRINGING UP BABY (RKO Radio, 1938), directed by Howard Hawks, is not exactly a movie dealing with a young couple coping and rearing its first born, but a comedy. A madcap comedy, in fact, starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, with the baby being none other than a leopard. While their initial pairing of SYLVIA SCARLETT (1935) was an oddity which couldn't make up its mind whether to be a comedy or drama, BRINGING UP BABY is comedy from start to finish, and that's a promise.Taken from a story by Hagar Wilde, the plot revolves around the mild-mannered David Huxley (Cary Grant), a bespectacled professor of zoology working for the Stuyvesant Museum of Natural History in New York City. Aside from being engaged to the no-nonsense Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker), he's also awaiting for the last bone to complete his four years of hard work for the development of his dinosaur display. Alexander Peabody (George Irving), a corporation lawyer whose client is to donate a million dollars to the museum, meets with Huxley for a game of golf to discuss matters, matters that couldn't get any worse for David upon his meeting with Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn), an dizzy heiress. Their encounter soon leads to a series of misunderstandings leaving Mr. Peabody behind. Later that evening, David, hoping to explain and apologize for leaving the way he did, tracks down Mr. Peabody to the Ritz Plaza Hotel dining room where he so happens to meet up with Susan again, once more leaving Mr. Peabody in a state of confusion. More confusion arises the next day as Susan acquires a leopard named Baby that was sent to her by her brother, Mark, a hunter, from Brazil. Before he knows it, David, with the much needed dinosaur bone in his box, ends up on a merry trip with Susan and her pet leopard (who reacts calmly to the song, \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby\") to Connecticut. While at her country home, David, identified by Susan as Mr. Bones, is introduced to her Aunt Elizabeth (May Robson), and her dinner guest, Major Horace Applegate (Charles Ruggles), one of them who happens to be the one to finance the million dollars to the museum. If that's not enough! David tries to get the dinosaur bone back from Elizabeth's dog, George, who has buried it somewhere on the estate, while he and Susan find themselves mixing a killer leopard who has escaped from a nearby circus, who happens to look just like Baby.Aside from Hepburn and Grant being the focal point throughout this zaniness, with the first half hour of priceless comedy situations, there's character types as Walter Catlett (Constable Slocum), Barry Fitzgerald (Gogarty, the gardener); and Fritz Lehmann (Fritz Feld), a psychiatrist, to add further laughs when necessary. Catlett's double-talk and matching wits with Hepburn's screwball zaniness ranks one of its brighter moments in the story. Other members of the cast include: Leona Roberts (Hannah Gogarty); Tala Birell (Mrs. Lehmann); and Ernest Cossart. Look quickly for future lead actor, Jack Carson, as a circus roustabout in one scene.With so many amusing moments involved, it's hard to imagine BRINGING UP BABY was not a success during its initial theatrical screening. Maybe 1938 audiences felt the movie a bit overlong (102 minutes), a bit silly, or feeling Hepburn miscast in a role that might have served best that of Carole Lombard. Who knows, really? Thanks to frequent television revivals in later years, the film has not only become very much appreciated, but listed among one of the greatest comedies of all time. Director Howard Hawks keeps this hectic pace going in fast-pace, not letting up for an instant. Interestingly this was Hepburn's only attempt in madcap comedy and final movie for RKO Radio before shifting over to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1940-1952). Though Cary Grant sports glasses through much of the proceedings, they apparently disappear from view later on and never worn again.Formerly available on video cassette dating back to the 1980s, and later DVD, BRINGING UP BABY (title not to be confused with a family comedy titled \"Blondie Brings Up Baby\" (Columbia, 1939)) has been broadcast on various cable channels over the years, notably American Movie Classics (prior to 2001) and Turner Classic Movies. For sheer fun, be sure not to miss this one. (***1/2)",

Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Charlie Ruggles, May Robson, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Catlett, Fritz Feld, Ward Bond.In her sole venture into slapstick, Hepburn plays a madcap heiress-- \"Baby'' is her pet leopard--who sets her sights on absentminded zoologist Grant and inadvertently proceeds to make a shambles of his life.Howard Hawks's \"Bringing Up Baby\" is the go-to example of screwball comedy that critics and film-lovers reference most as the definitive model of the genre. Quirky, original, perfectly timed, and with hilarious performances from the likes of Cary Grant and the incomparable Katharine Hepburn. It has been said that Hepburn struggled with a comedy performance, but as a mark of her talent, this never shows through. She is absolutely brilliant in this movie, blending slapstick, witty repartee, and even a little 'come hither' romance in a wild, frenetic script. She even does a mean gangster impression towards the end.Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and a leopard, hey, what more could you want? One of the highest high points of the entire screwball comedy genre, with its sharp script and wonderfully balanced leads. Recommended for all. This film is an absolute joy. 10/10",

            "content": "Bringing Up Baby is a 1938 Howard Hawk's screwball comedy that can easily be defined as insanity. From start to finish, this movie brings forth an energy that hits you like a lightning bolt. I consider that to be a good thing.....and maybe something that is a little bit too much at times. This film, directed by the legendary Howard Hawks (Barbary Coast) and stars two of our acting greats; Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, is considered by many to be the greatest comedies ever made. Great comedy, yes! Greatest comedy ever made? Maybe in the eyes of some, but my eyes see this as a fine, serviceable comedy. The biggest mystery of this review is how to make sense of the plot. As many critics say, this film is basically a giant ball of energy start to finish. Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant) is a paleontologist who has been working on the building of a brontosaurus structure for many years....and he is also about to be married to his assistant, Alice. On the day before the wedding, he receives notice that the final bone needed to complete his structure has been discovered. The museum he works at sends him to a meeting with a corporate lawyer at a golf course where he must ask him to donate to the exhibit. There he meets Susan Vance (Katherine Hepburn). Susan does everything she can to mess up David's neat, organized life. Over the course of the day, David will experience everything from a woman's dress to a pet leopard to a stint in prison. How will David react at the end of the day? The movie features two of the greatest actors to have ever graced our big screen; Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. At this point in Hepburn's career, she has been known as box office poison. None of her movies opened well (and this movie continues that trend), so Hepburn tried her hand at comedy for the first time. As the movie went on, she had to be coached by Hawks to fine tune her comedy skills. On the other hand, Cary Grant does a wonderful job. He was the serious character and given his personality next to the wacky personality of Hepburn's character, Susan....well that made it all the more funny. Screwball comedies are just not my type of tea, so I felt refreshed that I enjoyed this movie. While I did not outright laugh out loud many times, I kept a constant smile on my face. Nearly eighty years after the original release, I think the film remained fresh. People like fast-paced, zany comedies and this is one of them. When I researched the film, I came across a fact that surprised me. This film has one of the earliest known references of the term \"gay\" used as a word to describe homosexuals. How on earth did that pass the sensors? Who knows!Overall, Bringing Up Baby is a fun, fast-paced comedy about two opposite personalities falling in love after a day of crazy events. I smiled often, although the scene with David Huxley failing to recognize the difference between a tame and wild leopard had me in stitches. This film was eventually remade in the form of 1972's What's Up, Doc which unfortunately I did not like as much. Even though I do not think highly of this film as others do, I definitely recommend you check out this movie.My Grade: B+",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is the sort of movie that university students applaud. The story is wild, the acting first rate, the direction super fast and production values are nothing short of phenomenal. Another point in the film's favor as far as uni students are concerned is that contemporary audiences like their own grandparents hated the film - hated it so much in fact that word of mouth killed any chance that the movie might defy its detractors and end up at least breaking even at the box-office. In fact, RKO never recovered from this super- expensive disaster and thus began its slow, downward slide and its eventual fall into the hands of Howard Hughes and total oblivion. On the other hand, I think it's Cary Grant's best film. He plays a totally obnoxious, totally self-centered professor. And certainly it's one one of Hepburn's best too. The support cast is likewise great and I like the way Walter Catlett suddenly so astutely grabs the reins when we wrongly imagine that the movie is almost over. All in all, a wonderful film, that was not appreciated in its day. Needless to say, producer/director Howard Hawks was fired, and Kath Hepburn, labeled \"box-office poison\", was forced to buy out her RKO contract. What a difference a mere 80 years (almost) can make!",

            "content": "Film Review \u2013 Bringing Up BabyHoward Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.",

            "content": "The story is simple an archaeologist, is waiting to receive a bone for his museum collection, but through a series of odd circumstances keeps running into a woman who seems to do anything to get his attention.What makes this movie is the chemistry between Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. This is only the second movie I have seen either of them and both make the film. Hepburn fulfills the female role of the Screwball comedy with sheer perfection as a dominating, fearless, lighthearted, and larger-than-life Susan Vance. Cary Grant likewise transforms into the nerdy, single-minded Dr. Dave Huxley, who is always trying to avoid Hepburn but is eventually seduced.Without giving too much away, it is not only about the performances between Hepburn and Grant, but also follows along the American Comedy lines of \"release of the repressed\".In a sense, through the witty and intelligent innuendos and subtleties, Susan represents nature, as does her pet leper Baby and the dog George. With the power of all three and the adventures they undertake with Dave, they release the repressed soul of Dave who is stuck in a life of all business and no fun, reviving the elements of nature in him such as enjoying life and the desires of the flesh.The average person may not catch onto this, but after seeing this movie, it is hard not to miss due to the many symbolisms and subtleties that reflect Dave's desire of being a free man. To keep the movie going, the actors deliver one witty line after another, in addition with hilarious sight gags. \"Bringing Up Baby\" in my opinion is not only an excellent movie, but also a classic example of the screwball comedy with an intelligent script and plot.",

To use a publicity phrase of the time, this is a true \"laugh riot\"! The real surprise here is Hepburn herself. She plays this character with so much vulnerable panache, completely believing every minute of conniving, manipulative behavior, trying desperately to make Grant's character love her as much as she loves him, that, like Grant's clueless clod of a professor, you end up loving her out of sheer exhaustion, just as much as he does.This is certainly some of the best work of Hepburn's long career. No self-conscious posing, none of the brittle mannerisms of her later work, just straightforward, brilliantly timed, generous comic playing, using her well-trained athlete's body in the service of comedy as perhaps no one of her generation could.

I remember watching one of those dreadful \"Police Academy\" movies which left me guffawless, chortleless. In short, when you make a \"comedy\", it's supposed to be funny.I understand that people find this film a screwball comedy \"classic\". When the movie premiered in 1938, it was a flop. Now, some seventy years later, it is considered one of the best movies of the screwball genre. How much of this is revisionist Hollywood history is anybody's guess.Of course we all miss debonair Cary and the great Katharine Hepburn.But you can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse, and this movie remains to me a sow's ear. Let's get right to it. Katharine Hepburn has no flair for this type of comedy. She is devastating perfect as Tracy Lord in \"The Philadelphia Story\". Lovely, vulnerable, fully in command, Hepburn was born to play the pompous socialite. There is much humor in the story's telling, but it is all quite natural.\"Bringing Up Baby\" looks like a movie, sounds like a movie. I seem to be constantly aware that Hepburn is trying to be funny. I don't believe her for a moment as a scatterbrained dunderhead.I don't even enjoy Cary Grant as \"Dr. Huxley\". The whole movie seems forced. I do believe this is Hepburn's one attempt at \"screwball comedy\" and thank God for that. Grant is hilarious in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\". The energy he generates seems genuine. Although the film is a bit \"stagey\" (since it came from Broadway), I do find the gallows humor of \"Arsenic\" a fine comic turn for Grant.One reviewer who loves this movie says that \"it's not supposed to make sense\", like I am not getting it. I could say that easily about \"Duck Soup\" with the Marx Brothers. That also was considered a \"flop\" at the time, but is deservedly recognized now as probably their best film. The Marx Brothers were Jerry Seinfeld sixty years earlier. \"Duck Soup\" is truly about nothing, makes no sense and is all out Marxian anarchy. And perhaps I am a bit too enamored of one Carole Lombard, who was gorgeous and funny at the same time. That is no mean trick for a woman, but Carole could do it. You want to see one of the best \"screwball\" comedies? I suggest \"Nothing Sacred\" with Fredric March and Lombard. \"Twentieth Century\" with Carole and John Barrymore.Of course, art is so subjective. One man's meat is another man's poison. I do not find \"Bringing Up Baby\" funny. Not at all.",

Hepburn's line readings are hilarious. I laugh out loud just remembering the look on her face and the way she says, \"Wait a minute! There's nothing up there.

But she genuinely excels in Bringing Up Baby, alongside a flawless Grant.I was actually very surprised to see some poor opinions of the film in this comments list, some people obviously have no taste at all - although common sense has clearly prevailed given the very impressive average score and a secured place in the top 250. And there is some real genius to be had along the way here - the use of the leopard is comedy gold dust, putting glasses on Cary Grant is an inspired move, and to have David casually miss his wedding day to spend it digging holes in a 26-acre garden, the whole thing will leave you wondering just WHY you haven't seen this film sooner.The cast is universally excellent but the pick of the support was undoubtedly Charles Ruggles as Major Applegate - or \"Appletree\" if you were listening hard enough - he turned in a fantastic and hilarious performance during the dinner scene.I can't praise this film enough and it's one of my favourite comedies of all time, no doubt. 9/10",

Sure, if story elements are analyzed apart from the film itself-- as many critics do-- the madcap is lost, and not much is funny. But that's why film is a different medium from analytic prose. There're a visual, pacing and editing dimension to film that can carry viewers along regardless of reality. The situations in Baby are highly contrived and bear only passing resemblance to real situations. Yet the overall artistry is what diverts attention away from \"could this really happen\".Now, I'm no fan of Hepburn's for many reasons that others have. Yet, again, Hawks' rapid-fire pacing plus constant talk never give her time nor focus to be stagy or emotive. Overall, I thought she and Grant worked the madcap wonderfully. Then too, catch that final scene that's not only poignantly funny but also serves as a fine visual metaphor of redemption\u2014she knocks down his obsession with old bones, while he lifts her out of gilded isolation. I guess my only complaint is the over-extended jailhouse scene that's padding Catlett's screen time, but weakens the movie's narrative structure.All in all, I'm with those who think the movie a madcap classic, thanks to Hawks, Hepburn, Grant, and a fine furry friend.",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\"(1938) is the adventurous screwball comedy about a madcap New England heiress, Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) who, after accidentally running into stuffy zoologist, David Huxley (Cary Grant) is determined to land him as her husband. Not that David would notice. He's too concerned with acquiring a bone for his museum collection - go figure. But a gregarious little terrier named George (actually Asta from \"The Thin Man\" series) intervenes in David's plans, burying the irreplaceable fossilized bone somewhere on Sue's country estate. Meanwhile Baby, Susan's leopard, threatens the whole show by tearing up the scenery, as leopard's will do, after escaping from her cage. Naturally the whole mess winds up in front of a local authorities, who lacks the ability to put two ideas together and come up with one coherent thought.The supporting cast is a who's who of crazies, including Charles Ruggles as Major Applegate, a pompous big game hunter, May Robson as Sue's dotty rich aunt, Elizabeth Random, and Barry Fitzgerald as the congenial scatterbrain, Mr. Gogarty. Director, Howard Hawks infuses his film with every screwball gag in the book - and a few never before seen - delivering the overwhelming and riotous laugh a minute that has made \"Baby\" one of the unique highlights in film comedy history. Not that anyone knew it at the time. On the contrary, \"Bringing Up Baby\" was widely panned by the critics and did only modest box office on its initial release. But hey, what did they know? Time has proved that \"Baby\" is the one to beat; a high water mark of comedic prowess that only the likes of someone like Preston Sturges could hope to match.Warner's 2-disc special edition of this vintage comedy is a welcomed treat for DVD-philes. The black and white image is astoundingly solid. The gray scale has been impeccably mastered from very clean film elements. Contrast levels are superb. There's a hint of edge enhancement now and then, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are fully realized. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. Aside from the very thorough commentary track by Peter Bogdanovich, disc 2 of this DVD contains two feature length documentaries; one on Howard Hawks, the other on Cary Grant.There's also a couple of vintage short subjects and a gallery of trailers from other Howard Hawk's films. Very nice. Bottom line: \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a sheer delight and this new DVD expounds twice the good time in its beautifully rendered picture and sound quality from the good people at Warner Brothers.",

I wouldn't quite call this a screwball comedy, even though it is listed basically everywhere as one and the movie is basically one big heap of strange and unusual but funny circumstances.To be frank, the story and the way it progressed doesn't make much sense to me. Why on earth does Huxley keep seeing Susan, although he obviously doesn't like her too much and all she ever does is getting him in trouble. And why does he ever take all those things Susan says to him and asks of him. She's too wild and uncontrollable for him.Cary Grant began his career with movies like this but ended up getting later more serious roles, for which he now days is also still best known, though always with a certain comical undertone. Katharine Hepburn is exactly known for her comical talents but she pulls of more than alright in her role. She had a lot of training prior to starting and during the filming of this movie to get her comical timing right, which paid off obviously.The movie goes from the one strange situation into the other. This is basically all that \"Bringing Up Baby\" is all about. It doesn't exactly make this the best or most well written comedy but it obviously doesn't prevent the movie from being an enjoyable one. It's a movie that almost constantly entertains and the acting performances also make sure that the movie works out with what it tries to achieve, without ever getting tiresome or lame. It features some moments that will surely make you laugh.An enjoyable movie from director Howard Hawks.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The constable is also funny, with his cloudy perception.The plot's just silly, with money and leopards. But it's not really special, we just kind of watch the events play out and laugh a bit.

Vigorous, fast-paced farce sometimes goes wanting for a \"straight man\" in the main cast, but the script is constructed so well and the comedic timing is so close to perfect that it's hard to complain. Performers do splendid work; it's a shame that Hepburn so rarely played in this go-for-broke \"low comedy\" arena.

I tend to really enjoy films where the dialogue is quick and snappy. Catherine Hepburn was and Cary Grant were exceptionally sharp in their zany back-and-forth conversations. The dialogue reminds me of the 1994 movie \"Clerks.\" The humor is much different but the delivery from the actors is very much alike. I recommend that movie, as well. It wasn't a box-office hit; in fact it was a total flop. However, people in the 30's were kinda going through a little depression; they were ticked off all of the time.

A time that to me is idyllic and dreamlike... and it inspires me creatively.Now all that aside, it is a great movie, and proved Katharine Hepburn could not be typecast. The times, the chemistry, the dialog, the craziness. All work together to paint a timeless masterpiece so palpable it has endured for over 65 years.Bringing Up Baby is what happens when 2 actors with perfect comedic chemistry let loose. Much of the script becomes improvised physical comedy, from the high heel's unintentional break, we find these two are able to pull out of any accidental dive without a slip of step or momentum.Cary Grant is David, a zoologist who is supposed to be getting married to a woman who is just so wrong for him, and Katharine Hepburn is Susan, a crazy, manipulative woman with a leopard.This movie is quirky, crazy, and fun.A movie about paralleling mix-ups on every level from golf balls, cars, shirttails and dresses, dinosaur bone, to even a leopard that's escaped from a zoo! This movie keeps raising the ante and the tension, in an effort to bring these two fated soul mates together.Harold Lloyd (Cary Grant) the bumbling bespectacled silent film comedian was the inspiration for Cary Grant's David Huxley. In turn, Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent was patterned after Huxley! Isn't it neat how all this things come together? It's almost uncanny how many comedians and television characters got their start because of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Ross from Friends, Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent, the list is really endless, these two have influenced comedy and film forever.\"Now it isn't that I don't like you Susan because after all, in moments of quiet I'm strangely drawn toward you, but well, there haven't been any quiet moments\" Or when the Colonel sees the leopard and says in much distress to Elizabeth, \"Don't you think it's kind of chilly out here without a gun?\"",

            "content": "Absolute pinnacle of classic American comedy, in its craziest screwball-comedy kind.A perfect script by Hagar Wilde (based on her short story) and Dudley Nichols (Stagecoach, Gunga Din, Scarlet Street...) crafted in close collaboration with Howard Hawks (the film was a personal project, his pitch to RKO), results in a perfect mesh, where each scene is fun on its own, and at the same time irreplaceable essential in the relentless development of a plot that increasingly complicates the lives of the characters.The plot is based on a short story about a girl who receives in New York a leopard from her brother Mark in Brazil, and who calls her boyfriend to get it out of her apartment, since her rich aunt, who has a house in Connecticut, has just arrived to America and has re-included them in her will.One essential factor in the fascination of the film is the presence of two legends in the history of cinema, two comedy geniuses, confronted with their most atypical roles for being crazy and for their hilarious, slightly buffoonish touch, but among the most memorable.The humor has an adult and childish character at the same time, the plot tells us about the acceptance of risk, the absurd and the adventure in life. It is one of the most endearing films in the history of cinema, without ever falling into silliness or maudliness.Huxley is a bored and conformist paleontologist, about to bury his life next to an overbearing collaborator at the museum. But a crazy and determined young woman crosses his life and uses a leopard to destroy his life.Every scene is unforgettable: the meeting on the golf course, the argument in the restaurant and their antics when leaving it, the search for Baby and George through the woods...Naturally the most famous is the mythical scene of the torn jacket and the torn dress.Throughout the film, David Huxley will abandon his attitude of self-defense, as Susan breaks one thread after another that binds him to his old life. A kind of complicity will be created between them, and their scenes will gain in a kind of cozy feeling. Halfway through the film they are inseparable like Quixote and Sancho. At the end of the film, Huxley has nothing left of his former life, and he will realize that he has come out on top.Grant and Hepburn are joined by a team of actors who are all extraordinary, especially May Hobson as Aunt Elisabeth and Barry Fitzgerald as the gardener.Narratively, the film is an example of the dynamism in the staging that Hawks knew how to print, especially in the ensemble scenes, with a dizzying pace in the dialogue. It is an example of his commitment to teamwork.The filming seems to have been especially happy, and that happiness is transmitted to the viewer, above all a feeling of being at ease, despite the situations that are getting more and more complicated for the protagonists, a cozy feeling from a special world.It's also an example of his wonderful directing of actors (he defined Grant's approach to his character: Grant as Harold Lloyd, and advised Hepburn to learn from an expert stage comedian to refine her comedic vibe: it's the birth of one of the great comedians in the history of cinema)Unfortunately Hawks would learn from what he considered his mistake: not including sensible characters with whom the public could identify (in fact there is a sensible character, but very marginal: the lawyer). Hawks lost his magic for comedy in the 50s, his comedy became increasingly stereotyped, somewhat crude and sometimes in doubtful taste: Gentlemen prefer blondes, Monkey business... until the very mediocre Man's favourite sport.Totally avoid What's up, Doc?, absolutely insufferable remake from an unable and talentless Bogdanovich.",

            "content": "A glorious marriage of dynamic set-pieces and hilarious misunderstands, BRINGING UP BABY is director Howard Hawks' comedic masterpiece and it unarguably remains one of the greatest film comedies ever committed to celluloid. This is a film that makes absolutely no pretensions about being anything other than a slapstick comedy, and it is never afraid of being too ridiculous or absurd in order to accomplish it's goals. BRINGING UP BABY only exists to make audiences scream with laughter, and it does so more effectively than practically any other motion picture comedy before or since. The hilarious screenplay by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde is overflowing with madcap situations and rapid fire dialogue, and the phenomenally talented cast never misses a beat.The almost impossibly handsome Cary Grant delivers an uproarious performance as our tight-laced protagonist. The fact that Grant was arguably the most gorgeous man who ever lived only makes his portrayal of the film's stuffy palaeontologist even funnier. A major aspect of Grant's enormous appeal was that he never seemed to be depending upon his devastating handsomeness to be effective, and this dynamic has rarely been displayed better than in BRINGING UP BABY. The ever-glamorous Katharine Hepburn is so maddingly endearing as the film's scatter-brained heroine that it seems impossible to fathom why she was commonly referred to as \"box office poison\" by so many critics and theater-owners at the time (Hepburn would make a startling comeback in 1940's THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, and would remain a major box office star throughout the late-sixties).The rest of the cast rises to the same level as Grant and Hepburn, with veteran character actors Charles Ruggles, Walter Catlett, Barry Fitzgerald, and May Robson each turning in superb characterizations that rank among their very best work. The animal performers, including the canine Asta and feline Nissa (a leopard), are expertly trained and deliver performances that are every bit as impressive as the human actors with whom they share the screen. In the end, however, this is director Hawks' movie, and his inspired direction pulls off the impossible feat of repeatedly making every scene and every joke seem to top the one that came before it. Though BRINGING UP BABY was a box office failure at the time of it's release, it has since become highly regarded by virtually all major critics and most film fans as the comedy milestone that it is.",

But, with a film as crazy/zany as the 1938 Howard Hawks screwball comedy BRINGING UP BABY, the odds are in your favor.The college students loved it.Starring Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn - in their screwball comedy best - BRINGING UP BABY tells the story of a paleontologist (Grant) who is looking to land a $1 million donation, but ends up crossing paths with a wealthy heiress (Hepburn) - who marches to the beat of her own drum.Told at breakneck speed by Hawks - a trademark of screwball comedy - BRINGING UP BABY is smart, witty, wacky and very, very funny. I was surprised at this viewing just how fast-paced this film is - you do not come up for a breath throughout the entire film. It's a bit exhausting - and exhilarating - kind of like hanging onto a wild roller coaster ride.Remembered more for their dramatic roles, Hepburn and Grant are marvelous as the 2 leads of this film, they banter back and forth - quickly - throughout the film, they have tremendous chemistry with each other and their patter is a hallmark of these types of films and I was amazed at the dexterity and timing of these 2 pros. They make the dialogue work by not commenting on the comedy of it, but just moving onto the next scene, the next line, the next situation.The supporting cast - featuring such rubber faced character actors as Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, Fritz Feld and Leona Roberts - are just as good and add to the insanity that is seen on the screen. All corralled beautifully by one of the greatest Directors of the Old Hollywood era (the era before 1960), Howard Hawks who would end up directing a few years later the epitome of the screwball comedy - HIS GIRL FRIDAY - but who also Directed such classics as SCARFACE, THE BIG SLEEP, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES as well as quite a few John Wayne westerns like RED RIVER, RIO BRAVO and EL DORADO.Oh...and did I mention...the 3rd leading performer of this film is a Leopard?If you are looking to introduce someone (or maybe yourself) to a film type of a bygone era - you could do worse than BRINGING UP BABY - a screwball comedy that clips along in 102 fast-paced minutes.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",

Soon-to-be-married Dr. David Huxley (Grant) is engaged to a career-supportive what's-her-name (her appearances are so fleeting that she's more like fog than a supporting character) \u0096 everything is in place for a satisfying career in paleontology for the dorky doctor\u0085except for the grant, that is (this first scene features a full-scale brontosaur skeleton which becomes a metaphor for Huxley's future prospects). Off he goes to see about collecting those much-needed funds from some wealthy socialite who has money to burn. No sooner is he out golfing/begging does he run into the free-spirited Susan Vance (Hepburn). Through a series of bizarre, implausible encounters and misunderstandings do these two keep each other company - and the audience intrigued by extension.Interesting how Hawks' later feature \"His Girl Friday\" is the inverse reflection of this movie. Cary Grant's Huxley wants to further his career and Rosalind Russell's Johnson is looking to get out of hers \u0096 both making ultimate decisions unexpected to themselves but all too obvious to the audience. Was Hawks conscious of his equal treatment of both genders in their relations to their careers? It's ruminations like these that keep his work so fresh, so\u0085democratic?Sure \"Bringing Up Baby\" skims the surface of life, but don't almost all movies do the same thing?

In \"Bringing up Baby\" the word \"gay\" was used (for the first time) in two meanings.In \"Bringing up Baby\" Gary Grant plays the boring scientist David Huxley. This character was obviously framed, at least with respect to the outward appearance, after Harold Lloyd (the star of \"Safety last\" 1923). Just look at the glasses he is wearing. By the way Harold Lloyd could appreciate this imitation.I have long considered Howard Hawks as the master of the screwball comedy. This is very true of course, but it took me a while to discover that he excels in other genres too. Think about film noir (\"The big sleep\", 1946) or the Western (\"Red river\", 1948).",

This girl is also the heiress of a big amount of money so everything change. In this story we have also a leopard and things become more complicated.I truly liked this movie because of the plot which I found simply magnificent but also for the direction which made by Howard Hawks and it was very good. I have to admit that this movie gave me two really nice hours with plenty of fun and many laughs. Cary Grant who played as David was very good in this completely different interpretation from this that I used to watch him. Another good interpretation made by Katharine Hepburn who played as Susan and she was equally good.Finally I have to say that \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a very good movie to watch and I am sure that you will have a great time while watching it. This movie combines very well comedy with romance and the result from this combination is a perfect movie. I strongly recommend it to everyone.",

            "content": "I make it no secret that the screwball comedy is my favourite genre of film. I can never get tired of these films - to me, this is the most anti-boring genre. Whenever I watch a great screwball comedy I'm on Cloud 9 and when it's concluded I'm always left hungry for more (sometimes I even wish my life could play out like a screwball comedy!). Bringing Up Baby is the quintessential daffy dame/stuffy gentleman movie (a formula often imitated but never topped) and I find it endlessly fascinating this premise of how this woman constantly infiltrates this man's life and she just won't go away despite his best efforts. You think it would be easy that he could avoid her but the manner in which she keeps coming back into his life is comedic brilliance. Like many great comedies, the jokes present in Bringing Up Baby always take me by surprise no matter how many times I see it. Howard Hawks seems to have a distinctive style of slapstick comedy which separates his screwball comedies from others but why this is I can't put my finger on - Hawks' screwball simply has a distinctive electrically energy to it. Bringing Up Baby was produced at RKO studios, of whom I can't help but notice their films have a distinctive imperfection of a grainy image quality and the use of soft lighting which is very easy on the eyes; the days when movie studios had their own distinctive styles.I don't think Katharine Hepburn ever looked more staggeringly beautiful than she does in Bringing Up Baby, displaying a girlish, Carole Lombard-like charm (I even find myself infatuated with the outfits she wears and her hairstyles in the film). Unlike other films of the genre, however, the romance is largely secondary to the rest of the story; with Susan (Hepburn) falling for David (Cary Grant) but not the other way around. Even with David eventually proclaiming his love for Susan I get the impression the two only remain (unlikely) friends. Likewise, the common screwball comedy theme of a crisis of masculinity is really played up here to the full with Grant wearing a woman's dressing gown an even proclaiming in a fit of rage to be \"gay all of a sudden\".David's wild goose chase to obtain a dinosaur bone known as an 'intercostal clavicle' (a nonexistent fossil created for the movie) to complete the museum's Brontosaurus skeleton, it's eventual destruction at the hands of Susan as well as her treatment a leopard as a pet is all perfectly in tune with the character's defiance of the natural order of things. Bringing Up Baby is the only screwball comedy I can think of which involves it's cast interacting with a dangerous animal; I'm unsure why this never became a common screwball trope, I guess studios wouldn't allow their cast and crew to be placed in such danger. My review title may sound hyperbolic but I'd pair Bringing Up Baby with You Can't Take It With You as the most over the top, steroidal, off the wall offering in the screwball comedy genre. Watching Bringing Up Baby is like watching a movie with the fast-forward button turned on; the film is over before you know it. Old movies are slow and boring? Whoever came up with such nonsense?",

BRINGING UP BABY is fun to watch because IT IS fun to watch. Director Hawks intention was to create a totally bananas story, which critics at the time did not fully understand and/or appreciate. There was some healthy competition at the time with the likes of sand Hardy, WC Fields, Mae West and the Marx Brothers, and that may have been enough. Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, however, did make a fantastic team and a significant contribution to the world of comedy. Hawks basically just let the cameras roll and follow heiress Hepburn, who is just plain nuts, and how she turns by the book professor Grants life upside down. Grant, a master of the double take, is unforgettable, and in a couple of instances, steals the scene, he's that funny. Also in the cast is May Robson, a remarkable actress who delivered some of the best one liners in the biz, and Charlie Ruggles, who is over the top as usual. Last but not least, all this madness is set to the famous Jimmy McHugh tune, I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE, BABY, referring to Hepburn's pet leopard, who just roams around the place. You asked for it. Get the dvd ASAP.",

            "content": "Quirky characters, fast paced dialogue and equally fast comic situations, Bringing Up Baby is where any viewer can become absorbed into the hilarious madness which ensues and inhabits the narrative.All beginning when Palaeontologist David Huxley is seeking funding for his project he unexpectedly runs into Susan Vance, whose assertiveness beings to dominate the more feeble David the moment they first meet. From here Bringing Up Baby becomes a romantic story with a difference. It is the female who vigorously seeks the male for romantic desire rather than the usual vice versa and through comically deceitful means. And it all works to perfection thanks to the chemistry of the two leads.David is a passive and easily led person opposed to Susan's persuasive strength and cunningness. If it was any other genre besides comedy then the relationship between such contrasting characters would be bleak however in this case Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn give to their respective roles warmth and likability that for the audience helps Bringing Up Baby to be a greatly engrossing film. The same can be said for the large amount of peculiar and zany situations the characters find themselves in. Chasing a pet leopard all over the woods, going to desperate methods to hide a gigantic rip in Susan's dress and Susan mocking the Police Chief with a fantastic parody of a gangster's moll, we go from one dynamic situation to another at such an alarming rate you can't help but enjoy the experience being offered.The non \u2013 stop pace and abnormal events evidently makes Bringing Up Baby memorable viewing and a comedy which you can still appreciate.",

It seems to me that His Girl Friday is a lot better executed as a whole and in its parts than Bringing Up Baby. I understand that this one is the film people bring up when talking about Howard Hawks's screwball comedies, and rightfully so. But when you stand this up next to His Girl Friday, it doesn't read as well, simply because from the very beginning of His Girl Friday we know who the characters are and what their motives will be as the story progresses, but at the beginning of Bringing Up Baby the characters are muddled and confusing. In His Girl Friday, the actions of the main characters are hilarious and the motives behind those actions are complicated and human, and we understand that. Here the actions are also funny, but the motives are simpler. His Girl Friday is more realistic and human, and in my opinion that makes it the better movie.Even so, there is a lot in this movie to love. That's one of the movie's charms- the way that the characters develop from simple caricatures into people we can't help but loving. That must have been one of Hawks's gifts- providing us with characters that are just strange at the start and slowly develop into real people. Sure, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are as funny as can be, as expected, and the supporting cast is great. Some of the slapstick gags are a little stale, but there are enough priceless bits to make up for the not-so-priceless ones, especially near the end.I suppose I'll end up in IMDb hell for saying His Girl Friday is better than this movie, but I can't help it. It's intriguing to me that Bringing Up Baby is only 10 above His Girl Friday on the Top 250. Maybe I'll appreciate Bringing Up Baby more after a second viewing, but for now, I have to say that it's good, but it didn't live up to my expectations.",

People who have been brainwashed to believe it is a great film are simply afraid not to like it. Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn both do their best under the adverse circumstances, and the slapstick with the leopard towards the end of the film is genuinely funny.  This is one of a series of films that contributed to Kate Hepburn's reputation as \"box office poison\".  After boy friend Howard Hughes bought her the rights to Phillip Barry's play,  she then rescued her career with her big hit \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940).During the 1950s Cahiers du Cinema hailed director Howard Hawks as an \"auteur\", and resurrected all of his lesser films as would be masterpieces. This film was the main beneficiary, changing from a 1938 box office flop to a supposedly classic comedy.  It is perhaps the most striking example in film history of critics parroting received opinion to turn a flop into a masterpiece.  In my opinion the 1938 audience got it right.  There were many great screwball comedies made during the 1930s, such as \"It Happened One Night\", \"My Man Godfrey\", and \"The Awful Truth\".  Unfortunately, \"Bringing Up Baby\" was not one of them.",

For fans of the old 30's-style comedies, it doesn't get any better, and it also stands up well against anything made since.David (Grant) is a harried paleontologist who dreams of getting the final bone that will complete the dinosaur skeleton he's been working on for so long, while Susan (Hepburn) is a carefree socialite who takes a liking to the scientist and makes things up as she goes along.  When she acquires a live leopard, everything is in place for a series of crazy events.  There's a lot more to the plot than that, but it's much more fun to watch it than to analyze it.The comic timing of the director and the stars is flawless.  The supporting cast is perfect, and is an important part of making this such a great film. Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, May Robson, and the rest are all hilarious.  The excellent writing is also an indispensable part of the picture.All of the characters, plus both leopards and a dog, eventually come together in a wild climactic sequence full of non-stop laughs, capping off a great time.  \"Bringing up Baby\" is a must-see for anyone who likes classic comedies.",

Through the powers that be, I watched this movie just before I heard of Wilder's death, and now I can barely put a coherent thought together. Bringing Up Baby, directed by Howard Hawks in 1938 brought screen powerhouses Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn together in a zany screwball comedy for the ages. Showing the distance one woman will go to chase the object of her affection, no matter how dense he is to that fact, Bringing Up Baby is refined perfection to the genre of screwball comedy. Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant), a zoology professor preparing to be married has a solid handle on his life. Reserved and always in control, David knows exactly what will happen with his life. David will marry, hopefully secure a sizeable grant to continue his project of completing his brontosaurus skeleton, and he will live in peaceful harmony never challenging the rigid existence he has created. David's life in understood and peaceful, until he meets Susan (Katherine Hepburn). Susan is a zany, wild, and unpredictable woman who, unlike his fianc\u00e9, is more interested in David as a person rather than David as a zoologist. Susan has inserted herself into David's life and despite his efforts, has made it clear she plans to stay embedded in his life. Some of the zany methods she has used to remain a fixture in David's life include getting him arrested and deeming him the caretaker of a leopard. David remains focused on getting back to his comfortable life and marrying his fianc\u00e9, unbeknownst to him, however, he is also falling in love with Susan as she falls in love with him. When David realizes that Susan is friends with the woman he is attempting to secure the grant from, he remains by her side further complicating his attempts at resisting her love, and his attempts to resist loving her.Being a fan of classic cinema, I have always found Cary Grant, a golden boy of the age as being overrated. Seeing Grant portraying a socially awkward nerdy scientist, however, proves that I have possibly been underestimating him. His on-screen chemistry with Hepburn was pure gold, proving why this film is viewed in such esteem as possibly the best screwball comedy ever made. The two paired together to create a relationship to finally root for, even for the one who doesn't care for romantic movies (raises hand). I love Katherine Hepburn in her roles with Spencer Tracy, especially her turn in Adam's Rib. She was also fantastic in Woman of the Year, proving her take charge yet vulnerable range in each. Hepburn was just incredible in Bringing Up Baby, and had I not seen the previous titles, would list this film as her best role. Her lightning speed at which she delivered dialogue and her rapidly perfect comedic timing make her turn as Susan one for the ages and the lynch pin of what a successful comedic actor looks like. An exquisite script, perfect comedic acting, and hijinks galore make Bringing Up Baby a mainstay in teaching comedy today, nearly 80 years after its release.",

            "content": "The year was 1938. Audiences, still reeling from the sucker punch of a not-quite shaken Great Depression and the spectre of looming World War, took to the moving picture houses, presumably for a peaceful diversion, a relaxing reprieve from the exhausting whirlwind that was their lives. Then came Howard Hawks and Bringing Up Baby - a film about as relaxing as taking a joy ride on the outside of a fighter jet (and scarcely quieter, albeit much more joyful). So relentlessly madcap that Hawks inadvertently coined a genre in an attempt to make sense of the antics of his cast of characters (\"screwball,\" natch), Baby bombed at a box office - presumably due to a medical alert cautioning impending loss of consciousness from laughing too hard and incessantly. Revisited 80+ years after its initial release, the oft-imitated Baby remains the undisputed champion of the rollercoaster romp, swapping out balance, breathing, and very nearly common sense in exchange for a peerless barrage of overcaffienated hilarity. And, to quote the panting, sweating, bemused Cary Grant, in between cross-dressing and being doused in chicken feathers: \"I've never had a better time!\" Hawks himself, retroactively denounced his film for being too relentlessly zany, and lacking even a single straight (wo)man to ground the insanity (with the pointed exception of Virginia Walker's staid, uninteresting and unromantic romantic interest). And, while it's true that 90 minutes of Hawks' marathon pacing and machine gun banter can start to feel wearying, excessively bemoaning having too much of a good time is more ridiculous than any of the treasure trove of antics Hawks parades through the film. And ridiculousness aplenty awaits. Whisking by on a typhoon of repetitious wordplay, double-entendres, slapstick, visual gags, half a zoo's worth of menagerie, and various states of Hays Code-baiting undress, Hawks hits Shakespearean levels of dignified bawdiness (think Much Ado About Nothing performed on a formula one track), then honks the Bard on the nose while passing him on the comedic freeway. It's rare and wonderful to see a comedy so singularly and purely committed to raising laughs at all costs, utterly eschewing pretences of anything beyond unbridled entertainment. For Hawks, pacing is not so much a concept as a challenge. But, telling a story so willfully superfluous at such breakneck speed replete with the elegance of immaculate story structure and an incandescently clever script, makes watching the film akin to whizzing down a waterslide sipping a perfectly prepared cup of tea. Here, dialogue is not so much exchange as physical assault, as if the characters are attempting to push each other out of the frame with their sheer frantic barrage of words. Gone is the conventional class critique of the decade's convention: nothing and no one is safe from Hawks' voracious satire, as the rich, poor, men, women, scholarly, and illiterate are all socialistically denounced and revered as equally adorable nitwits, valuable only insofar as their capacity to be either driving or the butt of a joke. Hawks' irreverence feels consistently authentic and earned, however, even if it does mean the film's structural sophistication isn't echoed in depth in content or characterization. But who has time for those pesky things, anyway? Or breathing, for that matter?Although the entirety of the cast shine in their respective moments in the spotlight, the film is indisputably anchored on an trifecta: Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and a placidly mischievous leopard doing its utmost to undermine any fleeting attempts at normalcy. Grant is simply outstanding - nebbish but nimble, he runs the gamut of incredulity to insanity with boisterous ease, raising as many laughs from his flustered silences as his bombastic bursts of harried abandon. Hepburn is less performance than force of nature. A Tasmanian devil of whimsical chaos and incessant talking, Hepburn would toe the line of being infuriatingly nattering were her inherent charisma and charm not so radiant that her antics are not only gut-bustingly funny, but surprisingly sympathetic and sweet. And the leopard? Top notch as well - and probably the most remarkably well-behaved one of the lot, at that. A seminal seminar in 'everything but the kitchen sink' comedy keeping its dignity, Bringing Up Baby has lost none of its furious momentum and riotous wackiness, even if its lack of moments of zen make it a touch hard to know its protagonists beyond their pratfalls. For once, 'a laugh a minute' is more than a figure of speech - even if taking it literally would suggest that only a fraction of the gags in that given time span land have landed. Exhausting, exhilarating, and more coherent than any film this zany has any right to be, Hawks' classic is a triple shot of espresso, but from the most gourmet of cinematic roasts, and worth bringing up anew for years to come. In short: you can't give it anything but love, baby. Now, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!-9/10",

So, I watched it again recently for some laughs but I found only a couple. Well, maybe moods and times make a difference, so I just watched it one more time. Now, I wonder if it's the same movie I watched originally. Or maybe I was just impressed (and swayed) by what others were saying about the film then.So, I looked further back and found that this wasn't a big hit in its day either. It finished the year 57th in box office, with more than two dozen comedies finishing ahead of it. I have watched more than half of those, and they are all much better comedies than this film. There's an interesting history to this film, about it having been written specifically for Katherine Hepburn. But its screwball nature was much more fitting in that time for the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges or Laurel and Hardy. Certainly not for Hepburn and Cary Grant, together -- as audiences proved when it flopped at the box office. And, even though it later got something of a cult following, and critics and historians have taken to it, I prefer to go by how much all the zaniness in this (or any film) makes me (and most audiences) laugh.Anyway, I enjoy comedy and especially appreciate farce, as is found often in screwball comedy. But for that to work, it has to have great material and the right combinations of a cast and other things. This film just misses the mark in key areas. The screenplay suffers a great deal. First, it's far too wordy and talkative. The great screwball films have much less dialog with very funny, zany situations. But not slapstick as some of the antics here seem more to resemble. Katherine Hepburn's frenetic Susan is constantly rattling on and on and running here or there. Sometimes it's funny, but more often it's just inane, and that makes it tiring. Cary Grant's lines are almost void of any humor. It seems as though half of his lines are \"Susan! Susan!\" or \"Oh, Susan!\" or just plain \"Susan.\" After the third or fourth \"Susan! Susan!\" his dialog becomes tedious, and Cary Grant's David begins to grate on one's nerves.The constant mayhem in this film soon loses its luster. Only an occasional scene or exchange of lines is funny. Some others of the cast do well in their roles, but again, the humor is limited. Charles Ruggles is good as Major Applegate. May Robson is ideal as Aunt Elizabeth. This is the first movie for Virginia Walker who plays Alice Swallow. She is the type of person one might expect a no-nonsense professor to have as a fianc\u00e9. But she didn't make another movie until 1945. She got bit parts in four films that year and then died at age 30 in 1946. Little information is available about her or the cause of her death. A newspaper notice said she died after a long illness.Two scenes stand out as genuinely funny. The first is early in the film when Susan and David are in the restaurant. She accidentally rips the back of his suit jacket. Then he accidentally tears the back of her dress - exposing her girdle from behind. They hurry out of the restaurant, walking in step against one another, David in the back. The extras in the restaurant got a charge out of it as well. The second very funny scene is late in the movie in the jail. The humor here is mostly around dialog with Constable Slocum played very well by Walter Catlett. Just about everybody gets in on the craziness in the jail.I agree that the animal scene is very good with Baby (the leopard) and George (the Scottie dog) wrestling and playing together.Howard Hawks directed this RKO production, but it's far from his usual quality films. Another thing that detracted from the film some was the obvious stage sets for the outdoor scenes when David and Susan go hunting for Baby. I heard Cary Grant's voice echo a couple of time, which deflates the scene.Cary Grant has made many wonderful comedies, and Katherine Hepburn has a few good ones to her credit. Hepburn and Grant together are capable of chemistry as they showed in \"Holiday.\" It came out just four months after \"Bringing Up Baby.\" And, in that one, Hepburn is a free-wheeling spirit as well - but not a perpetual motion machine spewing incoherently or gabbing with gibberish. A couple other top comedies of Hepburn's were \"The Philadelphia Story\" of 1940 and \"Woman of the Year\" in 1942.I wondered about the difference in the two close Hepburn comedies of 1938. So, I did some online research. Sure enough - it was in 1938 - after this film came out, that Hepburn was labeled box office poison by the independent theater owners in America. An article to that effect appeared in the May 3, 1938, issue of the Independent Film Journal. Hepburn responded by ending her contract with RKO. \"Bringing Up Baby\" was her last RKO film. Her next, much better film came out just four months later. \"Holiday\" again co-starred Cary Grant but it was produced by Columbia Pictures and directed by George Cukor.This isn't a bad film, and most people might enjoy it once. Animal lovers would be its biggest fans. But it's not a very good comedy of the caliber of films to keep in a library for future viewings and for passing on in families.",

While I liked it, I do think it is a little bit overrated. Nevertheless, BABY will continue to win many new fans in the future, and I hope it does, because it is very good.Hepburn and Grant go from mad-cap situation to another. Hepburn plays a kooky, klutzy heiress who makes Cary Grant's life a lot of trouble (yet a lot more interesting) after they meet on the golf course. Cue a leopard called \"Baby\", uncomfortable wardrobe malfunctions, arrests and lots of pratfalls! For me, BABY is very charming for the first hour or so, yet seems to get almost too screwball for it's own good in the final half an hour. Unlike THE LADY EVE, everyone's a screwball, which marks it hard to find a yardstick against the silliness. Still, it's well worth seeing!",

Bringing Up Baby follows a tightly-wound paleontologist (Cary Grant), out of his element on a fundraising mission, who crosses paths with an accident-prone chatterbox socialite (Katherine Hepburn) and her housebroken pet leopard. Grant's mild-mannered professor is immediately frustrated by the entanglement, but the more he struggles to extricate himself, the tighter he's bound. The girl is quicksand, basically, and she revels in the havoc she plays upon her unsuspecting prey. Eventually, somehow, the two develop a strong affection for one another, but not before they've ostracized a benefactor, misplaced a priceless fossil and spent a few hours behind bars.Grant was no stranger to comedies (his collaboration with Hawks would continue in the aforementioned Friday), but this was Hepburn's first foray into the genre. Rumor has it she needed a little behind-the-scenes coaching, but she pulls her weight in the finished product and shows strong chemistry with her counterpart. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of laughs in the first hour, especially given the movie's age, but it wanes on the home stretch and I didn't really care for either of the main characters: one irritable wet blanket, one scatter-brained troublemaker.

It's really one big mess, with even leopards appearing, but that's why it's very funny. It doesn't make a whole lot sense, but it's nice to watch. You don't get bored one minute of it. The main leads here are Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. They are both great in their parts. Cary Grant doesn't play his usual kinda of guy - here he is weird, with a big glass, etc, but he has a great comedy timing. Never saw him in a comedy movie before, but he gets the job done. Katharine Hepburn is also nice, but not as great as her male counterpart. Howard Hawks' also does a nice job directing.So, this is a funny, light and entertaining 30' comedy, the type of movie you watch on a Sunday afternoon with the whole family - but that's it.

Every scene is centered around someone misunderstanding someone else and nobody even bothering to explain themselves, or when they do, another character interrupts to obliterate any budding coherency. I found myself literally wishing Susan (Hepburn) would stfu. Sure this might have hindered the \"comedy\" but it would have given my brain 5 seconds to breathe. Because of the time when this film was made there is absolutely no soundtrack music so it is Hepburn's grating voice at a high decibel level almost non-stop throughout the movie.

Usually as an audience member you feel sorry for well-intentioned people who are in over their heads, but both of these people struck me as fools right from the very beginning. You can cast Cary Grant as the put-upon social misfit and he'll play it very well, but for me it wasn't appealing to watch. Take away that debonair quality of his and you have someone you sympathise with because you feel superior. That's not a feeling I want my matin\u00e9e idols to inspire within me.Ultimately if you set out immediately with interesting characters then you don't need to throw a leopard into the mix to create sparks, and if one just happens to be there then don't assign your movie stars the task of trying to 'out-act' it.

            "content": "As directed by Howard Hawks from an intelligent script by Hagar Wilde and Dudley Nichols, \"Bringing up Baby\" proved to be a milestone in the War Between the Sexes. Here, as in other films, Hawks did not invent that war, but merely made himself its Suetonius. Recognizing that as a Freudian psychologist puts the point in the film \"the love impulse in the male\" often expresses itself in conflict, he found a way of crafting an entirely new genre of character comedies--which played on U.S. males' repression and conformity to weird statist rules on the one hand and U.S. females willful ignoring of such rules whenever they are after a man they want on the other.In this case, Katharine Hepburn, a screwball daughter of wealth, becomes involved with a professor, played in black glasses by Cary Grant. Grant has a fianc\u00e9e, a brontosaurus skeleton almost complete after four years of expeditions and assembly, and a need to extract a million dollars from a donor to his museum, through her adviser. When Hepburn ruins four attempts to reach the donor, her Aunt, May Robson, through his own or hers, the story takes a decidedly sudden and strange turn. Her brother has sent her a tame leopard--Baby. From this point in the narrative on, three main elements are interwoven--Grant getting deeper into daffiness because of Hepburn's slowing his chances of ever getting the money; she meanwhile keeping him from the frozen-faced fianc\u00e9, ably played by Virginia Walker; and the two trying to find the final bone for Grant's dinosaur, stolen by the Aunt's dog and buried, as both the dog and Baby also go missing. Somehow a Constable, a psychiatrist and his wife, the servants, a visiting circus with its own escaped leopard that is hardly tame, the Aunt's guest and others become embroiled in a well-photographed and memorable sequence of misunderstandings, confrontations, arguments and chases. The film is B/W, well photographed and kept moving by Hawks. Cliff Reed was associate producer for the film, with what music there is being supplied by veteran Roy Webb. With cinematography from Russell Mettey and Van Nest Polglase's Art Direction, Art Department contributions by Perry Ferguson, associate art director and Darrell Silvera's gorgeous decorations for numerous sets, the film is visually lovely. Howard Greer's costumes look stunning on Miss Hepburn who is young, striking and, apart from speaking a bit too fast, very good in this essentially youthful role. Grant is less convincing as a professor, but as a young serious type, he draws on his experience on \"Holiday\" to make the most of a long gradual change as he finds himself excited--sedately of course--by Hepburn and his adventures both. Also in the cast are May Robson as the Aunt, Fritz Feld and talented Tala Birell as the psychiatrist and his wife, Barry Fitzgerald and Leona Roberts as the servants, Walter Catlett as the befuddled constable, and George Irving as the Aunt's adviser. Look for Dick Lane, Jack Carson and Ward Bond in bit parts, among many others. The film I find to be attractive, and very funny, but certainly not a Top 100 film owing to its lack of important meaning. It is a light and biting satire on the way people fail to grow up in the U.S., and how this affects their attempts to find the right partner, and to get on with whatever it is they are doing. A failure when it was first offered to an edge-of-the-war public at the end of the 30s screwball treatment, era, like \"The Court Jester\" it has today found its audience as a good and rare noir satire. And most deservedly so, I suggest.",

This movie almost destroyed several careers. So it appears, given the rave reviews here, that the movie audiences back then were actually more discerning than today. No wonder, given the wonderful movies being produced back then, especially 1938 and 1939. They had caviar to pick from, and Howard Hawks was serving hot dogs.Why doesn't this work? For one thing, there is hardly any change of pace, and not enough grounding in reality to set off the comedy. Most of all, I didn't like the Hepburn character and didn't care what happened to her. And I felt sorry for the poor schlemiel Cary Grant was playing. But the bottom line was there wasn't enough depth to the characters. The only characters I truly cared about were Baby, played by Nissa, and George, played by Asta, the star of the Thin Man series. Bringing Up Baby has its moments, and is mostly bearable, though you start looking at your watch after awhile. I suppose it would go down better after a few glasses of wine or tequila.From the reviews here I have to wonder what some people see in screwball comedies like this. Perhaps after being brought up on modern lame brain comedy, this looks good. It is a lot better than most modern comedies.At the heart of the screwball formula appears to be a misunderstanding, preferably one big, central one, and many little ones. This is definitely not the best old screwball comedy. I can think of several contenders, but the winner, I believe, goes to Harvey. For a romantic comedy closer to this that works, see My Man Godfrey, which does right what this does wrong. For an example of a modern screwball comedy that works, see The Russians are Coming! This is not the worst major screwball comedy, a title that belongs to Twentieth Century. What a stinker! On the other hand, if you like that one, you're going to love Bringing Up Baby. When you boil this down, you've got to wonder, what were the studio executives thinking? They're sitting around the conference table, executives enveloped in cigar smoke, writers coughing:Let's do a movie with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. OK. A comedy. Hmmmm .... Hepburn as a flighty socialite. Sounds good. Grant as a paleontologist. I can't see it. Just give him glasses. We need something more. We'll add in a pet leopard. Why? People love animals. And a dog. That Asta from Thin Man. Asta and the Leopard will chase each other around and fall in love. What about Grant and Hepburn?They'll chase each other around, too. Or, rather, Hepburn will Chase Grant, and Grant will keep trying to get away. They will, of course, fall in love, but Grant won't know it. The audiences will love it! Can't lose!The writers deserve some credit for managing to build a movie on this thin foundation, but it needed more than just a bunch of good lines; it needed a plot. The performances by Hepburn and Grant were good enough, although Hepburn seems out to win an Oscar for fastest talker; it was the script and directing that failed. The real winner was the leopard.Bringing Up Baby turned out to be a warm up, a practice run for Philadelphia Story two years later, which has plenty of screwball elements, but which slows it down a bit and which has a story where you actually care about the main characters, and how it turns out for them. And it is actually funny. If you define a screwball comedy as a movie where the comedy gas pedal is stuck to the floor, Bringing Up Baby qualifies. But there are few comedies that can keep up such a frenetic pace and make it work. I think it's generally better to vary the pace of comedy in a movie, or the viewer is liable to fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion. Good night.",

In my opinion though, the funniest bit in the whole film was in the party scene quite near the beginning, when Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) is being taught a trick using olives by the bartender. She was supposed to flick an olive into her mouth, but she missed and it landed on the floor. As she tries to pick up the olive off the floor, you see Cary Grant walk in and slip on the olive and fall flat on his back! It was hilarious! Perfectly timed, and wonderfully well done! I have to admit that I am the sort of person who rewinds certain amusing incidents and watch them over and over again, and I had to watch that bit many times, and it just kept getting funnier each time! If you haven't seen Bringing up Baby, please watch it, as it is really entertaining, and I'm sure you'll love it as I do! It is an impeccably timed screwball-comedy with fine acting performances and hilarious direction from Howard Hawks. Absolutely brilliant; ***** out of 5",

Likewise, Howard Hawks will remain one of the most underrated American directors of cinema with films like Red River and His Girl Friday. Furthermore, I think slapstick is a seriously underrated art form which should get the attention it rightfully deserves. However, I had a very hard time liking this film. I have no idea why this film is praised to the degree to which it is. There are some seriously funny and memorable moments in this movie. One of the final scenes is one of the most amazing scenes I have seen in a long time. I still felt let down. I felt that the movie did not do a good job in developing its characters even though the genre may not call for this. Likewise, some of the scenes did not transition well. Finally, an excellent actress like Katharine Hepburn, as sophisticated as her acting may be, was just not right for this role in playing a dumb woman. In conclusion, I tried very hard to like this film, but I can not see it as an important American classic.",

A bone, a dog, a leopard, the wrong golf ball, and a case of mistaken identity. Grant is his usual great straight man, and I never realized Hepburn was such a comedienne. Nonstop fun and a great old flick.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, quit reading now, OK??Grant and Hepburn meet on the golf course as she hits his ball, he follows her to the 18th green, absolutely zany dialog, she seems like a complete airhead, but right away, we find out later, she determines to marry him, takes off in the wrong car, his, and in the process bends a bumper and dents a fender. They meet again at a restaurant, more zaniness, she rips his tux, he accidentally steps on her dress, ripping off the back, they end up at her place, he loses his clothes, later gets a package with the missing dino bone, it later comes up missing, the dog took it, also a leopard from Brazil, 'Baby', shows up, trying to find a home for it, call zoo, then find out it really is her aunt's, everyone searches for the tame leopard, meanwhile a wild leopard is also on the loose, everyone ends up in jail cells, in a funny scene a man is imitating a leopard, while others say a 'loon' is outside, 'It still puzzles me why a loon would answer a leopard's cry.' Everything Grant and Hepburn try turns into a comedy of errors, and at the end, when she visits him at work, knocks down the entire dinosaur skeleton.  But they get each other!!",

It's especially impressive considering director Howard Hawks had to hire people to teach her to be funny. Playing an early manic pixie dreamgirl prototype, she finds herself bumping into Cary Grant in increasing outrageous and embarrassing situations, then eventually she begins to lure him, using her mischievous pet leopard, Baby, as bait. The two are a delight together, probably my favorite cinematic duo because they are two of the biggest film stars ever, and they share the screen so effortlessly, neither one ever trying to steal the spotlight for themselves. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/16/bringing-up-baby",

            "content": "Brilliant comedic timing, timeless jokes, a perfect Hollywood pairing, farfetched situations, oh, and a pet leopard... what more could you ask for in a comedy?Usually, most reviews begin with a brief summary of the movie's plot, but with this, I won't bother. Just watch it! The movie's nonsensical narrative and random happenings are enough to keep you laughing and begging for more. It doesn't matter that the plot's a bit mad; if you're after a laugh - and with everything going on, who isn't? - this is the one for you!Stand out moments for me are when Susan (Hepburn) annoyingly repeats (and echoes) David's (Grant) cries for pet pooch George who's got a very important bone before the pair follow George aimlessly around the garden as he takes the pair on a wild goose chase digging up things he's buried. The scenes where the couple are in a restaurant and get into a few wardrobe mishaps and misunderstandings with fellow diners are really funny too.Grant, as usual, is the quintessential leading man for a '30s screwball comedy - easily flipping between being confused, flustered, cynical and at his wits' end in the hair-brained schemes his character (willingly) gets himself into.Hepburn is superb. It's amazing how she was able to, in her early career, portray wealthy and spoiled New England girls brought down to earth following a chance meeting with a charming guy - usually played by Hollywood's cream of the crop (Grant, Tracy, Stewart, etc.). On the surface, these characters aren't the ones you typically root for, yet she makes them likable and entertaining. A class act!",

Most films from the pre-war years do not wear well with age, but this one does, it is so fresh,lively and entertaining, that one tends to forget it was made 73 years ago. This film shows that a film to be extremely funny and engaging does not have to resort to swearing, nudity or sex, something the modern day directors and actors could do with learning. The plot is very simple and does not really contribute much, but the acting and direction is so superb that one does not really care. It is a silly film and unpretentious, just the sort of film to watch when one needs cheering up or a good laugh for a good laugh's sake.

I was especially intrigued by the scene with Baby and the dog playing because I couldn't figure out how it was created without the dog dying. It was very creative and suspenseful. I found the story interesting because it was tied together nicely; from the dinosaur bone being buried by the dog, the leopard actually belonging to the aunt, to the fact that an actual leopard had escaped from the zoo and almost maimed Hepburn. In addition to the humor, the film did give the general impression that you should marry for love, which is always a good message.

The comedic timing and the use of animals in the movie in their training was excellent. The animals were great comic devices that add a whole new dimension to the acting scene.

            "content": "I have watched this film many, many times over the last 45 years or so, and I have the same reaction every time. This film is highly over-rated. It is not really a screwball comedy at all, but simply a farce. The plot device of mistaken identities is probably older than Shakespeare, but to apply this device to two LEOPARDS coincidentally on the loose in the same New England locale is preposterous! In fact, the premise that somebody could actually just ship a live leopard, as if it were some stuffed toy, directly to a private address in the United States is beyond credulity to begin with, thus completely undermining the rest of this farce. True screwball comedy doesn't rely on such completely impossible plot devices - unlikely ones, maybe, but impossible ones, no!In BUB, Kate Hepburn is so annoying, that it is impossible for me to see how Cary Grant could possibly fall for her. Both Hepburn and Grant seem absorbed in their own eccentric characters. They seem to be acting in separate vacuums, instead of developing any palpable affection. In order to convince me that they are truly falling for one another, they needed to develop a lot more chemistry as the film progressed. Whatever chemistry they do have reflects conflict, not growing affection. In the end Grant seems to succumb to Hepburn with an air of weary resignation - not love! (That's, okay, Cary; she wore me down, too!) The love story is lost in all of the buffoonery and unbelievable antics and then seemingly tacked on as an afterthought.In fairness to Hepburn, I enjoyed seeing her portray the madcap heiress, even if she doesn't really convince me of her growing love for Grant. And Grant's Harold Lloyd knock-off is rather interesting - but more peculiar than funny. This film would have worked better with a real character - not a parody. In the truly classic screwball comedies, one of the main characters is loopy - not both. With both leads portrayed as nuts, there is nothing to ground this movie.Given the unbelievability of the plot, the writing is quite good. The dialog is very good; that part of the film is up to the standards of its contemporaries - both comedies and dramas. But to call this a screwball comedy is an affront to true screwball comedies. This is a farce, plain and simple - and as silly as they get.The film, Merrily We Live, released the same year, is a far better screwball comedy. It boasts a far stronger ensemble of actors than Bringing Up Baby. Despite its fabulous cast, from top to bottom, it is unfortunately under-appreciated and almost forgotten today. I wish TCM would show it half of the time it shows Bringing Up Baby.",

The fact that she doesn't see the error of her own ways adds to the screwyness, and in some ways allows the viewer to sympathize with Dr. David. At other points it just makes you wonder how anyone could be so oblivious, like when Susan steals David's car, then proceeds to ram and tear apart the 2 cars next to her along with the car she is driving without a care in the world.

But it wasn't hard to pay attention to the movie closely since it was so interesting. A few parts I really like in the movie was in the very beginning, I thought the wife to be of David was very sarcastic (and I liked it) when David was more concerned about getting the final bone to complete his dinosaur than being interested in the marriage he was about to embark in the next day. I loved her sarcasm toward the honeymoon stating his job is more important and he should do that instead of going on the honeymoon. Also, I loved all the different diversions the director came up with to keep David away from what he was trying to do. Each one was very smart and thought out.

That description alone is a recipe for hilarity and disaster. Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this film with a tamed leopard. In the beginning of the film I could not get over how outrageous and rude Susan (Hepburn) was acting. I hated the role she was playing and couldn't stand the fact that David (Grant) had to put up with it. As the film went on Susan started to grow on me and I got over the fact that she was completely crazy and was messing up David's life (for the better of course). Susan ended up bringing out the best in David, he came alive for the first time. By the end of the film I loved Susan, her fast delivery of the lines made it a smart and hilarious movie.Bringing Up Baby is a fast paced film with even faster dialog.

Grant and Hepburn have worked together quite well, as in The Philadelphia Story, but I think one of the obstacles to this film is that they haven't yet figured out their timing and rhythm to a degree that they work well together.

Don't take the movie too seriously, e.g. try to see the plot rationally, get angry at Hepburn's character for doing anything she pleases, etc - it's a screwball comedy. She is absolutely brilliant in this movie, blending slapstick, witty repartee, and even a little 'come hither' romance in a wild, frenetic script. She even does a mean gangster impression towards the end. I think the issue at the box office in 1938 (and subsequent label of her as 'box-office poison'...ha!) was that she didn't fit into accepted standards of \"feminine\" at the time, which is a shame, because she's got it all here. Grant is not so bad himself, with that suave accent in a nerdy role, finding himself helplessly drawn into Hepburn's crazy world. He's much better here than in 1944's \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", despite the obvious comparisons.

Katherine Hepburn plays a character who is interrupting at the perfect moments throughout the film, her acting is superb throughout. Cary Grant plays a buttoned-up paleontologist who is about to get married. His role is one of the quite, reserved groom to be, a character many can relate with. The great part of the direction and acting in Bringing up Baby is the foil that the two actors create, at times it is almost hard to watch. For those unversed in older films (Pre-1950) it is hard to understand that there was always a comedic element to these early films. Comparing modern comedies to movies like Bringing up Baby one can see that the producers and directors of modern comedies, and almost all modern films, have learned a lot from the movies of the past.

(I didn't drive yet and was 15). So, had to settle for watching TV. I already liked old movies then and the commercial (during the show before it) made this look interesting. (I've had it in my movie collection for a long time now.)\"Bringing Up Baby\"...The misadventures of David Huxley a studious & serious paleontologist whose life is turned upside down by the madcap heiress Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn), who has fallen for the man,practically on first sight.This, after their meet up on a golf course, as Susan has mistaken David's car for hers & tried to drive off with it. (I can only guess David left his keys in it?) Susan, obviously finding him attractive, although we can;t tell yet... does everything she can later, to prevent David's impending wedding to a frigid, all business type woman named Alice Swallow.This includes tricking David (acting over the phone like the Leopard is attacking her) to help her escort a pet leopard \"Baby\" from her luxurious New York City apartment, to her aunt's house in the Connecticut countryside.The scenes of Grant & Hepburn acapella singing \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\" to \"Baby\" to keep him tame, clearly demonstrates why Hepburn never 'really' sang in a movie. It's funny singing though.From here, he scenes become increasingly crazy as Susan, determined to prevent David from returning to New York, sends his clothes out to the dry cleaners while he's taking a shower. This forces him to don a frilly, women's bathrobe, the only available clothing item in the house.When confronted by Susan's aunt regarding his strange attire, \"Well why are you wearing THOSE clothes?!\" The only explanation David can offer is, \"Because i just went gay, all of a sudden!\" This line, which doesn't appear in any known version of the screenplay, was apparently ad libbed by Grant and, due to the rapid-fire nature of the delivery, snuck past the censors of the time.It is now believed to be the first time the word \"gay\" was used in a Hollywood film to connote homosexuality, and the line always gets a laugh from me.Truly, this was not a common term used then, so I con only gues it was used in certin circles of people then.) When he jumps in the airto say it, it actuallly makes the lne even funnier, as he had simply come up wit it.I did have to laugh when David tells Susan that he's strangely drawn to her in quiet moments . . . Although there haven't been any quiet moments since he's known her. Unless he means when she's not talking.The dinner scene with actor Charlie Ruggls was amusing but with a bit too much conversation and David & Susan repeatedly getting up and down, after 5 minutes of this, it started to feel the scene was going too long. My only negative here.Another moment, later Did is trying to call Alice in New York, but Susan listens in, then aps a glass to make a tone, then saying repeatedly, \"At the ton the time will be 7 (something) PM\".Then, George (her Aunt's dog) stealks away with a dinosaur bone that David had brought with him and they have to find whee he's buried it (among the many holes in the yard. Also the scene of them wandering through the woods at night to track down Baby, who's gotten loose.They accidentally slide down a hill, Suan after David and her big net comes down on his head. She looks at him and starts laughing and you can tell Grant is trying not to crack up. After they cross a pond and get drenched, David says that above all the other bad things happening ... \"And (now) we're wet!\"Near film's end, in the jailhouse scene, Hepburn covinves the nimble minded Sheriff that she and the others are all 'gangsters' (Chicago style) She does a hilarious 'gun moll' (ganster's woman) impression. Leading to her escaping the jail.Susan's ideas and schemes practially dismantle his persona & nearly wreck his life. But, his agreeability stems from the audience's belief that David has recognized (in the back of his mind) that she is somehow going to be good for him, as opposed to our near statue woman Miss Alice Swallow (that's the bird Swallow by the way.)Anyway, a sort of battle of the sexes is on display in Bringing Up Baby, it certainlty proves that women are at least equal with men in terms of intelligence and cleverness...and somewhat irrational behavior.Being a scrwball comedy, there's really nothing to understand or that should be confusing. It's not in line with Woody Allen films of the 1970s but it's not low humore either. It's just off the wall fun and 'normal' is not the order of the day,No better way to put it, Bringing Up Baby while not a box office draw in 1938, has since been reconsidered a classic comedy. Hepburn never did a role like Susan again...but knowing her, she likely felt she did right the first time, so why play it again?9 out of 10 from me.I love the movie and it's beyond funny. I only took one star for the dinner scene going on just a bit too long. ( I could just say 9 & 1/2 stars really .) - END -",

There are also leopards, circuses, assorted aunts, big game hunters, judges and doctors, all of them certifiable.Hepburn can sometimes appear cold and remote but she pitches her performance perfectly here with just the right amount of eccentricity and a strong dose of tomboy enthusiasm thrown in for good measure. Grant looks completely bemused and affronted throughout. He's the only remotely normal person in the movie and all be can do is watch on in completely bewilderment as the situation gets more and more hair-brained. With such a richly comic set-up from screenwriters Hagar Wilde & Dudley Nichols and such polished performances from the cast, all Director Howard Hawks has to do is point his camera, stand back and film the ensuing chaos.Rightly considered the consummate screwball comedy and cruelly under-appreciated in it's day (Hawks was fired from the studio and Hepburn labelled 'box-office poison' by distributors following it's disastrous performance), BRINGING UP BABY is surprisingly modern and seems to improve with age being as fresh and sparkling now as it was when first released. An interesting homage appeared in 1972 in the shape of Peter Bogdanovich's WHAT'S UP DOC? but it only served to illustrate that you can't improve upon perfection.",

Having seen quite a few screwball comedies, I'd have to say that Grant and Hepburn have some of the best on screen chemistry EVER. This is the kind of film where you're not only laughing, but the sheer amount of chaos catches and keeps your attention throughout. It provokes such a strong reaction, you want to shout at the characters \"don't do that!\" or \"oh not again!\" And they make you wait in suspense with no respite, for the resolution. That's the main reason this film works so well, as a viewer you're not satisfied until all the little plot twists have been worked out- it's maddening. But that's also what makes it great. Normally, I would have a problem with Hepburn's character traits, but she acts the part in such a way that it's funny rather than annoying. One thing I would very much like to see is a reversal of the typical personalities for men and women in screwball comedy, just for kicks. For some reason, I'd really like to see a ditzy Cary Grant, and KH as a slightly geeky paleontologist. As for formal aspects, I'll give a nod to the cinematography and lighting, camera etc. there were shots that were rather nice.

Basically Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant) is the mild mannered professor of zoology close to completing a brontosaurus skeleton he has worked on for four years, with only the intercostal clavicle bone left to go. He is also excited as he will be getting married to his officious assistant Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) who seems more interested in his work than him as a person, and he needs $1 million endowment from Mrs. Elizabeth Random (May Robson) in order to complete the project. It is her lawyer Alexander Peabody (George Irving ) who will decide for her whether he gets the money, do David needs to win his favour, but he cannot give a good impression because a woman keeps making him look bad. Eccentric heiress Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) keeps causing confusion to others and creating mishap around him, so he wants her to go away, and the more he wants this the more she stays besides him. He finds out that Susan knows Peabody, who she calls Boopy very well, and Mrs. Random is her Aunt, but getting to them is not easy, especially with the arrival of a tamed pet leopard named Baby sent by Susan's brother Mark sent from Brazil. Trying to keep an eye on the leopard is naturally not easy, and it ends up escaping and with word of mouth it becomes a hunt for people, including hunting enthusiast Major Horace Applegate (Charles Ruggles). So David is forced into helping Susan find Baby, while also searching for dog George who found the bone delivered to the professor that he has buried somewhere, and another leopard from the travelling circus is set loose too. There is a point when David and Susan are arrested along with a few other characters because of the huge misunderstanding with identities and the leopard situation, Susan does put on a act in order to get out, but the leopards make it easier. In the end David realises his work is not as important as his feelings for the woman he truly loves, no longer Alice, who has also moved on, but indeed Susan. Also starring Walter Catlett as Constable Slocum, Barry Fitzgerald as Aloysius Gogarty, Fritz Feld as Dr. Fritz Lehman, Leona Roberts as Hannah Gogarty, Tala Birell as Mrs. Lehman and John Kelly as Elmer. Grant as always is charming and does humorously well as the constantly annoyed man surrounded by confusion and small disaster, Hepburn is quite affectionate as the overly naive, slightly air-headed and in a way kooky woman who can't let him go, the jokes mostly come from the backwards and forwards dialogue and some small slapstick moments, a likable classic screwball comedy. Katherine Hepburn was number 38, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Hepburn was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and Grant was number 23, and Hepburn number 9 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 97 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

For example, when Susan was swinging on the ladder in the museum at the end of the movie; she would've fallen over sooner then she did.

            "content": "When first we see Cary Grant in Howard Hawks' classic screwball comedy \"Bringing Up Baby,\" he sits under a nearly constructed brontosaurus skeleton, dwarfed by the aged relic. What we witness in his final appearance in the film's final scene is Grant now positioned above the skeleton, which lies in ruins on the floor below him. These images nicely parallel the journey of Grant's character, scientist David Huxley, throughout the film. At the beginning we see him as a somber man enslaved to his work and uptight fianc\u00e9e, Miss Swallow (Virginia Walker). He ultimately finishes as an emerging free spirit, open more than ever to the sometimes zaniness of life. The catalyst in this change, of course, is Katharine Hepburn in a brilliant portrayal as the irrepressible socialite Susan Vance. Through the misadventures David experiences with her, and a certain leopard named Baby, he is finally able to experience the freedom of skirting the rules and living life as he sees fit.It's such a delight to watch this film and revel in its madcap situations and witty dialogue. Made under the constraints of the recently enforced Hays Production Code, it's equally fun to watch (and listen) for its veiled indiscretions and naughty innuendos. The storyline of \"Bringing Up Baby\" is kept simple enough. It practically has to be, or the viewer wouldn't hope of catching the copious jokes that fly by at a breakneck pace. Like the narrative, the film's score is also kept minimal, drawing heavily on repetitions of the popular song \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby,\" all but once sung by the characters themselves. The film has some clever visual touches too. Watch for the fun it pokes at Miss Swallow, the character who is constantly reminding David of the obligations he must adhere to, as well as proper social etiquette, in stark opposition to Susan. The film takes full advantage of the costuming of the two actresses, with Susan wearing light and flowing gowns, while Miss Swallow is constricted to tightly fitted black dresses.Despite the fact that in 1938 America was still dealing with the Great Depression, one would never know this looking back upon \"Bringing Up Baby,\" without outside historical knowledge. The world inhabited by the characters of the film is one of successful occupations, leisurely afternoons on the golf course, nights at stylish hotel clubrooms, and talk of million dollar inheritances. This, coupled with the carefree antics of its central characters, make the film a perfect specimen of the cherished escapism of the time. This isn't to say it doesn't hold up well today. In fact, that couldn't be further from the truth. The film perfectly suits lovers of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy, what with its irresistible blend of sharp dialogue and outright slapstick. The film draws from the full spectrum of what makes us laugh. And what more can you ask for in a comedy than that?",

If you find this funny then this film is for you. This film originally flopped and you can easily see why. I believe it became popular later only because Hepburn was a strong liberal and so any work needed to be classified as \"fantastic\". Someone can mention it was ranked in the top 100 all time, but ask yourself who created the rankings. Experts with a bias. Cary Grant does show why he is fabulous. He plays the professor perfectly. Very believable as a \"nerdy\" type. Yet he plays such suave roles in other movies.",

There are other screwball comedies to be sure, but this is the best. Cary Grant shows his outstanding comedic timing he was to display also in Arsenic and Old Lace, Philadelphia Story, and other films. Of course the entire cast performs brilliantly, Kate Hepburn, Charlie Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Castlett, among others. I remember from the film class the professor saying that these films were a tonic for the sad reality of the Depression, seeing wealthy people with apparently nothing better to do with their time. Form a technical standpoint, this film exemplifies the beauty of black and white films. The film would not be as good in color. Being filmed in black and white one can focus more on the tremendous scene framing, use of depth of field, and of course the beautiful set designs. The script is crisp and delivered perfectly by the cast, in Catlett's case a side benefit of his years in vaudeville. Really looks like a stage play on film, which in this case works perfectly. I have seen this movie countless times since that first viewing in college, and I pick up on new dialog and nuances each time I watch it! In my opinion, a perfect film.",

            "review_title": "The Finest Example of a Screwball Comedy",
            "content": "Funny how time has turned Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn into untouchable legends. In our minds, they're heavyweights stars with the capability to play any possible role, comedy parts among them but not our very first thought. We think of Hepburn as the ball-buster of \"Woman of the Year\", the transcending force of Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"The Lion in Winter\", Grant as a suave leading man of \"Notorious\" and \"Charade\" days past. We don't altogether forget how good of comedic actors Hepburn and Grant are. Rather, we underrate them, considering them to be masters at the top of their game instead of comedians capable of giving Bob Hope and Lucille Ball a run for their money. Excuse me while I sound off like an old-timer that continually yaps about the good old days \u2014 but present-day actors are really, really truly nothing in comparison to Hepburn and Grant. We have great actors around, no doubt, but the majority of actors are excellent in one genre and a deadbeat in the other. Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic in drama, but can you imagine him headlining a screwball comedy? Many can perhaps stay alive in a comedy, yet they aren't stirring the pot; they're usually sidelined with a quote-on-quote comedic actor who does all the heavy lifting for them.Hepburn and Grant are shining jewels of the cinema, humorous or otherwise. They don't just say their lines and hope to get a laugh. They become the dialogue, physically, emotionally, instinctively. Like the Barbara Stanwycks, James Stewarts, Rosalind Russells, Jack Lemmons of the day, a particular genre does not come as an obstacle. It's hard to even call Hepburn and Grant actors \u2014 to label them as chameleons seems more like it. In \"Bringing Up Baby\", Grant portrays David Huxley, a mild-mannered paleontologist hoping to finish his dinosaur exhibit through a potential million-dollar grant. While golfing with the primary donor, Peabody (George Irving), his plans are put on hold by the nutty Susan Vance (Hepburn), who steals his golf ball, his car, and, later, his heart. After causing a number of blunders in his life, Susan, who is under the impression that he is, in fact, a zoologist, persuades him to come to her aunt's Connecticut home to lock up Baby, a leopard she received from her brother. Consider that David is also supposed to get married the following day to the stuffy Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker). Consider that Susan's aunt (May Robson) is another benefactor for the grant, and believes that David is someone other than who he is. Consider how much trouble David will be in after it is discovered that Susan's dog has stolen and buried a rare dinosaur clavicle. Consider \u0085The plot of \"Bringing Up Baby\" is so thickened with misunderstandings and physical comedy races that is comes as a surprise that its abundance of energy never lets up, like a puppy who accidentally drank five Red Bulls and found its way onto a treadmill. It is the best screwball comedy ever made, being the funniest, the most lively, and the best acted. It should come tumbling down, considering how many comedic situations it has interacting at once, but Howard Hawks' direction is so sharp that the madness is nearly orderly. Arguably, \"Bringing Up Baby\" positively explodes during its climactic jail sequence; after yet another misunderstanding, the local constable arrests David, Susan, her aunt, and her aunt's dinner guest \u2014 later arriving is Baby, Susan's dog, and a second leopard who the characters think is Baby. Susan, hoping to trick the guards into releasing her, puts on a gun moll act that ends with her escaping out the window, befuddling everyone in the room. And then Peabody shows up. And then Alice Swallow shows up. And then \u0085\"Bringing Up Baby\" never slows down; it gets kookier (and better) as it goes along. It's a solid example of a perfect film. Hawks gives the material the zip it needs, Hepburn and Grant live the screenplay (ad-libbing and all), the supporting actors kick any chances of fatigue in the crotch \u2014 everything, and I mean everything, fits together flawlessly. In 1938, it was a flop, a critical shrug. In 2015, it's a masterpiece, a cinematic diamond.",

            "content": "Director Howard Hawks' opening scene features his real-life sister-in-law, actress Virginia Walker, answering Grant's seemingly innocuous question as the befuddled paleontologist assembling the pieces of a dinosaur skeleton and holding an unmistakably phallic-shaped bone in his hand, asking Walker where she thought it should go. Deadpan, Walker responds \"You tried it in the tail yesterday and it didn't fit.\" Somehow, Hawks slipped this juicy little bit of business right under the blue-noses of the puritanical Hays Code censors. At showings at revival theaters, Miss Walker's impassive yet saucy rejoinder to Grant always gets a good laugh. The voluptuous Mae West (Grant's \"mentor\" in his early years) could never have gotten away with that line, but the normally quite beautiful Walker pulls it off, largely because Hawks had her dressed-down to resemble a dowdy, bespectacled, middle-aged spinster. Walkers' character is billed as \"Alice Swallow,\" a tasty irony that Hawks probably felt he shouldn't try to get away with exploiting. Pic personifies Hawks' subtle yet substantial comedic genius. Sadly, the studio later fired Hawks because pic had such poor B.O. (Box Office) and bad reviews of what is now universally considered an archetypal screwball comedy. Studio suits back then could be as dumb as they are these days.In \"Bringing up Baby,\" Grant's channeling of Harold Lloyd as an absent-minded professor is just right, mixing sex appeal and comedy without resorting to slapstick or broad shtick. Having stated that, the collapse of the dinosaur skeleton at the end, with Hepburn swinging from Grant's arm up in the scaffolding, is the perfect physical comedy button to pic (Grant was actually an acrobat in his early years, and needed no double for the strenuous task of hauling Hepburn up to safety with a single arm).In 1971, Peter Bogdanovich later paid a loving homage to \"Bringing up Baby\" in his wonderful \"What's Up, Doc?\" borrowing, among other things, sight gags, background music tracks, and dialogue from the original. There's the scene in which Barbra Streisand (channeling Katharine Hepburn) grabs Ryan O'Neal's coat tail from behind and rips it up to the collar, just like Hepburn did with Grant. Bogdanovich even uses some of the same 1930s music in \"Bringing Up Baby.\"If you get a chance to see pic in a local revival theater, do it, even if you've seen it several times before on television. Cary Grant has a palpable chemistry with Katharine Hepburn - no small task with the headstrong, independent actress who was and still is decades ahead of her time.",

The timing is impeccable, the situations are hilarious, wonderful character actors abound and who can resist Baby and George? Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant have great chemistry together and it is obvious that they enjoyed making this film. In my mind, Kate is less strident than in some previous films; her voice is softer and more girlish. As for Grant, I am continuously amazed at what a wonderful actor he was. Because he was so handsome, Grant was underrated as an actor; people always seemed to think he was just playing himself. If you'd like to get a better idea of his acting range, watch this movie and Notorious; those two performances couldn't be more different.What I would love to know is how they filmed the sequence of Baby (played by the leopard, Nissa) and George (played by the terrier, Asta) playing together. It is real - no trick photography there. It is possible that Nissa grew up playing with dogs, but Asta probably never played with a leopard before in his life! They have different trainers, so it's doubtful that they grew up together. I slowed the DVD down to watch them play together, and I realized that Asta is the aggressor! He leaps on Nissa and grabs her ear ... all classic dominant dog play.As for the \"Because I just went GAY all of a sudden!\" remark made by the Grant character, it's my opinion that the general public thought of the term \"gay\" as only meaning happy, carefree. They, and most likely the censors, never picked up on the double entendre.This film is a must see, so grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy!",

Then my father started to let me rent films I would not be able to with my mother. And now I watch films from all over the world. One era of films I never really dabbled in was anything before the mid 1940's. Bringing Up Baby was made in 1938 and stars two of Hollywood's greatest actors, well, at least that is what I have always been told. Katharine Hepburn is always praised for her amazing acting, and this being a \"screwball\" comedy, I feel that I don't get a chance to see her shine. I have not seen much of her work, but I am willing to. I just didn't feel that this was a good vehicle for me to be introduced to her. Carey Grant on the other hand was wonderful. Prior to seeing this I was told that he and director Howard Hawks were very close and Grant would try anything for him in his films. Knowing this I payed close attention to Grants performance and was glad that I did. His facial expressions and reactions to the situations he was in were great. Besides the two of them the plot was somewhat solid but to plain for my taste. The older films have a lack of what I am used to, and because I was not familiar with more of them until now, I feel I am set in my ways and need to get out of them if I can. There is a lot of silence in the film, due to a minimal musical score and sound effects, and at times the actors seem to be talking way too fast, probably because it was a \"screwball\" comedy. Now I had seen Preston Sturges Sullivan's Travels a few years ago and loved it. I want to now go back and re-watch it so I can compare the two films as \"screwballs\". I am sure that I will watch Bringing Up Baby again sometime because my mother and grandmother think it's wonderful. I want to sit and see what they think is so wonderful.",

Then again, I would be more willing to accept the movie as a farcical illustration of the victory of natural free spirits (symbolised by Hepburn's leopard) over dusty convention (Grant's brontosaurus), if the anarchic tendency wasn't cushioned by wealth and privilege. Perhaps, when it comes to 1930s films on the spoiled heiress theme, I simply prefer Frank Capra's It Happened One Night, in which Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable are more equally matched.",

Every time I see it I spend the entire movie laughing, although it is exhausting to keep up. But what gives it the momentum is the romance, these two very, very different people are being brought together through the craziness and that is the most ridiculous and wondrous part of the it, that is what draws you in.She is the one to chase him, deciding early on that she loves him and doing everything she can think of to keep him near her. There is something quite striking about that both because she is a woman, and it is men who usually do the chasing, and because she is richer and of a higher class than him. Mostly again, in fairy tales and Shakespeare for example, it will be the character of lower class who falls desperately in love with someone from a higher class and has to prove their worth. Even in more modern movies (\"Titanic\" and \"the Notebook\" for instance) it is the poorer characters (who are in fact also male) who first notice and woo the richer characters.The leads; Katherine Hepburn, my favourite actress, and Cary Grant are just incredible and work wonderfully together. The leopard, Baby, is also lovely to look at.I, honestly, cannot understand why anybody wouldn't like this film. I can see why some people would like it more than others, being more enchanted perhaps by the romance, but how someone couldn't like it I do not know. Surely anyone, of any age(I watched it first time when I was 10 with my 8 year old sister and we both loved it), would find it funny?! I have discovered through user comments and reviews on IMDb that there are people out there who don't like it and think it's dated. At the time of release it was a commercial failure.

Hepburn, in her only foray into screwball, plays Susan Vance, a zany heiress whose flighty mannerisms get her caught in often hilarious situations. Grant plays David Huxley, a straight-laced paleontologist engaged to an equally straight-laced bookworm (Virginia Walker). David and Susan first meet at a golf course, and a series of unplanned circumstances (usually involving Susan's pet leopard Baby and dog George) keep the unlikely duo attached. Classic scenes include Grant tearing Hepburn's evening gown, parading about in her nightgown, and Hepburn imitating a gangster's moll while imprisoned. It's a shame this film wasn't better received at the box office when released, but now it is finally getting the fine recognition it deserves.

His character here was much more like the parody in that film as opposed to the version that I've seen in films like 'To Catch A Thief' (1955) for instance, but I'm afraid that it wasn't to my liking, despite how handsome he was.Allegedly Christopher Reeve based his performance of 'Clark Kent' in 'Superman' (1978) on Cary in this film and I can absolutely see it, because that has always annoyed me too.It was clear that the days of farce and nonsense from Vaudeville and the silent flicks was still only a recent memory when making this film, because it was just daft.The film had the same stupidity as Mr Grant's character and the story in 'His Girl Friday'(1940). There was too much, overly fast, talking over each other and silliness right from the off, which made the story itself difficult to focus on.And as for Miss Hepburn, well her character was positively bizarre and obviously in need of some medication or therapy for her mental health. How had she lived her life getting away with things as she did? And how did she fall in love with him so easily? He wasn't exactly full of charisma? Not to mention how could he possibly fall in love with such a completely bonkers woman, who had caused him nothing but trouble?In general it was the type of story that I would expect from 'The Chuckle Brothers' in 'Chucklevision' (1987-2009) or from some sort of cartoon, although 'Bugs Bunny' and 'Daffy Duck' would probably have done it more justice.The acting was far too much. If everything had been slower it might not have been so bad, but the silly way that it was rushed along made it hard to watch and I could have easily turned it off, if it hadn't been featured on two of the Top Films Lists I'm trying to tick off. I kept hoping that it would calm down and get better, but it just got progressively worse.There was a moment full of screaming and dog barking that was so frustrating that it boggled the senses. I don't know how they ever thought that people could concentrate and understand it all when it was all overlapping like that.The only good thing about the whole film was the beautiful leopard, who delivered a far better performance than any of the others and looked gorgeous too. The focus should definitely have been there instead.In some ways I found it to have similarities to 'Me & My Girl' (Stage Show) and 'The Importance Of Being Earnest' (Play & Film (1952/2002)), but without the calm easier pace and sensibility. If only they had slowed it down, it may have rivalled these shows.Honestly, I expected better from the actors mentioned and I would have liked it to have been much more about how they fell in love tracking down a lost leopard, rather than the overly complicated story that it was.151.33/1000.",

            "content": "This is a film I hadn't seen since my teens, back in the early '80s, and I am blown away anew by it now, having just watched it on DVD. The film's a masterpiece of American cinema. The great Cary Grant is in his element as the victim of a series of madcap circumstances -- his reactions throughout are priceless, as are his verbal responses (many of them ad-libs)-- and Katherine Hepburn is absolutely adorable, not the way she normally plays it, in her crazed role. Both actors turn in a very physical performance, too, including some falls that must have left a mark.Howard Hawks was unquestionably one of the best film directors of all time, and one of the most influential, though largely unheralded during his life. He could direct anything, it seems, and this is a prime example of his facility with comedy. Not just comedy, either, but frantic, madcap, slapstick, screwball comedy, comedy of a type so unrelenting and fast-paced that it could easily undermine the film or create fatal viewer fatigue were it not for the fact that it was written (and subsequently improvised upon) so perfectly sharply and featured such great actors in every role. The lines voiced by the actors are superb, but some of the unspoken communication is even better. Even the leopard (a jaguar, actually, as would be expected from a South American origin) was great, and one beautiful cat, as was the terminally annoying little yappydog that I was hoping Baby would eat. Just as Hawks was under-appreciated during his career, perhaps in part because in hindsight we can now see how far ahead of his time he always was, so this film suffered upon original release; indeed, this film was detrimental to the career trajectories of its director and two stars.To say that they don't make 'em like this any more would be an understatement. The fact is, really, that they NEVER made 'em like this, though some other highly entertaining 'screwball' comedies of the time (including Cary Grant properties) also provide excellent viewing even today. The dialog is not only rapid-paced but very edgy and loaded with double entendres, and overlapping dialog paved the way for similar devices by the likes of Robert Altman and the makers of \"Hill Street Blues\" and other works intentionally grounded in non-cinematic reality.The two main stars, of course, make the film, but every part here is cast to perfection. In the DVD commentary, a very interesting Peter Bogdanovich (he seems a fascinating dude, too) points out that all of the characters in this film are off-center and that Howard Hawks later realized that was the fault with the film and in the future never repeated his mistake, always including characters who were more 'normal' just to provide a basis for comparison. Regardless, every one of the quirky and halfway-nuts characters in this film is perfectly executed and adds to the whole; somehow, the film succeeds brilliantly despite, or perhaps because of, every player being way off-kilter, a feat perhaps not possible with actors of lesser caliber.My one concern here is that, eventually, someone will get around to pitching a remake of this with Ben Affleck and J Lo in the lead roles...",

Watch out for the throw-away line from the delivery man near the beginning of the film, it's a gem. On set Grant and Hepburn may not have warmed to each other straight away but Grant accepted that Hepburn had the sort of magnetism that meant you couldn't ignore her, even when you might want to! Hepburn is certainly not the typical ditsy heiress. In fact her willful performance was partly blamed for the box-office failure of this film.

In \"Bringing Up Baby,\" I was amused at the start of the film (Grant's fiance's romantic aloofness) and the last half hour or so (the mix-up of the two leopards, the jail scene, etc.). I hated the rest.  It was stupid and nasty, especially the Hepburn character.  Jerry Lewis' movies are smarter, more adult and subtle in comparison.  I won't bother to comment on how self- centered, immoral and cruel the Hepburn character is.  Nor will I go into how unlikely the two could fall in love (showing Grant a looser/fun [?, maybe crazy] side of life is not enough).  What bothered me is that most of what went on was stupid/unbelievable and not funny.  I could go on and on giving examples.  What is funny about Hepburn stupidly and unnecessarily damaging Grant's auto?  What is funny about her pulling on his formal coat to the point of tearing it, or him stepping on the hem of her dress to the point of accidentally tearing out the back of it?

Hepburn acts so odd and innocent that she eventually becomes lovable despite having certain blind spots. Cary Grant is good as always and can almost seem as clueless as she is sometimes while still being able to watch out for her. Their \"Odd Couple\" pairing keeps the comedy going as long as possible which is the only thing making it interesting which isn't a bad thing. Screwball comedies are all about the antics. There is almost no serious story or romance because of taboos. It can cute seeing the two be in love with each other while not being in love with each other because of the falsity of the movie genre. Though that disbelief can almost disappear after seeing everything come together to create an insane comedy. I'd recommend it to a lot of people because it really is so silly that it's hilarious.

Also, I hate every movie I've ever seen with Katharine Hepburn in it.  Her voice and demeanor are repulsive to me, but she probably stood tall as a strong woman of her time (which explains her gut-wrenching role in Adam's Rib).

We learn that Susan has found herself in love with David, truly, madly, in love with him. Emphasis on the \"madly\". Despite how irritating and tendency for things to go wrong in her presence, much like David towards the very end of it all, we find her maddening ways endearing. Even when she destroys the T-Rex skeleton David spent years working on. The panning shots allowed us to really feel as though we were seeing it ourselves first hand, and even further the brilliant yet realistic acting by Cary Grant's annoyance to her presence, as if we were being followed ourselves. The mid-shots and close proximity of the two actors adding to our experience and ability to empathize. I felt more empathetic to David, probably because he felt more real, and we've all been there where someone simply WILL NOT leave us alone. We've also all been there when we want someone to leave or disappear, but we grow to appreciate them, as they change who we are and how we see things.

I've never seen any of Catherine Hepburn's work before, but have only heard of her once when a biography of Audrey HEPBURN told the story of how the famous designer Givenchy mistook the then-aspiring Audrey Hepburn for Catherine.  Audrey Hepburn has always been a great favorite of mine, and that incident somehow kind of make me resent Catherine, of whom I have never seen.  Then there was \"Bringing Up Baby\" on TV, with nothing to do so I just sat down and watched it.  It left me speechless!  Susan (Catherine's character) has left such an imprint in me that I base all of Catherine Hepburn's characters in the rest of her movies on (and Catherine is the model that I've often compare every actress I've ever seen on).Catherine Hepburn was so great that it's as simple as Catherine IS Susan. Why it struck me so was that my image of the classic star is always aloof, unreachable, dignified, and kind of cold.  It actually seems true most of the time in the movies I've seen, and here is Susan Vance, a down-to-earth, unconventional, outgoing, warm, and finds-joys-in-all-things type of girl. The first time I've ever seen a famous star making a fool out of herself and seemingly enjoying it!  It's actually true to Catherine, she is said to be an unconventional woman, never follow rules and care not what people say.Cary Grant also did an exceptional job in this movie, proving he is a great actor in all fields: comedy, romance, drama, or thriller.  The scene where Susan stole his clothes and he ended up wearing her furry, lacy, and much too feminine dressing gown is a classic.  I've never seen anything more hilarious.  Watching the two characters interact is like watching a disaster bound to happen, with many funny trips on the way.But what irks me the most is when this movie came out, it received awful reviews and flopped at the box office.  It did so bad that the director was fired and Catherine Hepburn's contract was canceled.  Movie was probably too \"unconventional\" for people back then.

Her timing, line-reading, and way of looking at Cary Grant are flawless.But this was her first comedy. She was a serious actress who studied her part the way she'd study any dramatic role. This was the later strategy for using dramatic actress Jean Hagen as Lola Lamont in Singing In The Rain. Both of these dramatic stage actresses studied, prepared, and brought no memories of bad comedies with them to their roles. The audience sees nothing but the finished outcome of their preparations.And it wasn't the big flop it's made out to have been. Its success, though, was spotty and unpredictable, losing in NYC but doing well in the West Coast urban areas, for instance. The inability of distributors to pigeonhole this movie drove them crazy. So they blamed Hepburn and lauded Grant.And why not? Grant was the best and greatest film actor ever. Over the course of three films with Hawks, Grant and Howard invented \"Cary Grant\" with BUB in 1938, Only Angels Have Wings in 1939, and His Girl Friday in 1940. The Awful Truth made Grant a star of ROMCOMs, but his films with Hawks turned him into befuddled nerd, a macho unsentimental tough guy who's slightly sadistic and a macho tough guy editor who's ruthless and slightly sadistic yet principled about printing the truth. And he was utterly believable as all three.Hawks said of Grant \"He's got funny in his bones,\" meaning he shows up and the audience assumes he's hilarious. Grant just adjusts the level and tempo.And his size and athleticism made him an effortless macho leader of men.Hepburn was athletic as well, but her physical comedy was rarely used. Spencer Tracy may have loved her but Grant LIKED her, and her best performances were opposite Cary Grant.Outside Bringing Up Baby Hepburn was never cuter, more adorable, just plain likeable. Her Susan Vance loves Cary's David so much that it's palpable.This movie has two references to The Awful Truth's comedy of remarriage. First, ex-wife Irene Dunne breaks up Grant's engagement to Barbara VANCE. And both Dunne and Hepburn, in wild tales about Cary Grant's past, refer to him as 'Jerry the Nipper.'

She ruins every meeting and makes it hard for him to get married to his fianc\u00e9. One day, she seeks his help to take a leopard (\"Baby\") to her place in Connecticut. How they take the leopard to Connecticut and the adventures they have form the rest of the story.Cary Grant is brilliant as David Huxley. In my opinion, he is the greatest romantic comedy actor of his generation. Katherine Hepburn is amazing as always and steals the show from her first appearance. Every moment that Susan and David have is hilarious and make you wish these two get together. The lead actors have great chemistry and make the film enjoyable, even to someone like me who did not grow up in that era.Bringing Up Baby is a treat to all. It can bring joy even if you have had a rough day at work or just had a fight. Though the film might unrealistic to today's audience, it still is talked about today. The serious Grant and the happy-go-lucky Hepburn make it a treat to watch.",

It's always a treat to watch Cary Grant in anything he does, and there were very few actresses that could hold a candle to Hepburn. And yet, and yet ...I can't help wondering what the film would have been like if they had gone ahead and used the real Harold Lloyd instead of Cary Grant's imitation of him. Let's face it, Grant was playing very much against type, so much so that even he had strong reservations about his own performance. Lloyd, on the other hand, played this type of character often and brilliantly, in the talkies as well as the silents. He'd have been much more believable, and was a very fit man in his mid-forties when this film was made. A comic genius, as opposed to an actor who could play comedy.And while we're at it, I'd have given anything to see what Jean Arthur would have done with Hepburn's role. Hepburn pulled off an almost impossible feat in playing a ditzy character. But again Arthur was a natural for this kind of role, whereas Hepburn was playing against type, and needing all the help she could get, as other reviewers have pointed out. My futile pastime is to imagine the sparks flying between Jean and Harold in an alternate reality version of this movie.",

Being a 'blue-blood' in this modern age is considered superficial.I never liked Katherine Hepburn and couldn't understand why a blue-collar Irish/American guy from Milwaukee, such as Spencer Tracy, would be interested in a skinny, flat-chested, flat-assed, shallow (as in 'shall we dahnce' or 'simply divine') boorish bi**h from Connecticut. While I'll take Kate and Myrna over a typical Jeff Foxworthy 'redneck' for a neighbor, with rusted-out cars in the yard, surrounded by pink flamingos, I'd prefer earnest neighbors with something to say other than small talk and who's aunt was the most obese or brother-in-law who married his ten year old 'kissin' cousin.To me, the dialogue in the screenplay was trite in the manner of Neil Simon, the acting was contrived and, it can be easily seen, that the people who owned the cast were the studio execs.",

I just forced myself to watch it carefully for maybe the 4th time before I wrote this review and have to say I found Hepburn and Grant more annoying than the previous times I viewed the film. Others rave about the dizzying pace and nonstop zany dialogue, but I found it grating on my nerves. Grant seems to be reprising the same over-the-top character he played in Arsenic and Old Lace and Hepburn plays a scatter-brained, intellectually challenged woman who is endlessly running around yelling \"David\" over and over again that for me became repetitious, tedious and curiously lacking in humor. And the coup de grace for me was the jail scene where the most irritating and obnoxious buffoon of all, the constable, headlined an extremely painful, interminably long and unfunny sequence centering around whether or not Susan had an aunt. It reminds me of some of the over-the-top unfunny sequences in highly regarded Preston Sturges comedies. I'm no stranger to screwball comedies and have watched many of the best movies of that era, so I have a rather extensive frame of reference for this type of film. I rate movies on whether I could watch them over and over. This movie is not one of them. The first thirty minutes were very promising, but the rest of the movie was inconsistent and periodically tedious. Cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors, but I don't think this movie can hold a candle to two of my favorites starring him--The Awful Truth and My Favorite Wife. I much prefer Irene Dunne\"s more subdued style in these films to Katherine Hepburn. Don't try to tell me I don't \"understand\" the point of the film: hell-bent mayhem or such. It just doesn't work for me and I'm not drinking the kool-aid. It's amusing, but please, please don't call it the greatest screwball comedy ever made!",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is an American black-and-white movie in the English language from 1938, so this film we have here will have its 85th anniversary next year or perhaps it happened already depending on when you read this review of mine. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes, which makes it neither a short nor a long full feature film you could say. The director is Howard Hawks who was around the age of 40 when he made this and this film is from right before the beginning of World War II and Hawks scored his only Oscar nomination during World War II. There are two writers here: Dudley Nicholas was already an Oscar winner at that point and him being part of this movie is surely a key reason why they got two big name actors on board. I will get to those a little later. The second writer Hagar Wilde was more prolific for the small screen, especially later on in his career, than for the big screen, so nobody can really be surprised that he has no history with the Academy. This film here was induced in the National Film Preservation Board already back in 1990, so you can see that it is really remembered by many. Even so many years after its shooting and even without (Oscar) awards recognition from when it got made. The two stars I talked about earlier are of course Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. They are both leads here without a doubt, even if Grant feels slightly more lead. The film begins with him and Hepburn's character is not introduced before Grant's bumps into her for the first time. Almost literally. There are a few odd confusions on the golf course where they meet for the fist time. This includes golf balls, cars and a lot more. Later on when they run into each other again, a handbag including a really precious item plays a big role too.As the film continues, we also get to see some animals. There is a leopard at the center of the story or actually there are two leopards, even if most of the characters have no idea for the majority of the film that it is not just one. Then there is also a dog that unintentionally causes further mayhem. When I tell you that Grant's character here has the profession of a paleontologist and that old dinosaur bones play a major role, you can maybe already think of some of the chaos that ensues in terms of the dog. By the way, Grant, whose birth name is really completely different compared to the name that everybody knows him under, namely Cary Grant, was still waiting for his first Oscar nomination when this film was made while Hepburn had already two nominations and won one of those. Honestly, I am a bit surprised that she did not score an Oscar nomination for her performance here. I am not sure if I think she would be deserving, but what she did with the character and her clumsy shenanigans I really would have imagined the Academy going for it, especially as they clearly loved her at that point it seems. She is also first credit here. On the one hand it surprises me because, as I stated earlier, Grant is the bigger lead, but on the other it does not surprise me because Grant's character was basically throughout the entire film just reacting to what Hepburn's character does. The gigantic mayhem at the very end is the best example for that, namely when the big dinosaur skeleton crashes down. This confused me by the way at the very start. We find out that the dinosaur's clavicle or collarbone whatever it is called was missing still and they found it and send it there, but way before that, really with the very first shot, Grant's character is wondering where to put a specific bone for it to be in the right position of the skeleton, but then they say that the entire thing is finished and ready and only the clavicle or collarbone is missing for it to be completed. Anyway, just a minor thing that did not make sense here.I talked a lot about the two leads already, but there are others who deserve being mentioned. Charles Ruggles had some solid screen time in the second half. Barry Fitzgerald became an Oscar winner a few years later and managed something really unique in Oscar history and May Robson was already an Oscar nominee when this got made in the late 30s. Virginia Walker I personally want to mention and she plays Grant's character's initial romantic partner, but when she sees the chaos at the end she leaves him and well he is free for Hepburn's character as a consequence. No surprise there, the only surprise was how exactly they would reach that conclusion of the two becoming a couple. I am maybe the only one there but I would have picked Walker without hesitation over Hepburn, no matter how goofy and quirky the latter's character may be in this film. Walker was just really stunning and sad to see she died at such a young age already and also under not really known circumstances. May she rest in peace. Like everybody else from this film. Even with child actors, chances would be slim now for them to still be alive. I think that overall this was a decent watch. I was nicely entertained, but never too impressed by the writing or performances I must say. It's old Hollywood. Sometimes the film went a bit too much over the top in terms of romance like when Hepburn's character tells somebody on the phone and at the same time also tells us in the audience that she has never in her life loved a man as much as Grant's character and that was surely a bit exaggerated and even on the creepy/stalker side with how they knew each other really only for a short period of time. Grant's character's reaction seemed more appropriate. It seemed as if he wanted to be left alone as she was always creating chaos in his life, but he still said that he was attracted to her in a way on one occasion.The comedy was so-so I would say, just like everything else. Some jokes in here have not aged too well, while others were fairly funny. My favorite moment from the entire movie in terms of comedy, maybe even in terms of everything, was when Hepburn on the phone with Grant's character acted as if she was attacked by the leopard to make him come over to her place and see what is going on, maybe save her. That was nicely portrayed. How she is first about to say that everything is alright, but then only moments afterwards realizes that this is a way to make her (future) man come there, so she can see him again. Something that did not do too much for me for example on the comedy side was almost at the ending then when Hepburn's character, when in jail already, acts as if she was some tough criminal girl or so. This moment of not just Hepburn acting but her character acting left me completely unimpressed and she should have listened to Grant's character's words to stop whatever she was doing because it won't have any (positive) effect. I must also say that there almost none of the supporting actors really contributed any true quality here or made the film a better watch one way or another. There were exceptions like a sexually awkward moment between an old lady and the major, but these were not as frequent as they should have been for the film to really win me over. This is a bit disappointing because the longer the film goes, the more supporting characters show up, but (almost) all of them are utterly forgettable. I don't blame the actors, but rather the writing here.Nonetheless, the outcome is a thumbs-up for me here for sure and without major hesitation. It was never in doubt I would see this as an alright movie and there is no way I would give a negative recommendation here. I still think that other films from this era and especially other films including either Grant or Hepburn deserve to be seen first before you go check this one out. Nonetheless, I applaud the movie theater who decided to bring this film back to the big screen for two screenings only I think. The first happened when I was there, the second will happen on the penultimate day of the year 2022. Seeing it once is enough for me though, maybe even once in a lifetime is enough. In the end, nothing stays truly memorable here and even I as an animal lover did not see too much quality in the scenes with the different animals. I think it was also not just the leopard and the dog, but another later on briefly. It is a film that feels fairly typical for its era. Sometimes, it even had a touch of Three Stooges to it and one moment that stayed in the mind there for me was when Hepburn's character (deep into the second half already) pulled the savage leopard with her leash and made a brief statement of discomfort about the wild animal refusing to cooperate that literally could have been right out of a Three Stooges (short) film. The entire scene afterwards in the jailhouse could have been out of something like that almost. So yeah, this film is never about drama, but always about comedy mixed with romance, even if the latter only from Hepburn's character's side until the very end really. Maybe this lack of drama is why the Academy Awards ignored it. I myself, however, am glad films like this are still shown (or again shown) on the big screen and it was nice for me to see that the screening I was in attracted a really great amount of viewers. This is how it should be for the recent tendency/trend to continue, the one of many movie theaters showing classics again. I suggest you check out \"Bringing Up Baby\". There's worse (and better) ways to spend 100 minutes of your time. It's also not really necessarily a film that must be seen on the big screen. About as effective on a television or laptop screen too. Just go for it.",

            "content": "Like many of the classic Screwball comedies of the 1930s, Bringing up Baby features a male/female duo of opposite personalities that through a series of zany events, end up together at the end. Cary Grant plays David Huxley, an awkward, bumbling paleontologist who is hoping to secure funding for his museum. Katharine Hepburn is Susan, the niece of a wealthy woman, who is witty, confident, and looking for love. There are too many classic screwball elements in this movie to point them all out, however a select few are particularly notable. The most hilarious screwball scene is at the restaurant where David rips his coat and Suzan subsequently rips her dress. They hurry out of the restaurant and David calls, \"I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody,\" a recurring funny line of Huxley's when Suzan is preoccupying his time. Later in the movie, Mr. Applegate imitates the leopard call while over for dinner at Elizabeth's, not assuming one would be outside, and then Baby approaches Applegate much to his horror. This type of plot irony is typical for screwballs and it works wonderfully. In regards to the Hayes Code, there are some noticeable elements of censorship. For example, Suzan says, \"jeepers\" instead of a profane word and David threatens to barge into the bathroom while Suzan is in the shower, but reconsiders immediately. Overall, this film is well-paced, constantly funny, and wonderfully performed by Grant and Hepburn.",

            "content": "One problem in appreciating a comedy like this is you have to approach it with the right mindset. 20 years ago, I would have insisted that Animal House is a much funnier movie. But once you understand the conventions of the 1930's and 40's--particularly how people dealt with issues of sex (specifically, how they repressed their sexual desires)--the screwball comedies of that era are hysterical. Repression screws you up, man. That's why they're screwballs. To get the humor requires a level of maturity and knowledge that most teenagers simply don't possess. Sexual repression is something adults do. Kids are like, \"hey, want to see my ass?\" Animal House is like your crazy id battling against the superego of Dean Wormer. Bringing Up Baby is the exact same conflict, except it's all bottled up in the character of Cary Grant. This woman is driving him crazy. She's stalking him, she's ruining his career and his wedding. She's trashing his life. And he's so polite and chivalrous about the whole thing. And his id is screaming, \"let me out! let me out! I want to strangle her or have sex with her or both, anything, I'm going crazy all bottled up in here.\" So Grant is starting to stutter. This battle, this little war between his id and his repression of his basest desires, this is what makes Bringing Up Baby the epitome of the screwball, and a brilliant film. When I was young I didn't laugh at this. Now it puts me in stitches. It's funnier every time I watch it. Hawks is a genius.",

There are very few laughs in this film, maybe two, and both of those were ad-libs that Grant brought in. I cannot for the life of me understand why anybody would think the script fine! It is tedious, with the gags very broad and so drawn out that they continue for several minutes after the punch line has already occurred. The bit about the leopard's mating cry is atrociously dumb and unfunny and goes on literally forever! Cary Grant is a wonderful performer and he does his best here but it can't save the flick from being a turkey. Evidently the writers fell in love while working on the script - too busy getting off with each other to turn in a decent job perhaps? The script stinks! It's no surprise to me that people didn't rate this film when it first came out nor that it languished for 20 years until Bogdanovich revived it. It is DEFINITELY a case of Hollywood revisionism (as Jadedalex put it) that this third-rate nonsensical caper is now somehow regarded as one of the best movies ever made. That claim is far, far funnier than anything in the movie! I watched this film today, well aware of its reputation and eager to catch a great film classic. I was very disappointed and was left feeling completely bewildered by the (belated) rave reviews. The condescending person on here who assumes that people who don't find the film funny are lacking in film knowledge is completely incorrect. Personally, I love old movies from the 30s and 40s and understand the differences in style and so forth. But unfunny is unfunny, regardless of genre, time period, style, or whatever. The best thing about the film is Skippy, the terrier who also starred as Asta in the Thin Man films, and is a wonderful lively presence; his scene playing with the leopard is adorable. Skippy also has some of the best lines: woof, woof, woof. Far wittier than 99% of the human dialogue. It bothers me that people think is a great film.",

Grant plays the nebbish paleontologist much against type and Hepburn to that point in her career had no comedic chops. These elements kept both performers off-balance and this unevenness contributes to the comedic mayhem. Although to the modern audience most scenes involving Nilsa II, the leopard \"Baby\" of the title, clearly reveal themselves to be wipes of the cat added in during editing, there are enough actual scenes of Hepburn stroking the beast to produce some real frights. The movie maintains a degree of freshness lacking in most other films of the era because of certain daring chances it took for its time; the most memorable of these involves Grant opening a door dressed in a silky woman's robe and proclaiming: \"I just went gay all of a sudden!\" This line elicits shocked titters even today and must have been a right scandal back in the day.

The way that it is written makes the audience feel like they are in on a secret joke. Every time that Susan says, \"Oh, now don't you worry David, everything will be alright\" is really suggesting that the movie is a world where no consequences exist. Evidently, this sort of life philosophy would not be tolerated by the Hays Code, but the writers were able to get around this, somewhat ironically and humorously, by having Susan respond in such a way after seemingly harmful things happen, like Baby escaping. The humor in this film is also enhanced by the seemingly opposite characteristics of David, who is somewhat timid and likes \"quiet\", and Susan, who is a much more loud, in your-face person. The different personalities of these two is hilarious to watch in their interactions with each other and with those around them. For instance, when David is taking a shower and Susan takes his clothes in order to keep him at the house longer, David's reaction (he becomes angry and puts on a fluffy, woman's robe because he can't find other clothes) is very funny and could only happen because of Susan's action. Another effective scene that seems to get around the Hays Code is the famous scene where they (Susan and David) both end up ripping parts of their outfits after the other person stepping on it (Susan the back of her dress). David has to get very close to Susan in order to leave the building with her without people seeing the back of her dress. This closeness for a prolonged period of time appears to be against the Code but is brilliantly justified by the dress situation. By and large, this film was very fun to watch and definitely had the audience of the time laughing and feeling like they were in on a secret joke against the industry!",

And many of the times Cary Grant's Dr. Huxley has a joke, he is totally oblivious to the hilarity of his actions/words. Katharine Hepburn really shines as Susan Vance, her playful manner really adds to the effect of her character. The interaction between the two is also incredible. The chemistry is there and it makes the film fun to watch. So many people do not know what they have missed. I wish I could have gone along as a passenger on a journey like theirs. I have no doubt that I will watch this movie again and again and again. 10/10, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, etc.",

It combined Katherine Hepburn, who had never done an out and out comedy before, with Cary Grant, who was known for his debonair leading man roles.  But director Howard Hawks struck casting gold and set out to make Bringing Up Baby the screwiest comedy ever made.  The stars barely had time to catch their breath as they raced from one wild situation to another.When production was finished, RKO felt the film was too frenetic for audiences.  In fact the studio considered shelving it altogether.  When RKO finally released Bringing Up Baby into theaters, the film lost over $300,000.  Hawks was fired from his next scheduled film, Gunga Din and Hepburn bought out her RKO contract and returned to Broadway.However, with the coming of television in the 1960's and the advent of VCR's in the 1980's, Bringing Up Baby finally found its audience.  The film quickly won a reputation as one of the funniest movies ever made and became known as the quintessential screwball comedy.  In 1990, Bringing Up Baby was selected for the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as one of the most important films in American cinema history.I could never understand what was so great about this film.  I think that the acting is poor and the storyline is quite weak, if not believable.  What is the big deal with this film?  Maybe I just need to see it more...or maybe I've seen it enough.

            "content": "Directed by Howard Hawks / Comedy / Not Rated / 1 hour 42 minutes Written by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde / Released February 18, 1938 Review by Jesse MerrittThe main character is Dr. David Huxley played by Cary Grant. Carey brings David to life. David is a Zoologist who is focused on his work to the exclusion of all else, this has the effect of causing him to be extremely forgetful. His focus on his work causes him to be at odds with Susan Vance (played by Katharine Hepburn) time and again. Mr Grant does an awesome job, he becomes Dr David Huxley. Susan Vance is a ditsulfritz, she's nuts. She falls for David right away and she lets nothing stand in between her and winning his love, not even his impending marriage. David is tricked and controlled continually by Susan into all kinds of crazy hi-jinks; she is truly crazy. She causes David to be crazy too! She doesn't do anything out of meanness or spite and by the end of the movie whether David falls in love with her or not, you most certainly will.The movie is has three other well known actors. They help the movie come to life and become believable, even though it is totally unbelievable. We have May Robson who plays Mrs. Carlton Random, Susan's Aunt. Of an interesting note Mrs. Robson was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 for, \"Lady for a Day,\" only to lose out to Katharine Hepburn before they made this film together.Charles Ruggles, who had in the course of his life appeared in over 100 movies, plays Major Applegate close friend to Aunt Elizabeth (Mrs. Carlton Random). In this movie he only adds to the fun of the movie by his total confusion from the moment that he meets Susan and is never able to keep up with the goings on between her and David.There are more wonderful character actors in this movie, but I don't have time to mention them all by name. I would though like to mention Baby. This film would lack a lot of its zing if it were not for Baby, Susan's pet leopard. Please take time to watch this movie, you will love it. We rented this movie online from vudu.com, and as a family we all sat down and watched it. We were two or three minutes into the movie before the whole family was rolling with laughter. This being said, if you do watch it and like it, here are a few more movies you may want to watch. \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", \"All in a Night Work\", It's a \"Mad Mad Mad World\", \"Merrily we Live\", \"My Man Godfrey\".These make great family entertainment because you don't have to worry about the content such as: is it too violent, is there too much sex, or does it have foul language? If you like screwball comedies you will enjoy all these movies and agree they are well worth watching even though some are in black and white.",

            "review_title": "1938 Review: \"Breathless, senseless, and terribly, terribly fatiguing\"",
            "content": "That was penned by Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times back in March 1938, who added \"If you've never been to the movies, Bringing Up Baby will be new to you - a zany-ridden product of the goofy-farce school. But who hasn't been to the movies?\" Well said, Frank.Plot in a nutshell: Paleontologist Dr. Huxley (Cary Grant) is looking forward to two things: completing his reconstructed dinosaur skeleton and getting married to his fianc\u00e9e. But then an incredibly clueless and irritating woman (Katharine Hepburn) forcibly inserts herself into his life and frustrates his plans at every turn, including using a leopard named Baby to accomplish it.Another reviewer here said it well: 'irritating isn't funny.' And my goodness, Susan Vance (Hepburn) reaches the apex of irritability. Let's review: she plays Dr. Huxley's golf ball and refuses to listen to his attempts to point out her error. Come to think of it, that 'trait' (refusing to listen) appears over and over, to the film's detriment. She takes his car (and smashes it up). She rips his overcoat. She steals someone else's car and says 'oh we'll return it later.' She steals his clothes while he's showering. She lies to him about a leopard attack. And for a topper, she kidnaps him so that he can't get married to his fianc\u00e9e later in the day. Is this humor? Or is this stupidity? Wow.So many times I wanted to insert myself into the film and stop the insanity, for that's what it was. Screwball is one thing, but annoying to the point of maddening is quite another. And unfortunately, that's what this film has, in spades. Gladly I am able to say that it improves greatly once some other characters get involved with the story, especially Mrs. Random, Major Applegate and Constable Slocum. Their varied storylines help to detract and reduce the antics of Susan and they nearly save the film, almost. If I were to watch this again - unlikely, as I write this - I would skip the first hour and wait for the supporting players to get involved. They breathe life into what was a taxing chore to watch up to that point.I was not surprised to learn that 'Bringing Up Baby' did not fare well at the box office or with the critics of the time. It had all been done less annoyingly before, and better, and would be done better again. For proof of this, check out 1941's \"Love Crazy\" with William Powell and Myrna Loy - a nearly forgotten 'screwball' comedy but way, way funnier than this film.6/10 - Has it's moments but the aggravation factor weighs heavily against it. 2nd half better than the first. Would I watch again (Y/N): - only in parts.",

First, Katherine Hepburn just is not right for this part.  It is almost impossible to buy her as a scatterbrained psychopathic stalker.  Its not that she doesn't try hard.  She has several moments of truly inspired acting.  She is just wrong for the part on a deep level.  Compare this part to her part in The Philedelphia Story and you will see what I mean.  Which leads me to the second problem.  Is it just me, or is Hepburn's character completely insane?  Cary Grant should be running from her in abject terror, not going along with her hairbrained schemes.  Which leads me to the third problem.  I just can't believe that Cary Grant could fall in love with this loony woman!  Finally, Cary Grant has to work very hard to not be suave and debonair.  Just putting a pair of glasses on him doesn't suddenly make him a nerd.  He's Cary Grant for pete sake, not Jerry Lewis.",

That kind of danger is not funny.  I was also bothered by the Katherine Hepburn character; she was too scatterbrained to be believable.  Katherine Hepburn looks smart, acts smart, and obviously is smart.  She doesn't make a believable airhead.  When I try to watch this film, I never crack a smile.  What a waste of talent.",

Chaos ensues as David and Susan go on a hunt for the bone (\"It's rare. It's precious...\") .. throw in David's fiancee - who rather naturally doesn't understand what the fuss is about and just wants to get him to the alter; a dog that lives to dig up bones; some fun supporting characters and you have one of the most tightly paced screwball comedies around.. Classic scenes include David and Susan starting an evening impeccably dressed for cocktails and ending the night - via some lovely slapstick - barely half dressed... the pair singing \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby..\" appallingly (well Hepburn is dreadful and on the evidence here you would hardly believe Grant made his screen debut singing his first lines..) to an escapee leopard ... and my personal favourite (and a scene featured in The Celluloid Closet): David answers the door in Susan's silky bathrobe and faces a deluge of questions about his attire to which he finally replies that he \"just went gay all of a sudden!\" (proving just how long it's been since the word's meaning wasn't ambiguous).. The pairing of Grant and Hepburn works marvellously, the comic timing is faultless and sparks fly - something director George Cukor realised when he paired them up in 1936 for Sylvia Scarlett then reunited them in Holiday the same year as Bringing Up Baby and then The Philadelphia Story two years later. The supporting cast has a lot of fun but the leads appear to be enjoying the whole thing the most and the writing is strong enough to withstand much repeat viewing - and there's plenty of time to speculate about that lost bone..(eg. is it symbolic of David's lost masculinity?!)... Directed by Howard Hawks (who was intermittently brilliant and dreadful) it's one of his best and a film that makes you go all misty eyed swearing that \"They just don't make 'em like they used to, do they?\"That leaves just one question really... What on earth is an \"intercostal clavicle\" and where the f*** would it go in your average dinosaur skeleton?! Answers on a postcard please...",
