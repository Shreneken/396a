            "content": "If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend, as others have pointed to in the past, City Lights is the one. Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off. The film centers on three characters- the Tramp, the quintessential, funny homeless man who blends into the crowd, but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman (Myers, a fine performance in his own right) from suicide, and becomes his on and off again friend (that is, when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill, one of the most absorbing, beautiful, and key female performances in silent film), who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money, which leads to a (how else can I put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull. Though there is no dialog, the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again (the last scene, widely discussed by critics for decades, is moving if not tear-inducing). And it's never, ever boring- once you get along with the Tramp, you find the little things about him, the reaction shots, the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this, or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). Truth be told, if this film makes you indifferent, never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film, you may find it's one of the most charming from the era, or perhaps any era.",

            "content": "City Lights (1931) **** (out of 4)Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and sets out to help her. The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk (Harry Myers) and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he loves.Chaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made. Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but I'd also argue that it's one of the greatest love stories, if not the greatest. It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.I think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and there's really not a weak spot to be found here. Being 1931 it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound. He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point. The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point. The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success. The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water. In fact, the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own. Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film. What's so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really delivers.Chaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here. Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you can't help but be impressed with the actor. Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together. Then you've got Cherrill who wasn't a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughout.CITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history. There's really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's Masterpiece...and Oh Those Last Five Minutes!",
            "content": "Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\" a masterpiece. It's only 81 minutes long, but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies, and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm's length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says \"Yes, I can see now\", the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.Chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story, and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade. He had already made the classics \"The Gold Rush\" (1925) and \"The Circus\" (1928) starring his character, so it's obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time. The advent of talkies didn't stop Chaplin from making this \"Comedy Romance in Pantomime\" (as he subtitled it), as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a well-mannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down, even going to prison for love. It is this self-delusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl, played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill. Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film, as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable. Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale, Chaplin's leading lady in \"The Gold Rush\" and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill, as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the \"wealthy\" gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight.Of course, this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes - the rising and lowering of the street elevator, the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub, the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene, which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers (and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra, inspired by an earlier Chaplin short \"The Champion\" from 1915). Even a simple moment, for example, when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine, is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment. And special mention needs to go to Chaplin's musical score, where he beautifully interweaves Jos\u00e9 Padilla's \"La Violetta\" as his love theme.The transfer to DVD is very good, and the 2-DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality. The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film, and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the long-forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then. The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long. The 10-minute home movie of Chaplin's trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise. Regardless, the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplin's reputation as one of the world's leading filmmakers.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's Classic of Humor and Humanity",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it.  Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's \"little tramp\" character makes two acquaintances.  He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide.  In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help.  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film.  \"City Lights\" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh.  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once.",

            "content": "Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights, and the results are spectacular. The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights, and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes, the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant. City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked. Yes, you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene, but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really don't matter. Besides, let's keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago. Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp, and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk. His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious, but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol. This is truly a great film, which should not be forgotten.",

            "content": "I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as \"talkies\" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the \"eccentric millionaire.\"There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It's hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single Academy Award.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.For me, this film falls not into the category of favorite films (I'm a Marx brothers kind of guy) but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important movies.That's because it has two features that I truly appreciate.It is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible. Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work. Not so with a small list of projects from Welles, Kurosawa, Eisenstein, ... and this one project of Chaplin's. They are wholly original, springing from some nether world.But the other element is the one that impresses the most. This film is about itself, about the art of visual narrative. Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new. The issues are centered on what the audience `sees,' so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees, he builds that into the fabric of the story.The primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing' him in her own way. Then `sees' him at the end in a different way. The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not. Nearly all the jokes, indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic: the elevator which is not seen but then was, the burglars the same, the Tramp on the statue, on the barrel. Even seeing the cigar before the bum does. Even us seeing the soap and the foreman not.The `seeing' is carried over to `hearing' with the politician and whistle jokes. And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows' us something else: he writes and conducts an amazing score instead. This is truly amazing (and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriously).No wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made. But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative, my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downey's (and to some extent Depp's). Comic timing is something that evolves, and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to see.Trivia: Chaplin found the `blind' girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw. She's pretty as well of course, but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew. See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight (a performance) and her reaction to his performance in the film.",

            "content": "As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside. While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot. However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn \u0096 if the two of them can sober up long enough.In response to seeing some modern trash posing as \"comedies\" recently (Little Man, Norbit, Pluto Nash \u0096 I'm looking at you) I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time \u0096 a few Chaplin films being among them. City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start. As was often the case, this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic. And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.The statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that \u0096 support him \u0096 but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character, while Myers, Garcia, Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.City Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent set-pieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead.",

MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn't make a bad movie, and I'm not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it's a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin's little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It's a monument to understated sentimentality.To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it's that ending that makes us all love this movie.",

            "review_title": "True Blind Love",
            "content": "CITY LIGHTS (United Artists, 1931), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889- l977), is a silent comedy-drama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad, Chaplin gambled with this production, and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH (1925) as the one movie he would most want to be remembered, CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time, practically places his other silent masterpiece, THE CIRCUS (1928) to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time, balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama, but in Chaplin's case, pathos.Subtitled, \"A comedy romance in pantomime,\" the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city. After the unveiling, the crowd finds a little tramp (Charlie Chaplin) sleeping on the lap of one of the figures. As he tries to climb down, he encounters one problem after another. This opening scene alone is priceless. With such a great beginning, Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot. The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramp's love for a blind girl. However, there is a subplot, involving the tramp's involvement with a millionaire drunk, which, by far, takes up more time than the sentimental love story. These two segments actually set the pattern. First segment, set in the afternoon, finds Charlie walking down the street, examining a nude statue in a shop, being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing. He encounters a beautiful blonde girl (Virginia Cherrill) selling flowers. After she drops one of her flowers, Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it, thus, realizing she's blind. Smitten by her beauty, he picks it up and pays her for it. Minutes later, the slamming of a limousine door is heard, with the girl believing the kind gentleman, Charlie, to be a millionaire. Second segment, set at night, finds Charlie encountering a drunk (Harry Myers) trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Just as Charlie is about to save him, he in turn falls into the river. The drunk, in gratitude for saving his life, takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn. By morning, the millionaire, now sober, fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion. This running gag that's repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious, but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges. By day, Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when she's not at her usual corner selling flowers. Finding that she's ill and being cared by her grandmother (Florence Lee), whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction, Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs, ranging from street-cleaning to fighting in a boxing match. Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind, Charlie gives the girl $1,000 for an operation, the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire, who, after sober, accuses Charlie of robbing him, has his arrested and serving jail time. The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missed.Featured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman, Allan Garcia, Albert Austin, and Hank Mann. While much has been discussed about Chaplin's performance, his co-star, Virginia Cherrill, as the blind girl (no name given), should not go without mention. Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers, and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor, Cary Grant, her performance is excellent by all means. Although it's been said that future film star Jean Harlow (1911-1937) appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence, she is visible in a surviving still photograph, but no such scene appears in the finished product. Unlike THE GOLD RUSH, CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years, and was never allowed to be distributed to television. Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York City's revival movie house, The Regency Theater, formerly located on Broadway and 67th Street, in 1979, the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience. There was one man, probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories, whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film. No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else. Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy, and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in 1931.After Chaplin's death in December of 1977, CITY LIGHTS, along with his other silent features, were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure, but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplin's 100th birthday, 1989. In later years, CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (TNT) in the early 1990s, American Movie Classics up to 2001, and finally Turner Classic Movies. The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself. Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years. To learn more about the making, difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS, either watch Kevin Blownlow's 1980 documentary, Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, as narrated by James Mason, or Brownlow's other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplin's career, including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrill's temporary replacement, Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in THE GOLD RUSH.

And there are several reasons why this is so for me.I love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.Overall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The tramp is kind-hearted, always dignified. He's a simple soul who in \"City Lights\" tries to help out a young blind woman (well played by Virginia Cherrill). This is a silent film, of course, but the tramp's body language is his speech.The really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life. He's more or less ignored by many, laughed at by others. The girl's grandmother never \"sees\" him at all. And only when the millionaire is drunk does he \"see\" the tramp as a friend. Curious ... and deep.The tramp gets into his fair share of trouble, but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl. The boxing match is a hoot, and very well choreographed, as are all the skits. And what a beginning for a film, with city leaders spouting gibberish, probably as Chaplin's dig at the \"talkies\". Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance ... just terrific!Melancholy at times, the film's music really tugs at your heartstrings. Maybe it's sentimental and manipulative. But given the abiding and Zen-like qualities of the tramp, some sentimentality is quite appropriate. And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot action.Production design is sparse and at times drab. That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obvious.Comedy here is simple and effective. The main character expresses heart and humanity. The little tramp is an unforgettable character. And \"City Lights\" is a wonderful film.",

            "content": "The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first full-length talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that, far from being an embarrassing failure, became the fourth-highest grossing picture of the year, being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer, writer, director, editor, composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin was of course primarily a comedian, and his humour was of broad appeal, but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy. The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front, and the ever-popular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound. What makes Charlie stand out, and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era, is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary, empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy. Of all Chaplin's silent pictures, City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes. The number of classic gags here is fairly small. Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence. City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance, but it's a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter. Within this story, the comedy becomes functional, often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone. Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights real.As if to snub the talkie, City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative, even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedy-driven moments. Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated, which gives the picture a continual smoothness \u2013 another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card. Out of necessity Chaplin's technical approach is more overt than his usual. He often cuts to a close-up to give us a necessary reaction, and there are even some whip-pans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet, but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture. Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment, and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvre.But what really makes City Lights work, what makes it connect, is the man himself on the screen. Those additional close-ups, once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body, now show off a capability for intense facial acting. An older, more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive, but his own career trajectory was entering new ground, where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal. The result is profoundly moving.",

            "review_title": "A cinematic triumph ... a universal masterpiece ...",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was the greatest film-maker of all-time \u0085 and only two words are enough to measure up the greatness of his talent and its cultural significance in Cinema's history: \"City Lights\", a title that resonates in my heart as the most inspiring triumph of the human spirit. \"City Lights\" is not just a film; it's a cinematic gift from a genius, who sublimated the simplicity of the pantomime to create the greatest and most universal romantic comedy that ever enchanted the silver screen.The universality and emotionality of the film have remained intact, and continue to provoke the laughs and the tears of movie lovers all over the world even after 80 years. It's an incredible achievement because it stood the test of time and transcended the geographical barriers when other classics are more appreciated in a sort of sentimental and magnanimous way, as if we're trying to repress the feeling that some elements have obviously dated. But Chaplin's film hasn't dated because it chose to be dated from the start, at the time of its release. It was a silent movie in the talking era, when all the fans were enthusiastic of hearing shouts, screams, cars, declarations of loves, bad-ass dialogs and all that new stuff, Chaplin, in an admirable confidence, did what he did the best, the pantomime, the only language that could fit for the most fascinating cinematic character: the Little Tramp.And what could have been a timely weakness quickly became the film's ticket for immortality. 1931's audiences applauded the film as a celebration of humanism that could never be imitated again. And only a movie with no words could have touched the hearts of so many people in the world, precisely, during an era where laughs and cheers, trust and optimism were needed. It didn't take a political or a denunciative approach to inspire the hearts, only laughs, cheers and the depiction of the most beautiful and valuables virtues of humanity. No speeches needed, words were as meaningless as these hilarious squawks we heard at the beginning. This gibberish talk is Chaplin reminding us of the futility of words, and we trust him. Maybe, dialogs make you miss the essential in a film.Antoine De Saint Exup\u00e9ry, who wrote \"The Little Prince\", said: \"One sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes.\" I guess for Chaplin, who shared the same humanism of the French writer and pilot, you could translate his view on dialogs by this paraphrase : \"One sees well only with the eyes and the heart. The essential is inaudible to the ears\" No need for words but in \"City Lights\", our ears are enchanted by the beautiful \"flower girl\" melody, and sadness and happiness that inhabit the film has never been so graciously embodied. And while we float in this atmosphere, the action that follows is the tribute of Chaplin's comic genius, his body language and facial expressions are so rich, so fragile I can imagine my inner child being amused by this film, while I'm moved as an adult, by the purity of the character who wants to help this blind girl who sells flowers. \"The Little Tramp\" is the quintessential clown without a make-up and a true hero, a word often overused, but not in this case.The Tramp is a hero because of his altruistic nature. He's apolitical but indirectly highlights the social gaps in the modern cities, without letting the film fall into political denunciation. He saves a rich man who wants to commit a suicide and after having developed a fondness for him, the rich makes him discover the world, amusements, dance clubs, parties, all the decadence of the bourgeoisie where the Tramp obviously doesn't fit. But he stands, as a friend, and uses the friendship to help the blind girl who believes he's a rich man. It's the myth of the Charming Prince revisited by Chaplin, through a character driven by his heart. And despise this nobility of spirit, he's constantly bullied, hit, misunderstood. And this is where resides the sadness of the film, the struggle of the Tramp in this journey into the injustices of society. But he's a man, who gets hit but hits back, never remaining a victim, victims are helpless, the girl is helpless, if he becomes so, she has no salvation, the girl is his inspiration, and the only one who never harms him in the film.And boy, how many hits did he get ... of course, I'm referring to the hilarious legendary boxing scene ... probably one of the greatest Chaplin's moments. It has the format of his short stories, but here it does have a particular meaning, since we know what drives him to do so, he wants to get the money to pay the rent for the blind girl, his challenge is our hope, and we hope he'll get it. And as the ultimate tragic hero, not only he'll help her, but he'll get enough money to cure her blindness, before going to jail, rejected by the same rich friend who gave him the money. Rich are so rich, they're perverted by money, and treat friends as they deal with valuable things, but things have no value, love, feeling and generosity have.And the value of these things are illustrated in one of the greatest, if not the greatest concluding scene ever, where the blind girl, now cured, after giving the rose to the Tramp, understands that he is the \"rich man\", the Charming Prince who haunted her dreams. The Tramp is anxious, and timidly asks her if she can see now. The answer of the girl and the breathtaking concluding smile of the Tramp create the most beautiful and inspiring ending ever. Because she had just realized that she saw the essential, which ironically, was invisible to the eyes.",

            "content": "City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 5/5 stars from me.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films, this is one of the best, along with \"The Gold Rush\" and \"Modern Times.\" Two stories are woven together. One is Charlie's on-again off-again friendship with a wealthy drunk. The guy has a case of multiple personality. When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts. When he's sober he doesn't recognize Charlie at all.The second story involves a pretty, blind flower girl who, given certain distances, angles, and lighting, resembles Uma Thurman. Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs.Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy, he's sober and won't support Charlie's story. Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail. When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel, broke and bitter, he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands. The happy ending.There's sentimentality in the story of course. There often is in Chaplin's later films. But, as usual, it's somehow tempered. Here, it's undercut by irony.When Charlie meets the wealthy toff, the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him. He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope. He's about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes, gives him a pep talk, and changes his mind. His spirit revived, the rich guy spread his arms to the sky, dropping the boulder that falls on Charlie's foot.And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl, she's enthralled by his gentleness. Unseen by her, the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail. Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills. Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain, himself enraptured. Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlie's face. Well, it's not the blind Mr. Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W. C. Fields' general store, but what is? A note. There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film, not counting the Dempsey-Tunney debacle, but I don't think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here.It's hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this. Black and white, and silent. Applause, please.",

Our poor little tramp? Nobody is better at combining tragedy and comedy better than Charles Chaplin was.This is a fact I have mentioned in previous Chaplin reviews and this is something all the movie lovers have probably noticed.City Lights (1931) is one great example of those movies where comedy meets tragedy.Take the scene with the Eccentric Millionaire for example.He is there ready to jump into the water when our little tramp wanders to the spot.Soon they're both in the water.Comedy meets tragedy, laughter meets tears.I could mention plenty of other examples but you can see it all by watching this movie.If you already have, watch it again.It's a true classic that will not age.And the acting performances...they're all superb.Besides Chaplin there is Virinia Cherrill as A Blind Girl.She is so beautiful...such a good actress.And then there's Florence Lee as her grandmother.Harry Myers is fantastic as the moody millionaire.And so is Al Ernest Garcia as his Butler.The Keystone Kop Hank Mann plays A Prizefighter.The big man Henry Bergman is known from other Chaplin films also.Here he plays the Mayor/Blind Girls downstairs neighbor.Jean Harlow can be seen as an Extra in restaurant scene.The original music made by Charlie himself is masterly.Chaplin didn't want to give up silent pictures.And why would he have? Things could very well be told without words.He did use some simple sound effects in this film and then Modern Times (1936).City Lights is filled with memorable scenes like when Charlie goes boxing.And when he goes dancing drunk is hilarious.And let's not forget the ending.The ending is beautiful.",

            "content": "Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia.  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project.  While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable.  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.Since film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  I don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance.  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful.  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  Maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer.",

            "content": "Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema.  Coming up through the ranks, he gradually achieved a god-like stature, being awarded total control of every facet of the production.Not only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be (as in \"The Kid\") but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process.  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days, weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even (in the case of \"The Gold Rush\") cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over again.He cleverly duped chief studio- and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his free-wheeling and gross inclinations, thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hit-and-miss schemes and trial-and-error \"madness.\"In other words, Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush, with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases.  Fortunately, he was a genius, and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagence.It was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging, and there were no set rules.  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium -- and Chaplin helped to establish its early parameters.He was certainly and autocrat, yet that doesn't really matter when it comes to film works.  It's the product that counts.  In the case of \"City Lights,\" all the blood-sweat-and-tears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort.  Now that all the frustration, anger, and outrage associated with the behind-the-scenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past, what remains is a genuinely moving film classic.\nSometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship to forge them into being.  The greater the achievement, often the greater the challenge and period of endurance. Whatever the case, we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork, which takes its place besides \"Modern Times\" and \"The Gold Rush\" as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions.",

Filmed during the height of the Great Depression the situation of life in America has never been caught like this before.The Tramp is hoboing around town doing whatever odd jobs he can find. One day during one of his outings he meets an attractive woman who has an eye sight problem. Smitten, the Tramp vows that she'll see once again. So, he does whatever he has to do to get this young woman to see. He befriends a wealthy drunkard after he saves his life. The problem is that he only recognizes him when he's sloshed out of his gourd. What really moves this film is the great lengths that the Tramp will put his body through for love. When the final scene is shown, you'll understand why many people (including myself) have called this one of the greatest films ever made. Pure magic.A true masterpiece.",

The meeting of the flower girl in \"City Lights\" took over three hundred takes before it met Chaplin's approval; one of the many fascinating bits of history offered on the DVD extras I enjoyed today. Virginia Cherrill was a twenty year old, recently divorced socialite who didn't share Chaplin's work ethic and might have been replaced in the picture by Georgia Hale (\"The Gold Rush\") if so much of the picture hadn't already been filmed. Knowing that, and re-watching some of the more poignant scenes in \"City Lights\", makes it seem all the more incredible for knowing that Chaplin and Cherrill didn't really like each other.This is the story of love between two lost souls in the big city, a theme dear to Chaplin as the silent era in pictures was coming to an end. Movie fans, entranced by Al Jolson's \"The Jazz Singer\", were newly hooked on talking pictures, so Chaplin's decision to keep this film a silent was a controversial, if not an economically dangerous one. However the fans reacted wonderfully to the story, the final scene conveyed in a manner to bring tears to one's eyes and a melancholy lump to the throat. Few closing scenes in a movie can match it for impact, and it remains memorable even after eighty years of film making.For my part, I always get a kick out of the little things in a picture. This one had me hitting the rewind button to catch The Tramp's reaction to the newspaper boys near the beginning of the story. After that little dust up when one of the boys pulls the finger off Chaplin's glove, you can catch the quick flip of the bird he gives to the boy on the left. It's done very deftly and without hesitation, and you'll wonder to yourself - 'Did I just see that'?I haven't watched a lot of Chaplin's work up to this point, but with every film of importance I see, I'm led to others that will give me an even greater appreciation of the talent and hard work that went into the making of cinema's best. Chaplin's on the list now, and I'll be searching out his other noted pictures in short order.",

Basically the Tramp (Sir Charlie Chaplin, also directing), broke and homeless, stops a drunk and Eccentric Millionaire (Harry Myers) committing suicide, and they become friends, well, at least until he sobers up. The two of them go drinking and partying together, the Millionaire even gives the Tramp his Rolls Royce, and one day walking the streets he meets a poor blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), and she believes him to be a millionaire, so he just goes along with this. To earn some money and help out his new love interest pay her overdue rent money, or face eviction from her apartment, the Tramp gets a job sweeping the streets, which he quickly loses. He is then approached by a man who offers him a high sum if he can beat another man in a boxing match, which of course the Tramp fails to win, and it looks like the poor Girl is to be evicted. However, the Tramp meets up with the Millionaire who cheerfully gives him a $1000, which can pay for both the rent, and an advertised eye operation for the Girl to gain her sight back. He is accused of stealing this money from the Millionaire and goes to jail, and months later when he released he searches for the Girl, who is looking for the Millioanire who has been so good to her. In the end the pair find each other, the Girl with her eye sight restored runs a flower shop with her Grandmother (Florence Lee), and seeing him she knows the Tramp isn't rich, but it doesn't matter, it is a happy ending as they both hold back tears. Also starring Allan 'Al' Ernest Garcia as the Butler and Hank Mann as A Prizefighter. Chaplin is still wonderful as the lovable Tramp with his slapstick comedy moments, great facial expressions and the famous waddle walk, and Cherrill makes a marvellous love interest. It is a beautifully told story with both very funny moments, but also surprisingly emotional scenes involving the tragic blindness using depths of pathos, a magnificent silent comedy romance. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.

            "content": "Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote, performed, directed and scored one of film's finest masterpieces.The story is about the \"Little Tramp\" befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich. Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the woman.In an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy. Drunk, dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty, a comic ballet. Chaplin's performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent. By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession. Some sound is used sparingly (brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard) but no intelligible words are uttered. The track and Chaplin's score is lyrical, energized and integral. The film is perfectly constructed.In the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment, saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale. Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to.",

The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.The plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.City Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone.",

After the almost-continuous comedy of The Circus, his previous movie, the lulls in comedy found in City Lights to advance the plot and develop the characters come as a bit of a shock. Even a let-down. But they are worth it, as the movie builds up to an incredibly emotional final scene. Plus the breaks from the comedy make the comedic scenes even more impactful.An absolute must-see.",

This is Chaplin at his most unabashedly sentimental, but darn it if it doesn't work like a charm. This feels the most dramatic of the Chaplin films I've seen, with the most \"plot,\" but that doesn't mean there aren't wildly funny bits, like Chaplin's brief stint as a boxer.

Charlie Chaplin plays his trademark tramp who is sneered at by anyone who isn't blind or intoxicated. Virginia Cherrill plays a blind woman who sells flowers on the corner. Smitten, Chaplin purchases a flower. Harry Myers plays a drunken millionaire on the verge of suicide until Chaplin prevents it in his usual hilarious slapstick fashion. Thankful, he invites Chaplin to his mansion for partying. Unfortunately when sober he doesn't recall his new friend. This frustrates Chaplin who attempts odd jobs in order to help the blind woman with her rent as well as an expensive eye surgery that would gain her sight. This leads to more hijinks particularly when he makes a failed attempt at boxing. Chaplin plays off a desire to please despite the fact that the blind woman believes him to be rich. Cherrill as the blind woman proves to have a heart of gold. Florence Lee plays her concern grandmother who help her with the flowers arrangements. Myers plays off the recklessness of alcohol. Al Ernest Garcia plays the stern and often confused butler. Chaplin's best work presents a theme of putting the needs of others first as well as give the words of a touching closing line, \"I can see now.\" Score: 10 / 10",

CITY LIGHTS deserves to be rated among the ten best American films ever made. It is Chaplin's ultimate triumph as actor, writer, director- made even more remarkable by the fact that the film, a silent, was released into a market saturated with sound films.Chaplin's tramp is universal- he understood that speech would mar the tramp's simplicity and appeal so there is no dialog used in the film. Chaplin delivers one of his most emotive and effective performances as the Tramp. There are many classic Chaplin scenes to enjoy in CITY LIGHTS- the famous \"spaghetti streamer\" scene, the tramp saving the millionaire from suicide, the final moment with his sweet flower-girl love who can now truly \"see\" the man who has helped her regain her sight. It is a beautiful film. I'll take a leaf from Chaplin's book and leave my comment here- no mere words can describe the wonderful experience that CITY LIGHTS gives to the viewer.10/10.",

            "review_title": "The most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had",
            "content": "By 1930, the silent era was coming to a rapid end. All doubters thinking that the 'talkie' craze would not last were having a wake-up call, and silent geniuses such as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, were potentially seeing their highly successful careers melting away. Chaplin began work on City Lights back in 1928, yet a troubled and stressful shoot caused production to run until 1931, when Hollywood had all but given itself over to the new talkie era. Refusing to let go of his most famous creation, The Tramp, Chaplin endured with his vision and kept City Lights silent, seeing no hope for his beloved character in sound pictures. Chaplin shot sporadically, seemingly around one central, and very simple, idea, and managed to create his greatest work, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.After a chance encounter with a poor, blind and humble flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), The Tramp falls in love. Smitten, he sits down by the sea where a drunk and eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) is trying to commit suicide. The Tramp opens the millionaire's eyes to life's simple wonders, so the millionaire treats him to life's luxuries, getting him extremely drunk in the process. After a memorable night, the millionaire sobers up and throws the Tramp out, where he spies the flower girl being visited by a doctor. Desperate to make money for her, he takes a job a street sweeper and gets involved in a winner-takes-all boxing match. Yet everywhere he goes, the drunk millionaire is there ready to whisk him off on another wild night.The juxtaposition of the two central stories in City Nights is relatively strange in terms of relevance to the narrative. The film is clearly a romantic one, which makes it peculiar when it repeatedly cuts to the Tramp's escapades with the millionaire. But Chaplin seems to have incorporated this for two reasons, and two aspects that Chaplin is remembered and adored for - comedy and social commentary. This is Chaplin's most laugh-out-loud film, with the standout being the scene in which the Tramp and millionaire, both highly intoxicated, arrive at a formal party. The Tramp walks across the dance floor, slipping in unfamiliar shoes, trying desperately to stay on his feet. It's a five- second gag, but for me it incorporated all of Chaplin's breathtaking physical ability and subtle energy. Every moment seems like an endless maze of possibilities for Chaplin, squeezing instants of virtuoso out of simple things like lighting a cigar or eating spaghetti.The Great Depression had recently struck the country, and Chaplin uses City Lights as a gloomy insight to the lives of the people hit by poverty. The blind flower girl seems to have nothing, yet is rich in soul and spirit that the Tramp is uncontrollably drawn to. The millionaire is emotionally vacated - miserable, angry and intolerable when sober, yet boisterous and care-free when drunk. By contrasting the poor girl with the empty millionaire in his lonely mansion, Chaplin is championing the human spirit over material wealth, a beautiful sentiment brought to life by some fine scenes of comedy, and a profound statement given the harsh, demoralising times. This no doubt was one of the key factors that led to the film's surprising commercial success, with a hungry and unemployed audience given a sense of hope through Chaplin's magic.It is the most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had - frequently hilarious, awe-inspiring and exquisitely moving. Although Chaplin would carry on making movies and make another masterpiece in Modern Times (1936), this is the last great 'true' Chaplin, his farewell to the era that served him so well. The final scene is the work of a true craftsman, a moment of sheer beauty. Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen it, the close-up of the Tramp's face overcome with emotion is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever come across, and it is easy to see why this scene is now so widely celebrated. A simply magical experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Filmed mainly during 1930 for an early 1931 release, CITY LIGHTS stands as a sort of stubborn display of Mr. Chaplin's determination to stick by the Silent Film form. Charlie still preferred a protracted sight gag to 2 pages of scripted \"jokes\".The project had started out to be a \"Talkie\", but somewhere between the start of the shooting and a dispute with his Leading Lady,Virginia Cherrill, the plan was revised in favor of the old way, the method that the Chaplin Company knew and even had been innovators in so many aspects of the Siilent Form.Following his tradition as a sort of Traditional, Classic Story Teller, his cast is credited with portraying characters with no names. The credits in CITY LIGHTS, as in so many of his films up to the 1st true \"Takie\", THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940).The story in a nutshell takes us to the City, any Metropolis would do. The city scape looks much like a huge tank of tropical fish, with the various inhabitants scurrying to and fro, going to thousands of destinations, all moving at variable speeds. The fellow next to you is barely visible to you as you are to him.On occasion, usually quite by accident, two of our urban denizens \"collide\" one way or other, and things slow down enough for some meaningful interaction.The first such occurrence happens when The Little Tramp meets up with a beautiful, young Flower Girl(Leading Lady, Virginia Cherrill), who he soon discovers is blind. Because of the proximity of some Limoseines, the Girl mistakenly believes Charlie to be a Rich Millionaire(and that's the best kind!) The Tramp is obviously smitten by the Girl, and his heart also sympathizes with her affliction.A chance meeting with an intoxicated Millionaire(Harry Myers), who befriends The Tramp, and is his best buddy. There is nothing that he won't do for Charlie, unless of course, he is Sober! When the Millionaire is not under the influence, he does not know the Tramp, nor does he remember whatever promises he made to him! Following a meandering odyssey of menial jobs and incidents follow, in which Charlie both helps to support the Girl and her Grandmother, but at the same time, has hopes of saving up money enough money in order to send her to Europe and a cure for her blindness! In getting the money, The Little Tramp winds up in prison for a \"Robbery\". Once released he is back in the City, where he again meets the Girl.It is at this point that Chaplin gives us his most unusual ending, is not one of the most different wind ups in film History. (If you don'y know what I'm talking about, JUST SEE IT!!) All of this serious talk might lead one to think that there is no humor here. Far from it, as we have a most impressive array of out and out comic action and great gags ever seen, and together in one movie! A few good examples (without giving it away)follows: 1. The opening scene of an Official, White Tie Dedication of a new piece of Public Art*, a new Sculpture in a City Park. 2. An extended bit of interplay between Sanitation Department Street Sweeper(Charlie) and some large animals. 3. The Boxing, the Prizefight between Professional Boxer, (Hank Mann)and the Little Tramp! (about the funniest thing on the screen!) This is one rare Movie, being so well liked by the Public and the Press Boys alike! When the people(Box Office)meets such as written by the Movie Critics(The Film as Art), we are left with a truly, one of a kind only, Comedy Masterpiece.THANK YOU, SIR CHARLES, and may THE LITTLE TRAMP Rest in Peace.NOTE: * Which reminds me: QUESTION: What is the difference between Obscenity and Art?ANSWER: A Federal Grant! (I know it's not germane to the discussion,but the \"Art\" reference brought it up in my mind.)",

It's ironic how the passing of silence liberated Chaplin to a point where he could fully express his pantomime genius and find, at long last, the elusive tertium quid between laughter and tears. Was there ever a more unpredictable companion than millionaire Harry Myers, matching the Little Tramp drink for drink until the sober light of dawn revealed the callous Jekyll behind his generous Hyde? And was there ever a more heartbreaking moment than the final, devastating close-up, when the once blind flower girl confronts the shabby vagabond she thought was her handsome young benefactor? \"I can see now\", her poignant last words, leave more unsaid than Chaplin would later be in the habit of leaving, and however unintended reveal striking insight at a time when every other movie was saying, \"I can hear now\".",

Every time I see a new movie coming out that is touted as the greatest thing since sliced bread, plastic and microwave technology, I sink deeper into an unspoken depression because this movie has not surged forth as one of the truly sublime creations of the entire film era.It's simplicity cloaks a recondite whole that few will admit to understanding.  Yet Chaplin speaks in an easily understandable language: the speech of human movement and emotion.To say that Chaplin was a master is understating the breadth of his gifts. He combined comedy with pathos, added a hefty dash of physical comedy and threw it all into a bowl of drama.  Deep, personal drama.  The kind of drama that envelops our daily lives but we are too aware of the rest of the world to discern it for its full worth.  The result is a delicious meal perfectly and equally suitable for a gourmet or a gourmand.Many mistake his brand of comedy for vapid sentimentality.  But they are missing the reality that life is full of sentiment...pure and noble sentiment.  Chaplin's passion is universal and it has lasted for nearly a hundred years -- there is no doubt that his brand of life's basic truths will endure until there is a new heaven and a new Earth.CITY LIGHTS mixes the very best that Chaplin had to offer.  A gentle story, comedic interludes, human tragedy and a sense for the grandiloquence in the most innocent and tender emotions that humankind can conjure.SIDE NOTE:  One of Chaplin's gifts was his musicmaking.  Although I treasure all of his creations, I am glad that IMDB.com finally headed my suggestion and gave credit to, Jos\u00e9 Padilla, the Spanish composer of the famous \"Flower Girl' music as it should be.  The correct name of the song is \"LA VIOLETERA\"; which means the \"girl who sells violets\".If you treasure human feeling and human comedy in all its veils and ramifications, CITY LIGHTS is the movie for you.10+/10",

The Tramp does so by depending on the largess of a carousing millionaire whose drunken debauchery at one point convinces the girl (Virginia Cherrill) that the Tramp is in-fact a wealthy benefactor and not just a homeless Tramp eager to find love.Effortlessly funny in the way that only Charlie Chaplin can achieve, City Lights has the audacity to once again give voice to the voiceless while being a treasure trove of timeless comedic scenes. There's something about Chaplin's unabashed humanism and sincere romanticism that strikes a cord that willing audiences won't soon forget. While the best of films can make you jump for joy or shed a tear, City Lights and the genius of Chaplin can accomplish both within the same reel.While some may not be keen on silent films, Chaplin's Tramp persona has achieved cinematic immortality through his universal appeal as a struggling but always chipper, limber and silent vaudevillian.

The movie features jumping, falling and climbing, as you would obviously expect from a '30's slapstick movie.I must admit that a few of the Chaplin movies don't live up to their reputations but this one on the other hand really does. It's certainly one of the best comedies of the '30's and of all time. A true timeless comedy classic!But as you would expect from a Chaplin movie, it also is a movie with lots of heart and humanity. No matter how crazy the movie gets in parts, the movie never loses any of its credibility when it comes down to its drama and pureness. The movie is also made in a more realistic style, rather than a comical one that clearly and also predictably builds up toward a comical situations.

            "content": "When City Lights started production in 1928 it was merely another Chaplin silent comedy, but after the turn of the new century it was the odd one out. Although The Jazz Singer provided a watershed moment for sound in film the year before, it contained only a few minutes of actual synchronised sound and still relegated most of its dialogue through traditional intertitles. By 1931, however, the majority of Hollywood had made the shift, ushering in the age of talkies and never looking back. It is no coincidence that Chaplin makes reference to his lone stand in the opening scene of the film, where dignified city officials host the unveiling of a new statue and attempt to address the adoring crowd, only to have their words morphed into screechy, kazoo-like nonsense (Donald Duck would come a few years later). The bit is more a playful wink and less a jab, as part of a wider career that demonstrated Chaplin's mastery of pantomime and its endurance well into the talkie era. The Tramp's mere presence upsets the proceedings, and they all rush to capture him, but not before they freeze in the insanity to salute the national anthem and flag. But even Chaplin recognised the importance and value of the new innovation, and in doing so crafted a film that was perfectly attuned with its sound. Consider an early gag where he admires a statue in the window from multiple distances, moving forwards and backing away. Chaplin renders a simple move into a tightrope act, flirting dangerously with the panel in the sidewalk, fluttering his eyebrows, and the score rises and falls along with him, pausing when he does to consider his next possibly fatal move, leaping when is at the pit's edge. Likewise you can feel the symphony almost jump up in surprise as the Tramp drunkenly stumbles backwards and straight into the comfort of the couch. Later as he attempts to re-enter the millionaire's mansion the track times its flourishes with the blows of the butler, then zips as he lurches and wheels around and through the open door. One of the funniest gags of the film is purely sound based, and the way in which Chaplin takes a one-note joke and extends it much further is a testament to his absolute control of body movement while maintaining his nonchalance. The more he tries to convince us that he is fine the more he hiccups and sounds the whistle, waving his arms and protesting his innocence, and as he staggers outside to clear his throat, the horde of taxis and dogs summoned is the cherry on top.The Tramp was Chaplin's defining character, instantly recognisable by his bowler hat, toothbrush moustache and knack for stumbling into trouble when he didn't need it. His entire existence was a rebellion in itself, and through his attitude, dress and stature, the character defied limitations of both physical and class. In an early scene he trudges through the sped-up bustle of the city, and is picked on by two newspaper boys. Although the Tramp is taller than either of them he doesn't use it well, and in attempting to rise up pompously and puff out his chest he actually shrinks himself. The move fails because it is uncharacteristic of him; he never won by directly going head-to-head with his enemies, but rather waited for an opportunity to slip away or fumble into a victory. Though Chaplin would portray him for one more film, he never made the Tramp talk, believing the character communicated in a universal language of gestures and expressions that needed no further clarification. By the time Chaplin finally embraced dialogue he was no longer a charming vagrant but a man speaking with defiance to a nation and world in turmoil. Chaplin wasn't as daring or adept technically as Keaton, but he was a performer, and in City Lights he finds himself taking on other forms without completely abandoning his classic charm or sense of who he was. His world of pantomime was all about exaggeration and cartoonish proportions; see the way he waddles down the street with his cleaner cart and sticks hands on hips at a parade of horses, the way he puts his entire body into jerking back and yelling into the telephone for the police, and in the iconic boxing match, so pitch perfect in its timing that it is less a fight and more a choreographed dance. Chaplin's perfectionism ensures that it unfolds in one fluid take, and the movements are so practiced that it seems as if he simply rewound the footage. In Virginia Cherrill's blind flower girl the Tramp found his poetic opposite. Simple conveniences involving him scrambling through a car door and the owner returning a minute later set up the illusion of his wealth. They are destined for each other because he is a poor bumbling fool and she can't see it - the drunk millionaire the other figure able to look past his rags and find the nobility and kindness in his heart. Detractors of sentiment might attack their romance for retreating from reality, but Chaplin showed how funny and misguided this ideal was in the big city - he's still grinning from their brief encounter, only to be showered unknowingly by her bucket of water. He may be cunning, but he's not invincible to the times, and once again finds himself in rags and on the streets. It is a credit to Cherrill that she leaps off the screen with an undeniable presence once her eyesight has been restored, and we recognise the same pureness that the Tramp exemplifies. That is why he takes the plunge and reveals the truth about himself, smiling shyly behind the flower. Like the film itself, it is a brave move in its climate, and like the hand-in-hand walk at the end of Modern Times towards an uncertain future, we are right there alongside with him.",

            "content": "Chaplin edited, wrote, directed, and produced City Lights over a three year period. He initiated the film just before releasing The Circus, and he released it in January of 1931. Talking pictures were all the rage at the time, having been in vogue for a few years at this point, so it's no surprise that Chaplin at least added sound to City Lights, albeit in a limited capacity. The film is deceptively simple both in its plot and in its construction. Chaplin the perfectionist used hundreds of takes once again to get scenes right. As in The Gold Rush and in The Circus, Chaplin used an unknown female for the lead: Virginia Cherrill, who would become one of Cary Grant's wives a few years later. City Lights was Cherrill's debut film, and she and Chaplin did not get along. Chaplin even tried to replace her with Georgia Hale, his lead from The Gold Rush, before realizing it wouldn't be practical. Oddly enough, Cherrill's career lasted only fourteen films.The film contains all the Chaplin trademarks: Comedy, great editing and performances from the entire cast, pantomime, pathos, perfect timing, sight gags, and a wonderful feeling at the end. A blind flower girl, played by Cherrill, mistakes a tramp for a rich man. The tramp then feels obligated to help the girl. As usual, the plot of Chaplin's film is paper thin, but its execution is what matters. Along the way are many comic highlights including the opening statue sequence, the sidewalk scene with the nude sculpture/statue, saving the millionaire on the waterfront, the spaghetti noodle restaurant scene, and of course the famous boxing scene derived from his earlier film: The Champion.Chaplin composed the music for this film, and it is the first time he composed the music for the original release of one of his films, although in later years, he composed scores for several of his earlier films and re-released them. The music is quite memorable, and it's perfect for this film. The cinematography and editing are terrific; oddly this would be the last original film Chaplin would edit. The last ten minutes are cinematic perfection and may well be one of the most recognized scenes in the history of cinema. Although the ending itself is ambiguous, the scene is very poignant and moving. The camera dwells on each character's face for just the right amount of time and their faces express everything. Without words, Chaplin gives us one of the greatest endings in motion picture history.The four principal actors, aside from Virginia Cherrill, enjoyed long successful careers in silent films and then in talking pictures in small parts with the exception of Florence Lee, the girl's mother. This was her last film. Hank Mann, Chaplin's opponent in the boxing match, was the last surviving member of the original Keystone cops. Albert Austin, one of Chaplin's regular actors, appears in his last film in a couple of bit roles. **** of 4 stars.",

The movie is part a long stretch of movies where Chaplin plays his beloved tramp character who doesn't go without his wild adventures in the city, but in this movie he meets and eventually falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) who lives with her grandmother (Florence Lee) and their living situation isn't the best in the world by living in a crappy apartment. Meanwhile The Little Tramp meets a rich man (Harry Myers) who is trying to kill himself because he is all torn up over the end of his marriage and feels as if he has no more purpose in this world and ends up getting his life saved by Chaplin and to show his gratitude he wants to be friends for life with the Tramp. then there is a scene in the movie where the tramp is at the girl's house and they're just talking and he finds an eviction notice in the record player that her grandmother left in there so no one would know, opens the letter and reads it to the girl while breaking down in tears as he's reading it, he then cheers her up and offers to pay the rent but he does more than that by also paying for her to get an eye operation so that she can see. I have watched four Chaplin films so far with the other three being \"The Kid\" (1921), \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), and \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947) and with all of these films the one thing that each of them have in common is that they are all masterpieces. Chaplin along with Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa was a notorious perfectionist and settled for nothing but the best by any means necessary which a prime example would be when he fired the actress who played the blind girl in this movie only to hire her again. The movie has been remembered as a true classic and still holds up with cinephiles everywhere and filmmakers praising such as Orson Welles calling it his favorite movie of all time and Woody Allen saying that it's Chaplin's best movie. The best thing about Chaplin's movies is not only that he can make you laugh real hard every chance he gets but he can also balance that with brilliant dramatic elements which is what made the greatest filmmaker of the silent era.",

Right! Howls and heart tugs. Follow the battered derby and shuffle along with Charlie to that happy hunting ground of his own creation !One of the most eloquent and sensitive films ever shot , due to Chaplin's keen balance between comedy and tragedy . Chaplin didn't always achieve the difficult double of successful comedy and hit pathos for which he often strove , but this movie , released silent after almost three years in the making , was a triumph for him on both fronts . Chaplin gives an awesome and sympathetic performance as a tramp who triumphs over adversity , including some comical set pieces in all Chaplin's distinguished contributions to the cinema. Here delivering his ordinary trade mark : A tramp with toothbrush mustache, undersized bowler hat and bamboo cane who struggled to survive while keeping his dignity in a world with great social injustice. His scenes with the blind flower girl are genuinely stirring and the sequence in the boxing ring one of the most hilarious in his long career. This is a vintage flick much in the fashion that sound films offended his pantomimist's sensibilities . Chaplin also composed the score which incorporates the charming tune : Flower Girl Theme with music by composer Jos\u00e9 Padilla.The motion picture was masterfully directed by Charles Chaplin .This was one of the longest ones to that date . Chaplin previously directed 2 or 3 reel short movies, such as : Our hero, The fireman, Night at the show , The adventurer, The floorwalker, The cure , The inmigrant , The circus , Burlesque on Carmen , among others . After that , he made long feature films such as : The gold Rush , The kid , City lights , The great dictator , Monseur Verdoux , Limelight , A king of New York and his last one : A countess from Hong Kong .

His interactions with a drunkard, a very funny boxing match, a flower girl's love are so well interlaced that never for a moment is a laugh lost or a smile broken.

Each time he meets the flower girl, she welcomes him hilariously, each time he is away from her, he does something extremely funny. The romance is just filled with expression of eyes and it is so very subtle. I must say the whole movie is like a poem with sublime lyrical beauty. It's very fluid as the scenes just flow. I surrender myself to the genius as Charlie Chaplin and to a great movie as City Lights.

It is a testament to the genius of Chaplin that he has made three \"classics\" - City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times - that people argue about to this day which is the greater film. I will say that Modern Times is the most accessible of these three to the current film-goer because it's the one which uses sound most extensively, and that The Gold Rush has more classic comedic bits, but for me it's always been City Lights, as this is the film that strikes the best balance of slapstick and pathos together, where you're laughing one moment, and then greatly moved in another.I was fortunate that I first saw this movie in a film class in college. I am embarrassed to say that all I knew about Chaplin was his comedic shorts, so this was a great surprise to see City Lights. I was fortunate however, in that I had no idea what this film was about, and in what high esteem this film was held. The ending is moving and tugs at the heart. I don't know if it's the greatest ending I've ever seen in a movie (I might have to give that to Chinatown), but I love it and the movie.I don't know if the PBS Special \"Unknown Chaplin\" is floating around anywhere on video or DVD, but it's a treasure chest of surprises for City Lights fans. In it, they unearth many of the film outtakes, particularly the number of shots it took to convincingly make the audience understand why the Blind Girl thought the Tramp was a wealthy man. There's also interviews with Virginia Cherrill and Georgia Hale, and how Chaplin didn't care for Cherrill very much, and wanted to replace her with Georgia Hale after almost the entire film had been shot. They even show the final scene with Georgia Hale when she gets her sight back, and wants to give a flower to the Tramp.",

You know I often try to separate the films which have left me speechless with their haunting climaxes, and guees what? Chaplin has the most number of such films in my list. The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), The Great Dictator (1940) and Limelight (1952) are those 4 films of Charles Chaplin that left me stunned with their climax scenes. City Lights is so emotional, impulsive and generous by nature that any person with the heart at right place just can't hate it. And beyond that, can't stop crying in the those last 5 minutes when your heart will be going through a massive pain attack. That face Chaplin makes while accepting the flower in the climax is just wonderful, unbeatable and unthinkable. Believe me, i will never forget that one moment as long as i am watching films in this life. So, City Lights is another social plug-in by Chaplin but this time without any negative effects. This one is full of positiveness and kindness. With the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewy-eyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically. Charles Chaplin delivers one hell of a performance which is beyond any award trophies and critics listing. The audience will remember his act in City Lights FOREVER and that's the biggest honour any actor could ever receive. With the terrific dose of comedy and pacy screenplay City Lights passes the time quickly and you don't even get time to prepare for that heart-wrenching climax. It hits you and it hits you so hard even before you realise that it has just happened and it stays with you for a while even after the screen is gone blank. Overall, A MASTERPIECE beyond emotional measurements.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest.",

It's on Ebert's Great Films list; it's #70 on IMDb's list of all time 250 greatest movies; AFI (American Film Institute) ranks it #1 among romantic comedies.\"CL\" gives us the essential, iconic Little Tramp and a large heaping of Chaplin's gifts for physical comedy -- scenes of him impaling his pants on a statue's sword, as a street sweeper trying to avoid picking up after a group of horses only to run into an elephant, his boxing scene, getting in and out of cars, dance parties, etc.It also gives us the poignancy that Chaplin's Little Tramp specialized in, probably more than any other movie he made. The LT is attracted to a blind flower girl (roughly 20? 23? years old) and, after determining that she's blind, resolves to help her. She thinks he's wealthy and the LT doesn't correct this misbelief.The LT also runs into an alcoholic, suicidal millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide several times. Whenever he's drunk, this A$M calls the LT his best friend but, whenever he's sober, he has no memory of their relationship and orders him away from him.So there are two central characters in the movie -- each blind in their own ways to the LT -- the girl recognizes his true compassion but not his lack of wealth or low status. The A$M recognizes the LT's value and compassion only when he's drunk, never when sober. A couple young newspaper boys never recognize his value and try to torment him whenever they see him.The LT sees a newspaper article about a surgeon in Europe who's able to restore sight to those with the blind girl's condition. The LT, after many failed attempts, is finally able to get and give her the money to have the operation that restores her sight.The final scene in the movie -- in which she, with her vision restored doesn't recognize the LT by sight but does so by feeling his hand -- has often been described as one of the most moving in all film history.BTW, Chaplin also composed all the music for the film including the song, \"Who will buy my pretty violets?\", the theme played when the blind flower girl was on screen. Chaplin couldn't read or write music but he was an accomplished amateur pianist and violinist. He employed a musician to listen to his playing and transcribe it into musical notation.",

I didn't think I would be able to stand a whole film without any dialogue. I honestly didn't think that slapstick humor, to the extent that I've seen in a few clips from Chaplin films would appeal to me. Thankfully, I was more than wrong. Charlie Chaplin is not only a funny film, but it is an extremely touching film. The performances are fanastic, especially by legend Charlie Chaplin who was perfect as the often clumsy Tramp. The story was so moving that the 90 minute duration was forgotten by me right throughout the film.The Tramp meets a blind flower girl and immediately falls in love with her. On eday, he rescues a millionaire as he was about to commit suicide and convinces him to not destroy his life. The drunk millionaire befriends The Tramp to the extent of allowing him to stay at the man's mansion, use his car and even borrow money. The Tramp, one day, spies on the blind girl's window and sees a doctor by the girl's bedside and realizes that she is sick. He also discovers that the girl and his grandmother may be forced to leave if they cannot pay their rent in time. 'City Lights' then follows The Tramp's hilarious adventure to try and get enough money to save the girl and her grandmother, whilst running into plenty of trouble.Charlie Chaplin perfectly portrays the Tramp as an extremely peculiar looking and clumsy man yet also brings extreme heart and love to the role. His fantastic performance is matched by Virginia Cherrill who portrays the blind flower girl extremely well. Inarguably, both were fantastic but their brilliance is more evident due to the fact that 'City Lights' is a silent film that has no dialogue. The ability to portray an entire film simply out of facial expressions is absolutely fantastic.My expectations for 'City Light' were to see a completely slap stick humored film. Whilst there is plenty of slapstick humor, the film is incredibly touching and powerful written and directed brilliantly by Sir Charles Chaplin. The humor is plenty throughout the 90 minute duration of the film and whilst the emotion is limited, when emotional scenes are shown in the film they work brilliantly. 'City Lights' is yet another one of those films that many people underestimate and jump to speculations which turn out wrong.'City Lights' is such a brilliant film that is pretty much flawless, making for the most entertaining 90 minutes without any words uttered out of mouths! The brilliance of this film is more evident for myself, as I now wish to see more Chaplin classics! Featuring fantastic performances and a great story, City Lights is definitely one of the classics that every movie lover must view sometime in their life. It is the Star Wars of its era.",

            "content": "The ending of this movie is like an emotional Rorschach test for me. Every time I see it, I understand it in a different way. When I saw the movie for the first time, it was clear: she didn't love the Tramp, she only pitied him. It was a brutally sad ending. The second time I saw it, my opinion changed completely. I saw her holding his hand against her heart, gazing at him, remembering of all the things he'd done for her when she was blind. I decided she really did love him after all. It didn't matter about his social standing or lack of money. She saw through all of that and loved him anyway. After seeing it just now for a third time, I have a new opinion. For me it hinges on her line: \"Yes, I can see now.\"I think she says \"Yes I can see now\" because the situation is so much more complicated than just \"she loves me, she loves me not\", and she finally understands the full implications of who the Tramp is, who she is, and what happened while she was blind. She sees that the Tramp is a very sweet person who's clearly in love with her, but she also sees him for who he is: a homely, goofy, lower-class citizen. She sees that there really isn't a hope of them getting together, in the social climate of the day. But she still feels gratitude toward the Tramp and wants him to understand that she accepts his generosity and kindness. She really does love him, in a sense, because of what he did for her; their time together while she was blind is always going to be a treasure to her, but it will probably end there. I also think the Tramp realizes this, and he's just happy that she could finally see his face and understand. It really is amazing the amount of depth this ending achieves with only a few simple lines, a gesture, and some beautifully understated acting.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin is a tramp, blown hither and thither by the winds of fate in this film. The set pieces, including Charlie as a boxer and Charlie rescuing a man (George Myers as a rich drunk) from suicide are fantastic. The boxing scene in particular is the work of genius because it involves in the fight as Charlie tries to avoid being beaten to a pulp. The final scene is beautiful as the girl (Virginia Cherrill) who had been laughing at Charlie, not knowing he was the man who had extended a lot of kindness to her, realizes that he is the man who had been kind to her when she couldn't see.Chaplin's appreciation for the universality of physical comedy and his appropriation of an everyman persona as the tramp went a long way to solidifying his appeal. He created a character which was universally recognizable and many people could relate to. Making such a sympa character makes it possible for Chaplin to appeal to many people and he does. Chaplin's use of the mundane and the everyday in his movies made for scenes which were funny while also being everyday. Chaplin's placing of his tramp character in settings that many people were familiar with, and the fact that his Tramp character was an everyman, made his films attractive for many people. This film is certainly one of them.The acting from Myers and Cherrill is excellent and Chaplin also delivers a very good performance. Highly recommended and it's easy to see that Chaplin was a genius.",

            "content": "In a time when film industry was making its transition to talkies & silent films were becoming obsolete, Charlie Chaplin's City Lights entered into the theatres as a late example of its era yet in the long run, it didn't just turn out to be the greatest achievement of silent filmmaking but has endured the test of time so well that it still remains the quintessential romantic comedy.The penultimate silent feature from Charlie Chaplin, City Lights chronicles the adventures of The Little Tramp who falls in love with a beautiful blind girl who sells flowers for a living. His desire to make her life better becomes a possibility when he saves a suicidal, drunken but wealthy man from killing himself but their friendship continues to be on/off depending on his drunk/sober state.Written, produced, directed, edited & scored by Charlie Chaplin, City Lights is the pinnacle of Chaplin's exceptional film career that presents the extraordinary artist at the apex of his talents, both in front n behind the camera. From its opening moments where the film mocks the unrefined technology used in early talkies to the heartbreaking finale, this unparalleled classic is pure lyrical poetry.The screenplay is exquisitely penned down, beautifully balances the elements of romance & comedy, and each segment is properly weighed before its transition on the film canvas. The technical aspects are a work of perfection as Chaplin leaves no stone unturned to make it all work in harmony. Cinematography wonderfully captures its drama, Editing is immaculate & the soundtrack seamlessly integrates into the narrative.Although Chaplin has always been a perfectionist but what he manages to accomplish with City Lights is something far greater than any his previous works. Slapstick humour is a constant ingredient in his filmography but the precision balance he finds between the elements of comedy & romance in this feature is so flawless that it hasn't been equalled ever since. Plus, the perfect comic timing further elevates this great cinema to an even greater level.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Charlie Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill & Harry Myers, with all three leaving a lasting impression. Myers is hilarious as hell in the role of the suicidal, drunken millionaire, Cherrill brings a warmth to her character while Chaplin is at his usual best and shares a spot-on chemistry with both of them. But it's the memorable finale that marks the highest-point of Chaplin's acting career & it's just as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.On an overall scale, City Lights finds the most gifted film artist crafting his finest piece with precision, accuracy & controlled artistry and is completely deserving of its unprecedented legacy. An unforgettable example of silent cinema, an ideal blend of art & entertainment, an unsurpassed achievement of its genre(s), and a timeless treasure that's just as awe- inspiring today as it was back during its time of release, Charlie Chaplin's magnum opus comes one hundred percent recommended.",

Forget \"Casablanca\". Forget \"An Affair to Remember\". Forget \"Love Story\". (For the love of Christ, forget \"Love Story\".) This is a movie about the purest love.We have the simple, ubiquitous Tramp. He is smitten with a blind flower girl, who has mistaken him for a wealthy man. There is a new operation that \"cures\" blindness, and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight. He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed. In an era that is forgotten in modern times (pun gleefully intended), he cleans the streets of dung. (One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant.) Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girl's operation.And then, after he has spent many years in prison, the Tramp is reunited with Flower Girl.My fellow males, this is a wonderful \"Chick Flick.\" If your lady friend isn't reduced to tears by the last 4 minutes of this movie, you need to find a new lady.

For us, its one of the most remarkable films of Little Bum, the most iconic character of this actor.Visually beautiful and elegant, it has a careful cinematography and music, as well as sound effects, dispenses well any vocal addition. Scenarios and costumes were carefully thought out and created. In all the technical details Chaplin's taste and meticulous hand is visible. The comedy is created through the most unlikely situations in which the character stands, and it is delicious. Even if it fails to tease out laughs it will certainly make the audience smile. There is also a naive and pure love story that permeates the entire film, as a thread of history, and that is deeply touching.",

The music gives some dynamism and density to the film itself.The actors are absolutely fabulous and thus the story without words is quite realistic and poignantly effective. Imagine that tramp Charlie Chaplin is falling in love with a street flower girl who is blind on top of it. He is going to play the gentleman and she is going to fall for his voice and his good manners like kissing her hand. But how can he help her?In the same period, in fact the same day he saves a millionaire from suicide in the most dramatically hilarious way and the millionaire takes him home and becomes his friend when he is drunk in the evening, but he rejects him in the morning when he is sober. Difficult to cultivate a friendship in such conditions; But Charlie Chaplin is patient and benevolent. So with a little bit of goodwill he manages to benefit from this millionaire of his every night.One night though, in the midst of a burglary against the millionaire he is given one thousand dollars for the girl but the delivery to the girl is problematic because he is chased by the whole police of the City of New York and the millionaire who was hit on the head has lost all memory - of course. But Charlie Chaplin delivers the money for the rent and for the surgery, a miracle surgery in Switzerland that is supposed to giver the girl her sight back.But after delivering the money at 8:00 in the morning he is chased again by cops and this time NYPD wins and he is taken to prison for a burglary and a theft he has not committed. When he gets out of prison in a pretty bad shape one of the very first persons he looks for and he encounters is the flower girl who is no longer selling flowers in the street but is working in a flower shop. At first she does not recognize him but then she does the way blind people do, by recognizing the voice and by touching the man a little. And that's the end.Will there be a salvation for Charlie Chaplin? We do not know. But Charlie Chaplin is a great romantic who plays naivety to please an audience that is victimized by the great crisis of 1929. How can a homeless person among millions of unemployed and homeless people survive without any popular soup and Salvation Army? But even more difficult right under the fully implemented prohibition amendment how can all, the rich have all the alcohol they have and be drunk every night? But being na\u00efve is probably the only way to survive in this situation and bringing some soothing entertainment to people who have it a lot harder than Charlie Chaplin himself.Enjoy the film that is maybe slightly slow at times due to the fact it is a silent film and they have not remastered the speed, though they added a sound track.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "051: City Lights (1931) - released 1/30/31; viewed 5/14/06.KEVIN: While watching the film, it's hard to believe that the production of Charlie Chaplin's City Lights could have been more laborious and time-consuming than The Gold Rush. But Chaplin's penchant for perfectionism wasn't about to go away, and fortunately it pays off in spades here. This is surely the real best picture of 1931 (and the competition was stiff as ever). Although it's not as perfect as Gold Rush, it's still a great example of Chaplin's emotionally-rich storytelling craft, and is a slight middle-finger to the staunch supporters of conversion to talkies. The Tramp truly is born for the silent film and nothing else. In my mind, every time I tried to add spoken words to his act, the magic disappeared. Virginia Cherrill isn't the Tramp's greatest female foil, but she does bring exactly the right amount of understated pathos and innocence every second she's on screen. One of my favorite comic sequences in the film is the boxing match, a hilarious mixture of balletic violence and precise comedic timing. The final moments of the film are far superior to the rags-to-riches ending of The Gold Rush as the blind girl with her sight restored sees her benefactor for the first time.DOUG: After enduring the two-day gulag of Cimarron, we move on to the REAL best picture of '31, Charles Chaplin's City Lights. Moviegoers haven't seen Chaplin in three years (about eight months for us), and in that time silent movies had all but vanished\u0085except for Chaplin, who wouldn't let the format in which he had perfected his act go away so easily. I'd been looking forward to watching this film for a very long time, as it shows up on a great many AFI lists, not to mention there were a number of scenes I was hoping to see, especially the boxing scene, where the Tramp uses every trick in the book to keep from getting taken out by his bigger, stronger opponent. We decided to watch it twice, since we were half-awake for most of the first viewing (it was late), not to mention the fact that it really is THAT GOOD. I was surprised that this was quite a different film from The Gold Rush, with a somewhat simpler story and the romantic plot more at the forefront. It is very interesting to see how Chaplin reacted to sound pictures, using sound while not using it; at the beginning, we see people talking at a dedication of a new landmark, but all we hear is a strange buzzing sound (Chaplin blowing a bit of paper against a comb). And what more can be said about Virginia Cherrill, the lovely blind girl whom the Tramp falls for? Her performance is very understated, letting the simplest of gestures and movements tell the whole story (A screen test on the DVD shows Georgia Hale trying for the part when things got rough with Virginia, and her style is much more expressive. How weird is it that Chaplin worked with one actress named Georgia and another named Virginia?). When the ending came up, I knew what was coming, but it's still so incredibly powerful.One parallel I noticed on the second viewing: the Tramp meets up with the millionaire and makes friends with him. The millionaire treats him as his best chum when he's stone drunk, but then forgets it all and rejects him as a vagrant and an intruder when sober. No doubt our Tramp fears a similar rejection from the Girl when she sees what he really is.Last film: Cimarron (1931). Next film: Dracula (1931).",

To these people I would say, \"I feel sorry that you are unable to appreciate some of the greatest works of art ever created\".  This movie is a nearly ideal case in point.  The story is simple: the Tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl and does anything to help her.  Although there are some very funny moments, the movie is not really what I would call hilarious.  But I don't see these as flaws.  The very simplicity of the story gives it enormous impact because it obviously comes straight from the heart, and the humor is present to soften the blow of the drama and make it bearable, the exception being the very end.  Much has been said about the ending, and deservedly so.  There is nothing outlandish, nothing over the top about it: everything is very subtle, but the way that it is set up, the subtle facial expressions, the lack of dialogue, and the music all have the impact of a sledgehammer.

Suffice to say after just one film, I can whole heartedly state that the man was a comedic genius. This puts all modern comedies to shame. I laughed more watching this classic than I have done all year, and that in itself proves that this 1931 silent masterpiece has stood the test of time. A tramp encounters an enigmatic blind woman who he tries to impress. In doing so, he befriends a turbulent alcoholic millionaire and starts to utilise his wealth to win her over. It's easy to dismiss Chaplin's films as slapstick humour. An array of silly sketches stringed together to evoke laughter. This dismissal is unjustified. There is a reason why City Lights is regarded as one of the best of all time, because it makes you experience a variety of emotions. The romance between the tramp and the woman is sweet and tender. The commentary on alcoholism, although not as thematically powerful as one would've hoped for, makes for adequate drama. The misfortunes of the tramp, particularly the swallowing of the whistle and well-choreographed boxing match, create the expected humour. Then the touching final scene adds a sprinkle of melodrama to surmise the story in two minutes. It's a tale about kindness. Being a gentleman no matter how small or large your bank account is. Aside from the overlong boxing match preparation scene, which should've been shortened to keep the pace up, I found no faults. The amount of personality seeping through the screen from the characters was astonishing. Nearly every scene felt fresh, introducing new and innovative gags to maintain the hilarity. The exaggerated acting assisted in producing chemistry between the characters. Briskly paced, consistently funny and just enough drama to retain viewer engagement. City Lights is (so far) the best silent film I have seen, and a true testament to the power of silence in an era where \"talkies\" were prevalent.",

Hold on to your ten dollars and rent the Charlie Chaplin classic \"City Lights,\" a heart-warming romance and physical comedy -- where no one talks.It seems like the era and even the idea of the silent love story has been long gone and forgotten. Relationships and courtship are full of drama, selfish sexual desire and prejudices and attitudes about what's attractive. In a modern context, \"City Lights\" can be viewed as an hour and a half trip back to innocence.The already famous Chaplin returns to the screen in \"Lights,\" his first silent film in the dawn of the \"talkie\" era. Chaplin once again plays the Tramp, this time befriending a suicidal drunken rich man and taking a fancy to a blind flower salesgirl. As a social commentary, Chaplin picks on the snootiness of the upper class and their fancy parties that only mask their unhappiness, as well as championing those who are not as wealthy but don't create social prejudice. But \"Lights\" is a love story at heart.Maybe it's only because he knows she won't judge him by his appearance that the Tramp is immediately infatuated with the blind flower seller, but his unblinking kindness toward her is just heart-warming. As he tries to find the money to pay for her rent, (leading to some hysterical scenes, namely a boxing fight) you know deep down that he'll never fully be repaid for his kind deeds. That is until the classic ending that could win even the coldest of fish over with its simple but perfect execution.There's plenty opportunity here for us to laugh at the Tramp too, but it's just not what you take away most from \"City Lights.' You can name the classic comedy scenes without problem, but the impression does not follow them. It's the beautiful story of two seemingly nobodies who treat each other with unconditional kindness amidst a city of superficial and judgmental people that makes you stop and wonder. The fact that in all honesty we still search for that ideal today despite an even greater setting promoting the opposite, and that's what makes \"City Lights\" a classic. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Chaplin's City Lights has several funny vignettes, including the climactic boxing match and the scene near the beginning where one of the characters is trying to commit suicide. They are the epitome of slapstick. They're largely unvocal and entirely physical. They're unreasonably against reality, and common sense. This kind of humor can be full of laughs, or simply grin-filled appreciation.What I found the most interesting about this film, and the even later Chaplin film that I previously watched, are the mechanics of the earliest kind of cinematic storytelling. The story threads are so simple, and even close to singular. You can hardly call anything a subplot. There is a single journey taken by a character who encounters several others. I found myself engrossed by this sort of plot. Sometimes the most simplistic stories are the most effective. You really find yourself yearning for Chaplin to get the money for this blind girl's rent. The film may be light, and how can it not be? But while you're watching it, you can't treat the story lightly, which is very impressive for such a threadbare film.Also, having already known that Charlie Chaplin was a multi-talent, a performer, a writer, a director, I had no idea he'd written the score playing over the entire film's action. Most silent film scores are not as beautiful as the score in City Lights. Chaplin pumped his score full of hopeful, naive emotion, which suits the tone of the movie perfectly.",

            "content": "Making Jack Lemmon cry is a delight reserved for demented people, but---when he was alive---there WAS a way to make the man weep. Just show him the last scene of City Lights. If you can get hold of the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs TV special, you can see for yourself. Lemmon cries while describing the end of this movie. Then I cried. My wife laughed. She's such a little trooper.I won't give away what that last scene is, but it's easy to see how it could make a person bust up just thinking about it. Charlie Chaplin was certainly not afraid to hit those maudlin notes. His Tramp character was lovable enough and Chaplin the artist was talented enough to get away with milking you for every emotion you've got. Funny how some people can mix tones in the same movie and make it work so well while others can't even get one tone right.The story: the Tramp makes friends with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and works various jobs to help support her. She doesn't know he's broke, instead thinking he's a rich benefactor. Along the way he tries his hand at a few different vocations, including a hilarious attempt at being a boxer. He also parties a lot with an actual rich man (Harry Myers) who spends most of the movie drunk as a monkey. Whenever he sobers up, out goes the Tramp. No one can ever see our hero for who he truly is.City Lights is a short and pithy movie, as were most of CC's works. He knew how to tell a compact story with oodles of hijinks, a little drama, a message and plenty of feeling. The AFI definitely had l'amour for this picture, ranking it 76th and then 11th on their 1998 and then 2007 Top 100 lists. That's a remarkable leap in the span of 10 years. Do you feel that strongly about City Lights too? I'm not quite as enamoured with it as the AFI, but it's a wonderful picture. Jack Lemmon's sloppy tears are proof.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 23-minute City Lights 'cast...and many others.

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin falls for a blind flower girl and lives the high life with a lush, amnesiac fatcat, sampling and exploiting various urban lifestyles along the way. Playful and carefree, like all the classic auteur's best pantomimes, this is more of a loosely-related collection of skits than an all-enveloping story. The sidetracks are all great, of course - The Tramp and a late replacement swinging for the fences in the boxing ring, all manner of drunken hijinx in a ritzy club on New Year's Eve, slapstick encounters with a newly-unveiled statue before an outraged audience - but it doesn't get quite as deep under the skin as Chaplin's other masterpieces.That he doesn't share a wealth of chemistry with his leading lady, Virginia Cherrill (who endured a contentious relationship with the star during production), isn't so much to blame as their too-swift courtship and her disappearance during the second act. We never really get a chance to grow into loving them as a couple, though their sweet parting shot serves as proof that such spoils were within reach. Stuffed with ideas and ingenuity, City Lights still makes for an endearing, if scatter-brained, early romantic comedy.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's Crowning Masterpiece of Silent Cinema!",
            "content": "The transition from silent films to talkies proved devastating for many movie stars. Some with thick European accents, like Teutonic actor Emil Jannings who won the first Best Acting Oscar, did not weather the conversion and returned to Germany. The silent clowns who practiced the art of pantomime became one group adversely affected by the advent of sound. Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd emerged as the first casualties of the talkies. Meanwhile, Chaplin had nothing but contempt for sound films. \"Motion pictures need dialogue as much as Beethoven symphonies need lyrics,\" he said. Indeed, Chaplin saw few advantages to sound, despite the sensation that the new technology created for the industry. Warner Brothers introduced sound pictures in 1927 with its quasi-talkie The Jazz Singer, and sound propelled Warners into the big leagues with exalted studios like MGM and Paramount. Chaplin did not rush to climb aboard the sound movie bandwagon. Instead, he hoped that City Lights would revive silent movies. As the popularity of sound waxed, Chaplin grew more anxious about sound. Nevertheless, he produced his greatest silent movie comedy City Lights in 1931. He took into account, however, the impact of sound and added a synchronized soundtrack as well as his own post-production musical score. Chaplin remained reluctant to convert to sound. When he made his next classic comedy Modern Times (1936), he made it as a silent. Eventually, Chaplin converted to sound with his classic anti-Hitler film The Great Dictator in 1940. Chaplin's dismissal of sound grew out of his success as a mime. The former English music hall pantomimist created his life-long comic persona--the 'little tramp'--for the 1914 silent comedy The Kid Auto Races at Venice. Chaplin rose through the ranks at various studios until his success with the little tramp enabled him to finance his own studio. Chaplin's mute tramp appealed to everybody everywhere because body language constituted an international language. Asian audiences appreciated Chaplin's comic body language as much as Scandinavians. \"My own pictures will always be silent,\" he assured his audiences. Although he added a synchronized sound track, Chaplin ridiculed talkies in City Lights. In the opening scene, when dignitaries dedicate a monument to 'Peace and Prosperity,' Chaplin pokes fun at these pretentious people with his use of squawky sound effects. \"City Lights\" qualifies as a sweetly sentimental saga about Chaplin's trademark 'little tramp' character in his tattered evening clothes and a hat falling hopeless in love with a beautiful but blind flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill. Meanwhile, when the Tramp isn't buying flowers from the heroine and escorting her back to where she lives with her grandmother, he strikes up an on-and-off friendship with a real millionaire. According to the credits, mustached Harry Myers of \"Getting Gertie's Garter\" (1927) plays an 'eccentric millionaire.' He is eccentric because he lives alone without his wife and has only his butler to care for him. Unhappy, the millionaire either tries to commit suicide or gets plastered and goes from one party to another, even hosting them at his mansion. The Tramp runs into him late one evening when the Millionaire tries to commit suicide by drowning himself. The Tramp gets soaked for saving his new found friend and the friend reciprocates and becomes the Tramp's long-lost friend\u0097that is\u0097until he sobers up and has no memory of their friendship.In any case, the Tramp learns about a treatment that a foreign doctor has used to help some blind people recover their sight and he sets out to earn the money so that the blind girl can see again. The Tramp tries to earn the money the old-fashioned way by joining the ranks as a city sanitation engineer. In other words, he scoops up animal droppings and hauls them away. In one amusing scene, he tries to avoid a street strewn with animals, only to have a couple of circus elephants stomp up out of nowhere. Eventually, he gets fired for being late back to work after his lunch break. Next door, at a gym, he agrees to box for a share of the purse and his opponent agrees to share. Things take a turn for the worse, when the guy has to leave unexpectedly. It seems that the police are after him. The guy who replaces the fleeing boxer is a dour tough guy who is a little afraid of the Tramp's efforts to ingratiate himself to him. Further, the new guy refuses to share the prize money. In one of the funniest scenes ever, we see the Tramp strenuously avoid blows with the rival boxer. The Tramp keeps the referee between them at times or gets behind the other boxer. This confusion is sheer side-splitting fun. Sadly, the Tramp loses, but he keeps trying to get the girl her money.Charlie Chaplin does a flawless job directing this sappy love story. He alternates his love story with the friendship with the rich man. The way that he meets the blind flower girl is brilliant. The Tramp is walking along when he spots a cop (cops always scare him) and he ducks into a limo parked in the street. When he comes out the door on the other side, he sets foot on the sidewalk in front of the blind girl. The Tramp falls madly in love at first sight and the limo cruises away with the girl believing that she has sold a flower to a wealthy gentleman instead of a homeless transient. There is a pretty funny dance hall number with the Tramp setting fire to a woman's chair and then her dress. However, the crowning achievement of \"City Lights\" is its weepy ending. The Tramp has survived a sentence in stir and he meets the blind girl again, but things are definitely changed. Like the short story about the woman in the arena in Rome, \"City Lights\" asks you to decide for yourself if it has a happy ending or a cynical ending.",

            "content": "\"Tomorrow the birds will sing.\"Before Raging Bull or Rocky, Charles Chaplin brought us one of the most memorable boxing scenes in film history. The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters: the tramp.Charles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.City Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it.",

Yet even despite this, I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene. If you want to impress the right kind of girl, put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final moments.As for the rest of the film, then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did, the rest of it is episodic and patchy, necessitating my relatively low score.

            "content": "City Lights is a film which is beloved and revered. And it is easy to see why. As comedies go, it may not be among the funniest films ever made. But if there is any shortfall of laughs the film more than compensates with an overabundance of charm. And it is not as if the film is totally lacking in laughs either, there is plenty of good humor here. But in this case it is the story, more than the jokes and gags, which really is the key to the film's success. That story draws you in, makes you root for Charlie Chaplin's famous Tramp. It's a beautifully unique love story which will definitely bring a smile to your face and ultimately maybe even a tear to your eye. City Lights is the brilliant result you get when you have a master of his art form at work.The simple, though thoroughly captivating story, follows The Tramp as he falls in love with a beautiful, blind flower girl. She can't see him for the lowly hobo he is, a misunderstanding upon her initial meeting leads her to believe he is a wealthy gentleman. The Tramp is more than happy to allow her to maintain that illusion. He gets some help in this endeavor from a drunken millionaire who befriends him. The Tramp gets money from the millionaire, stays in his house, drives his car. All very helpful in keeping up the ruse of wealthiness for the blind girl. Unfortunately the drunken millionaire is only friends with The Tramp whenever he is in fact drunk. When he sobers up he doesn't remember The Tramp at all. This of course causes awkward, and funny, complications. Meanwhile the flower girl has problems of her own. She's behind on the rent and, unknowingly since her grandmother hides the notice, about to be evicted. The Tramp is determined to save the day, pay the rent and also somehow pay for surgery to cure the girl's blindness. How will our shabby little hero pull this off? Chaplin is a master of his craft at the peak of his powers. When City Lights was released the era of silent films was at its end, the talkies had taken over. But Chaplin was determined to tell his story his way, really the only way a story of The Tramp could ever be told. Who would want to hear The Tramp speak? The brilliance of the character is in the pantomime, the expressions. Chaplin tugs on the heartstrings without ever saying a word. Other performers in the film, most notably Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl and Harry Myers as the millionaire, play their parts well. Cherrill in particular deserves much credit for the film's ultimate emotional wallop. But this film is Chaplin's through and through, his fingerprints are on every frame. A brilliant performer, a brilliant director. Every moment is so well thought out. Maybe the film is not outrageously funny but there is plenty of humor to appreciate. Even if you think a scene may drag on too long, like a boxing match late on in the film, you can't help but appreciate the effort that went into it. It may be a little long but the scene is undeniably worked out beautifully, Chaplin showing an absolute mastery of choreography. It is a comedy film in which ultimately the comedy is secondary. Yes, there are jokes and gags and no, not all of them work perfectly. But there are definitely enough good comedic moments to keep you entertained. But more importantly there is a story to keep you enthralled. The love story between The Tramp and the blind girl warms your heart and makes City Lights a true feel-good movie, one worthy of its status as one of the most beloved films ever made.",

            "review_title": "A Jewel in the Crown of Silent Cinema",
            "content": "The transition from silent film to sound is undoubtedly the most significant change to affect the cinematic medium. The commercial success of 1927's THE JAZZ SINGER, the first mainstream film to feature talking segments, prompted other studios to either add sound segments to already existing silent films, or create full-length \"talkies.\" The public eagerly embraced this new form, but not all were so enthusiastic to abandon mute film. Perhaps the most ardent promoter of silent cinema at this time was Charlie Chaplin. Between 1928 and 1931, the number of silent features steadily dwindled until. In 1930 and 1931, Hollywood produced maybe 4 silent pictures, among the hundreds of sound features that came out in those years. One of them was CITY LIGHTS (1931). If CITY LIGHTS (as well as Chaplin's 1936 MODERN TIMES) serve as an epilogue or elegy for the silent era, it can also be said that Chaplin's film provides a passionate and effective argument for the aesthetic and emotional value of cinema without spoken dialogue.Once again, Chaplin uses his Little Tramp character in a tale that blends humor with pathos. The Tramp makes the acquaintance of two very different characters - a pretty, blind flower girl who lives in poverty (stunningly played by Virginia Cherrill) and an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) who only remembers the Tramp when he's drunk. Chaplin, who wrote and directed the film as usual, plays off of the contrast between rich and poor, and once again his Tramp character shows humor and resilience in the face of adversity. When he realizes that the flower girl is in dire financial straits, he does everything possible to help her, and an unexpected love blossoms between the two. There are many funny scenes here - the opening scene with the Tramp sleeping on the statue as it's unveiled, the Tramp and the millionaire attempting to dance in the restaurant, the comical boxing match - all displaying Chaplin's trademark command of visual humor. The flower girl is the emotional anchor of the movie - happy despite her blindness and poverty, she takes in the Tramp as well as the viewer with her incandescent charm. Neither she nor the Tramp have much materially, but their concern for each other illustrate how love can make every life better despite hardship.The acting is superb. Chaplin could seemingly do no wrong on screen, and he shows humor, flamboyance, tenderness and warmth in his portrayal. The biggest revelation is Virginia Cherrill, in her first major film role. Cherrill is wonderfully natural, understated and charming, beautiful and luminous, the center of all of her scenes. She convincingly portrays the blind girl and contributes a performance full of feeling. The interplay between Cherrill and Chaplin at the end of the movie is extraordinarily moving and memorable. Harry Myers is funny and memorable as the millionaire whom the Tramp befriends. Chaplin always employed a rather minimalistic style of cinematography as director. He didn't care to have the camera draw attention to itself, but used it to capture the story in a way that would emotionally involve the audience. Chaplin also composed the score, and it effectively draws out the right emotions from each character and situation. Overall, CITY LIGHTS is a definite classic. SCORE: 10/10",

            "content": "A great movie with a deeply touching message about love and human frailty.I watched City Lights with a bunch of students as part of a series in a class studying Chaplin's work.  Someone asked about the dance hall scene, where Chaplin grabs a woman and starts dancing frenetically and dispassionately around the hall.  The student seemed a little confused about the meaning of that moment.  I pointed out that this was simply an example of Chaplin doing what he did best; showing how silly we look acting out our rituals.After the class, I thought about this a little more.  I think Chaplin holds a hope out to those of us not born with a sense of humor; can we find the cure for this in our lifetimes?  More importantly; could Chaplin be that cure?  I think Chaplin is something of a miracle.  On one hand, he embodies the ideal of the humorist who's just simply funny, and evades analysis.  On the other, his craft is detectable, and we can learn from it.  We can see how he sets up the joke by establishing himself as someone not to be taken seriously.  Having done that, he can then proceed to thrash away at our cherished notions of class, propriety, and overcharged \"fun\" with a kind of impunity.  And we can see him as a good sport and laugh about it, rather than cry over our individual and collective plights.A lot of humor, some drama, some fine metaphor, and, as usual, a good dose of Chaplin using film to communicate to us the images of feeling and human passion.Oh yeah, another thing about this film.  I was rather impressed by all the acting, not just Chaplin's; and it sort of surprised me.  For some reason, my expectations hadn't been programmed to be very elevated in this regard, and City Lights sort of reestablished for me the importance of expecting good work out of all the personae, even in these early movies.",

            "content": "City Lights(1931) is Charles Chaplin's greatest achivement as a filmmaker of the early 20th Century.  It belongs to the category of tragic comedy where the main character is suffering and the humor is done as sympathy.  The relationship between the little tramp and the blind flower girl is touching in the fact that he loves her to the point of having her eyes fixed.  This is not only one of the greatest films of the first half of the 20th Century, but also one of the top ten best movies of all time.  Chaplin's top three are 1. City Lights, 2. The Gold Rush, and 3. Modern Times.\nCity Lights would be one of the last films that Chaplin appears as the little tramp(Modern Times(1933) would be the last).  Charles Chaplin was one of the few directors doing Silent Films in the early 30's when most were doing Sound Pictures.  This motion picture exhibits why Chaplin along with Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd were the greatest comedians of the Silent era. The final image represents the lost love of Chaplin's little tramp. City Lights was done as the Marx Brothers were appearing in films with sound.",

            "content": "Stories that complete an entire cycle are the most fulfilling ones. City Lights tells the story of a tramp who by sheer luck befriends a drunken millionaire and falls in love with a blind young flower-girl. Both the people have different perceptions about the tramp \u2013 the millionaire only recognizes him when he is intoxicated while the girl mistakes him for a millionaire. In an effort to win the girl's heart and lighten her financial troubles, the tramp assumes the role of a millionaire, a street-sweeper and a boxer, but is mistaken by the others for a thief. The most striking part is that in one of the scenes, another desperate boxer flees from the restroom realizing that the cops are after him. But the tramp, who is the most honest and magnanimous person, is sent to jail. When the two lovers meet again, the girl, who has acquired sight with the money given by the tramp, offers him a nickel. Recall their first meeting when the tramp is the one who offers her a coin and we that the story has completed its cycle. The moment is so poignant that if one just looks at the tramp's eyes, he/she can see the various emotions experienced by him at that point.There are a few movies of Charlie Chaplin that will not work today because of the excessive slapstick in them. I remember being enervated by the abundance of butt-kicks in one of his old films that was close to unbearable. City Lights is not one of them, and here Charlie has blended slapstick, comedy, romance and drama seamlessly. The initial scenes when the tramp parties with the millionaire evokes not just humor but also pity for the tramp because we realize what may happen once the millionaire comes to his senses. We come to terms with the fact that there will be a moment when the tramp will not be aided by the millionaire and he would have to confess this to the blind girl. We still are in fits when the tramp, in fine clothes, cannot walk without slipping on those slippery floors, or when he begins eating spaghetti and takes the long strand of confetti in his mouth or the opening scene, where the tramp stomps on the private part of the statue and hangs by the sword while the anthem is going on. In the later scenes, we root for the clumsy, straggly man because we know how desperate he is. Every person, including the millionaire, the girl, her grandmother, the butler, the rich people and the tramp himself, have the human touch to them that is usually compromised in slapstick comedies.Charlie Chaplin was the producer, director, actor, editor and music director of the film and everything is done by him immaculately. The loose body movements, the eccentric gait, the wide, expressive eyes and the sparkling comic timing are applaud worthy but what is most treasured is his ability to make the audience cry. Virginia Cherrill has terrific screen presence and can emote so well I was surprised to hear she wasn't in good terms with Charlie. Harry Myers gives us two sides of his personality in very believable terms; after his drinking bouts, when he gets up and sees Charlie, he has that perfect expression of confusion and weariness. Florence Lee is touching in her short role; Al Ernest Garcia as the butler who shows contempt towards the tramp shines. The two impish kids who sell newspapers, the prizefighter, the rich people, the two robbers etc are equally memorable.The Tramp gave everything, got nothing but did get his most cherished desire in the end. And we the audiences gave City Lights not even two hours and got one of the best experiences of our lives.My Rating: 10 out of 10",

He was such a sensitive man, everything he made turned to gold it seemed.This film here is of the most chaotic of his arsenal but as always, an organized well tamed chaos at that. From the very get-go, that film is just an absolutely surrealistic highway speedrun, while never failing to make that plot exist with clarity.Here, it's the same formula: Chaplin starts from knowing absolutely no one, he comes into contact with..someone who can help him in one way or the other. Then, that girl.There's as much laugh out loud material as there is strong cinematic craft, never a dull moment despite the fact Chaplin has in places very little to deal with (still makes a hilarious science out of it). You'll absolutely find yourselves forgetting you're after all watching a fully silent film, there's so much fun on display. Ending is very touching, although indirectly inspired from Dickens' Great Expectations in spirit.Beautiful little Chaplin film.",

            "content": "After being opportune to see many of the old Charlie Chaplin classics, this movie City Lights stands out as the best I have seen him in. Charlie's films will always stand out in the history of film making as he brought something new to the silver screen. City Lights is an exceptional silent film that showed the simplicity of romance and the length of ideology any one will go to keep it, from living a lie, to going to jail all in the name of love.The final scene in the movie has been sighted by many to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. I to accept that claim, the tramp's melancholy look as all the walls of lies fall apart will touch you in ways that will make you smile; the acting that followed it was masterfully done.Next to that scene my second favorite scene is the boxing fight, if you have not seen this movie before get ready for the laugh of your life, the screenplay is masterful, the acting is wonderful and the sound effects just enough. Such scenes make you wonder what Charlie movies would have been if he had all the gadgets and money that studios are pumping into movies this days.Like other Chaplin movies, this is a slapstick comedy done in 1931. He wrote produced and directed the movie. By the time of its release talkies were already in vogue (sound) but Chaplin took a shot in the dark making this movie a silent movie, he did fear though that the reception will not be good, but this movie did well in the box office and also was well received.The story plot as others is about the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time tramp meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be blind.While the tramp was taking his leisure stroll he runs into a wealthy man, whom he befriended but the relationship was on and off, as the man will at times recognize Charlie and later forget that they know each other. The tramp on the other hand used his connection with the wealthy man to help his love as she was going through financial trouble.Holding the eleventh place in the AFI greatest film of all time, City Lights is one classic romantic comedy that will leave Charlie's name in the lips of many film goers for a long time. No matter what your take is concerning silent movies, make sure this one does not pass you by.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Chaplin excels again by delivering a bittersweet classic that mixes a good story with comedy and a timeless ending",
            "content": "Believe it or not (especially nowadays) there was a movement of actors, producers, and directors that didn't like the addition of speech to cinema. While most of these \"voices\" didn't hold much weight, they did have one frontrunner that could definitely dent the industry of \"Talkies,\" and that was Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin was so strongly against movies with dialogue, that he continued making silent movies (then eventually with sounds) way after the fad had died. Among his films that defied the industry was the charming City Lights. City Lights is a good bubbly film that has easily one of the best endings in the history of motion pictures. Combining slapstick comedy with good direction, a nice musical score, and a dosage of drama, City Lights is another tour-de-force from Chaplin.There are two plot lines to City Lights, both of them involving The Tramp (Chaplin of course). In one tale, The Tramp tries to help and win the heart of a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). In the other tale, the Tramp experiences a series of antics with a millionaire that gets drunk every evening with him, but then doesn't remember him the very next morning. Both plots mingle a few times, and complement each other as they advance the story forward. The Tramp in the latter half of the movie falls for the flower girl so severely that he begins working any sort of job to come up with the money to fix her vision.Chaplin was one of the most talented men Hollywood has ever had the privilege of supporting; the man can act, direct, write, and even compose music. The music helps make up for the total lack of dialogue and very limited sound. His story at the time was a bit original, as the lead female couldn't see, which adds a dimension of innocence to her character. She represents purity, kindness, and what's right with the world. In the meantime, the drunken millionaire represents all that is wrong. The balance between the two gives City Lights its roller coaster feel, much like the city-like atmosphere setting in the movie. Most of the sight/humorous gags were with the millionaire, while the drama was saved for the scenes with the flower girl. Chaplin himself provides all the funniest moments in the movie, especially the incredible boxing scene.With that being said however, City Lights gets a little repetitive in its jokes, which makes it overall a weaker comedy than The Gold Rush. Whether it's the joke about the amnesic millionaire, the repetitive moments of the kids spitting at the Tramp, or the scene with the chairs; City Lights has a lot of good funny scenes, but they lose flavor and quality once you see them again and again. The Gold Rush doesn't have this problem, as their gags are very varied and never repeat. The Gold Rush also has a much better cast of supporting characters, and has better cinematography.But, the one thing The Gold Rush doesn't have is the incredible ending that City Lights has. In my opinion, if you can't end the movie on a good note, you better be sure to craft a masterpiece of a flick throughout the first two acts. A great ending can save a movie, and a bad ending can utterly destroy a good movie as well. City Lights has the perfect ending for the content presented; it could not have ended in a better way. At this moment, the directing, editing, acting, and music was at its best; its as if Chaplin had saved his best efforts for last. The payoff is grand, and the tears just might stream down your face. That is, if you know what love is.Bottom Line: As a modern, bitter, out-of-the-box independent critic, I try to step away from the expected boundaries of the typical film critic; I try to not give in to the regular mannerisms of the people that get paid to criticize movies past and present. The usual film critic shall state that City Lights was Chaplin at his prime blah blah blah. This isn't the case, as Chaplin has done better work before (Gold Rush; his best work) and since (Great Dictator, a long monologue away from perfection). But, this is a good movie, and is one of the earliest examples of a spectacular ending. City Lights is better and ages better than the typical silent movie, it can hold its own with romantic comedies of today. Its charming story will keep you entertained, and its ending will leave you breathless, wondering why movies of today don't try to end in the same fashion (or at least with the same amount of effort). City Lights is a nice \"comedy romance in pantomime.\"",

            "content": "This movie is artistically beautiful--with nice cinematography, music, etc. Some of this can be attributed to this being a sound-era movie (hence better equipment) but I've gotta admit Chaplin had a great eye--the film is quite pretty and exquisitely made. There were some cute little skits and laughs spread throughout the film. During the boxing match, I barely laughed (though it was well done) and my wife almost fell on the floor laughing. However the film was able to provide a decent number of laughs---even though the story was also brimming with pathos. And wow...it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. I could say more, but I think it's best you just see it for yourself. It's not my favorite Chaplin film but it is amazingly good.One final observation about this film as well as Modern Times: While these films are firmly stuck in the past (silent movies well into the sound era), it was a smart decision on Chaplin's part to do this as well as to only make a few films he could really devote his energy into. Lloyd and especially Keaton strongly embraced the sound era and churned out quite a few films in the late 20s-early 30s--and some of them stunk when compared to their silent films. If I were watching any of these three comedians in a film from the sound era, it would definitely be Chaplin, as he didn't try to change the basic formula. Unfortunately with Keaton in particular, as MGM paired him with the very very very talkative and pushy Jimmy Durante and completely tossed out what had been great about Keaton's earlier films, his film quality plummeted.",

The shots are more still shots, but it is this dramatic performance that makes the characters more attractive.This is Chaplin's last silent movie. After all, there have been sound movies in 27 years. Unlike the intuition of sound movies, his mime performance deeply moved me.There are three main characters\nA rich man's characteristic is that he wants to commit suicide as long as he is drunk. . Because this is a person who turned up and turned a blind face when he was awake, he also laid a groundwork for the homeless to go to prison.

There are too few such people in society.

The good news is that this girl is a girl who cherishes encounters and gratitude, and has not changed her heart from beginning to end. This is also a necessary factor for a happy ending.The homeless comment is less because I think this movie is more about saving others. As far as he is concerned, he is a dedicated character. The color of tragedy can be said to such a bright person. Almost nothing, because he never felt that he was living in tragedy.\nLike he admonished the rich, tomorrow's birds will still sing, hoping that they will still exist.The cruelty of society and the warmth of humanity make up this movie, which will make people warm, and still believe that there is warmth between the cold and the cold.",

This is because Charlie Chaplin's acting and musical score were perfect. The music fits the action on screen perfectly and keeps you drawn in. Chaplin's character, a tramp, conveys his message through pantomime. The blind girl played by Virginia Cherrill was also done perfectly. The ending between these two characters is one of the best that I have ever seen. Harry Myers plays an eccentric millionaire, This part is also played very well. This character is a kind of Jeckyll and Hyde. When he has been drinking, he is the tramp's best buddy, when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him. The boxing scene is extremely funny. I won't give away any spoilers but the interaction between the two boxers and the referee is hilarious. Overall this is a masterpiece.

She did not abandon him, she did not miss the gap and out of control.\nYou know what? The tramp was there himself, and no one in the world could vouch for the girl's gracious response.Peace and prosperity. How lovely it was when the statue was unveiled and Charles curled up in his mother's arms.\nThe tramp inadvertently saved the millionaire's life, and he had capital, capital he had never had before. The millionaire wakes up and forgets the tramp; The tramp remembered his friend after drinking. This description is both dramatic and realistic.One day, Charles is watching a boxing match in LA. Sitting next to him is a farm girl named Virginia Cherrill, so Charles asks her to play a blind flower girl.\nIn fact, when we see the heroines in Charles's films, they are all similar. A woman in Paris, stage career, city light... Beautiful, the eyes are always showing light sadness. Charles plays a clown, a tramp who happens to meet them and falls in love with them, with a low status, with shallow or noble love.Charles is good at portraying the poor, and he does it in a comic way that makes the audience laugh until they cry.\nWhen the oscars invited Chaplin back to the United States to accept the award, he expressed his concern to his wife.\nIn fact, those black and white light images, still make people laugh, and then tears.

            "content": "It may be the haze of all the intervening years, but I don't think Chaplin made anything but 'Classics' from 1916-1936. You can pretty much watch anything from these couple of decades and see, if not an entire classic, at least frequent moments of brilliance. Such was the man's genius.Of this oeuvre, some items stand out as especially worthy of praise: all the full length features in this period, for example, are worth seeing today. Most live on in the work of other directors, cinematographers and actors who were influenced by these films. In fact it could rightly be said that Chaplin lives on in innumerable moments on screen and in the attitude he brought to the project of making films - raising it from a novelty to it's status as art today. No filmmaker did more to advance the art of film.City Lights is certainly one of his masterpieces. It resembles his other features from the 30's (and throughout is career) in it's utterly distinctive look and feel. Due to the unique style of directing, his absolute control of all aspects of the production and the use of his collaborator/cinematographer, Rollie Totheroh, all Chaplin films have this 'look' that the film wears almost like a brand.The most striking thing, to me, about CL, is the pure symmetry of the story. Everything is pared down to the double story of love story/infatuation and friendship/exploitation. The love story is predicated on deception, while the friendship is predicated on alcoholism. The parallel stories take place almost independently of each other. It is this lack of cohesion that to me at least makes it less of a great film than, say, Modern Times.Nevertheless, there are many great moments in the film to admire. The two best scenes, IMO, are the boxing scene which is genuinely one of the most hilarious sequences ever filmed (if you want to know where Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball and other masters of physical comedy got their chops, a good place to start is right here) and the final scene/fadeout.The ending is beyond genius, almost as if God had AD'd this scene for Chaplin, it is so profoundly moving. That said, a great ending, even one as great as graces City Lights, does still not resolve the issue of the un-meeting story lines which proceed along parallel tracks for the whole film.It is still worth your time to watch this supremely gifted physical comedian at the top of his game, and even more so, IMO, in repeat viewings. No silent actor rewards the repeat watcher more than Chaplin, as his constant, offhand improvisations often escape first or second notice and only become apparent upon repeat viewings.",

            "content": "I have always loved \"City Lights\" the best of all the wonderful gems Chaplin has made. And after revisiting it recently, still do. In fact, the more I see films, the more this one stands apart as the quintessential comedy on what not only making films is about, but loving them as well.The circumstances in which Chaplin made it are well-known, as well as the ironic use of sound. In other words the war between the image and sound that in the early 1930s seemed all but lost. But the crystallization of this concept is in how everything in the film is about seeing or not seeing. There is a review here on IMDb (\"Seeing and Being Seen\", April 30th, 2002, by \"tedg\") that I'd encourage you to read, since it analyzes this exact topic so astutely I have really nothing more to say, other than it truly is remarkable how every little thing in the film seems to be conveyed visually, be it a gag at the expense of the Tramp or the the blind girl's loneliness depicted in the birdcage.There is a fine Blu-ray for this film, released last autumn by the Criterion Collection. Had I any influence on you, I'd urge you to see it. It's a marvellous presentation of a marvellous film, and is there any higher compliment I could give any film than that seeing \"City Lights\" makes me love it more, and not only it but all film? I think you know my answer. I love you, Charlie.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the film, but looking at my record with his films- The Great Dictator is one of the best of all time and Modern Times was hilarious, while The Kid was boring, I have to say this one is just below Modern Times.I watch a Charlie Chaplin movie to see slapstick primarily and watch a very high quality silent film. City Lights is more of a drama, due to the primary storyline of the blind flower girl. The story is incredibly touching. The actors involved put on the performances of a lifetime, especially considering their off-screen relationship. But it reduced the laughs, and not once did I laugh out loud like the food machine in Modern Times. The subplot about the millionaire was funny though.I think a second viewing in the future will be very rewarding, knowing what the film really is. That's my advice to you: recognize this as a dramedy. The film will be much more fulfilling. 8.4/10",

            "content": "I am a child of the Sixties, and many of the attitudes I formed were based on essentially special moments, it seems to me. One of my parent's friends opined one evening, stridently, vigourously, something to the effect that because Charlie Chaplin was a Communist everything he ever did was therefore artistically inadmissible. There are times in life where something you hear you instantly know is either completely wrong or right. I knew then that this had to be wrong, even though I had never seen anything more than a snippet of Chaplin's work.Many of what are considered great films were not shown anywhere, not on TV, certainly not on the big screen, for most of my early life. So it is that in my recent viewing of \"City Lights\" I saw my first full length Chaplin film. And I was not disappointed.In this movie there are only a handful of main characters. Chaplin's little tramp is of course prominent, but the key supporting players certainly get a lot of screen time. Among them is the blind flower girl who becomes the center of the tramp's attention, her grandmother, and a very rich and also very boozy benefactor of sorts. The rich man's butler has a significant part. There are many, many players with brief parts.As far as a plot goes, the tramp meets the blind flower girl and of course he is able over time to appear to her as a wealthy kind-of boyfriend; he helps her when he can. He is smitten with her. In the meantime the tramp has run into the rich man, their initial meeting being the tramp's intervention in the others suicide attempt.But the benefactor has mercurial fits of memory loss and gain, so his generous gestures are at best unreliable. In the midst of the tramp's efforts to do what we would term the right thing, other confounding moments occur. Which leads us to the comedy part.In effect the tramp runs into troubles at every turn. His helpful and often unsolicited attempts make things right do not necessarily provide a real advantage for him or those about him. He does get the money to help the flower girl and grandmother, but at a price.It is fun to watch the little tramp and his antics. Chaplin could certainly do physical comedy, and his attempts at this are very honest, involving tremendous eye to detail touches in all scenes. At one point he briefly eludes two policemen; his quickness and well-rehearsed reaction is actually difficult to follow. I have read about the ending previously from a few sources, but no spoilers were among them. I appreciate this because the last few moments of \"City Lights\" deliver a terrific payoff. And its nice to know a boyhood suspicion was well-founded.Three Stars",

The ending has been praised justifiably - it is close to perfection.

But some other sequences run on slightly too long. Chaplin's own music score is wonderful, and there are sound effects (a whistle, a gunshot, a piano, etc.) which creatively bridge the silent and the sound era of movies. *** out of 4.",

But he was much more than that, and this movie attests to that. It can be seen in his movies that Chaplin carries meanings in his roles and this movie is about loving someone more than you love yourself. It's about how a kind man remains kind regardless of the mistreatment that come his way. It's about how love for someone can provide purpose and meaning in someone's life. It's about how miracles can come in the most strangest and unlikely forms. The movie is filled with laughs, joys and tears.

After rescuing a man from a drunken suicide attempt, the tramp befriends him and soon he finds himself able to help the girl get eye surgery. The catch? The rich man forgets the poor man's existence every time he sobers up.Upon my first viewing, I had no strong background in Charlie Chaplin films. Aside from \"Modern Times\", I cannot recall really seeing all that many before. And I freely admit I had a bias towards Buster Keaton, the earlier, \"better\" silent comedian. But their comedy is somewhat different: Buster is more physical, whereas Charlie seems to be more of as prop artist.Upon further review, Chaplin's work is better appreciated. We see in this film that he mocks the motion picture industry as a whole, which has now embraced the talkies; the only \"dialogue\" here is a stream of squawks, and Chaplin noted that \"dialogue is superfluous noise\". Of course, he eventually gave in, but this film proved that silents could compete -- and sometimes exceed -- the talking films. (Just as today black and white is not common, but can still have its powerful impact.)The bulk of the comedy here, besides falling down, could be called \"bait and switch\" routines. The tramp is presented with an item, and then it switches to something else (such as pasta turning into confetti). It is funny, and you have to give the film credit for keeping audiences entertained when they cannot verbally tell jokes.One of the greatest things about the film is the casting of Virginia Cherrill. Prior to this film, she was a complete unknown, and through Chaplin she was launched into the stars. Not that her name is well-known today, but she was married to Cary Grant and later George Francis Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey. That has to count for something for a Chicago native!If you have not seen much Chaplin, see this one. Almost all critics agree that it is one of his best, and this was also Chaplin's favorite of his own work. Jeffrey Vance believes it to be his \"most perfect film\".",

Regarded by most as Chaplin's best work, City Lights has some of the Tramp's funniest and most heartfelt moments. In a more developed storyline than usual, the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a rich man. While this situation provides the emotional drive of the film, the Tramp's relationship with a rich, suicidal drunkard provides most of the laughs. Both plot lines intertwine perfectly, complementing each other well. In the third act, the Tramp sets out to raise money for an operation on the blind girl. After loosing his job as a street sweeper, he enters a boxing match to try and win the prize money. The hilariously choreographed match is one of Chaplin's best routine's ever. As much as it makes us laugh, it still tugs at our heart strings when the Tramp surprisingly goes down for the count. The final scene in which the girl with her restored sight realizes that the Tramp is her benefactor is a study in bittersweet. Chaplin and the girl wisely underplay the moment, keeping it from being too sappy, but still making us care. What happens next is also wisely left to the imagination.",

            "content": "Along came the Depression and it gave Chaplin's Tramp character an extra layer of meaning to go along with his comedy. When those kids are mercilessly picking on him in the street, when he's desperately trying to swipe some food as he's being escorted out of a mansion by the butler, when he's dealing with the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde nature of the rich, filmgoers in 1931 surely must have empathized all the more with the downtrodden man. Nowhere is he more touching than when he says \"Tomorrow the birds will sing\" to talk a man out of committing suicide, or that final scene, which is stunning. Before the close-ups, the mid-distance shot of the young woman (Virginia Cherrill) reaching out to him and Charlie looking beleaguered, vulnerable, and yet happy is absolutely spine tingling, one of my favorites in cinema history.The film may seem to have less of a message to it than some of Chaplin's other great works, but it's there, just more subtle. We see him mocking Herbert Hoover's line of \"peace and prosperity\" in the opening scene of the statue dedication, and we see the heartlessness of the wealthy, one of whom climbs into his car without even looking at the blind girl selling her flowers in the street, after the tramp has given her one of the few coins he has. We see the wealthy out partying all night while people are struggling to pay their rent. Through it all we see themes of generosity, humanity, and grace in the characters of the poor. In the end the young woman can see in more ways than one, e.g. the raw truth of the tramp's frailty, shown at a time when the nation was so frail, and yet with the sense that they will persevere together. It turns out I like these types of things about the film even more than the famous boxing scene or the rest of the comedy, since they seem so pitch perfect for 1931.",

This time the stage is the city where our lovable scamp has to contend with alcoholic millionaires with bad memories, boxing opponents that keep changing and changing, grumpy butlers and enchanting flower girls.In have to admit that I find myself comparing these silent funny films to each other more than anything else. And why not, they're almost the same. They're all good, I'll give them that, but the plots are often almost identical. The Tramp is introduced, followed by some physical comedy, The Tramp meets a girl, physical comedy, The Tramp does something stupid to impress the girl, physical comedy, and a happy ending. It is all very well done, but is it any wonder that these movies start to blend with one another in my mind.That being said, this is the best Chaplin film I've seen so far. Because while the rather detached comedy sessions are still there, the central characters and the central romance are both brilliant. Harry Myers is very good and funny as the millionaire, but it's the growing and tested romance between Chaplin and the flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill that keeps us interested. Especially the ending scene, which is called one of the best romantic scenes ever. And rightfully so.They say City Lights is the one film you should see if you haven't seen any Charlie Chaplin in your life.Yeah, I can't argue with that.",

            "content": "City Lights, made back in 1930, is a love story featuring our favorite funny character, the Tramp. First time,I watched this movie two years back with my friends. That time we laughed very much. But as I was watching the movie, I felt that I have to watch this movie alone sometime to get the feel and the message of the movie. Unfortunately, I was very busy those days and couldn't watch it back then but I watched it again yesterday. And this time there was much more than just laughs I got. I loved this film. And I can challenge everyone who says A Walk to Remember or The Notebook are the best love stories! The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is introduced to us sleeping in the lap of a large statue. People, who have come to watch the giant statue, shoo him away. He is just wandering when he sees a girl selling flowers. He stops and buys a flower. But the girl drops the flower by mistake. He sees that she is looking for the flower in the wrong place and he realises that she is blind. He feels bad for her. He is also very poor and he can well understand her situation. He wants to say something but instead he leaves.At night, he sees a guy trying to kill himself. He convinces him in giving up this idea. The guy takes the Tramp back to his home. He is a millionaire and the Tramp can't figure out why he was trying to kill himself when he is having every pleasure. They become very good friends and the Tramp asks him for some money. The next day, the Tramp buys all the flowers from the blind girl. She is happy, and he is happier than her. The blind girl reaches her home and tells her mother about the millionaire customer she has had today. She thinks him as a millionaire as well as a very big hearted person. She is also having many problems at her home. The rest of the film is pretty much about the Tramp trying to help the girl and sometimes asking the millionaire for some help. Will he be able to help the girl? How will things end up with the millionaire and the Tramp? All the answers are lying in the movie further with a heart-touching ending of the film. Along will all these, there will be many scenes where there will be tears in your eyes just because of laughing.Charlie Chaplin, as most of the times, is the director-writer-producer- composer-editor-actor of the film. And he wins, again as most of the times, in everything. First talking about Chaplin the director-writer, he is brilliant. Needless to say, the story of the film is amazing. Comedy scenes are superbly written and directed and also there are few fighting scenes but Chaplin knows very well how to make them funny. And when I say funny here, I mean hilarious. Though I loved every scene in the film, but still I would like to mention a couple here: Of course the last scene in the film, then the scene where the millionaire invites the tramp for dinner and the fight scene between the Tramp and the boxer who was changed when the original had to flee and with the original one, the Tramp had a pact of 50-50 if he lets the Tramp win. Both the scenes are insanely funny. And I think I won't be able to stop my laughter even if I'm watching them for 10th time. I don't have to say much about Chaplin the actor. I will definitely fall short even if I write a page in his praise. According to me, there have been only one actor who has delivered every performance with no more scope of improvisation: Charlie Chaplin. He has played the Tramp for about forty years. To tell you the truth, I can't imagine him otherwise. I have watched many of his movies and I have loved his performance in all of them. In this movie, he is excellent. In emotional scenes also, he is brilliant. He has had a great impact on the film industry and it won't be an oversaying that he actually revolutionized the genre and the industry.Chaplin the composer does a swell job. Music changes accordingly with the requirements of the film. This is a silent movie and so music becomes a very important part. It supports the funny scenes brilliantly. The movie is black and white so there is not a question of brilliant visuals. The cinematography is good overall. About the other actors in the film, the blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill and she is very convincing in the role. Her later films didn't see much success and she dropped her film career. The millionaire Harry Myres and he is good. As required, he is very funny. He trusts our Tramp and helps him very much, with his money of course. All other actors are fine.City Lights is definitely one of the best Chaplin movies, if not the best. I loved this movie and while writing this review, going back to every point and remembering everything is making me watch this movie again. You know what? I will watch the movie again after I finish this review. There has been a lot of discussion about the movie title \"City Lights\". Many believe that \"city lights\" are allegorical for the types of shallow luxuries and excess that can be found under the lights of the city, e.g., the rich man's drinking, cars, and clothing, when compared to the life of the Tramp and the blind flowergirl. I am kinda satisfied with this theory. City Lights is a very special film for me and I will remember this film for a long long time. And I will definitely watch it many times.",

            "review_title": "A great movie, as powerful now as ever",
            "content": "I've always loved Chaplin- \"Modern Times\" has long been one of my favorite films, and I enjoyed \"The Circus,\" \"The Gold Rush,\" \"The Great Dictator,\" and \"Monsieur Verdoux.\" I can easily see how many people consider \"City Lights\" his masterpiece. It's hard to even speak rationally about this movie. It's very layered, but also very simple, and that's what I think defines a great film.The plot is easy to describe: the Little Tramp befriends a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. Then he saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and uses his money and car to make the flower girl think he's rich. However, the millionaire sobers up and forgets the Tramp; the flower girl desperately needs money to pay the rent; ultimately, after a series of comical attempts to earn money, the Tramp receives $1000 from the millionaire, which (after being mistakenly branded a thief) he gives to the flower girl, before being sent to prison. He gets out months later, the flower girl has had an operation to restore her sight, and as he stumbles about outside her new flower shop she gives him a flower, recognizes him, and the film ends.No complex subplots, no dialogue. Just a pure and simple story about a Tramp and his love. Chaplin possesses perhaps the greatest gift for changing the audience emotionally: the movie is never blunt or outrageous; I laughed out loud several times, but it wasn't explosive laughter. And I also very nearly cried at several points. When the Tramp finds he's falling in love with the flower girl he's trying to help- that made me cry. It's so touching, how the Tramp's weaknesses are his strengths. If Chaplin is a communist, then I'm a fellow traveler. The Tramp has nothing to give but his heart and his life. He goes through hell and comes out smiling. Sure, filmmakers today could learn a lot from \"City Lights,\" but so could people today: if you are human, you can learn from this movie.The movie is called a \"romance comedy,\" and that's what it is. The Tramp voluntarily undergoes several ordeals for the flower girl, but he's also subjected to a number of funny situations: the nightclub party that showcases the Roaring '20s (how he drunkenly struggles to find a girl to dance with), the millionaire's attempt to get back home (\"Am I driving?\"), and of course the classic boxing match. The Tramp is the ultimate underdog: he can never win, but there is beauty is his failure. He finds happiness in life without going along with society's standards. And he gives us happiness, too, and a little inspiration.Then, of course, there is the ending. I love Chaplin's endings. The last title card in \"Modern Times\" (\"We'll get along\") and the final shot of \"The Circus\" (makes me choke a little just to think about it) are both great examples. This ending is overflowing with tenderness. The flower girl loves her mysterious savior, and has said before that money isn't her greatest concern. But then the Tramp shows up: filthy, pathetic, and right out of jail. She laughs at him and teases him a little good-naturedly. He's a little reluctant to come to her- he stands back a little. Then she takes his hand and suddenly realizes the truth. She confirms it by feeling his arm and then says, \"You?\" and he asks if she can see now and she says, \"Yes, I can see now.\" Their expressions convey just enough for the viewer to understand completely, without being entirely able to say what they understand. You can read the thoughts in her head, and then the camera turns to the Tramp, and his face is a heart-broken, heart-fixed, strange, sad smile. The screen goes black, it says THE END, and the music continues with a flourish, ending on a bittersweet note. I think the ending lets us know that these are real human beings in front of us, not just actors. They have real lives, and those lives can be changed, for better or for worse. It's absolute pathos. You can't be entirely the same after watching \"City Lights.\"",

Chaplin opens the film with a lampoon of talkies: at the unveiling of a Greco-Roman stone statue, the dignitaries' speeches are heard only as unintelligible squawks.\nSmitten by a flower-selling Blind Girl (Virginia Sherrill) who has mistaken him for a dapper gentleman, the Little Tramp takes on odd jobs (including a prizefight, shown in a masterfully choreographed sequence) to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. After the Tramp intervenes to prevent the suicide of an alcoholic tycoon, the tycoon befriends him; but it is an on and off friendship, as when sober the tycoon doesn't even recognize the Tramp. Despite a series of mishaps, the Tramp pays for the operation. But in the process he lands in prison. On the Tramp's elease, the Blind Girl learns the true identity of her benefactor in one of the most rarified scenes in cinema.",

Like in others of his masterpieces it's hard if not impossible not to be emotionally moved. Tragedy and comedy is woven together at it's highest level of performance.I won't review the film any more than the above, but would like to make a general statement on the greatest film personality of all times. In 1999 The American Film Institute somehow managed to rank Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, James Stuart, Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Henry Fonda, Clark Gable, James Cagney and Spencer Tracy above Charlie Chaplin on the List Of Greatest Screen Legends. With all due respect of the nine mentioned, but placing Chaplin as No.10 is a meaningless parody of disgrace. Not only is he in a class of his own, he was perhaps more than anyone else responsible for making their stardom possible.\ufeffThank You!",

Nevertheless \"City Lights\" is a delightful cinema.Music is this movie is good, as well as acting and directing. The story is nice, although one could argue about lose of memory after drinking, of course i understand this is a comedy and you should't take it very seriously, yet it's not the strongest part of the movie. The joke with bird \u2013 hiccups was also a bit too long. Overall, \"City Lights\" is a good movie for the fans of Charles Chaplin. It is not as good as \"Modern Times\" (these are only two movies i saw with this great comedian yet), but it is a good movie overall. There are many classical Charles Chaplin moments, and boxing fight scene is great one. Many comedy scenes are still working, this is universal humor, although some of them are a bit dated now. The story is simple, but one shouldn't be watching Charles Chaplin movie for a story. Overall, 8/10.",

            "content": "To most 'City Lights' is their favorite Charles Chaplin movie. It is said to be the great auteur's personal favorite amongst his movies. I might be the rare individual in this case - 'City Lights' is not my favorite for some reason. Although, I can consider this as his BEST movie. Perhaps, because here the Tramp character is most nuanced than ever. And the writing is the most complex and complete Chaplin has ever achieved. Physical comedy is precise - just look at that fight scene (I wonder, were Buster Keaton jealous of that?). There aren't many stand-alone gags, every joke is there to move forward the story or develop the character. Funny and touching, but the most important is (one of) the message the movie carries - only an outcast can help an outcast. Psychologically and philosophically 'City Lights' is much more complex than its slapstick exterior shows at the first glance. The pantomime only enhances the magical fairytale feel - the real love never needs words. In 'City Lights' the Tramp is at his most romantic adventure ever, where he shows utmost bravery and selflessness. He doesn't only try to help his love interest, a blind flower girl (ever so charming Virginia Cherrill), but he also puts his own life on the line to save a millionaire (Harry Myers makes convincing alcoholic and is funny in his own right) from suicide, although, when sobered up, the millionaire doesn't want to make any dealings with the Tramp. Even there, Chaplin has written more complex social criticism than just pointing out the gap between the rich and the poor.Sweet, hilarious, and sad, delightful, and thoughtful movie. If you don't find yourself moved by this movie, my friend, then you are no longer my friend.",

            "content": "The first time I saw this movie I fell in love, and it instantly became one of my favorites. I just watched it the other night again and it still had a similar effect. This masterpiece directed by the great Charlie Chaplin is his best I've seen so far. It tells the tale of a poor tramp who meets a beautiful women selling flowers, and quickly finds out she is blind. When she begins to believe he is a wealthy man, the poor man goes along with it and begins to try and impress her. This may sound like some kind of romantic comedy that no one would want to see, but trust me, its far from that.The tramp starts off with his antics right from the get go, and even though its all through the movie, they never get old. It is always something new, and it keeps it interesting. That's the thing about this movie, its not like The Kid or The Great Dictator where all or most of the gags revolve around a certain topic or event, this story was made where the lead character can go on many adventures during the film, but it still ends up coming full circle to the most important story of them all. That's why this isn't just a romantic comedy, its more than that.For people who have never seen a Chaplin movie, or at least a full length film of his, it may seem like this movie would be all slapstick. Yes, there is slapstick, and a lot of it. However, the comical time is perfect and I found myself laughing at a lot of these gags, and I normally don't find that type of humor funny, Also, if you look deeper, you will soon see there is much more depth then one would think. It tells the story of a kind poor man trying to help everyone he meets and especially the ones he cares about. The Tramp meets this young women and soon goes to great lengths to help her when she is in need, more then most people would ever do. This loving side of him brings him through hilarious and memorable journeys. Along with the amazing score, this movie is prefect.For anyone who even is CONSIDERING watching this, I strongly, strongly suggest you do. With gags that will leave you laughing for weeks, but also a heartwarming tale that will leave you satisfied, it is enough to make any movie lover happy, no matter what kind of person you are.The only person I could think that would not enjoy it would be someone who hates slapstick, but really, I was never a fan of it, but when I found Mr.Charlie Chaplin's work I realized how funny it could actually be when done right. 10/10, one of the greatest movies of all time.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplain's comic outings are very well known, even today and given the amount that he made, it's difficult not to come across one of his classics every now and again. I happened to stumble across 'City Lights', in which the comedy still holds up.What makes the film still good is the simplicity of the comedy. The situations are common, everyday and relatable to and most things that MIGHT go wrong, do; given the circumstances. These apply to going to a restaurant, fighting in a boxing match and spending time in someone else's home. Early on during the statue scene, everything is placed into context and the scene serves as a good introduction to the film and its content. This is good for people first encountering Chaplain and this is the perfect introduction to his world of 'slapstick humour'. The things that could possibly go wrong; do and everything has an eerie sense of realism. 'What would happen if a tramp was indeed sleeping during a statue unveiling?' or indeed, got involved in any of the other situations in this film. One thing I found particularly interesting was the instance where everyone paused to respect the national anthem, even the tramp amongst the chaos. Nobody moved during the anthem and although they were trying to get him down initially, everything stops for the anthem \u0096 everything. I found this an interesting little piece of propaganda but very humorous at the same time: No matter what's going on around you, always stop to respect the nation when given the chance.What's also interesting is the narrative in the film. Narrative film making was around but was only about a decade or two old. In other films from around the time, narratives were still pretty basic but they got their story across, albeit maybe jumbled. In City Lights, the love story is put across effectively and the whole side story of the drunken millionaire/Chaplain trying to raise money is well sewn in; this adds to the effectiveness of the ending, also. What I like is the feeling of the character just wondering around, living day to day life, encountering people and things. There is that feeling of chance throughout. The backgrounds, given the date, are equally as interesting.Although you do see some gags coming, for instance the spaghetti scene where the similar looking decorations lurk menacingly above, City Lights does enough; with its love story, simplistic and comic situations mixed with actual humour such as the 'I thought you were driving' scene and the bad effect the lucky charms have on the boxers prior to the fight scene and the fact that there's enough in the film for you to take it seriously, especially the ending.'City Lights' will remain a classic.",

But this movie contains much more complex and developed comedy than the rest of his movies, making for a better laugh that will definitely stick with you for longer.\nTwo of the scenes in this film are probably two of the funniest Chaplin scenes and probably some of the funniest ever.\nThese scenes are:\nThe opening scene, which has this hilarious robotic feel to it with him feeling the need to repeat the action of saying hello to everyone and everything. The is has a sense of idiocy and lack of mediocrity throughout causing you to belt out with laughter.\nThe other scene is the scene in the boxing ring. The hilarity of this scene comes from the role reversal, and every time that one of the boxers has to break up the clinch between the referee and the other boxer, I laugh so hard.\nThis movie has surprising depth as well, being a criticism of capitalist society. The theme in this is so clear and obvious that a child could understand it. Maybe don't show this to a child as the silence might be a little boring, I know as a child I wouldn't have been able to sit through it, but as a teenager I couldn't recommend it more.\nAs with all of the Chaplin movies, his acting is less acting and more a well performed and choreographed dance or mime showing and conveying a very clear and obvious narrative.\nThe only thing holding this movie back is the score. Considering the emotional investment the score brings in these movies, I don't think its quite up to scratch and definitely worse than modern times. This is. A huge shame as everything about this movie has aged better than modern times, predominantly the jokes.\nMy personal favourite Chaplin movie so far.",

Actor, writer, director, producer, composer; it was not unlike Chaplin to do it all in his movies, but to do all of these, and to do them so brilliantly - it can only be described as genius. This film, is a wonderful place to start for anyone interested in the work of Charles Chaplin. While I feel that The Gold Rush is the better film, I would still recommend this just as quickly. It contains the wonderful sight gags, pratfalls, and classic comedy for which Chaplin's films are so renowned. From the opening scene, the unveiling of the monument, you know that you are in for a treat. The film is not all comedy, though. There is romance and drama as well. Yet, this is where this film shines so brightly; it IS comedy, it IS romance, and it IS drama. All three genres are presented here, purely, and yet, they are intertwined so exquisitely that the viewer hardly realizes the shifts in emotion!

The music is captivating, easily one of the best scores that he has composed till now.The supporting cast along with the lead actress contribute significantly in this superb movie.

His famous tramp is presented as the core common man in most of his movies like Gold Rush, Modern Times, etc. According to me, the best Chaplin movie is The Great Dictator. But, as tramp, it's City Lights which captures the grace of Chaplin at peak. Story picks a tramp, and his romantic interest, a flower girl. His attempts to support the gave gives way to so many hilarious situations. As an addition, there is an eccentric millionaire, his butler, and a boxing match. Behind every laugh, there will be a stinging pain, and Chaplin successfully captured the woes and worries of the men who lived in this world, with the best as he could. Words won't be enough to praise the artist in Chaplin, since he is one of the pioneers of world cinema. There are no wonder that he made these movies brilliant, because that what he had experienced in his childhood. He conjured his suffering days into the celluloid, and we are calling them classics. Even after all these years, we wonders, sighs, laughs with the tramp, and the master behind all these will be laughing too, from heavens....",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's Most Poignant Film",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's script concerning a blind woman who meets and befriends his Tramp character needed a special actress with a distant gazed look. The director/actor had auditioned several actresses, and was unhappy with all of them. During a boxing match, Chaplin sat near Virginia Cherrill, who was nearsighted. He noticed her squinting to see the action in the ring. His instinctive impulse in slotting her in as the blind woman was bold since she had no acting experience. He approached her during intermission and asked if she would be interested in the part in January 1931's \"City Lights.\" She didn't hesitate and said yes.That's one account. The other was while he was at a film shoot observing some bathing suit models on Santa Monica beach, Chaplin was approached by Cherrill. She reminded him of their boxing match meeting, and asked if there would ever be a chance to work in one of his movies. She screen tested perfectly for the part.Ever a perfectionist, Chaplin put the raw actress through the wringer. In one of his first scenes with her filmed early in 1929, the sequence calls for her while selling flowers on a sidewalk when she mistakens the Tramp for a millionaire emerging from a limousine. Chaplin shot hundreds of takes before moving on to other scenes. Several months later, he resumed filming that early shot. In all, Chaplin called for a total of 342 takes, shattering the record for the number of takes for one scene. Needless to say, Chaplin and Cherrill had a rocky relationship throughout the production. The now-actress recalled \"I never liked Charlie and he never liked me.\" The director took part of the blame, saying \"I had worked myself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection.\" Deep into the movie's production, Cherrill showed up late at the studio because she wanted to get her hair done. Chaplin fired her on the spot and considered replacing her with actress Georgia Hale, who played the female lead in 1925's \"The Gold Rush.\" He shot the script's final scene with Hale. But once advised on the great amount of filming and high costs required to reshoot Cherrill's scenes, Chaplin reluctantly brought her back. Friend Marion Davies coached Virginia to ask for more money to complete the film, which sent the director in an even more frenetic tizzy. He finally agreed to her demands and completed the film with her in it.When Hollywood had moved on to talkies in the late 1920s, Chaplin chose to continue to make silent films with an accompanying musical soundtrack and sound effects. He witnessed his friends Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks having an incredibly difficult time making the transition to talkies, and decided to keep his Tramp character mute. From the inception of \"City Lights'\" script, Chaplin visualized the ending as the keystone of the movie. Its conclusion, cited as the best finale in cinema, shows the blind girl who the Tramp paid for her eye operation recognizing her benefactor for the first time. The ending inspired Woody Allen to duplicate Chaplin's expressions in the final sequence in 1979's \"Manhattan.\"Film reviewer Roger Ebert described \"The last scene of \"City Lights\" is justly famous as one of the great emotional moments in the movies,\" wrote film reviewer Roger Ebert. He recalled seeing the movie in 1972 in Venice during a Chaplin film festival. \"When the flower girl recognized the Tramp, I heard much snuffling and blowing of noses around me; there wasn't a dry eye in the piazza. Then complete darkness fell, and a spotlight singled out a balcony overlooking the square. Charlie Chaplin walked forward, and bowed. I have seldom heard such cheering.\"\nAt \"City Lights'\" premier in January 30, 1931, Chaplin had personally invited Albert Einstein and his wife Elsa to sit with him. Once the movie ended, he saw Einstein's eyes tearing, surprising the comedian that the genius was so sentimental.\"City Lights\" has been called a synthesis of the entire body of Chaplin's work. He has a number of classic episodic skits contained within the movie: from its opening with The Tramp sleeping on a city statue, to an unforgettable boxing match, to a wild New Year Eve's night spent with a millionaire he befriends.\"City Lights\" was rousing success with both the critics and the general public. Orson Welles said it was his favorite movie. Stanley Kubrick listed the Chaplin film number five of his top ten movies he most loved. Playwright George Bernard Shaw described Chaplin as the only \"genius to come out of the movie industry.\" The American Film Institute members ranked \"City Lights\" in a number of categories: The 11th Best Movie of All-Time, The 38th Funniest Movie, the 10th Most Passionate, the 33rd Most Inspiring, the Number One Best Romantic Comedy of All Time, and The Tramp as the 38th Most Heroic Movie character. The feature film is also in the \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.\" Strangely, \"City Lights\" didn't receive one Academy Award nomination in any category, one of the organization's more ignoble slights.",

            "review_title": "The Lights, that blind (*may contain spoilers*)",
            "content": "****May contain spoilers***** City Lights is yet another great example of Chaplin's greatness. This film contains many of the Chaplin's usual comedy numbers. In fact, the boxing scene in this film is even better than those from Cinderella Man. However, I think that this film has a very serious message behind all of the comedy.Chaplin was never a man who feared making social commentary. This is more obvious in films like The Great Dictator and Modern Times. Even though City Lights messages are a little more subtle, I think they are still present. The film touches on everything from poverty to wealth and even race.I think the main social commentary in the film can be found in it's views on wealth. The film actually opens up with the city unveiling a large monument. To their surprise, when the pull the curtain the homeless Tramp (Chaplin) is sleeping on the lap of the statue. His presence is seen by the crowd as an unwelcome blemish on the face of their monument. Physical comedy aside, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. The whole concept is how the rich want to ignore the poor and pretend they do not exist. This is made completely clear in the relationship between Chaplin and the eccentric millionaire. In fact, when the first meet the millionaire is attempting to kill himself. He is actually saved by a homeless man telling him that \"the birds will sing tomorrow.\" This total irony is the kind of tool that Chaplin uses to illustrate his point. Another aspect of the this relationship that illustrates the same point is the fact that when the rich man is drunk, Chaplin is his best friend. However, when he sobers up he wants nothing to do with him. He even pretends not to know him some times. This shows in no uncertain terms, that Chaplin saw the rich as being afraid to help the poor. In fact, one of the only people that will actually talk to Charlie is a blind girl who sells flowers. This seems like a typical screen romance. However, when you delve deeper I think that you can see it is not. Through out the film, I think you can confuse this relationship as puppy love. Then as the plot unfolds a couple of apparent thoughts surface. The blind girl actually thinks that Charlie's character is a millionaire. I think that in hind sight it is easy to see that the more Charlie pretends to be rich, the more she likes him. In fact, this can perhaps be seen in the ending sequence. The girl now able to see and the owner of a whole flower store thanks to the money that Charlie provides is always waiting on him to arrive. The catch is, that she has never seen Charlie before. At one point a rich man walks in, and the girl gets a look on her face that shows she thinks that her prince has arrived. When it isn't him, she says she hopes he comes soon. Then ironically, a totally beaten down Tramp walks by her store window. From inside the store, she actually laughs at him when local paper boys pick on him. Then we he sees her and is obviously madly in love, she taunts him even further. In fact, when she does realize that this tramp is her knight in shining armor comes the clincher. The girl's face shows not love or gratitude. There is no hug or kiss, for the man that saved her. Only a disappointed look and her saying that now she can see. I think that this more than any other point in the film is where the message is really hammered home. When Charlie's only friend now has some money, and sees him for the poor person that he is she is saddened. It is really quite a dark thought. I mean this is a man, who got beaten up in a boxing match and even shoveled fecal matter off the street just to try and help his love pay her rent. I think this sad thought is one that Chaplin hoped would open the audience's eyes to this problem.Besides the obvious economic views in the movie, we have other examples of social commentary. The boxing scene has a very interesting one to me. Not only does it show these boxing people turning the poor into punching bags, so they can fill their arena but there is a race issue as well. In this scene the black boxer is shown not only as superstitious, but he actually gets pummeled by a white boxer. Then there is also a major homosexual under current in this scene as well. Charlie is shown as seemingly gay in the locker room. He makes gay gestures as well as faces towards his opponent. If you think this is not true, then why does the man change his pants behind a curtain? I think the fact that Charlie and the black boxer are shown as outcast in the locker room is some kind of commentary on the thoughts of the time. In fact, the homosexual theme is also prevalent with the millionaire and Charlie. Always hugging and drinking. At one point Charlie actually wakes up in bed with the millionaire. I think the film at times shows the desperate Charlie as a male prostitute to the millionaire. I am not sure if this is what Charlie meant to do, but it is definitely something to look at when you view the film.In closing, this film is just as much a masterpiece as everything else that Chaplin has done. The comedy and commentary mix together to form one very striking and memorable film. I think that is why is is still held in such high regards, even to this day.",

            "content": "The infamous Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) befriends a sightless flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and vows to cure her blindness. Every penny as poor as the girl is, he embarks on a series of misanthropic adventures that transport him from the center of a boxing ring to the house of an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers), who shuns the Tramp when sober and treasures his company when drunk. All the while, the flower girl, unable to see his face, mistakes the Tramp for a rich philanthropist, unable to believe that one so destitute could care so deeply for the woes of another.City Lights joins an embarrassingly long list of films that moved me to tears, though not, perhaps, for the typical reasons. On an absolute level, there's something profoundly touching in the Tramp's devotion to the blind girl, but I found myself even more caught up in what Chaplin seemed to be saying about class. That the rich characters are only capable of empathy when alcohol levels the playing field is only one part of the critique. That the Tramp exists in a moral vacuum, that the needs of others are a constant inspiration for everything he does, that his lack of attachments enables him to come to the rescue not only of the flower girl but of the millionaire himself, whose attempted suicide would have been successful if the Tramp hadn't intervened . . . these are just a few of the reasons for why Chaplin's hobo-protagonist is, ironically, the wealthiest character in the movie. Thematically speaking, it's a well-worn path (the charitable bum versus the miserly aristocrat) yet Chaplin attacks the subject in such a simple, exacting, and unobtrusive way that we forget we've encountered it before. We don't come away feeling like we've swallowed a sermon with characters attached to it. We feel like we've witnessed something fresh and new, something funny and tearful and void of baggage.Rare is the movie that combines comedy and drama quite so fluently. While farcical sequences often distract from the film in question, Chaplin's slapstick actually underscores the drama, since the more ridiculous the Tramp's situation becomes, the more impressed we are at the lengths he'll go to in the service of his friend. And the performances in the final scene are about as good as any of seen, if only because they work with so little, and still say so much.",

            "content": "City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing. I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years. I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment. The plot seems to be commonly used now, with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girl's love in return. In City Lights, there are a few twists to the plot. The girl is blind and poor, the Tramp\u0097Chaplin\u0097is poor, in love, and wants to help the blind girl. The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money, but he is an on-again, off-again friend depending on whether or not he is drunk.Being that this is a silent film, there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character. Since in a silent film they can't tell us how they are feeling, it is important that we can understand feelings through action. This may be through facial expressions, body language, dress, eye contact, kinds of touch, or the use of written statements, like title cards in a silent film. A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers. From the flower girl selling her flowers, to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl, the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters. It symbolized the affection he had for her, because like the flowers she couldn't see, she couldn't see the true him or his true affections. Another prop that was used was money. From the millionaire's point of view, money was really of no matter. He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend, he went out to the dance club, and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars. To the millionaire this money is nothing, but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity. When the movie was made in the 1930s, many people were poor and hopeless, but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression. In the film I noticed the use of a repetition, or rather a parallelism, as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz. They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz, as I saw in City Lights. In City Lights, parallelism is done with sight, not necessarily with eyes, but with the mind. We see the reverse where the poor blind girl \"sees\" Chaplin as a millionaire, and then at the end, she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight. The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money. The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum, yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love. Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide. However, when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him, throws him out and even has him arrested.In a way, this film is different then what our generation might be used to, but by watching these \"classics\" we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film.",

Okay, the story is done.Honestly, I have to say that I like Chaplin, but I don't love him. This film does nothing to change my mind. There are many cute clowning sequences and they are strung together, although early on, they don't do a whole lot to help the story out and serve almost as distractions. However, taken as individual scenes, they are entertaining, although nothing that caused me to laugh out loud.The film is helped in that it doesn't resolve too neatly but leaves a little room for our own projection of how we think things happen after we see \"The End\". And it's a bittersweet plot twist which allows for some empathy, rather than just clowning for the sake of clowning. So, City Lights is enjoyable and human, but suffers from gag-stringing and being a little drawn out. Decent, but not a must-watch. 7/10.",

Tramp is out on the streets again and falls in love with a blind girl, played stupendously by Virginia Cherrill, who mistakenly takes him for a millionaire. And being hooked up by this wonderful feeling he goes all the extra miles and runs marathons to help her selflessly; he even agrees to a boxing match just to get some money for a person in need.People got used to other people walking by or walking out when someone is helpless but Charles shows us another way, a better way to deal with life. He also shows us that looks don't matter when it comes to love: even with your eyes wide open you can miss the love of your life even if he is right in front of you - all you need to do is reach out your hand toward another human being and try and feel him. Most of the people aren't blind but they are when it comes to the simplest and very often the most important things in life and Charles will always be there for us to lead the way.\"City lights\" is not just another masterpiece of Chaplin's (which it definitely is) but is also his most ultimate, touching, meaningful and undeniably best body of work before he slowly let himself step out of his role of an underdog, matured, became more political but not less revealing and powerful.",

In those days there was no sound at all in the movies and the actors have to perform very well in order to convey their messages to the viewers and every single artist in this movie did it beautifully. Virginia Cherrill portrayed the character of blind girl beautifully. I have seen many movies that were made before 2nd world war but with all do respect those were nothing as compare to this movie. On the whole this movie is great and I recommend it to everyone especially who likes classics and comedy. I give it 10/10.",

            "content": "City Lights (1931)Considered to be one of the best movies of all time, Charlie Chaplin's City Lights stands the test of time and proves to be as entertaining today as it was in 1931. Charlie Chaplin's comedic style comes through and is perfectly crafted. The amount of time spent on creating the tramp must have taken a long time. The character has his own unique walk and walks are often the first thing actors do to get the character right. The comedic style Chaplin portrays is universally funny and doesn't rely on pop culture references or current events to make fun of. Everyone can laugh at falling into a lake, or silly dancing, or running away from an imposing boxer. City Lights was shot in the beginning of \"talkies\" era, but remains a silent movie with a soundtrack. The reason behind this is Chaplin's comedic pantomime style wouldn't translate as well with people talking.Chaplin's actions, gestures and facial expressions are perfect at telling the story of his character in the film. The elaborate scenes that are shot without a cut must have called for very careful choreography, timing and a lot of practice. An example of this would be the boxing scene where the tramp dances around the referee and the other boxer while sneaking in a punch here and there.The other actors and actresses in City Lights do a very good job at portraying their characters with very little dialog. The blind girl's appearance is exaggerated by her eyes and how they're empathized with dark eye shadow to show that she's blind. After she gets the surgery her dark eye shadow is gone. The film's 3 main characters each have a basic want, the blind girl wants to see, the tramp wants love, the rich guy wants excess and to have a good time. Each has a distinct attitude. The Blind girl is a sweet kind heart, the tramp is a good-hearted fun loving guy in love, the millionaire is a two face who seems harsh and angry when he's sober, but jolly and fun when he's drunk. These three characters and types are very stereotypical and have been used before and after the movie, but in this film the blind girl and tramp's feel like real people with real problems and feelings. The film covers several themes, including love and being in love, commitment, hope, friendship, want for something more, and humor in everyday situations. The lines between the themes are easily crossed and gently blend into each other perfectly. The end of the film is the real show stopper when the blind girl finally gets to see the tramp, the man who helped her in so many ways. This ending is thought, by some, to be one of the greatest endings of all time and after watching it you're left wondering what happened? Several scenarios run through your head and the true ending is decided by you, the viewer. Perhaps she helps the tramp as he helped her? Maybe she's wrong and thinks the rich guy who was in the store earlier is the true rich guy who helped her? The sets and design have an older feel to it, not only because it's shot in black and white, but the architecture feels European and has a feel like it could happen anywhere in Europe. In fact, the movie was shot in San Francisco and doesn't use any of the landmarks, but chooses against them so the story can feel like it can happen anywhere. With universal humor, themes and a simple, but beautiful story, City Lights remains a classic.",

            "content": "This is certainly one of the most sensual films of all time. Chaplin turned in it a festival of senses. - Smell: no real reference, but something puzzles me when the elephant crosses the screen (and the street). - Taste: this is a film where they eat a lot. They eat spaghetti in the restaurant; they eat at the rich man's house; the tramp eats his lunch; and of course, he brings food to the girl. - Hearing: she hears him passing by, although he tries to be silent. Then she (thinks she) hears him leave in the car. When the statue is revealed, people are talking in a microphone. But we do not understand a thing. Only the tone of the voices are recognizable: a low tone for the man, a high-pitched tone for the woman. This was also the occasion to make fun of the talkies, Chaplin remaining a silent movie director. Nevertheless, Chaplin uses sounds to increase his comical effects: when he swallows spaghetti, or blows against his will the whistle, the boxing gong... - Touch: this is the sense of communication for the girl. This is how she knows who she is talking to. This is also by touching him that she realizes that he is the man who looked after her. The first time she meets him, she touches his jacket put a flower in his buttonhole. This is also the same thing she does when they finally meet. She wants to give him a flower and money, but he refuses. By touching, one last time, his jacket, she recognizes him, and is filled with emotion (who would not be?). - Sight: the most important sense, of course. First, we watch. And what do we watch? A blind girl. She has an empty look when we meet her. When he talks to her, he cannot help miming his words. Of course, it is for us spectators that he makes all these gestures. But he is also very enthusiastic when he talks, so he has to mime everything he says. And when he leaves her, he cannot help spying on her through the window, standing on a barrel. Finally, their last look at each other is one of the most moving I have ever seen. She is sad (is she disappointed?), he seems half-sad/half-annoyed by this situation.Anyway, this film is also a great love story (like in most Chaplin movies). This little man will do whatever he can for the girl he loves. He will even steal - and go to prison - for her. But this is an impossible love. They will not end together. Indeed, when they finally meet, her first reaction to this tramp is mockery. She laughs at him with the other girls. She even offers him money. You cannot love someone you pity. The other reason this ending is quite sad is the role of the flower. This nice flower suddenly dies in his hands. As he realizes she has changed, the petals are falling. This flower, symbolizing their relation (a link between past and present), is no more. He is not what she expected. They do not belong to the same world.Last, their final discussion (which we do not hear): \"You can see now. - Yes, I can see now.\" There is definitely a double meaning in these words. No luck for him. Unfortunately.",

The plot is simple: the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl, played by Virgnina Cherrill, and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to raise money for a surgery that is to restore her sight. This is the classic Tramp character at his finest. In City Lights, Chaplin brings such depth to the character, but never fails to amaze with his brilliant comic talent. Cherrill also does a magnificent job; it's almost as though she was really blind, without a hint of even seeing her surroundings. This film was rated as one of the top 100 films of all time (AFI, 1998), within the top 20. At the time of production, nearly all filmmakers turned to films with sound. But of course Chaplin did not cave in, and produced a fantastic silent film, at a time when adding sound was all the rage. Thank goodness for that!I recommend City Lights to absolutely anyone- it never fails to amaze.",

            "content": "This is the first silent film that I have reviewed. This maybe the first silent film that I have ever sat all of the way through. I have not been avoiding them, but there are just so many movies to watch that I just have not gotten to any. The saddest thing about a movie as great and as influential as this is that as a modern movie goer it is hard not to be jaded when it comes to witnessing the brilliance of the original geniuses of film. There is a lot that modern filmmakers and viewers can learn from silent movies. It is hard to capture an audience for an extended period of time without boring them especially when the movie is predictable every step of the way. Watching City Lights was an extremely predictable experience, yet it did not take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I really enjoyed watching the story play out each step of the way and the movie is made with so much heart and care that it really comes through when watching. The movie starts with some great physical comedy while showcasing the good natured spirit of the Tramp. The sword gag really demonstrates some of the physicality that Chaplin brought to his role, as does the boxing scene, but having grown up with the Loony Toon cartoons and the physical comedians like Jim Carrey we have seen all of these types of gags. Seeing it play out on screen with real actors is still enjoyable to watch, but I am sure that the magic that others experienced watching it for the first time is lost on me. The heart of the film is not the physical comedy, but the relationship that the Tramp has with the flower girl. It is really a touching story that really has not lost any of its poignancy. A man willing to give up anything of his own to bring happiness to a stranger's life is not a original story, but watching the Tramp put everything he has into making the flower girl smile is heart breaking. While this is a moving tale it is amazing how Chaplin balances the comedy with the heart and how the comedy is a necessary consequence of the Tramp helping the flower girl with the means that he has. I love how Chaplin throws himself into the character and embodies the physical nature of the tramp. The walk is instantly recognizable and one can see how the great actors are able to disappear into roles by capturing this physicality with their performances. Cherrill does a wonderful job also and I swear that some of the actress from the black and white films actually glow. Cherrill absolutely glows throughout the whole film and she does have sweetness that matches the Tramps intentions. It also showcases how being physical in a role does not necessarily mean that their movements are loud and exaggerated. The ending will go down as one of the best endings of all time, but it did not hit me as hard as I thought going into the movie. I knew the basic premise of the movie and the ending was sweet as could be, but it did not resonate with me as much as it has with other film goers. I loved watching it the smile on Chaplin's face will sit with me for a while. I did love this film and it really has opened the door for me to want to see more silent films. It was a fascinating experience that I thoroughly enjoyed, but it did not feel fresh to me. I did not seem like I was discovering something special, but had finally watched something special that everyone else had already embraced. With a lot of these older films I almost feel as if it is my duty to watch the movie and that I am not doing it because I want to. I loved the movie and it will go done as a classic in my book, but it was not a special movie experience for me.",

            "content": "The Tramp meets a blind girl who sells flowers in the street.  He falls in love with her, and endeavours to raise money for her eye surgery.    Chaplin, as usual, pulls off the bravura achievement of writing, directing, starring and composing the music.  The characteristic Chaplin strengths are on display - exquisite timing, virtuoso athleticism and rich comic invention.  His weaknesses are also apparent - laboured gags and over-the-top sentimentality.    The opening scene, a municipal ceremony to unveil a statue, is hallmark Chaplin.  In the background a colonial-style church is dwarfed by huge commercial buildings.  The homely virtues of America's early communities have been overwhelmed by rapacious capitalism.  The joke which introduces the Tramp is a good one, nicely sustained by the clownage with the sword. In 1931 the cinema was feeling its way with the new medium of sound, an innovation to which the Chaplin style was ill-suited and to which he adjusted only gradually.  This film uses a distorted 'buzzing' soundtrack to suggest human speech.  It has a valid satirical point (parodying the vapid speeches of local worthies), but for Chaplin it has the added usefulness of avoiding any need for lip-synchronisation.    Window-shopping because he has nothing else to do, the Tramp notices a statuette of a female nude in a store's window display.  He becomes aroused by it (watch for the crafty little 'erection' joke with the cane) and this prepares us for his sexual interest in the blind girl.    This portion of the film is packed with symbolism.  The Tramp is a figure on the fringes of civilisation, and he shies instinctively from the motor-cycle cop.  The blindness of the girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) is important, because she alone is not repelled by outward appearances.  She 'sees' his true worth.  Back in her little tenement, the lonely blind girl hears her 'normal' neighbour leaving on a date.  She picks up the birdcage, the emblem of her own imprisoned beauty.    Chaplin's mime of drunkenness as he 'celebrates' with the Millionaire (Harry Myers) is superb, his problems on the slippery ballroom floor are a comic marvel.  Particularly impressive is the eating of the paper streamer. Chaplin's face is a picture!    Because he is so adept at conveying information through mime, Chaplin pulls off some wonderful things.  The Millionaire shuns him when sober, and the Tramp's bonhomie - rejected by his stiff friend - is all portrayed beautifully in a fleeting gesture.  Similarly, the Tramp returns to the park railings where the blind girl usually sits, only to find that she's not there.  His body sags in a brilliant depiction of the shock of disappointment.  Before the boxing match, the Tramp is rapidly losing heart as he observes the meanness of his opponent.  His defeatism as he dabs himself with the lucky rabbit's foot is a delight.  More bedraggled than ever, the Tramp re-encounters the now-cured blind girl, and the flower discarded in the gutter represents the inherent goodness of the man, and the way in which society has squandered his potential.    Well-constructed in a workmanlike sense, the film is really little more than a vehicle for a string of mime routines (the party, the boxing-match and so on).  Modern viewers might feel awkward with the outrageous coincidences which keep the plot moving, and with a comedy routine centring on a drunk driver.    The film's sentimental finale is very well-known.  Might it not have been more effective if the girl had failed to recognise him?",

            "content": "City lights is simply Charlie Chaplin's best film. His most balanced, profound, and absolutely brilliant work. In passing, he offers us his best interpretation and his definitive and last incarnation of the Tramp.Chaplin in his role as a tramp, saves the life of a drunken, embittered and suicidal millionaire at night. During the day he falls in love with a poor blind florist who sells her flowers on the street. The problem is that the girl mistakes him from the beginning for a millionaire, and the tramp thinks that the only way to get the girl is to continue with the deception. The film is articulated around these two relationships.The story of the millionaire will clearly influence Brecht in one of his most famous plays. As in Mr. Puntilla and his man Matti, here the millionaire becomes human by getting drunk, reverting to his bitter, well-off egoism as soon as he gets a hangover. Drunk, he wants to socialize, have a good time, and he also has clairvoyant moments in which he realizes his deeply desperate state and gives free rein to his suicidal tendencies. Sober he becomes a kind of grumpy, distrustful, self-satisfied automaton, incapable of maintaining a human relationship with anyone.With the money that the tramp gets at night from his friendship with the millionaire, he manages to alleviate the economic situation of the girl and her poor sick mother. We have seen the girl wishing she could lead a normal life like her neighbors, unable to avoid a background of bitterness at her situation, and now deluding herself with her supposed new millionaire lover.The film has some of the greatest comedy scenes of Chaplin and thus in the history of cinema, the most famous of which is naturally the boxing match. Throughout the film, Chaplin strikes a miraculous balance between the comic and the sentimental, alternating between the tramp's amusing efforts to raise money and his encounters with the blind girl.The final scene is the greatest Chaplin ever shot, and one of the greatest in film history. Months go by. The girl has been able to operate, she can see now, and has opened a store with the money that Chaplin has given her (and for which he has gone to jail). The girl has been waiting for her millionaire lover since Chaplin disappeared, dreaming up. A handsome and elegant young man enters the store and her heart sinks: she has thought it was him. The moment is very important, we see the aspirations of the girl: a rich, handsome, elegant young man. Next we see Chaplin who has been released from prison, and wanders the streets of the city. He walks past some newsboys. We already know them from before, they like to make fun of the tramp. They are children, somewhat cruel, who want to amuse themselves by playing the poor tramp with heavy jokes and humiliating him. The definitely comical details only deepen our impression of the poor tramp's bitterness: totally broken, a shadow of the cheerful character we saw at the beginning of the film.And suddenly, in the most humiliating moment, the camera discovers that Chaplin is right in front of the flower shop window, and that the girl enjoys the jokes and humiliations that the boys subject the tramp to, laughing from inside with a shop assistant of the store.When the homeless man turns around and sees her, his face changes: it lights up, he has regained his happiness at seeing the young woman with her sight restored, in her own shop, a life solved. The girl wants to be charitable to that nice tramp who looks lovingly at her from the other side of the glass and comes out to meet him when the tramp wants to get away. She asks him to come closer and it is then, when she gives him a coin, that when she touches his hands she recognizes him. It is one of the most exciting moments in the history of cinema. The girl abruptly changes her expression, she is no longer the condescending and charitable florist who gives alms to a poor man: we now see her surprise, and also her deep disappointment. Chaplin stares with deep concern, excitement and nervousness: he sees her surprise and her disappointment. The tension is enormous: these are two of the most expressive looks I have ever seen on a screen. We see how the girl in a few seconds goes from that surprise, from that disappointment to first painful and then deeply grateful acceptance. Probably sadly renouncing to her imagined lover, but deeper accepting this real man whose love is much more valuable precisely for all that she is renouncing to.",

I should say I'm not a great fan of the man, dazzling us with lots of separate little scenes which show off his 'extraordinary' timing and 'amazing' dexterity and which scream look at me, look at me and are then sewn together into a very basic plot. On that basis I'm probably not a person to pay attention to if you like Chaplin.

            "content": "City Lights is my favorite Chaplin feature; the climax is a cinematic masterpiece, as other contributors here will attest.  No matter how many times I view the ending (I own the film on videotape), tears still well in my eyes at the close.  I consider it one of the best films of all time. The plot contrivance of the \"Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde\" personality of the millionaire is sheer genius.  Others have spoke of the artisty of the boxing match, but my favorite scene is where Charlie, while driving the millionaire's car, sees a discarded cigar butt on the sidewalk.  Before he can get to it, a panhandler happens by and leans down to pick it up.  Charlie dispatches him with a kick in the pants, grabs the cigar butt and jumps back into his luxury automobile.  He leaves the bewildered panhandler scratching his head, wondering why a wealthy man would be so mean as to snatch a discarded butt from the curb.  Of course, if one is aware of the grinding poverty Chaplin endured while growing up in south London and of his stingy reputation with a buck, the joke is all the more significant.  Certainly The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus and Modern Times are all classics, but City Lights wraps pathos, superb pantomime and comic gags into a seamless display of artistry that Chaplin never was able to surpass.",

            "content": "The film often considered to be Chaplin's masterpiece, and one of the true landmarks of cinema.  \"City Lights\" may not be the most skillfully constructed of Chaplin's Little Tramp movies, but it is undoubtedly his most powerful and satisfying.Chaplin has been known for the sentimentality that coexists with the comedy in his movies, but rarely has he used as many pathos as he does here. Chaplin, however, refuses to manipulate his audience with weepy, overblown sappiness.  He instead plays out his dramatic scenes in a genuinely convincing manner with a dose of humor sprinkled into it.Although there are some classic scenes in the first half of the film (most notably the scenes with the Tramp befriending a rich drunk), most of the movie's greatness comes in the second half.  One of Chaplin's finest moments has the Tramp boxing for a fifty-dollar purse.  It would be useless to try and describe how beautifully and hilariously choreographed the sequence is; one simply has to appreciate it on their own.The film's greatest moment is, undeniably, the final scene.  Everything about it (acting and music especially) is masterfully executed.  The scene is so sublimely uplifting and inspiring, it leaves one in a state of mild euphoria, if only for a short time.",

I really enjoyed the scenes of Chaplin working on this film on the \"Special Features\" disc of the \"Chaplin Collection\". Especially enlightening was the story of Chaplin's conflict with his ing\u00e9nue Virginia Cherrill. The outtakes of his replacement for her character, Georgia Hale, after he fired her (temporarily) show that as good as an actor/actress is, they are not perfect for every role.

Something of the age vibrates in all of Chaplin's movies; somehow he preserves their style, their grace, and perhaps in this silent movie demonstrates a sensitivity, a gentleness that we've all but lost in todays films. The relationship between the Little Tramp and the flower girl touches the heart so tenderly, yet so deeply, that the viewer comes away a little more human, and perhaps a little more sympathetic to the human condition. Virginia Cherrill is marvelous as the blind flower girl, fragile and wanting, yet wholesomely full of life. This was her first film, and she only acted for five years before marrying and retiring from the screen. We can only sigh and dream of what she might have given us movie buffs if she'd continued. Still, we have the marvelous Charlie Chaplin.",

'City Lights (1931)' is enjoyable throughout and tells its story deftly, but there are several slow segments - perhaps somewhat expected from a film of this age but not excused, considering that the era and talent have produced pieces superior in this regard - ultimately making this a fun watch which often represents uproarious cinematic entertainment in its purest form but isn't the best of the bunch. 6/10",

What follows is an emotional rollercoaster of a movie that fills you with laughter and sadness. This really is Chaplin at his best. This film was made in 1931, when movies had sound in them and a lot of companies were now producing talkies, rather than silent movies. Chaplin, thinking that sound would be a killer of the industry, decided to make City Lights a silent film anyway. Whilst he may have been wrong about sound being the end of the movie industry, this film being made as a silent movie was a very good idea. I really enjoyed the way he incorporated tiny bits of sound into his humour. One of the scenes involved him swallowing a whistle and every time he breathed out, he let out a toot.",

            "review_title": "Intellectual",
            "content": "The movie is a brilliant movie with simple approach, face expressions and body language delivered the message louder than words. Charlie Chaplin manages to expose the contrast in our lives between rich and poor and between dreams and reality. The first point has been delivered in the first seen, when group of politicians were celebrating a monument that has been built by donated money. Charlie Chaplin (a homeless man) was sleeping under the cover of the statue. This seen highlighted the contrast between money spent for cosmetic projects that does not add any value to eliminate hanger and improve the life of the neediest parts of the community. The message is that we are spending money and willing to provide funding for project that at most just cosmetic, and ignore funding to fight hunger, homelessness and curable diseases in our own backyard in the US. We see the same today, almost seventy years after the movie. The willingness to spend many billions on wars, supporting dictators, stadiums, art, and music, on the other hand, the community organized huge resistance to provide health care service for every American. The movie continued to highlight the wide gap between the rich and the poor in our community. The movie showed how a $10 can buy whole day worth of work for the blind girl and send her home for the day. The rich mane has many of those bills in his pocket as pocket cash. The same point is emphasized when the drunk rich man wanted to help and offered a $1000 to help. This amount of money was part of the pocket cash again. The movie proceed to show that portion of the rich man pocket cash was able to keep the blind lady and her old grandmother at their rented home, and cure her vision in addition to opening her own flower shop. The idea of just a portion of a pocket cash of someone can make this huge impact on someone else life is sad reality. It applies to all of us today, the few dollars we spend every day on coffee, cigarettes, and other unessential expenses can make huge difference in someone else life, in this country and in other countries. The culture of spending money we don't have to buy things we will never use is a very well established culture, proved by a simple trip to the nearest Costco or mall. The rich man drives a Rolls Royce (that he was willing to give it as gift in exchange for few happy moments with his \"friend\" Charlie Chaplin) and he has several servants at his home. The movie succeeded in denying the association between money and happiness. The rich man was not happy and was trying to end his own life; however, unintentionally he was able to introduce major happiness to others. The fact that he was drunk when he offered the money is an indicator that people are good when they are at their simplest form, and turn to monsters when they are back to their complicated personality.At many points, the movie highlighted the harsh reality of the tough job market. The humiliation of cleaning after horses and \"elephants\" and the job as a boxer to make money were stretched to make the message louder. My personal believe is that money and wealth belong to god, wealthy people are just in control of the wealth in behalf of god and spending money is regulated on the basis of helping the bigger benefit of the community. Over spending is discouraged and greed is discouraged. The spending is to be balanced between the extremes. God like to see the signs of his gifts on his creations. The movie did not touch directly on the social justice and the lack of it; however, it highlighted the dark side of capitalism, homelessness, eviction, medical coverage, and low end jobs brutality. The movie triggered thoughts in many directions due the lack of the sound conversation. This may lead to stretch of what really the movie is trying to say and deliver to the viewers. It opened the door for multiple interpretations for the same seen based on one's background and believes. In conclusion, the movie is intellectual and it is everything but just a popcorn movie.The movie successfully delivered the message that capitalism comes with heavy price. The dark side of capitalism can be minimized by having social justice and implementing social services to benefit the least fortunate among us and the sick.Advance social services do not contradict with capitalism as far as I understood capitalism. Advanced social services may hurt certain business like insurance companies and other business that makes money from the misery of people. The contradiction is how such a religious country like the US denies social services and support for the poor and the sick. It seems to me that money rules, and money map our lives much more than out believes. I always support my claim with our consistent attempts to cash in our ethics like legalizing gambling and certain types of drugs. Some communities went further and legalized prostitution. As I am living in this free country, I am always amazed how major issues are not negotiable and taken granted forever as in the availability and abuse of alcohol and \"right\" to have sex without restrictions. We choose to deal with the end effect of alcohol but never question its availability and accessibility equally to under-aged and mature abusers. The same applies to our solution to the teen pregnancy where the best we did is making condoms available.This movie was one of the intellectual movies that managed to deliver a clear message by highlighting contradictions in our daily live. I enjoyed the movie and it made it to my favorite movies list.",

Forget Carlin, forget Gervais, Chaplin rules 'em all. And all this without saying a word. Can you believe it?This is his masterpiece! 10 stars truly deserved.",

            "review_title": "Fairly entertaining, but not one of the best",
            "content": "\"City Lights\" is an American silent film from 1931, so this one is almost 90 years old now, although \"silent\" is a bit relative in this scenario because there is a defined soundtrack by Chaplin and he said he does not want this film shown with different kind of music, but yeah as for talking and sound effects, it is of course a silent movie. Unlike other Chaplin films this one does not seem to have many different versions (according to imdb at least) and it runs for slightly under 90 minutes. Of course it is in black-and-white. And this is once again 100% about Chaplin, but let me still say a few words on the supporting cast. His female lead, i.e. love interest, is played by Virginia Cherrill who was still very young when this was made and retired from the film industry before her 30th birthday, but led a long life afterwards. The actress who palyed her mother, however, did not get this old and died less than 5 years after this was made, way before WWII. This is a Chaplin movie that does not play way back in the past, like the days of the Gold Rush for example. It is set in the city approximately during the time when it was made as we can easily see when watching this film. And while I do think that this is all about Chaplin at the center of the film/action, I still think he is best when he interacts with people that he really only shares pretty much one scene with most of the time, like the guy whose bald head he mistakes for food. Or the dude who is making a sandwich and Chaplin mistakes one ingredient for soap. Or of course the boxing fight now that was hilarious with the referee constantly in the way between them. It never got old despite how long they used this running gag. Well with how fast they were moving, it was really a running gag and Chaplin (forgive me for saying his name instead of \"the Tramp\") sure knew how to make the most of it. He may not have had the strength, but he had the quickness. And still he lost the fight in the end, which as the expected outcome for the bookmakers probably, but not for the audience in my theater, who was clearly surprised that our hero came short. But it is a nice inclusion of realism I must say. What was also fun were the scenes before the fight when Chaplin using another guy's lucky charm to its full extent, but when he saw that guy got quite a beating he really tries to get all the lucky charm away from him because clearly it wasn't working.Well, this was a movie in which it could have been really easy to feel for the guy, like how he is mistaken for the person who robbed the guy who is constantly drunk by the police and in the end even has to go to jail for it, but all he really wanted was get some money to help the girl he is in love with to have eye surgery, so that she can see again. And the guy willingly gave him the money after he saved him from commiting suicide earlier in the film. This was a strange inclusion though. I mean the subject of depression or whatever caused him to go for it was never part of the film later on. So yeah like I said, it was rather these individual, almost independent, scenes that made this film work for me than the key plot involving the friendship story with the drunkard or the key plot involving the romance with the girl. But this is to some extent also subjective because this time I was not crushing together with Charlie on her, which would have helped to maybe see this as more of an emotional movie. The ending was also a bit unusual. I have seen Chaplin films in which he gets the girl and I have seen Chaplin films in which he helps the girl get married to another guy, even if he liked her too. But this is somewhat open. The girl remembers him again, but then the closing credits roll in. Still I somehow feel we perceive this film very differently than the people did back then. So I somewhat think they did see it as a happy ending back then because she cared so much for him and she was so grateful towards him that there was no way she would refuse him right now, even if he was not the big hunk maybe she would have liked him to be. But it's just speculation anyway. Everybody will probably perceive this ending differently. I watched this film as part of a series on Chaplin in my local theater and it was shown at midnight and even if there was no fee (zero a.m. zero euros), I found it baffling that there were easily over 200 people in my showing and the room was packed. Shows how big Chaplin still is such a long time after his death. I would not call myself a big fan of him, but I like some of his works. This is one of them, even if it is not really among my favorites. I listed reasons for that earlier. So I am a bit surprised that this is really ranked so high here on imdb and has such a marvellous rating average. That I would not agree with. The only thing in this movie that maybe came close to an 8.5 out of 10 was the revelation of Chaplin under the cover on the statue. And how he is stuck there and how the anthem interrupts their routine was indeed really hilarious. So it is a good film to watch and I am glad I saw it. Give it a thumbs-up and if you also get a chance to check it out in a big theater and not at home on a small television screen, then I think you should go for it, maybe also if you have not seen anything else from him before that.",

The man had an obvious talent to him, charisma and energy that's hard to deny but this just didn't land right for me. In all fairness, it might be the time involved. I have seen this story, the lower class person who appears fancy, woos the girl only for her to realize he's not rich and they still live happily ever after. This definitely had a slight variation on that but it's still a very familiar story and, even if it did it first, it's hard to reconcile that with how many other stories have done this.I feel like this is a situation where HE is great but the pieces around him just weren't doing it for me.

            "content": "Upon watching City Lights again, I didn't want to write this until the film's anniversary, but I couldn't wait. This is heart-warming, humorous and tear-jerking cinema at its finest. Charlie Chaplin's eternal character, \"the Tramp\", returns for an emotional and wholesome story. We find the Tramp inadvertently meeting another unfortunate character (like the homeless kid in the Kid): a blind, female florist. The plot that ensues makes for a lot of sympathy and interest, without resorting to being sappy or melodramatic. Along the way in the Tramp's efforts to help, he encounters a suicidal man that soon paves the way for landmark slapstick comedy. All three of these characters are very memorable, and they should be a subject of character development within silent films, as they all have justified motivations. You could state that Chaplin created an evocative type of slapstick; mishaps-filled comedy with a bigger meaning. The bigger meaning here, much like the Kid and the Gold Rush, is poverty. He shows how it can affect some of the most needful people. Sadly, when the Tramp exerts his socialism, he becomes even more tattered and helpless than before. What the wonderful Chaplin asked for was for the government to not let the financial status of the world fester any more crucially (as throughout his childhood). Like the Tramp, he seemed selfless, as shown very notably in his Great Dictator speech. His ideology is solidified masterfully in City Lights particularly, though. City Lights enchants with its innocent romance, roaring slapstick, and underlying symbolism of the world's biggest problem. He truly, truly makes his mark on cinema with this film, and that is solidified with the ending. I'd call it the greatest in cinema, as it gets me shedding tears of joy every time. After City Lights has finished, you'll be strongly thinking about the poverty in the world, but mostly the humanity that can overcome it --- as long as you can recover from the laughter. This is why it is one of the greatest films of all-time.",

I thought it was pretty good! But it didn't leave a lasting impression on me.Now I decided to watch it with my dad since he even gave me the idea, and I must say that we enjoyed it immensely. We laughed, we got excited and even got a lump in our throat with that ending. In short, we thought it was phenomenal.I loved the film, the lighting feels alive, giving each actor an emphasis on their face and evoking the most sincere emotions of the film. The camera moves with intent and the shots last much longer than today's movies. The music perfectly accompanies what is happening on screen and is responsible for many laughs.I found the intertitles very purposeful, since they only said the most important thing. There is a great level of subtlety in the choice of words, and for such an expressive film this took me by surprise.There are notable production errors that even have their charm, such as the fact that the titles are not always straight, and that in the final boxing match you can feel the key that holds Charles Chaplin, however I admire the dedication of do these things without the technology needed to correct such errors.The performances are superb. I love how each actor splendidly conveys all the emotions they're feeling. The gentleman who plays the wealthy man is as convincing as a drunk, who never doubts that he was drunk. The young woman who plays the blind girl does a beautiful job of conveying her love for our protagonist and really sells the romance. However, Charlie Chaplin sticks to the film and its simple plot with phenomenal bravery.Excellent movie. A classic.",

            "content": "I wonder how well this movie did at the box office. By 1931 talking pictures were pretty standard fare, so I can't imagine a silent film being too well received. At the same time, this was a Chaplin film and he was already a big star.\"City Lights\" stars Chaplin as the Tramp. He plays his familiar role of struggling guy living day-to-day with a few mishaps here and there. When he saved an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) from drowning himself, the millionaire took him out on the town. The two lived it up until morning when the Millionaire sobered up and didn't know who Chaplin was.Chaplin's only other associate of any kind was the Blind Girl (Virginia Cherrill). She was beautiful and he was in love. He wanted to help her when she got an eviction notice and that led to a world of trouble, but nothing more hilarious than his boxing match with A Prizefighter (Hank Mann). It was comedy gold.One aspect of the movie that wasn't meant for a laugh, but was probably the best part of the movie was Charlie going to jail for a crime he did not commit. He was hanging with his alcoholic rich friend, the Millionaire, when he was robbed. But before he was robbed he drunkenly gave Charlie $1000 to give to the Blind Girl for her rent and an operation to restore her sight.When the drunkard came to, again he didn't recognize Charlie which led to Charlie being pursued for robbery. Charlie got away and gave the $1000 to his blind crush then turned himself in. He served time for robbing the Millionaire though he was totally innocent.Normally I would be chafed at such an injustice, but it seemed to only enhance his character, and make the reunion between him and the blind girl that much sweeter. He returned to the streets with tattier clothes and a more somber look, but you could tell he had a spark of hope that he'd meet his amore again. By chance he saw her again, and even though she didn't recognize him by sight, she recognized the feel of his hands and that was enough for her to know him and know that he was her knight in shining armor.HBO Max.",

The man who was in a daze exchanged drinks with him. After a good time, he gave his car and some money to the tramp.

So, the tramp went for broke, in various ways trying to raise money for the flower girl, even thin arms and legs he would go to the boxing ring to fight. The story here has been a steady progress of joy. Although there are adventures and accidents, the tramp always lives a calm and optimistic life, quietly making the flower girl happy and working hard for her. Despite his devotion to the flower girl, the tramp takes on a low-key, selfless form, such as rolling up wool for her. Even though the flower girl mistakenly wraps all his sweaters around him, he doesn't say a word, and the comedy scene brings out the essence of his kindness. I have seen too many fanatical films showing love, but the subtle but essentially rich love in this film makes people feel warmer than the hysterical love that shouts \"XX, I can't leave you\".",

Would or could \"City Lights\" have worked as a \"talkie\", of course the answer is yes, but so much would have been lost in the process, not least the wonderful, playful musical score Chaplin composed for his feature.The combination and contrast of pathos and humour is masterfully balanced, one minute you're roaring laughing at say, the wonderfully staged boxing bout and the next you're holding back the tears at the end when Virginia Cherrill's fingers wrap themselves around the little tramp's face and you see the revelation of discovery on her face and the humility on his.Chaplin walks us through the streets of contemporary New York City focusing on the plight of both the poor, namely his own character and Cherrill's hand-to-mouth blind flower-seller as well as the rich, in the person of the dipsomaniac millionaire who befriends him after he rescues him from suicide but who can only see him when he's drunk.Yes, some of the physical comedy, slapstick and general buffoonery can seem a little overdone today, but don't forget this is a silent movie and naturally you're going to get a lot of sight-gags. Some might say it's over-sentimental too, but I would just respond to those people by asking them to put their hand on their chest and check they can still feel a beat because truly, if this doesn't move you, you're already gone.",

In City Lights, the best of Chaplin's works, the little tramp is mistaken for a rich man by a blind girl, and taken under the wing of a millionaire, and he does quite well in his new rich life, although he is a tramp. Perhaps this explains the famous W.C. Fields quote: \"a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money.\"So, City Lights is satire of the rich, but it seems to have more dimension than that. It is moving, it is inspiring, it is beautiful. But what makes it beautiful is elusive. It could be the romance, it could be the humor, but more likely, it is the tramp himself, with his little grins and shining eyes. Charlie Chaplin is both a genius director and a genius comic actor, and he was the only one who fully understood his work. And no matter how many speculations there are, nothing will be settled other than the rightful place this film has in cinema history.The ending of this film sticks out most of all as masterful. What does it mean? Will she love him? Will she believe him? Is it melancholy or euphoric? Has the flower stopped wilting? Is that a grin or a tear?

But after 30 minutes the movie really takes off!Unforgettable scenes like picking up the cigar bum, while driving in a Rolls Royce and the sublime boxing scene, makes this movie worth watching.It all accumulates in the final scene, Autumn, one the most touching and emotional scenes created in cinematography.",

What moves me the most is that the little tramp is the essence of decency. The fact that he is a tramp does not make him lazy or not trustworthy. There is a subtle message here about giving of yourself, sacrifice and kindness. I also think the true meaning of love is expressed very well in the relationship between the blind girl and the tramp. And the saddest thing is that even though she will find out he is her benefactor, there is the probability that any true relationship between them is doomed once she has her sight. Could you allow yourself to offer someone the gift of sight knowing as the tramp does that it will end your relationship forever? This is the true meaning of love and giving. I think this film should be required viewing for everyone. You will never ever forget the last 5 minutes of this movie. Great.",

            "content": "If there were any doubts that Charlie Chaplin was way ahead of many of his contemporaries, this work of art will shed them away. The man did it all, and did it expertly. The classic comedic gags are not scarce in the movie and they are great as well. The comedy may not be extremely witty or even funny by today's standards, but honestly, it manages to bring a smile to my face quite frequently. A special nod to the box fight scene, which manages not only to be a smart piece of practical comedy, but also an uneasy moment, because of how much is a stake. You can't help but to feel yourself so expectant and deeply involved that it almost as if you forget the silliness of the situation for a moment. The personal interactions, in my opinion, are also undeniable proof of Chaplin's genius. Be it the interesting intermittent relationship between the Tramp and the millionaire or the tender affection between a blind woman selling flowers and a lowlife with ragged clothes. Chaplin's character is someone who is used to be looked from above, and his sincere happiness is truly poetic, when he finds gratitude from someone who, ironically, can see behind his flawed facade. That's why, to me, it came as shock when I read about the tense relationship between Chaplin and Cherrill and how she got fired from the production at some point. The connection between their characters just oozes out of the screen, in such a way that it seems unbelievable that, actually, it was almost the opposite in \"real life\". On top of all that, for the ones that find silent movies scary, rest assured that the score (composed by Chaplin himself) fits the tone of each scene so perfectly, that, a few minutes in, one already forgets that this is not a 'talkie'. I grant it that the \"speech sounds\" at the first scene of the movie are somewhat off-putting but, luckily, they do not appear for the rest of the movie, and the rest of the sound design is actually pretty well done.I can understand that the way I feel about this movie may sound exaggerated to most people. Even I question myself when I fell so strongly about a work of art and I admit that the nostalgia factor may be playing tricks on me. But sometimes, one must not question their feelings too much, and, in my opinion, the way a number of people feel about City Lights is just like the movie itself: pure and sincere without pretensions. I am usually a thick-shelled \"insensitive\" person when it comes to movies, especially the ones purposefully designed to bring that little tear out. But the ending in this one made my eyes watery. And that says a lot.\"Tomorrow the birds will sing. Be brave. Face life.\"",

The plot could be followed by a five-year old, which is also a breath from all the complicated, deep movies I've been watching recently. And yes, it has some very funny parts, though it seems that the whole plot was written by putting together a bunch of gags that Chaplin had thought about, with no connexion whatsoever but that he made an effort to making them look somehow of a coherent story. I cannot say he wasn't successful.I guess the year it was written (1931) explains the somehow political implication of the tramp and a poor blind lady being the main, good characters, while the butler and the rich man when sober are not likable at all.That being said, is not my favorite comedy, by far. It is also not my favorite Chaplin movie, as he pulls of a much better performance at The Dictator.

Lacking speech, there isn't much plot, and with just gestures and facial expressions there are limits to how much emotional impact the film can have.

            "content": "This is my 3rd favourite film of Chaplin's. Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?BE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.W: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.C: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.A: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.S: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare.PD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.BA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself.EVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal. Rather than your standard romantic movie which is like eating a 15 kg bag of marshmallows in a single sitting.",

            "content": "\"City lights\" is movie with al the characteristic Chaplin elements in it. It has slapstick, melodrama, pantomime and of course the little tramp. The story isn't very complicated and is to a great extent just a framework for the visual gags. Some gags are a little too long but I was really amazed to see the famous boxing scene again. This is not one visual gag, but a whole collection of gags put into one scene.The little tramp has always been an outsider, but in no other Chaplin movie this has been so clear as in \"City lights\". The little tramp only interacts with people who don't see his appearance very clear, that is with a drunken millionaire and a blind girl.The drunken millonaire however does not recognize the little tramp in the scarce moments when he is sober. Bertolt Brecht elaborated on this element in his comedy \"Herr Puntila und Sein Knecht Matti\" (1940), in which Herr Puntila is warm and kind when drunk and cold and cynical when sober. I think however that Chaplin used this plot-element only to accentuate the position of the tramp as an outsider and not as criticism on the capitalist society. This criticism came only later in \"Modern times\" (1936).Unlike the millionaire the blind girl still recognizes the little tramp when her eyes are cured. This happens in the final scene and while the future of the little tramp maybe not so hopefull as at the end of \"Modern times\" (when he walks at the middle of an empy road with his sweetheart) it is still the most emotional moment of the film.\"City lights\" was a silent movie in 1931 when the industry was rapidly transforming to sound since 1927 (the year \"The jazz singer\" from Alan Crosland appeared). Chaplin was a staunch opponent of \"talkies\" and in the beginning he had a few good arguments.Talkies threatened the universality of film, because it introduced differences in languages.Spoken language goes at the expense of body language and thus at the expense of pantomime, which is such an important element in Chaplin movies.Comedy requires long shot takes where for tragedy close ups are more important. The clumsiness of early sound equipment required actors to stay near the microphone.In the opening scene Chaplin ridicules talkies a little bit. We see the unveiling of a monument and accompanying speeches. The speeches however are only unintelligible gibberish, a reference to the (at that moment) bad sound quality of the talkies. Of course the opening scene also makes fun of speeching politicians and Chaplin would do that again, even more convinvingly, in \"The great dictator\" (1940).",

            "content": "The timeless charm that Charlie Chaplin personifies through this film is at its greatest in this, his most graceful work of art. The genuine wit and humor mastered over the years is of course pervasive, but it ultimately plays second fiddle to the delicate eloquence of one of the most powerful love stories to ever grace the silver screen. This is the masterpiece Chaplin had been working towards his entire career, and it is executed incomparably.It is a peculiar thing to consider the title of the film, as the city and its lights don't seem to be an overtly prominent part of the picture. However, upon closer inspection, it truly is all about the city (society and its individuals) and its lights in a figurative sense, as lights in this film can very much refer to the beacons of hope that the individual characters serve as to each other. While the three main characters are just struggling to make it by in this world- to find purpose, to succeed- their own sense of worth in the eyes of society goes unmatched by the light they bring to those who need it.The millionaire's split personality as a suicidal drunkard (a social outcast) serves as the enlightened version of his character because in this state he is honest and mindful of those around him regardless of their status. His sober self, then, although admirable by society's standards, goes to show just how \"blind\" people are to the reality of how we should treat each other. The blind Flower Girl, of course, is incidentally only blind to the true nature of the Tramp when she can physically see. When she learns the truth, the \"light\" goes on for her (\"Yes, I can see now\"), and she can go back to seeing the true nature of an individual rather than their outward appearance. Thirdly, the Tramp is simply a bum meandering through life, until he finds a purpose. Naturally, it takes the city's lowest of the low- The Tramp- to be enlightened enough to see past a handicap and realize the true beauty of the Flower Girl, who is overlooked by the rest of society. As he becomes enlightened to the vitality of living selflessly, the Tramp receives the beacon of hope in return, grasping his dreams for love and a better way of life. Although very different individually, as these characters can see beyond society's little boxes they are each little pillars of light to illuminate the way for each other (something every city could use a lot more of). The Tramp and the Flower Girl, having their eyes opened and having found each other, display one of the most fulfilling of on-screen romances, for as once they were struggling through life individually, they have discovered more than they could ever hope and dream, together. City Lights is a love story of two outcasts, loners; until we find our light, aren't we all?",

            "content": "People say a lot of things about Chaplin's immortality. Actually, they say only one thing many times, over and over again: he is eternal, his films will live forever, a hundred or two hundred years from now humanity will still turn to Charles Chaplin for joy and relief from whatever burdens they may have, as like or unlike our own as those may be. My gut tells me there is truth in this belief, but I don't think with my gut. To be honest, I am not that optimistic. And my doubts don't spring from common sense, either; common sense says, of course, someday everything disappears - so will Chaplin. But other than that, I, as a 17-year-old, know absolutely no one of a similar age that likes Chaplin or remembers having seen any of his movies in recent times. All kids in Pakistan used to see them, and maybe they still do, but no one bothers to stick to it as the years pass. Tom and Jerry et al are still on TV - their place in public consciousness is continuously reinforced; they can legitimately claim timelessness. But what about all the 17-year-olds that would rather watch 'Transformers' and have only dim memories of a funny little man in a shabby top hat, ones that like movies only in passing, without passion? How will these poor people - and they are poorer for it - find 'City Lights'? This is a truly magnificent film. Its enduring greatness (if not enduring popularity) can, of course, be attributed to nostalgia - but only in part. You need never have heard of Charlie Chaplin to enjoy it. It also has the common advantage of all silent films in that it knows no linguistic boundaries; the story, unlike that of a Buster Keaton film, is simple and silent enough that one does not really need even the sparse title cards to follow it. Keaton's films, while silent, tended to be rather talkative, requiring the viewer to do quite a bit of reading. Chaplin is perhaps more widely known than Keaton because he, unlike the latter, can be understood by people who cannot read English or any language at all.Chaplin's comedic timing is flawless. This is not, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film, but it strings together sequence after hilarious sequence of classic slapstick nevertheless: the opening scene on the monument, the one with the suicidal millionaire, the one in the restaurant (my personal favorite), the boxing match - each is immediately familiar and unfailingly funny. (Sophisticated humor? No doubt it has its skillful practitioners and talented writers. I love it. But is it, when you get right down to it, actually any funnier than watching a chair pulled out from under someone's descending rear end? Not on this evidence.) But what sets 'City Lights' apart from other Chaplin films, and classical comedy in general, is its heart.The story is, as I mentioned, disarmingly simple. Chaplin plays The Tramp, a homeless man with an odd mustache, a top hat and a cane, who is always in trouble because of his social ineptitude. He is persecuted because of his shabby appearance. He meets a girl that sells flowers who is kind to him, possibly only because she is blind and thinks he is a gentleman. He saves the life of a drunken millionaire, whose help he needs when the girl has trouble paying her rent. Obstacles arise. The obstacles are the comedy.That really is it. It does not, on paper, sound like masterpiece material, but it is brought to life - partly by humor, yes - but primarily by Chaplin's persona as the Tramp. The Tramp is one of cinema's greatest personalities, the people's champion to end them all. His perennially good intentions, his unflagging good cheer, his clumsiness, his social inadequacy, his underdog status and his constant bedevilment by ridiculous misfortune make us cheer, cheer, cheer like we never have for any other character. It is quite possible that of all the great people invented by the silver screen, Chaplin's Tramp is the easiest to love, and love the most.The movie is, of course, a great technical achievement. It is boundlessly entertaining. Each quirky character, from the flower girl to the millionaire to the class conscious butler, serves its purpose in moving the story towards it conclusion. The conclusion, of course, is one of the finest emotional scenes in movie history; in fact, in its length and low-key conclusion, without fanfare or fireworks, anticipates in a strange way the French New Wave. The ending is abrupt. I spoil nothing by saying you will be joyful when it comes.One of the greatest of all movies. Most highly recommended.",

He even ends up in a boxing match with a boxer off the street (Hank Mann).The story's core is the Tramp's smitten state with the Flower Vendor. The millionaire and boxer provide much comic relief. It's a love story that ends happily.\"City Lights\" is a master of pace and timing and a musical score that fits beautifully with the script. Although this is several years into the sound movie era, this is a triumph of the silent era. Everyone should see Chaplain's masterpiece at least once.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's Romantic Side",
            "content": "This is how you do a comedy that is timeless and heartfelt. Then again, Charlie Chaplin was a legend when it came to making these types of films. The Little Tramp is such an iconic character, even to this day, nearly a century after the Tramp was born in the mind of Chaplin. Chaplin knew how to work with the silent film format to deliver a moving, yet hilarious film. I never knew a silent film would be capable of having me bowled over in laughter. Yet, here we are. There is a reason why critics lauded City Lights as Chaplin's best film. I still think Modern Times is slightly better, but this 1931 feature is right up there. Some of the scenes are just so funny. My favorite sequence, which I am sure others can agree, is the boxing sequence. The Tramp uses a weird choreography to befuddle his opponent and the referee...while having the audience laugh their minds out. I also adored that spaghetti sequence. Finally, when compared to earlier films, Chaplin uses romance more effectively. Throughout the picture, it was easy to fall for a possible romance between the Tramp and the Blind Woman. The ending is heartfelt, moving, and one that is bound to put a smile on your face...even for the most cynical.This is Chaplin's first film since the advent of sound in motion pictures. Chaplin is the only person who could have pulled this off because the Tramp is an iconic character which would only be ruined by sound. Unlike other films from the early sound era, Chaplin did not have to worry about complicated sets. The director never truly believed in the talkies, but he had earned enough goodwill in Hollywood to continue to make what he wanted to. He took that goodwill to make an impressive romantic comedy. Production was tough for him. He admitted that he became neurotic because of all the stress. He did not have good working relationships with his cast as he even fired his leading lady, Virginia Cherrill. He produced many rolls of film which indicated a lengthy production. In the end, it was all worth it. Chaplin considers this film to be his favorite out of all the ones he made. At one of the premieres, Albert Einstein was in attendance and was reportedly in tears by the end. That is a feat in itself.The Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) lives in the big city. The film begins with a sequence with the homeless Tramp being bothersome during a statue unveiling. But he ends up having a large effect on some people's lives. First, he saves this drunk, wealthy man from killing himself. The man's attitude towards the Tramp changes depending on whether he is sober or not. He also has a profound effect on this blind woman who sells flowers and lives with her poor grandmother. He tries to find the money to recover her eyesight, but will she still love the Tramp after she realizes he is not a wealthy man like she believes?Chaplin made a career playing the Little Tramp. It is easily his best role. The character stands out more here because Chaplin gave him depth. He is a sweet little man who remains hilarious as always...yet is given a romantic side that we truly never seen from him before. I felt for him going after this blind girl...and felt the pain when he realizes there could be a chance they will not end up together. The blind girl is played beautifully by Virginia Cherrill. She was plucked out of obscurity when Chaplin discovered her on a California beach set. She had some issues with Chaplin, but that did not seemingly affect her performance. Her nearsightedness was able to help her play a blind woman convincingly.City Lights is a beautiful movie about love. In addition to a romantic side, Chaplin uses comedy just as well as ever. Not everything works, but the scenes that do work are to be forever remembered. The boxing sequence and the ending scene are immortal in terms of influence. Chaplin preferred to use live music in earlier films, so this was the first time he provided a score in any of his films...and it's a great one too. He minimized the use of subtitle cards because he felt the actor's expressions and movements said enough. With talkies now the main source of films, one would think it would be impossible to replicate the success of earlier films. Well, he ended up having the most financially successful and critically lauded film of his career. While not my personal favorite from him, it ranks near the top. It is a funny and heartfelt comedy...a proper comedy that will never be forgotten.My Grade: A-",

            "content": "This film also is a very interesting film to watch, considering where it falls on the film-history timeline, as well as, our real-world history. There is a lot going on here. First off, sound film was invented, about four years before this film was released. It's not a secret that director/actor/legend, Charlie Chaplin, was a little bit resistant to the coming age of sound. You see this immensely in this film, as he tries to \"meet them halfway\" with synchronized sound effects and music, that is used throughout the film. When it comes to dialogue however, it still uses those silent film title cards. It basically is Chaplin saying, \"I was the king of silent film. Give me some time to join the talkies, but here is a taste\".It is actually a joy to see what he comes up with in this film, because the use of sound allowed him to be even more creative with his jokes and skits. This film is very funny. I laughed a lot. That brings me to another part of the timeline. This is a pre-code film, but has nothing in it that would have been a problem for censors. It is a good old-fashioned, family type of comedy film, however just be warned by the rampant alcoholic subject matter, that actually is the driving force of the film's plot. That is another interesting part about this film, as it was released while Prohibition was still going on.Charlie plays, no surprise, a tramp, who falls for a beautiful blind woman, who sells flowers in the part of the city he is now living in. He realizes she is blind and wants to help her with her financial woes. He works some jobs, unfortunately is conned into a boxing match and tries to keep secret from her, his real life as a tramp. While all of this is going on, Charlie runs into a rich millionaire (Harry Myers), who's alcoholism gives him blind amnesia, split personality and a need to commit suicide. He never remembers Charlie when he wakes up sober the next morning, after Charlie keeps him out of trouble all night or stops him from killing himself.These two different plot arcs interweave with each other throughout the film, with a lot of laughs and Chaplin artistry. It is a very funny film and is entertaining till the end. What is really interesting is seeing the negative side of Chaplin's alcoholic buddy, the eccentric millionaire (none of the characters in this film have names), which produces positive results for Charlie and his flower-girl friend. This is an enjoyable film to see. It will please Chaplin fans, audiences, who like \"feel-good\" movies and should be required viewing for film students, considering its place in film history. It was a delight to see.8.2 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

It's pure genius and ties so much with Chaplin's childhood on the streets of Lambeth.I cover the film extensively in my book \"The Charlie Chaplin Walk\" (Stephen P. Smith). The blind flower seller, who he attempts to rescue, represents Chaplin's mother who he failed to rescue from her madness. And the drunk represents his father, sometimes dismissive, sometimes pleased to see him and Chaplin plays the child in that dynamic.Importantly, and I've never seen this pointed out anywhere, the drunk and the flower girl never meet in the film; they are two distinct stories joined by the presence of Chaplin (The Tramp) which mirrors Chaplin's own childhood where he never was in the presence of his mother and father at the same time. His mother was the poor woman who needed rescuing and his father the unreliable drunk.",

For anyone today, City Lights may be seen as his crowning achievement, and it comes as no surprise.Charlie combined the visual comic flair and superbly crafted drama that adorned his previous legendary films, but added an extra touch that is difficult to explain. The majority of this film is gold, with several sequences that are engraved into the public conscience such as the boxing match, the Tramp sleeping on a statue and of course, that moving finale.The film is a simple love story between the Little Tramp and a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill). Along the way, the Tramp tries to support the girl and her grandmother, while striking up a friendship with an alternately drunk/sober millionaire (played by Harry Myers). Its simplicity adds to how effective the film is, and not only because of the fact it is silent and black & white.I urge every fan of film to watch this masterpiece. Sure, the effects are sometimes poor (you see strings on Charlie in the boxing match); but even if it was just for that magical finale that completes a film that has set the template for romantic comedies for all eternity, then it would still be worth watching.'City Lights' is truly a classic of cinema that will be remembered forever and will be loved for just as long.",

Chaplin's humor still hold up, 80 odd years later, with some slapstick tactics that Adam Sandler and the lot should pick up on.

Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's \"little tramp\" character makes two acquaintances. He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide. In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help. His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film. \"City Lights\" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh.

            "content": "There's no messing around with this, Chaplin's 7th outing as The Tramp. He's literally unveiled in the opening scene. It doesn't have much baring on the story, a mere appetiser to ease us in, before we get to the famous flower girl scene and The Tramp falls in love. He does this a lot doesn't he, but he's so sweet. As is his source of affection, the blind girl (Virginia Cherrill), beautiful but lonely... a bit like The Tramp. There is a bit more filler in City Lights, budgets were getting bigger, as does the cast and the sets. It all still works though as The Tramp meets and saves a millionaire (Harry Myers) at the end of his rope. He's a flamboyant drunk, perfect for Chaplin to play off of. They're both quick to defend each other's honour, getting into scrapes at parties and running around town on the millionaire's dime. Until he once more runs into the girl and she again mistakenly takes him for a richer man, but falls for him. Does she love the man or the money? When The Tramp's wealthy friend sobers up, he's a different man. Leaving The Tramp to find ways of helping the girl who's luck is going from bad to worse. Of course, each opportunity giving Chaplin the chance to raise his slapstick game. Soon though, The Tramp realises that the situation with the girl is more desperate than he thought. This is the thing about these films, yes they're funny, light in tone on the surface, but they're brimming with heart. The Tramp is the epitome of that heart, he's selfless, willing to take on any cause and willing to go the distance, even putting himself in danger in the boxing ring against a ruthless prizefighter and giving up he's freedom over a misunderstanding with the law. I'm typical fashion it goes round the houses to reach it's inevitable end, but the finale will melt your heart. I've not found anything to match The Kid yet, but this comes close.",

We even get to see the tramp in a boxing match which is equally funny. This is a silent movie but it talks to us in many ways. The unending vigor and affirmative outlook of the tramp which teaches a lesson or two, the tramp-millionaire relationship with its classist undertones, the girl's relationship with her benefactor whom she can't see. All this amalgamates to form something wonderful. A classic in every respect. 10/10 :)",

Filmed during the height of the Great Depression the situation of life in America has never been caught like this before.The Tramp is hoboing around town doing whatever odd jobs he can find. One day during one of his outings he meets an attractive woman who has an eye sight problem. Smitten, the Tramp vows that she'll see once again. So, he does whatever he has to do to get this young woman to see. He befriends a wealthy drunkard after he saves his life. The problem is that he only recognizes him when he's sloshed out of his gourd. What really moves this film is the great lengths that the Tramp will put his body through for love.

The average moviegoer only thinks of Chaplin with a few cliched aspects of his Little Tramp character, but in City Lights, Chaplin lays out an astonishing, positively delightful, and phenomenal masterpiece of cinema which still today says as much as any other film I've seen.I count City Lights in my top three films of all time, and I've noticed that a recent national critic survey has placed it among their top 100.  The bottom line is that if you haven't yet seen it, watch carefully with open eyes and heart, and understand the genius which is Charles Chaplin.",

Chaplin, in his persona of The Tramp (replete with disconcertingly Hitler-y moustache), falls in love with a beautiful flower seller (Virginia Sherrill).

Across the course of their love story, the Tramp goes from low to high to low to very low and ultimately, to one of the purest moments of joy ever shown on screen.

The film is quite straight forward plot-wise: there's this tramp guy who falls in love with a blind girl who's selling white flowers. She's quite nice to him, in strike contrast to almost every other person in the whole city, and so he can't get her out of his mind. That night he meets a weird, suicidal rich guy, saves his life and so begins a peculiar friendship (of sorts) between the two. These are the main plotlines, which of course affect each other at all times.This film is...well...it's okay. I don't have a lot to say about it, but I'll try my best to explain my feelings here. Some moments here made me smile, alright. Some moments were quite fun. I particularly enjoyed the \"let's burn the city\" scene, at the party. Fun dynamics and good flow all around. The way this film utilizes sound is also pretty cool, and I can definitely appreciate how the score emphasizes many comic moments, similar to the way old Disney films do it.However, I can't say that I'm emotionally invested in the slightest, that the comedy always hits (as I said, mostly amusing but nothing more) or even that the characters are more than a bunch of clich\u00e9s. That's just the way it is. Again, nothing bad, but many things are just mediocre at best.So, yeah, I definitely don't understand the disproportionate hype around this piece of cinema. It's amusing, yeah, it has some fun moments, but it's mostly dry and full of clich\u00e9s. The humor is nothing more than okay most of the time, and I'm just not that invested in the movie. Extremely overrated. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one.",

            "content": "Although Charlie Chaplin counted THE GOLD RUSH as his personal favorite of his films, the consensus among critics and historians is that CITY LIGHTS represents the summit of his genius. The American Film Institute rates it as the greatest of all romantic comedies, even ninety years after it was made. Chaplin's peers in the director's chair also have a reverence for CITY LIGHTS: it's one of the favorite films of Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, Guillermo Del Toro, Andrei Tarkovsky, Federico Fellini....and ugh! Woody Allen.Although you wouldn't know it from its running time, CITY LIGHTS consumed three years of Chaplin's life, from the pre-production stage in 1928 to it's release in 1931. Normally, that kind of lengthy Kubrickian shoot would be compatible with a three hour epic, not a silent comedy barely clocking in at ninety minutes. But being an independent artist with his own studio meant that Chaplin could develop his project without having to answer to any executive breathing down his neck.Aside from Erich von Stroheim, Chaplin was the most perfectionist filmmaker of his era, often starting production without a finished script. He was one of those rare directors who liked to develop his story as he moved along, ordering an excessive number of takes, to the frustration of his co-stars. In lieu of a screenplay, Chaplin would pantomime how he wanted his actors to perform, right down to the last extra on the set.Chaplin and his leading lady Virginia Cherrill -playing the blind flower girl- didn't get along. He would frequently explode with anger if she didn't act out a scene precisely how he wanted. Chaplin also disapproved of the 20-year old Cherrill's active nightlife either, and the tension got to the point when he would fire her out of frustration. After terminating her services, Chaplin realized that he'd filmed too much footage of her to start anew with another actress. Cherrill got wind of this somehow, for she offered to return to complete CITY LIGHTS....for double her salary. Chaplin grudgingly rehired her.",

The one thing City Lights misses is the true meaning that everyone should hear - The Great Dictator has that.The plot is about a tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who falls in love with a beautiful young flower girl. Being blind she suspects the tramp to be rich.There's a great range of humour in the great dictator - ranging from a scene subtle making fun of talkies (City Lights is a silent film) to a blatantly slapstick boxing match. This film could be enjoyed by people of all ages.When you think of a modern comedy you get slightly disappointing, because they have nothing on City Lights.

That producer would be perfectly cast as Charlie Chaplin.Reams of stuff have been written by critics about how the comic genius Chaplin was a sentimentalist who was capable of conveying sympathy and pathos at the same time that he mocked the silliness and pretensions of modern society. This is so often written that I wonder if anyone in the audience has ever gotten the idea that Chaplin was a ruthless satirist, especially when it came to an underclass made up of vagrants and criminals who were the butt of most of his jokes.A great artist and craftsman, Chaplin was extremely industrious, was never a tramp himself, almost never unemployed (dating back all the way to childhood); he was knighted and was quite the proper gentleman. Although he might have been amused if anyone had confused him with the feckless bums he often portrayed, in reality he probably had only the intention of making the audience ridicule such characters. In his ragged suit and derby and walking like he has a broomstick lodged up his rear, Chaplin's Little Tramp represents the familiar character of the once wealthy young rake now fallen on hard times, the poor little no longer rich boy who has to survive on the generosity of his wealthy patrons or scratch out a living among the dregs of society (pugs, convicted criminals). Chaplin probably thought the ultimate joke is on the audience when it sheds tears over the romantic misfortunes of a type of person on whom pity is wasted.",

            "review_title": "Probably Chaplin's Finest Film. A Silent Masterpiece.",
            "content": "In regards to silent cinema, the first name that usually comes to mind is either Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, both who in their own rights, were both masters in their field, as they both created some of the best and most well known films in the history of cinema. As for what I would say is my favorite of Chaplin's films, it would probably be this one.City Lights is a flawless film that may very will be the best thing that Charlie Chaplin made. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with a sense of pathos. More specifically, the movie contains trademark Chaplin comedy, as the funny scenes are genuinely funny and are certain to make the audience laugh, however, the dramatic moments are indeed dramatic, which showed that Chaplin could be extremely versatile in his abilities as a filmmaker.The film stars Chaplin as his iconic persona as The Tramp. In this film, the Tramp meets this young flower girl that he falls in love with, and, upon discovering that she's unable to see, becomes determined to help her. Eventually, he crosses paths with a millionaire, and this may potentially lead to him reaching his goal. Throughout the course of the film, plenty of hilarious moments ensue, while at the same time, so does quite a bit of the aforementioned sense of pathos, which combine to make what one might consider to be one of the most beautiful films ever made.Chaplin's Tramp character is much like the other films that said persona appeared in, he's the average individual who gets caught up in situations, both funny and dramatic. Some of the funny moments include the beginning where he gets entangled on a statue and has a hard time trying to get down. There's also a scene where he gets a job as a street cleaner, and tries to wash his hands while one of his co-workers is trying to make a sandwich, which results in the co-worker accidentally eating a bar of soap. Then there's also the hilarity of one of the most famous scenes in the film, a boxing match in which the Tramp competes in to win money to help the aforementioned blind girl, a match that doesn't go according to plan. However, like I also said, there are some more dramatic moments to them, which as I also said before, showcases Chaplin's versatility.In addition to Chaplin, there's also some great supporting performances. Among said roles include Harry Myers, who plays the millionaire who becomes friends (well, depending on what frame of mind he's in) with the Tramp, and even becomes something of an assistant to him in is mission to help the girl he loves. However, the best one after Chaplin would have to be Virginia Cherrill, who plays the blind girl that Chaplin becomes determined to help. Their interactions with each other are probably among the most touching I've seen in any movie, because even though they have problems understanding each other due to the girl's blindness, one can still feel a sense of compassion amongst the two, which leads to one of the most heartwarming endings in cinema. The ending of the film (and I won't say what it is), which has been talked about for decades, is one that will definitely move the audience (if not more).Ultimately, City Lights is a breathtaking, funny, and very moving experience that definitely has a tendency to captivate those who view it. While I definitely would recommend this masterpiece to those who have yet to see it, I would not recommend it if they're discovering silent films for the first time, because while the film is outstanding, the sense of pathos might prove to be too much for first time silent film viewers. If that's the case, then some of the films of Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd would be perfect for entering the silent foray, and if that proves to work, then give Chaplin a try, as his movies are among the finest of all time. Some might debate that there are better films that Chaplin made, but at the same time, there are probably those who would say that this is his best, which is a sentiment that I can definitely agree with. If you see this film, and you end up being entranced by it, then you've seen one of the best movies from the era, and one of the best of all time even.",

            "content": "In 1914, Charlie Chaplin created one of the most recognizable and beloved movie icons of all time. With City Lights in 1931, the world said goodbye to him. In this context, it is easy to see how anyone even remotely a fan of the tramp would hold this film dear to their hearts and quietly champion it as one of the best films ever made.Now, to be clear, City Lights wasn't actually the tramp's last appearance in cinema. That came five years later, in Modern Times. However, by looking back to the time in which this film was made, and with the benefit of seeing it from our perspective in history, we can see why it was considered a bittersweet goodbye to the lovable tramp. With the advent of talkies in 1928, it would be a great understatement to say that film was forever changed. To this day some still debate whether that was a positive change or not. One thing is certain, that a great number of careers were ruined by the advent of sound. One of the biggest stars of the silent era was Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. As the years went by and talkie productions began outnumbering silent films ten to one, the world waited with bated breath to see how Chaplin would adjust to this major change. Finally, he answered with City lights. What everyone was expecting was for Chaplin to present the tramp in his first talkie, and in fact Chaplin was under immense studio pressure to do so. He stuck to his guns though, and presented them with what he must have felt was a goodbye letter to the silent era.All things considered, silent films could not have asked for a more elegant farewell. City Lights is an excellent example of everything that makes silent films superior to talkies, according to some. There's the trademark slapstick comedy, which still leaves audiences in stitches. This brand of comedy simply wouldn't work in a film with sound. Replaced two years later with the first Three Stooges short and their brand of somewhat cruder slapstick, Chaplin's humour necessitated silence. The acting in city lights was superb. The kind of subtlety that is called for in silent films is used to perfection here, displaying plot and emotion unmistakably without ever seeming to be overacting. This is due, no doubt, in part to the legendary perfectionism displayed by Chaplin during the filming of City Lights. Shooting 342 takes of one scene illustrates a level of passion for the film, which is evident in every frame.This is a film without a villain, really. The two main characters are extremely likable. The closest it has to an antagonist is the millionaire, however this is only half the time, and without him the Tramp would not be able to pursue his courtship of the flower girl. The tramp acts as a sort of guardian angel to his millionaire friend, saving him from suicide on several occasions. In almost every other scene, he is struggling to provide for the flower girl who holds his heart. She is the classic picture of noble poverty, never complaining, selling flowers everyday to provide for her grandmother and herself. The two of them are outsiders, struggling to find acceptance and love while being trapped by poverty, and in the flower girl's case, physical disability. In one memorable scene, when we first see her home, she seems jealous of a couple next door and the shot lingers on an image of a bird in cage. Later on the Tramp is literally caged when sent to prison for theft. In the ending, which is touted by some as the most perfect conclusion in film history both are freed from their respective cages when the Tramp is released and the flower girl is cured of her blindness. Now that they are free they can finally find acceptance within another.While not a true silent film, as it has a music track and sound effects, City Lights is in many ways the quintessential silent film. It was also one of Chaplin's last. After this he went into semi-retirement and made only a handful of films before passing away. Given this, and the fact that every scene drips with semi-sweet sentimentality, it is little wonder that fans of the era treasure it much the same way that fans of TV shows get misty-eyed thinking about the series finale of their favourite show. This is not to belittle it, as even non-fans can appreciate its message and storytelling. As James Hamilton said, \"If you don't like this movie, there is just something wrong with you\".",

The set piece action sequences are funny, smartly done, and unpredictable. There's no talking in the film, but you can pick out almost exactly what the characters are saying. It's brilliantly funny adult humor - sometimes raunchy, sometimes pointing out the charming idiosyncrasies of high society. The characters act smartly and the shot selection is bordering on perfect. The framing for shots is extremely well picked, and the plot is well paced.In my eyes, the film accomplishes everything that Charlie Chaplin set out to accomplish. It's very very funny and very smart at the same time. A masterclass on filmmaking for those that are on a tight budget! A classic for sure.",

            "review_title": "City Lights shines",
            "content": "City Lights is something of a case that sometimes the old ways are the best ways. Released in 1931, four years after the advent of sound in film, Charlie Chaplin made the bold decision to keep his famous character, the Little Tramp, occupying a world silent but for music. The story of City Lights is far from a complex one; it concerns the Tramp falling in love with a blind flower girl and also befriending a troubled millionaire, with ample amounts of visual and physical comedy thrown into the mix. But in many ways, the film's simplicity is central to its enduring appeal.The film opens with the grand unveiling of a statue at a public ceremony, with the pomp of the preceding speeches sardonically represented by droning kazoo noises. The veil over the statue is lifted, revealing the Tramp sleeping upon it. Awakened by the public outrage at his conduct, he tries to climb down from the statue, but his baggy and hole-ridden trousers end up getting caught. Not only does this scene tell us everything we need to know about the Tramp and his social standing right away but, as with the rest of the comedy in this film, it goes on for just as long as it reasonably can. The Tramp's dismount from the statue is long ordeal involving snagging trousers, a badly timed rendition of the national anthem, and an accidental disrespect upon the statue's face. Once the audience has about seen it all, and just as the humour begins to wane, the film promptly moves onto the next scene. I think there is something to be admired about Chaplin's ability to play out a gag and get as much mileage from it as possible, especially without ever tiring the audience. I suspect few other filmmakers would depict a character eating a streamer they've mistaken for the pasta noodles on their plate for more than a couple seconds, let alone for the full minute or so that we see here.It's probably none too shocking that the film is funny; at this point in Chaplin's career comedy was an older hat than that sitting atop the Tramp's head. What is surprising is its delicate and tender approach to the love story that it tells. Before seeing City Lights, I might have thought that a silent romance film was a terrible idea. It seems that most modern cinematic portrayals of romance are defined by grand and verbal declarations of love, about love meaning never having to say you're sorry or never letting go. But here the relationship between the Tramp and the Flower Girl is so wonderfully sweet in its straightforwardness. In reality, there are so many nuances to human speech and communication that complicate matters; being able to put feelings into the correct words, misunderstandings in phrasing or tone, or just the overall capacity to lie and deceive that all cast in question whether a person really means what they say. However, none of this applies in a silent film. The Tramp loves the Flower Girl for her blind lack of derisive judgement on himself and his social status; she, in turn, loves him for the apparent generosity and kindness that she inspires in him. The motivations in this romance are clear, and its presented almost exclusively through expressions and gestures that can't be taken as anything less than sincere. Without the complicated burden of dialogue, this love story becomes more easily believable.Take, for example, a scene near the end of the film where the Tramp presents to the Flower Girl a large sum of money that he has gone through considerable trouble to acquire. The Tramp slyly stashes away some of the money for himself, unbeknownst to her, but gifts the rest to the Flower Girl for her to pay her rent and receive a blindness curing surgery. The Flower Girl is overjoyed, and kisses the Tramp in gratitude; the Tramp, visibly flattered, subtly gives the Flower Girl the small amount of money he had kept for himself. These few gestures say so much about the care that exists between the two characters, and wordlessly demonstrates the levels of selflessness that she brings out in him. Nothing needs to be said out loud about her making him want to be a better person. The audience simply sees it and believes it.City Lights also has the wherewithal to keep the romantic heart of the story in clear view, even amidst its scenes of comedy, such as when the Tramp enters into a boxing match in an attempt to earn the money needed for the Flower Girl's rent. Despite being badly outmatched and obviously daunted, the Tramp doesn't run away and gives his all in trying to win. Then, while in a beaten daze and being tended to between rounds, he imagines one of the men in his corner as being the Flower Girl. This is a great reminder to the audience of what exactly the Tramp is fighting for, as well as a set up to a great gag wherein the Tramp lovingly kisses this man's hand, much to the latter's disgust. Further, the character of the Millionaire works well in this regard. When we are first introduced to him, he is in a drunken and suicidal state, distressed over his wife having left him. It's an eloquent way of reminding us just how universal matters of the heart are - rich or poor, we all want to be loved.Charlie Chapin did quite a bit of work behind the camera on this picture - directing, producing, writing, editing, and composing the music for it - but his work in front of the camera is arguably the most commendable of all. It might go without saying that he pulls off physical comedy amazingly well. Whether he's slipping on a dance floor as if it's covered in ice or being suddenly pulled off a dock and into the water like a spectacular ragdoll, Chaplin plays it all like a living cartoon and really makes the most of the visual medium. Beyond that, there is an incredible poignancy to his performance here as well. Chaplin's acting during the final scene, where the Tramp's face runs through an entire array of emotions upon realizing that the once blind Flower Girl can now see him, is magnificent and incredibly touching.The music of the film deserves some mention too. Much like another romance film I'm quite fond of, Punch-Drunk Love, the soundtrack of City Lights uses contrast very effectively. The music in most scenes is quite loud, frenetic, and occasionally chaotic, such as in the boxing scene, but whenever the Tramp and the Flower Girl are on screen together the soundtrack melts into a soft and sweet medley. I feel this imparts a relative sense of calm, similar to the emotional calm that his love for the Flower Girl provides the Tramp in his otherwise turbulent life.Ultimately, I believe the lasting appeal of City Lights is in the message it provides. The final scene of the film doesn't specifically tell the audience what finally becomes of the Tramp and the now sighted Flower Girl. What the film does tell us though is that she can finally see him and, after a moment's hesitation, smiles, seeming to accept him for who he is. And the Tramp, knowing that she can finally see, slowly breaks into a smile of joy. For him it's enough to know that he's managed to help the woman that he loves, and the emotional profundity of this sticks with the audience long after the film is over. There's something so wonderfully heartening in the idea that even the oddest and most socially outcast of people are able to love and be loved.",

The way the Tramp was introduced reminded me of Jack Sparrow's introduction in the 5th Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The Tramp must've served as the original inspiration.The music did a really great job at matching with the actions. The film has a great use of whip pans, and the wide shots are set up well to have a satisfying comedic climax. The manhole opening and closing without him knowing was funny and a creative use of dramatic irony, but it loses something when he actually falls in.The boxing match was fun because of all the turnarounds, and there was no way of predicting the outcome, because it would be expected for the Tramp to lose and hurt himself, yet at the same time, his incompetence is also his greatest strengths, so it could have played either way.The dialogue in the end wasn't neccessary after they held hands. It was evident that she knew who he was, and that he knew she knew. Nothing really needed to be said after that.But nonetheless, it was still an entertaining film.",

An interesting note is that, in a time when soundtrack movie was rising, Chaplin remains faithful to the unspoken movie, using just a musical background, or a few sound effects. Even if the conflict is born in dialogues, the powerful use of mimics, especially facial mimics, render the story in a certain way, reducing written cards along the movie to a few, just for the main guidance.",

It purely is my level of enjoyment during my experience of watching the movie. As a 23 year old in 2015, with limited experience in watching silent movies, in fact, just this and \"The Kid\" so far. It's hard for me to truly appreciate the movie. Unfortunately as time goes by, City Lights (just like all movies this old), will slowly fall down popularity lists like the IMDb Top 250. That is not to take away anything from what is so obviously a masterpiece of it's era. The movies that came before our times will always have their place, and people intrigued enough by our history in general, and the history of cinema, will always give movies like this, time, even if 6 out of 10 does seem like I am dismissing it.During my time watching, I had fun in parts. There were parts where I was bored, tired. This is down to where I am at in the comedy evolution scale. I'm in 2015, I love \"The Office UK\". Me personally, I'm not going to laugh anymore when I see someone hit their head constantly. This is not ALL that happens in the movie, but you get my drift. Though luckily enough for older fans, i'm a rare breed these days; just because something doesn't entertain me to the highest possible level, I won't just brush it off and call it \"shit\". My 6 stars come from a respect of the entertainment and therefore intrigue to watch. The freshness of it to someone who is new to silent movies. The freshness of watching a screen legend like Charlie Chaplin for only the 2nd time. The powerful ending. What it leaves me with, for example, I will have more fun thinking back to this movie, than I had actually watching it. The reason for that is I can cancel out the bits that bore me. I am left with some great characters, and my imagination. The Blind Girl, there is a beauty about blind people that only blind people can attain. An unfortunate but also fortunate naivety about the world. I love the story of the tramp and the blind girl. It's something that i'll remember.If you like silent movies, you've already seen this movie. If you don't like silent movies, you'll hate this movie. If you're not sure whether you like silent movies, try watching a master of his generation, if only for that reason. See what happens. I did, and i'm glad that I did, as Charlie Chaplin is now floating around inside my mind for a while, and I like him there.",

It also to some extent defies our 21 century notion of love about finding the perfect match. The encounter between the tramp and the blind girl was simple. They didn't even go on dates.Their mutual affection started with the tramp's sympathy for the girl, and evolved as the tramp started to get more involved in the girl's life. The tramp appeared as a weak little man but being in love made him brave enough to tackle a boxing match.The movie conveys something very pure and clean about love, and makes you ponder that love is most beautiful when it's simple.

            "content": "City Lights by Charlie Chaplin is a silent film released in 1931; it can be clearly categorized in a comedy genre. The movie director and lead character (the tramp) is Charlie Chaplin. The blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill. Those two characters love grown all along the movie, but during the hour and a half, the film lasted, the tramp set you on another journey full of laughs which were the main purpose of the film in my opinion.The theme is: life is worth living and can be much better with your smile on. Since it is a silent movie the names of the characters are not known. The fact that the tramp was the person that give his life back to the millionaire and the blind girl, is one aspect that illustrates why life is worth living is the theme of the movie. It is a silent movie. Besides the story itself, the choice of the director to go for a silent movie even though at that point it was possible to do the movie with sound is to emphasize the theme. That choice was made to distinguish the other movies front this one ,and to show how great and exceptional it could be. Even though it was a silent movie it is a classic American film, because of its simplicity and it the theme; regardless of the time period is a theme such as life is worth it, will always be an up to date theme. The historical context is also great because it was after the first World War; it gives hope. Those three points helped to illustrate the theme.In 1992 , the Tom and Jerry movie was released; the theme of life is worth it can be also found in this movie. because of the story , the humor and the simplicity of the story, the both movies are similar in key points that that support the same theme.There is two specific technique used in the film that has retained my attention. The absence of any dialogue is most obvious. To compensate with that the director used the transitions to let the watcher know what is happening when it was essential . For instance, at several moment in the movie, there were black screens with a simple sentence written on it. The second point is the angle there is very few close up scene, only with the pretty girl and the hug scene at the end of the movie. That choice for the angles helps the watcher to concentrate more on the facial expression, emotional and non-verbal communication to compensate the non-dialogue when it is close up scene. When the camera is far the actions of the characters are more put in the spotlight..I personally liked this movie a lot, loved to laugh for an hour and a half and adored to watch it again.",
