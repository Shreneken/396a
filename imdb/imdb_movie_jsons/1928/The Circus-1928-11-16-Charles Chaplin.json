            "review_title": "Charlie of the Sawdust",
            "content": "THE CIRCUS (United Artists, 1928) written, produced, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, is a well-documented gem about circus life, mixing comedy and sentiment in the best Chaplin tradition, ranking this one of his finer yet neglected achievements of the 1920s.In it, Chaplin plays a tramp who drifts at the midway of the circus after being wrongly accused of a theft and chased by a policeman. His escapades are mistaken as part of the act, which stirs roars of laughter from its audience. Because his circus has not been earning any profits, the ringmaster/owner (Allan Garcia) decides in hiring Charlie as his top attraction. However it is learned that Charlie is only funny whenever he blunders to his viewing public. Charlie soon learns from the abused Merna (Merna Kennedy), how valuable he really is, thus, making demands of quitting to his employer unless he ceases mistreating his stepdaughter, and offers him a higher salary, which he does. All goes well until Rex (Henry Crocker), \"King of the High Wire,\" joins the circus and becomes attracted to Merna, causing Charlie to vie for her affections any which way he can.With the circus being one of the more famous backdrops of many movie comedians and/or comedy teams ranging from W.C. Fields to Laurel & Hardy, The Marx Brothers to Martin and Lewis, THE CIRCUS stands out more for its ingenious use of difficult gags, comic timing and the effort that went into it to make every gag funny as well as realistically done. Rarely seen since its original theatrical release, THE CIRCUS came into full view again shortly after Chaplin's death in 1977. Newly scored and restored by Chaplin himself in 1968 (as mentioned in the new opening titles), with his singing of \"Swing Little Girl\" recorded on the soundtrack during the opening credits, my first experience with THE CIRCUS was in 1980 at New York City's Regency Theater, 68th Street and Broadway, where the revival theater (which no longer exists, having been demolished in 1998) paid a tribute to Chaplin with a series of shorts and features, including THE KID (1921), MODERN TIMES (1936) and THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). Being surrounded by an appreciative audience laughing at a silent film made long ago indicated d THE CIRCUS has stood the test of time and what a comic genius Chaplin was, especially when demonstrating how difficult performing comedy can be as his character finds he has to be funny and isn't, and at the same time showing how poor he is as a comic to the circus staff and how funny he is as a bad comedian to the movie audience. While sitting in the dark movie theater of all ages at the Regency, the biggest laughs occurred during the opening as Chaplin hides from the law inside a fun house surrounded by mirrors and later making a fool out of the rival pickpocket (Steve Murphy) as they each attempt to fool the policeman by pretending to be movable statues; Charlie's encounter with a lion while locked inside the cage; and the biggest topper of all being Charlie doing a tight rope wire act and trying to balance himself while loose monkeys crawl all over him, thus disrupting his act. These same gags obviously brought forth many laughs in 1980 as it did in 1928, and continue to do so today. In between these gags comes pathos, which Chaplin also succeeds without hurting the continuity.Chaplin staff players regulars such as Harry Bergman as the Clown, and Stanley Sanford as the Head Property lead fine support. Others in the cast include Betty Morrissey as The Vanishing Lady; George Davis as The Magician; John Rand, Albert Austin and Heinie Conklin in smaller roles.In spite of its true greatness, it's hard to believe how underrated THE CIRCUS has become, not having the appreciation as Chaplin's own masterpieces, THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and CITY LIGHTS (1931), even by Chaplin himself. It's been said that during the making of THE CIRCUS, Chaplin was going through personal problems of his own, including divorce and the passing of his mother. It's even more ironic the elimination of THE CIRCUS from Chaplin's own autobiography published in 1964 while his other works were profiled to great extent, regardless of his nomination as Best Actor and Best Comedy Director by the Academy for 1927-28 awards. At least this has been amended through its reissue throughout the years to a new generation of movie lovers.Distributed onto video cassette as part of the Chaplin centennial collection in 1989, THE CIRCUS, currently on DVD, made its presence known on television in the height of cable television, notably on the weekly series, \"Dead Comics Society\" on the Comedy Channel hosted by Kevin Kline around 1989-90, followed by American Movie Classics (1997-2000) and Turner Classic Movies where it made its debut in 2003.THE CIRCUS, a 70 minute comedy, is a fine study to film students and anyone appreciating and supporting the art of silent comedy.

It is (easily) one of the funniest movies ever, and the inventiveness of such shots as the Mirror Maze scene and the closing sequence are nothing less than brilliant. What separates Chaplin from other comedian filmmakers is his ability to evoke a sense of pity and/or sympathy for his character. How can you watch the closing scenes of this film and, even after all of the laughter, NOT sense a bit of melancholia welling up in your heart? Truly one of the greats.",

I don't know why that would make a difference with the story, but it did as I found it very good for the entire distance, although that's just a scant 69 minutes.In the story, Charlie Chaplin does his normally-great physical slapstick so well that he accidentally becomes a hit at the circus, which is run by a nasty man (Allan Garcia) who regularly beats his sweet step-daughter, played by a very pretty Merna Kennedy. Charlie, of course, gets smitten by her and comes to her rescue.This movie has a different kind of ending that what you'd normally see for a comedy but it's inspiring as Chaplin performs a noble deed. (However, Kennedy's character is in question as she seems satisfied to marry either of two men. Huh?)Chaplin's timing and clever slapstick routines never fail to amaze me. Even though silent films aren't seen by many people these days, it's works of art like this that will endure forever. This is not of one of Chaplin's more famous movies.....but it should be. I think it's one of his best.",

It's full of very funny routines along with plenty of action, with enough of a story to make you care about the characters, too.The setting in \"The Circus\" certainly gives Chaplin a lot of ready-made material, and he makes the most of it, coming up with hilarious routines involving everything from a hall of mirrors to a lion.  His 'Tramp' character gets involved in all kinds of amusing predicaments that involve several other interesting characters.  Most of it keeps a pretty light tone, which makes the serious parts that much more effective.  And there are several sequences which, though perhaps not as well known as some of the scenes from other Chaplin films, are quite funny and creative.With plenty of humor and Chaplin's trademark sympathetic characters, this is a very enjoyable feature for anyone who appreciates classic comedy.",

            "review_title": "Perfect Chaplin, Perfect Comedy...",
            "content": "The Circus (1928)Charlie Chaplin had a string of silent feature films in the 1920s that were and are his classics, ending with a couple of amazing capstones in the 1930s. And though he is famous for having carried on the silent tradition well beyond everyone else (understandably, given his style), this one finished shooting only three weeks after the first talkie, so this is a true cusp film. And it took two years to plan and film (starting in 1926).And in some ways this is the best of them all for the simple reason that it avoids that occasional cloying sentimentality that you either love or tolerate in his other classics. It's a pure, light, clever, cinematically sophisticated comedy. And the physical tricks, the timing of certain gags, is breathtaking. It also has a deeply satisfying ending, shot in 1927...which you might see echo of in the last moments of \"Being There\" with Peter Sellars, from 1999.\"The Circus\" is just over an hour and it never flags, never repeats, is never strained. Chaplin had the rare ability to do the most outrageous things and make them seem perfectly plausible--even though we know better. It's partly because he would do dozens of takes, \"perserverance to the point of madness,\" as he said, until it felt right. A note on the sound. This was a true silent film on its release. In the 1960s and 70s, Chaplin created musical soundtracks, composed by himself (and made edits, as well) for his earlier features. The song sung over the opening credits on the Warner Bros. DVD is Chaplin himself, as an old man, singing a song he composed. It's not really legit, in terms of period (1928), but it feels good. The music is fairly innocuous, but a bit too emphatic at times. Still, it's better than the add-on tracks most silent films get these days, and Chaplin was smart to have paid it attention.Most of all, this is funny, uncompromised Chaplin genius. Maybe the best way to get introducted to his large body of work. See it!!",

            "review_title": "\"Bring on the funny man\"",
            "content": "When Charlie Chaplin first plods onto screen in The Circus, he has his back to us. Unusual for any other leading man, but Chaplin was such a legendary icon, even now when he was only making one film every few years, his mere outline was enough to announce his presence. But with such a status came a certain weariness, and The Circus is one of a number of pictures in which Chaplin lampoons the whole process that made his name.A lot of the business in The Circus is about Chaplin's ability to be naturally comical, and the shortcomings of being an employed comedian. It's interesting how, more than any Chaplin picture that came before or after, The Circus seems to be putting us (the audience) into the little tramp's experience. There are a number of point of view shots, and often characters addressing Charlie are virtually staring into the lens, as opposed to the profile shots he usually stuck to. Even the shots in the ring do not give us the perspective of the big top crowd, and instead the camera looks in on the action from the performers' entrance. The camera is always in the sawdust and never the stalls. This is, from its very first scene, clearly a backstage movie. It may seem a subtle shift but Chaplin is certainly drawing us more to focusing on the lives of circus folk and away from thinking of the circus as entertainment. It's notable too that Chaplin's best comedy vignettes occur outside the big top.It seems Chaplin was increasingly giving larger and more substantial roles to his leading ladies. Oddly however, while Merna Kennedy plays the most fleshed-out female lead of any Chaplin picture to date, she seems less of a focus for the camera, which barely lingers on her. From what we can see she is not bad, but she lacks the calm dignity of Edna Purviance and Georgia Hale, or at least does not get to display such a thing. More reassuringly, there is a decent-sized part for Chaplin regular Henry Bergman as an old clown. Bergman had been a comedy performer for decades, and had even worked in a real circus in his youth, so he certainly knew what this role was about. With some heartfelt facial acting amongst all his usual huffing and puffing about, it is probably his finest performance.If The Circus is known for anything, it tends to be the very fact that it is not as well known as many of Chaplin's other features. Chaplin himself does not even mention it in his autobiography (the imaginatively titled \"My autobiography\" \u2013 but then again, being the legend that he is, he doesn't need a punchy title to promote his own name). But far from neglecting the work, Chaplin gave it surely his neatest and most delicate update-job when he came to overhaul all his silent features for re-release in the 60s and 70s. Unlike The Kid and A Woman of Paris, from which he cut several scenes, and The Gold Rush, which he all but butchered in 1943, The Circus is left intact. He also treats it to its own theme song, under which the opening credits are inter-cut with shots of Kennedy on the trapeze, creating the most tender and lyrical opening of all his pictures.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin's comedy about comedy is sweet, funny and beautiful",
            "content": "The Little Tramp is chased into a circus tent during a performance; his antics prove funnier than those of the clowns, and the ringmaster hires him for the show.When a comedian plays a character who is inadvertently hilarious, it can seem narcissistic: just check out Jerry Lewis's \"The Errand Boy\" where Lewis has his supporting cast praise the comic genius of the character played by Jerry Lewis. Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin's off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one. My favorite moment is when the ringmaster demands the auditioning Tramp to be funny right that instant: the Tramp grins and shyly dances around a bit, gingerly falls down, puts his cane between his legs and meekly lifts himself back up. \"Terrible!\" roars his would-be employer.This film has more self-awareness over comedy conventions that any other Chaplin I know of. The Tramp ineptly (but hilariously) performs a couple of standard comedy routines with the other circus clowns. Later, there's a funny twist to the old banana peel gag; and near the end he crashes into an old general store, looking as if he's thrust himself back into his old Keystone days. This is Chaplin's last true silent film, and the Keystone moment feels like a nostalgic farewell to the past.\"The Circus\" is funny throughout, but the opening scenes are probably the best. There's a marvelous funhouse sequence and a priceless routine where The Tramp pretends to be a motorized dummy. (Has anyone seen the Swiss clock routine from \"Your Show of Shows\"?) He also falls in love with the ringmaster's cruelly treated daughter, which leads to a poignant ending.I enjoyed the music, which Chaplin composed for this film in 1969. His scores are always repetitive; but they're also sweet and funny and they enhance the action. I could have done without the title-sequence song (which he sings himself)\u2014something about looking up at rainbows. Otherwise, this comedy is near-perfect and holds its own against Chaplin's even greater features, \"The Gold Rush,\" \"City Lights\" and \"Modern Times.\"",

            "content": "Although movie buffs seldom mention `The Circus' in the same breath as Charlie Chaplin's more touted masterpieces (`City Lights,' `Modern Times,' `The Gold Rush'), this film contains some of his best work manifested in a number of ingenious sequences.  Chaplin once again dons the role of the tramp, this time having all sorts of adventures (and misadventures) under the big top.In order to evade the police who suspect him of being a thief, the tramp ducks into a circus tent and acts as if he is part of the show.  The cops follow him into the tent and try to apprehend him, with comical results. The crowd goes wild, believing all this was planned ahead of time.  The audience's reaction is so strong that the tyrannical circus owner hires him on the spot.  When it is discovered that Chaplin cannot be funny intentionally, the owner gives him a job as a prop man, clumsily lugging equipment around the tent as part of the show.  Again the crowd roars its approval at his inadvertent antics, and soon the tramp is the circus' main attraction.  In the meantime, he falls in love with the owner's daughter, a bareback rider who herself loves the tightrope walker, and romantic complications ensue.`The Circus' is an all-around Chaplin effort.  In addition to playing the lead role, he wrote, directed, produced and edited it, and composed the music as well.  It is a meticulous production on all counts, with each sequence choreographed to elicit the maximum capacity of laughter from the audience.  The scenes in which the tramp is pursued through a hall of mirrors, trapped inside the lion's cage, and forced to double for the missing tightrope walker stand alongside his finest achievements.  The ending sequence is especially heartrending, as many are in his films.  Here is a movie to be cherished by all fans of Chaplin, but appreciated even by casual viewers.  This is because it achieves a rare blend of comedy and poignancy through appealing, sympathetic characters and with genuine honesty adding a note of realism to counterbalance the clowning.",

You'll die laughing in the scenes where he's attached to the rope. I actually watched it on TV while living with a family in St. Petersburg, Russia, and they laughed their heads off just watching him perform his stunts.

            "content": "Following the success in the summer of 1925 with the release of The Gold Rush, Chaplin started work on The Circus in 1926. The production, like The Kid, was stonewalled numerous times with various situations, chief among them was a fire at Chaplin studios and divorce proceedings brought on by his second wife: Lita Grey. Chaplin forged on, and The Circus was released in January of 1928. In The Circus, the tramp happens upon a failing circus and inadvertently becomes a huge success when he unknowingly interrupts the show. He befriends a girl, the proprietor's daughter, played by Merna Kennedy in her film debut. The proprietor puts increasing pressure on Chaplin to make good, and complicating matters is a handsome tightrope walker interested in the daughter. It's a great combination of Chaplin's trademark sight gags and pathos. The highlight of the film occurs when the tramp decides to impress the girl by substituting for the no-show tightrope walker. Chaplin filmed this scene several hundred times to get it just right. Three Chaplin regulars appear as clowns in the film: Albert Austin, Henry Bergman, and Chester Conklin. Chaplin edited, wrote, directed, and produced the film and received a special Oscar for doing so. That's Chaplin singing at the beginning of the film, which is very poignant. The singing was added to the film by Chaplin some 40 years later. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

In fact, I believe that it would have not had been as engrossing as it was had there been dialogue present. This is because of the movie's rather romantic leaning, but here audience is spared the endless romantic dribble of a character in love. Instead the movie was able to move constantly forward spurred purely by Chaplin's exaggerated facial and body expressions. The movie also works without sound because Chaplin's \"Tramp\" character would probably come across as a bit of an imbecile with sound, rather than naive with all of his accidental high-jinks and follies. It is this naive innocence that makes the Tramp so likable, and when he losses Merna at the end, Chaplin's face and defeated body language do more justice to the sad moment than any dialogue with him lamenting her loss could have. The Circus is an altogether enjoyable piece whose rather predictable story-line is kept fresh with Chaplin's charismatic antics.",

Of course, it is much more than that as we witness some incredible stunts by the versatile Chaplin, as well as some great camera work that was undoubtedly way ahead of its time.Perhaps simply because it is in black and white, or it is without dialog it is a sad truth that great auteurs such as Chaplin and Buster Keaton have been mostly forgotten by today's moviegoers. For this reason, I find it very important to continue to support their work and look for further and deeper truths. What can be gleaned from this is astonishing. There is so much sadness, joy, anger, and fear lurking at the surface it takes multiple views to catch it all. What Chaplin does with this simple story, his incredible array of stunts and comedic situations, and that memorable little Tramp make for one of the greatest of all silent films; one worthy enough to be mentioned with City Lights, The Gold Rush and the other Chaplin classics.

It looks lovely, and has a beautiful score. I also loved the recurring despondent theme of love, which provided The Circus's more touching moments, but there are also some truly brilliant slapstick set-pieces especially when Chaplin walks a tightrope with falling trousers and a clinging monkey, while the chase through the hall of mirrors and the scene in the lion's cage are also inspired. Chaplin's direction is superb, and he is even better in the title role of the Tramp.Overall, a great film while not quite Chaplin's best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "There was barely a minute in the Circus I wasn't smiling and/or laughing like a silly little kid, and that's the key for how successful the picture is and, hopefully, in its appeal. For those handful of young people (i.e. children) who would be adventurous enough to come close to a black and white movie let alone one without any dialog, it's possibly the most enjoyable of all of Chaplin's pre-1940 work. This doesn't mean it'll make you cry like City Lights or be somewhat enlightened like Modern Times, but it has a fresh and joyous and innocent delight in its making and Chaplin as the Little Tramp, where here he's more than ever like a simple cartoon character thrust into this rough-and-tumble circus world with a mean ringmaster and kind and kind of loving girl.And it's not just the infamous climactic tightrope act, although if for no other reason that's one big reason to see the film as the little Tramp goes haywire with his plans to \"safely\" go across the tightrope. It's just the entire assemblage of skits and moments, little things that might seem silly to talk about- like Chaplin locked in a lion's cage or trying to 'learn' a barber trick- and how it unfolds with a precision and finesse (yes, finesse) that is just short of genius, if not that. In fact a big point in the film is \"try and act funny\", which is not something that can really be barked on command to anyone, especially the Little Tramp who, in essence, garners his comedy from unintentional goofiness, embarrassment or humiliation on the parts of others, or just plain old physical pratfalls. What we get in the Circus is the tale of the classic clown in the midst of a whole programmed slew of them, and what it takes to make it in it- or what humanity is there.As said, it doesn't necessarily have the best love story, even if that's touching, and it doesn't make some big statement on the working-man or society in general. But if you want to just flat-out laugh at some incredible stunts and witness Chaplin's craft of quality, The Circus is fantastic fun.",

I love silent films but if you compare the films the other two great silent clowns were doing at the same time, \"The Circus\" does not compare. Lloyd was doing films like \"The Kid Brother\" and \"Speedy\" while Keaton was doing \"The Cameraman\"--all films that show how really great silent pictures can be.When the Tramp is chased into the circus by the cop the audience immediately goes wild! They scream with laughter, yell and applaud, despite the fact the Tramp has done NOTHING remotely funny at this point. In fact, his run on the turntable is pretty much what the \"unfunny\" clowns just did. Keaton or Lloyd never would have cheated this way. They'd have given themselves something funny to do and won over the audience and SHOWN us how funny their characters were, even if it was inadvertent.Chaplin also misses a daring comedy moment when his Tramp character ISN'T funny and the ringmaster threatens to fire him. Chaplin could have shown us how with a lack of timing and lack of inspiration a funny bit could fall flat, but he fails to seize the moment.The bit in the lion cage and the high wire scene are undeniably funny and great sequences in and of themselves. But the rest of \"The Circus\" is not. Perhaps if this had been made around 1924, it would compare favorably to films of that era. But compared to the previously mentioned films (and classics like Keaton's \"The General\") Chaplin is backsliding here. Adding the title song years later doesn't help it.",

To him it is all about getting away but to the crowd his hilarious antics are all part of the show and they love it. The circus master recognises this and hires the tramp but yet he cannot seem to understand even the simplest of routines and it seems hopeless. However the next night the tramp helps out with the props for the show and again, without trying draws the same laughs. The circus master keeps him on as a prop man, but while his \"act\" helps the circus prosper, the tramp nor his new friend (the master's step-daughter) are benefiting from it.This afternoon I watched a couple of classic Chaplin films including Modern Times and while great, I had not felt I was roaring with laughter in the way that other users said they had been. Maybe it was the fact that many clip shows that made me familiar with the gags long before seeing the film or maybe it was the way that the plot seemed to be about more than just delivering laughs. Either way, when I came to The Circus I found myself laughing out loud regularly in the way that many of Chaplin's shorts make me do. With The Circus I had a feature length film whose plot existed as a basic frame for one very funny scene after another.There are \"big\" scenes but even the linking ones are funny as Chaplin's little tramp proves himself an effortless entertainer. The bit I laughed hardest at was more to do with imaginative writing than physical and that was the wonderful running gag where the horse chased Chaplin every chance it got \u0096 it was never explained why it chased him and nobody else but it was very funny! Only at the end where the plot (the usual romantic subplot) is pulled together does the laugh quota dip but otherwise it is very funny and consistent. Mentioning the horse gag should not make you think that I do not appreciate the rest of it though, because as usual Chaplin is excellent when it comes to his physical performance. Kennedy works reasonably well with him but he gets more effective support from Garcia, Davis, Crocker and others.The Circus may not be considered as highly as things like The Great Dictator and Modern Times but for my money it delivers where it counts \u0096 laughs. In this regard it has more in common with his short films than with some of his features because this does feel like one gag after another and I was laughing near consistently.",

            "content": "\"The Circus\" plays more like a series of vignettes instead of a complete story, although it all does take place in the limited venue of a circus environment. The version I viewed from the Criterion Collection offered a restored 1968 update to the movie, complete with an introductory song written and sung by Chaplin, who is also credited as director and producer to go along with his acting honors. The movie is an enjoyable one, and the way it breezes by you would almost think it's one of his short films. It's difficult to definitively pick out a favorite bit from the picture, although the 'Mirror Maze' segment was quite fun, while the segment with the cop chasing The Tramp on the merry go round has to be notable for the timing and complexity involved. In a nutshell, Chaplin's Tramp character becomes the star of the circus quite by accident when he stumbles into the center ring during the cop chase, and is hired by the Ringmaster (Allan Garcia) to perform for real. However The Tramp can't seem to summon up any humor when he's put on the spot for it; it's only when his instincts take over when he finds himself in sticky situations that he brings the circus audience to life. You really have to credit Chaplin for performing bravely, doing all of his own stunts and often times tempting fate. The high wire act in which his harness suddenly detaches and the monkeys swarm him makes you hold your breath. There's a bit of a side story involving the abused daughter (Merna Kennedy) of the ringmaster, though it doesn't turn into a romance for The Tramp, who's left to wistfully contemplate the circus as it packs up and moves on to the next town.Though I'm not a Chaplin connoisseur, I do enjoy his films, and of the handful I've seen, my favorite happens to be \"City Lights\". In an IMDb list of silent films I've watched and reviewed, this one sits in tenth place out of almost three dozen films when ranked in IMDb rating order. The thing is, four of Chaplin's other movies rate higher, with \"Modern Times\" topping the list. The others are \"City Lights\", \"The Kid\", and Gold Rush\".",

It is about the Tramp getting accidentally and innocently mixed up in a pickpocket theft, he runs from the cops, and inadvertently ends up in the circus that is in town.Once there it becomes clear, again accidentally, that he is funnier than the acts that are supposed to be funny.

NOTES: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave a Special Award to Charles Chaplin, \"for versatility and genius in writing, acting, directing and producing The Circus.\" Chaplin was also nominated for Best Actor (the award was won by Emil Jannings) and Best Comedy Director (Lewis Milestone received the award). The movie itself was voted number six in The Film Daily's 1928 poll of American film critics.COMMENT: Although, disappointingly, it is not one of his funniest films (some of the jokes, especially the horse pill and some similar experiments, now seem extremely old, tired and totally worn out), \"The Circus\" still carries more than enough Chaplin magic to make it extremely watchable. It's absolutely impossible to go past Chaplin for his mastery of comic timing, and here in \"The Circus\", such inspired timing is as deft as ever. Fortunately, Chaplin's brilliantly neat footwork is also just as fancy, and remarkable as ever. And as for performance wise, Chaplin has it all over the rest of the cast. In my opinion, whilst I found some of the other players to be totally forgettable, Chaplin's own performance registered strongly enough that I still remember it, even though it is at least twenty years since I saw the movie in a theater. My memory is that Chaplin did actually win an acting nomination for his performance in this movie. He fully deserved it!",

The crowd reaction makes the ringmaster hire him but since the tramp is unaware that he's the star of the show, he accepts the minimum wage offer and also falls for the owner's daughter.Written, produced, directed, edited & composed by Charlie Chaplin plus starring him in the lead role, The Circus doesn't go for an introductory set-up like it did in The Gold Rush & is funny from its opening moments. Chaplin again impresses with his precision control over all filmmaking aspects and further elevates the already iconic status of his signature character to a new level.While the film does allow its drama to take over the screen at regular intervals, it's actually the elements of comedy that keeps the story fresh & engaging throughout its runtime. The stunt-work doesn't fail to impress even today, its opening sequence is hilarious as hell and the extraordinary performer once again delivers a show-stealing performance that's not just comical but also heartwarming.On an overall scale, The Circus is an endlessly enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying film that may not be better than Chaplin's finest films but isn't any less either. An under-appreciated work of silent cinema in my opinion that can certainly use a broader audience, The Circus is an underrated masterpiece that, just like almost every other Chaplin film, simply refuses to age and comes delightfully recommended to every cinema lover.",

The film is mostly a series of circus-themed skits thrown together, but there are several interesting ideas at hand as the manager avoids telling him he is their biggest attraction (to avoid paying a handsome salary) and as the tramp is only ever able to make the circus audiences laugh when he is not trying to be funny at all. There is also a touching subplot in which he tries to help an abused circus worker and the film creates an authentic relationship between the pair that never once feels sentimental. If there is one thing to hold against the film though, it is the fact that the first fifteen minutes (before Chaplin is invited to join the circus) is far funnier than anything else afterwards with the subsequent movie never quite recapturing the hilarity of Chaplin running amok in a house of mirrors, running in synchrony with a thief and repeatedly whacking the thief on the head when pretending to be mechanical.

            "content": "I've been spending a lot of time lately going through and watching all of Chaplin's oldest short comedies that he made for Keystone and Essanay, and with only a few left before I get into the 1920s I decided to jump ahead and watch this one, which is reportedly the last true silent film that Chaplin made, since there were elements of City Lights and especially Modern Times that were clearly moving toward the sound era. The first thing the struck my is how much better looking the film is, and the second thing that struck me is that, other than the length and thickness of the plot and story, it is remarkably similar to his earlier films. In a good way, of course.By now, Chaplin had reached a point in his career where he was a major film star, so of course this movie is much bigger, much more ambitious than the 10 or 20 minute films he was churning out a decade before. He plays the same person, the little tramp out of the job, out of money and out of love. Maybe this is just me, but I really think that the parts of Chaplin's films where we see the tramp before the story has started going are generally some of the best parts, because we get quick looks at the tramp's personality \u0096 what he does with himself when nothing's going on. He's usually just hanging out, spinning his cane or browsing casually without a care in the world. I sometimes wonder what Rowan Atkinson would be doing if there had been no Chaplin to inspire his own famous character.There is a very clever opening to the movie, as Chaplin twice finds himself the victim of pick-pocketing, once when another man's wallet is slipped into his pocket, and another time when that wallet is stolen from him before he realizes he has it. Luckily, a police officer sees the second thief and returns the stolen wallet to the thoroughly astonished tramp. When he goes to spend some of his new money, the real owner catches him and, as can only happen in a Chaplin movie, the ensuing chase makes him a star.I especially love how much more complex the movie is the its shorter predecessors. It is clearly a big-budget 1928 Hollywood movie, with high-flying stunts and even special effects (yeah, special effects in a Chaplin movie!!). There are plenty of charming and effective sight gags, including his famous tight rope scene with the monkeys, and a sweet love story that calls to mind the similar love story, and how it played out, from The Tramp, back in 1916. If the oldest two-reelers are too rough or uninteresting to you, this would be a great film to see to check out Chaplin's early work. It's similar in countless ways, but is cleaner and has a much more engaging plot. Excellent show!Note: The IMDb trvia page mentions that this is the only one of Chaplin's feature films not mentioned in his autobiography, because of \"problems with the film, not the film itself.\" I understand that his studio burned down during production and that he suffered a nervous breakdown during filming because of personal problems, but do any of his dissatisfactions have anything to do with the actual film? If you know please email me, this movie is definitely something that I would think he would be proud of!",

This go-around, he happens upon a traveling circus, inadvertently stumbles his way into becoming a star attraction, falls for the trapeze girl and finds trouble with her father, the ringmaster. Sprinkled along the way are frequent doses of brilliant physical comedy, inventive and original as ever, which playfully goof around with the trappings of daily life around the carnival grounds.Chaplin suffered several personal hardships during filming - a messy public divorce, a ruinous studio fire, the death of a parent - and tucked in amidst all the hijinx and gags I found a tinge of quiet sadness and reflection. Particularly late in the picture, when the plucky Tramp falls into the friend zone and struggles with jealousy over his girl's new fling, he emits an air of desperation, then acceptance, that organically develops into a sweet, unexpected climax. It's easy to get the sense that he worked through quite a bit with this picture, both behind the camera and before it, which elevates the product from a very good silent comedy into something more significant, something lasting. The parting shot, in which the show noisily rides off to the next town while Chaplin is left in the dust, serves as a potent metaphor for his fears over the steamrolling arrival of sound cinema (The Jazz Singer opened a mere three months before The Circus) and adds yet another layer to the complex emotional undercurrent. A phenomenal, and oft-overlooked, bit of understated work from one of Hollywood's brightest stars.",

Stumbling into a performance The Tramp is a comic sensation and hired on the spot by the cruel, daughter abusing, cheapskate circus owner. Charlie falls for the girl and protects her with his leverage as the shows biggest act. Just as hints of romance between the two begin to take form tall, dark and handsome Rex the wire walker arrives on the scene and sweeps her off her feet. The Tramp goes into a funk, his performance suffers and he is fired but then volunteers to to sub for the AWOL Rex on the high wire. Chaplin's scenes on a high wire with a monkey biting his nose, climbing into a lion's cage and a chase through a fun house that culminates in a hall of mirrors is as good as Charlie (ie: all of twentieth century film) gets in the slapstick acrobatic poetry department. He also does a wonderful job of conveying his melancholy in a variety of moods. Chaplin's overall direction however seems distracted with little attention payed to detail outside his outstanding performance as he works within the confines of three or four rotating sets in which design and compositions are dull and sparse, the editing and continuity a touch ragged. Nothing however can get in the way or surpass the comic brilliance of The Little Tramp and The Circus offers up some of his best.",

It is hard for me to pick a favorite film from Chaplin since they all have something unique about them, but it doesn't deserve to be considered a lesser work and more people should check this out. There are several stand out scenes in every one of his features and The Circus is no exception. Some of my favorite include the scene where he locks himself in the lion's cage, the scene where he is walking through the tightrope (a physically demanding scene), the scene where he is in the mirror maze, and the final scene where he walks off to the sunset with his unique and cheerful walk. The Circus is a fun and entertaining film with perfect pacing which never drags. The tramp always reminds us that no matter how difficult our circumstances are, we must never lose our hope and we must remain true to ourselves. One moment he can be stealing food from a baby (but he does it in such a sweet and funny way that we don't judge him), and the next he can be sharing a piece of bread with a lonely girl. He might be unfortunate and clumsy, but he has a heart of gold. The Circus captures the essence of the tramp really well and Chaplin balances pathos with slapstick perfectly once again.In The Circus we follow the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who once again is a victim of his circumstance. After a pickpocket (Steve Murphy) steals a wallet, he hides it in the Tramps pants so he isn't discovered. When a police officer realizes that the tramp is carrying the wallet he chases him across a nearby circus. A few clowns are doing their number, but the audience is bored to death until they see the Tramp running all over the place and stumbling across everything while the police officer chases him. He turns into a sensation without realizing it and the Circus Proprietor (Al Ernest Garcia) hires him. He asks the Tramp to do some funny stunts, but he isn't funny so he decides to put him to work as a janitor. The Proprietor realizes that the audiences love the Tramp when he is actually being his clumsy self stumbling all over the place without trying to be funny so he takes advantage of the situation and uses him. The tramp falls in love with the Proprietor's step-daughter, a Circus rider (Merna Kennedy), who is treated poorly by him. But when she falls in love with the tight rope walker (Harry Crocker), the Tramp loses his magic touch. Perhaps if he can do that act, the girl might fall for him, but it is an extremely risky act.The way Chaplin establishes each of his characters through a simple scene and few dialogue boxes is impressive. He also has an amazing talent to make audiences laugh through comedic acts that we've seen before, but adding his unique personal stamp. What's amazing for me is that each lead actress in his films are different, but they all look so much alike. The love story in The Circus is the one that works best for me and seems more believable. The Circus has a lot of heart. Many complained that The Gold Rush lacked a better ending and in The Circus Chaplin managed to deliver one that captured his essence. It may be far less adventurous, but the love story worked much better. City Lights manages to capture the best elements from both those films: a tender love story, some hilarious scenes, and another great ending so that is why it is considered a superior film, but by no means does The Circus deserve to be neglected like it has been by many.",

            "content": "There's been some brilliant minds that have produced their best work under personal stress. Painter Vincent van Gogh especially comes to mind. Add comic genius Charlie Chaplin to that roster. While working on his January 1928's release, \"The Circus,\" several crushing personal and profession blows came to him all at once. But the resilient actor/director rebounded from a series of misfortunes to create one of his most admired feature films.His marriage to late teenager Lita Grey was dissolving when he went into the movie's production. Lita had packed her bags and left the house with their two children, serving him with divorce papers. Chaplin was forced to stop filming midway through the movie for several months while he was enduring a high-profile divorce trial costing him $600,000 in alimony. Meanwhile, the IRS, drawn into the case, discovered Chaplin owed $1 million in back taxes and froze all his assets. On top of all that, his mother, Hannah Chaplin, was on her deathbed and soon passed away shortly after \"The Circus\" was released.Compounding his personal issues was his film studio he owned suffered a major fire in the midst of \"The Circus\" production. One reel of film, showing him performing a breath-taking tight rope act 40 feet up, with several monkeys scampering all over him, was scratched during processing and had to be reshot over again. Chaplin, who rehearsed for weeks learning how to walk the tight rope, said after viewing the newly filmed sequence that it wasn't nearly as good as the original one.Chaplin was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This period was such a time of turmoil for the comedian that when he was composing his autobiography years later, he barely mentioned any of these events.Despite it all, \"The Circus\" is acknowledged as one of Chaplin's best films. The Academy nominated it for three awards: Best Director in a Comedy Picture, Best Actor, and Best Original Story. Recognizing the film as an exceptional production, the Academy decided to give Chaplin an honorary Special Award for \"acting, writing, directing and producing of 'The Circus,'\" the first Honorary Award ever given. (The other Honorary Award doled out during the first Awards ceremony in May 1929 was to Warner Brothers for \"The Jazz Singer,\" \"the pioneer outstanding talking picture, which has revolutionized the industry.\" Academy members felt because of its singing and talking, it would be unfair to compare the film to its silent competitors.).In \"The Circus,\" Chaplin's Tramp evades policemen who are chasing him in the mistaken belief he was pickpocketing by running into a circus tent during a performance. He's hired by circus management for his antics, where he falls in love with Merna (Merna Kennedy), the ringmaster's step-daughter. But she's attracted to the newly-hired tight rope walker, Rex (Harry Crocker). Chaplin in turn tries to one-up him on the ropes. In another scene he accidentally finds himself locked in a lion's cage. Chaplin filmed 200 takes with himself in the cage with the animal.\"The Circus\" was the 17th highest box office hit ever in silent movies. The movie was nominated by the American Film Institute as the one of 500 to qualify for its Top 100 Funniest American Movies. Film critic Roger Ebert included it in his \"Great Movies\" list.Although Chaplin didn't quite give up surrendering his silent format, \"The Circus\" marked the last movie he produced during the silent movie era. The film also marked the screen debut of Merna Kennedy. She was a dancer and friend of Lita Grey, who introduced her to Chaplin. Merna was hired because of her athletic ability to ride on a horse. Kennedy was one of those rare actresses who made the transition to sound, only to retire when she met and married choreographer Busby Berkeley in early 1934. The marriage lasted only two years. Kennedy tragically died of a heart attack in 1944 at the young age of 36.",

In Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, in 1972, there was a retrospective of Chaplin's work, and I chose to watch two movies, my favorite Chaplins ever since: THE CIRCUS and MODERN TIMES.THE CIRCUS brings to light Chaplin's incredibly athletic abilities, and his ballet-like sense of the comic. The scene where he mimics a clockwork figure that keeps hitting one of Chaplin's pursuers and laughing as part of the mimicry, all to fool a watching policeman, is one of the most brilliant comedy pieces ever, and I shall always feel humbled by the genius that pervades that sequence.The Tramp is the ultimate survivor and he picks up his paycheck by tending to animals and engaging in circus acts, all rather mechanically, until he meets the female lead played by Merna Kennedy, and suddenly he finds a meaning to things, and develops the type of generosity toward a fellow human being that love alone can generate.In between, there are many wonderful moments to enjoy, as Chaplin's acting and directorial skills have seldom been more inspired. Unfortunately, the film ends all too soon but its ending is one of the most truthful I have ever had the privilege to watch.\nChaplin's reaction to his loss paves the way for perhaps the greatest closing shot ever.THE CIRCUS is now 91 years old, but its themes, views, and comic touches remain fresh, thought-provoking, and a pleasure to return to. Congratulations, the great Master!",

            "review_title": "Ode to Chaplin, part fourteen",
            "content": "I never really liked circus; for me it was always more of a place where you'd go when you want to see acrobats, tightrope walkers and animals do the act which serves its only purpose - to entertain people, and I never felt the urge to be entertained. This is why I don't like the lion's share of modern movies - they forgot that they used to be entertainment vehicle but there were also people like Charles Chaplin who were there to change that, make a difference, leave a trace; and he left the biggest trace of all in my heart.When Charles began production on \"The circus\" (1928) he was facing many difficulties along the way: the death of his mother, his second divorce and the IRS hanging on his back to get his tax returns delayed the movie's release for eight months. But all those struggles didn't affect the end result whatsoever.In this story our dear old Tramp finds himself in the circus trying to earn some living by making people laugh but the thing is - he can only be funny unintentionally, without him realizing he's doing something funny. We do something like that every day, just being ourselves without even noticing how much we influence other people by our actions; we learned to see past that, see the world with our eyes shut so that there's no damage can be done but we can never escape the consequences of our actions. Charles knows that and Tramp knows that, he tries to see a bigger picture before it's too late and puts himself after the people he cares for. But as every human being he makes mistakes and acts like an idiot sometimes but it's what he learns from the consequences that counts.As always Chaplin produced, directed, starred and in 1967 composed a new score for \"The circus\" and even wrote and sang \"Swing little girl\" in the opening credits. The movie was another success for Charles, although not as big as \"The gold rush\" but it doesn't matter now because the movie is an undeniable masterpiece that saw Charles trying something new and making something new thereby making a difference in the world of cinema the way it is supposed to be made.",

            "review_title": "The Little Tramp Does Not Disappoint",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin produced and acted in great movies, and Roger Ebert is correct in placing \"The Circus\" into his top 350 listing. Chaplin was so much a perfectionist in his films that he often demanded many scenic takes. And some of his films took several years to produce. That is one reason that he was in far less films than the other two nonpareil silent screen comics: Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.The film begins with circus acts ineffectively performed by clowns and the acrobat/horse rider. Merna (Merna Kennedy), the acrobat who missed a hoop, is punished by her bullying stepfather, the ringmaster/circus proprietor (Allan Garcia). He withholds her dinner. Meanwhile in the fairgrounds our diminutive tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is both hungry and broke. A pickpocket artist in the ground starts a chain of events that develops into a wild chase by police of the tramp, falsely accused. When the Little Tramp is chased into the main circus tent, he interferes with the real acts; the customers think he is part of the show, and they react positively. The crafty circus owner not only hires him, but also underpays him. The tramp does not realize that he is the top attraction until Merna explains the situation to him. After, he approaches the owner, and is hired at a rate of $100 per week. Yet he still does not understand what makes him so funny. While this is happening, The Little Tramp develops a protective and romantic crush on Merna, but seems to confuse her kindness for love, as she loves the tramp as a \"friend.\" (Apparently she was a real love interest in his private life.) Earlier, when she was hungry, Charlie gave her some bread and an egg. After that he overhears a fortune-teller informing Merna of her future. The gypsy says that she will fall in love with a dark and handsome stranger. The Little Tramp, looking into a mirror, somehow believes he is that man. He even becomes a bit nasty. Then a handsome tightrope walker, Rex (Harry Crocker), becomes part of the mix.There are many funny sight gags, and more than a few will be mentioned. A laugh is the scene in the fairgrounds where Chaplin eats the child's hot dog while applying mustard \u2013 and then wipes the child's lips with the bib when the father turns and faces him. In the Mirror Maze, the tramp and policeman are confused by the many reflections. In one of the all-time classic silent screen gags, Charlie becomes part of the automated figures in the Noah's Ark attraction. Afterward, Chaplin tries to throw a cream pie to the hungry Merna, who is sitting high on the rings in the Big Top. But she misses it and the pie subsequently lands on top of the lead property man's head (Stanley Stanford). The ringmaster looks around and is puzzled, and Charlie tries to explain that the white stuff was the droppings of a bird! Yikes! After that, our little hero is locked in a lion's cage; the lion certainly looks real. The door may not have been really locked, but when the sleeping lion yawned, its large bone-cracking jaws were exposed. Maybe the animal was drugged. The lion may have been the same one later seen in other movies in the 1930s featuring folks like Johnny Weissmuller (Tarzan) and even Harold Lloyd. By then the aging animal had lost an upper canine. The tightrope scene is classic (and apparently real enough), with Charlie trying to walk a tightrope and trying to keep his pants on while fending off monkeys at the same time.Some consider the self-sacrificing ending to be odd: Charlie sees the circus wagons leave, and then he contemplates on the crate, and finally arises and hops away in the distance. Maybe the Little Tramp character was a bit anxious, as talkies were already on his doorstep. Chaplin knew that they were destined to take the aura of his silent Little Tramp away. He would make the excellent \"City Lights\" in 1931, considered the last of the real silent movies, although \"Modern Times\" (1936) was mostly so. \"The Circus\" is not one of Chaplin's sentimental types, like \"The Kid\" (1921) or \"City Lights.\" But his work was good, so enjoy this gem.",

If you're looking for rainbows look up to the sky. You'll never find rainbows if you're looking down.\" The point at which the world of cinema caught up to and passed Charles Chaplin is The Circus, his final film of the silent era. A disastrous production schedule and Chaplin's personal turmoil at the time has much to do with the diminished stature of this film. Likely an episode in his life he chose to forget and excluded from his autobiography, the film was forgotten until it's re-release in 1969 with an original soundtrack composed and title song performed by the then eighty year old Chaplin. The Circus, despite all this, is no less a work of genius than his other films of the era and includes many of Chaplin's best and most memorable comic moments. In a spectacular opening shot we see Merna, a circus rider, burst through a paper ring to reveal all the vitality of the big top, a Degas dancer amid the sawdust and lights. While lacking the chemistry Chaplin had with Edna Purvaince, Merna Kennedy brings a sweetness and charm to her character. Her joy is short-lived when she is brutalized by the ringmaster for her lack of perfection. Enter the little tramp, broke and starving, yet always managing to get by, this time, secretly fed by a babe in arms. A victim of misunderstanding and happenstance, he finds himself pursued by police, across the boardwalk and into the fun house maze of mirrors in a complex and magical scene. After Charlie is forced to masquerade as an automaton to avoid capture the chase ends up under the big top, where he wrecks the show but wins the audience over with his misadventures. The mayhem subsides, the performance resumes and we are left with the dissatisfaction of the crowd, \"Where's the funny man? Bring on the funny man!\" Oblivious, he lies fast asleep in a nearby horse cart. Chaplin's brilliance was never so clear as when he portrayed every day life in all it's mundane little details. The starving little dancer steals his breakfast. he rebukes her, pities her, and in the end gives her his meal. Later, as she hurries off, the tramp is smitten, and the die is cast. Our little fellow manages to stumble his way to success, hired, fired and finally re-hired as a circus prop man. He is in fact, and unknowing, the star of the show. As though to illustrate why his love for the girl can never be realized, the tramp tosses food to Merna from her lofty perch in the empty tent, they are from different worlds. In the end, he guides the girl to the safety of a better life and the promise of prosperity as the little tramp wanders off into the setting sun. In a picture filled with an excess of wonderful vignettes, chased by a mad donkey while holding an enormous stack of dishes, Charlie's surprise when he opens a trunk to find it full of wild monkeys, his boastfulness at surviving a moment trapped in the lions cage only to be frightened by a kitten, and William Tell with a banana, Chaplin left still more on the cutting room floor. In the highlight of the film we see Charlie's hilarious trip across the highwire as he stands in for the absent star and is attacked by the marauding monkeys for his efforts. While The Circus may be thinner in character development and plot than Chaplin's other feature films, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable comic masterpiece. Easily forgotten by modern moviegoers, no one has ever achieved the ability to express tenderness, joy, sadness, irrepressible humor and pathos to a greater degree than Chaplin. The broad appeal of his films made him the beloved everyman to a world-wide audience. The Circus is yet another gem from the greatest comic filmmaker of the silent era and a subtle hint of the masterpiece to follow. The opportunity to see this film on a big screen in a theater from the silent era is rare and should not be missed.",

            "content": "While all the others of his GREAT silent comedies, from \"The Kid\" to \"City Lights\", are still being celebrated and cherished today (and ENTIRELY deservedly, of course), \"The Circus\" seems to be Charlie Chaplin's mental 'stepchild' - perhaps partly because he himself wanted to forget about the movie (or rather the making of it) later on; since at the time he made it, he had LOADS of personal problems... But that certainly changes NOTHING about the facts: \"The Circus\" is a really WONDERFUL movie, poetic, philosophical, and of course hilariously funny! While watching it, we very soon catch the atmosphere Charlie Chaplin always created in his VERY own films which he wrote the scripts (and even the music) for, directed, produced, and of course starred in ever since he'd become the co-founder of United Artists and gained his absolute artistic freedom: torn between comedy and drama... There are comical scenes in \"The Circus\" which can EASILY compete with those of his - today - more famous works; like the chase scene in the Chamber of Mirrors, or his unintentionally comic 'entrance' into the circus show which makes him an immediate success with the public - or the famous, and TRULY daring, tightrope scene where he's not only got to struggle with gravity, but also with the circus monkeys! Nevertheless, there ARE dramatic and sad moments - 'lighter' perhaps than those in \"The Kid\" or \"City Lights\" or \"Modern Times\", but with a DEFINITE touch of social criticism: the mean, greedy circus owner who never pays his workers, exploits his artists, and even mistreats his own step-daughter to the point of letting her go hungry; generally, the VERY basic topic of food once again is a main theme as in so many of Charlie's movies: the fight for a slice of bread, or the generosity to give away a boiled egg... Anyway, he had LIVED through all those things during his childhood in the London slums, and he always wanted to remind the audience of what it means to be HUNGRY - only a year later, MANY people in the US and all around the world would get to know that feeling themselves, after Black Friday 1929...And yet it's simply ASTONISHING what a wonderful freshness and spontaneity this masterpiece of silent cinema exudes even today, after almost 90 years - it gives us back the good old circus atmosphere that many children of the 21st century have never even known yet, and generally makes us ALL feel like children once again while we're following those funny, lively and also touching scenes of a VERY outstanding, immortal Hollywood classic!",

            "content": "A Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is mistaken for a pickpocket and chased through a circus by the police. Once in the big top he outwits the cops and gets more laughs in doing so than the circus clowns so is offered a job by the ringmaster (Al Ernest Garcia). On his first morning at work the tramp meets a beautiful young dancer (Merna Kennedy) who is hungry after being punished by the ringmaster who is also her father. The tramp falls instantly in love and shares what little food he has. Despite being a hit with the audience the tramp is unaware and like the dancer is mistreated by the ringmaster. No sooner does he become self aware he begins to act with hubris, making working conditions better for himself and his love. The tramp's intentions are soon interrupted however with the arrival of a handsome young tightrope walker (Harry Crocker).Almost forgotten by Chaplin and his audience for sixty years, more recently The Circus has become known as one of actor/director's defining works. Featuring some of his best comic creations and earning points for the sheer hardship of production, The Circus is amongst Chaplin's better films and ranks as one of my favourites.Amazingly The Circus is the only one of Chaplin's feature films which does not get even a single mention in his autobiography. It is almost as though he wished to forget it as production took place during one of the most tumultuous times of his career. The film took two years to make, an exceedingly long time for the 1920s and this was due in part to a terrible fire which ripped through the set and also because production had to be halted after Chaplin was served divorce papers by his second wife Lita Grey. Her lawyers attempted to take the film's negatives as part of the divorce settlement and Chaplin was forced to hide them away before continuing. With all that was going on during its production it isn't surprising that Chaplin wanted to forget it. Luckily for us he returned to the film in 1967, creating a new score and even singing Swing High Little Girl over the titles. This was the version I saw. To hear Chaplin, whose voice I've barely heard before, sing over the beginning of one of his best films is a joy.The Circus features what is probably my favourite 90 seconds of Chaplin's entire sixty year career. While being chased by the police early on he enters a mirror maze and causes confusion inside, ducking and diving out of the reach of the police officer who never really knows where he is. On a technical level this is also impressive as despite there being around twenty mirrors on screen you never once see the camera. After escaping the hall of mirrors Chaplin finds himself and the real pickpocket (Steve Murphy) being chased into an automaton Noah's Ark experience. The following scene is the highlight of the film as Chaplin and the pickpocket are forced to act as automatons to fool the police. Chaplin uses this as a chance to repeatedly hit the pickpocket on the head and is able to produce an automaton style laugh after each whack. The way Chaplin moves and the genius of the idea are both extraordinary. Another scene which had me laughing was when Chaplin was cleaning and took a goldfish out of its tank to clean. The stupidity and surrealism are excellent.As well as the trademark slapstick and trodden on character there are a few aspects of the film which will surprise even Chaplin aficionados. There are several fairly brutal beatings which Merna Kennedy endures from her father. These aren't brutal in the vein of a Korean thriller but by silent comedy and especially Chaplin standards they are almost horrific. I did not expect to see it but it gave the tramp a reason to stand up and fight back and also created a feeling of hatred towards the villain of the piece. Something else that struck me was Chaplin's stunt work. He isn't usually remembered for his stunts, at least not as much as fellow silent clowns Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd but here Chaplin performs some deft defying aerial tricks. The tightrope scene is simply incredible, especially given the fact that Chaplin was unable to tightrope walk before the film. This scene is also one of the comedic highlights. In an earlier scene, he also shares a small cage with a huge lion. This scene took over 200 takes to get right so there were 200 chances for the director to be mauled. That shows dedication to perfection.The film was nominated for four Academy Awards at the first ever Oscar ceremony but was taken out of the running by the Academy in favour of giving the film a special award for acting, writing, directing and producing. The Jazz Singer was the only other film to receive a special award during the next five years.Chaplin gives us a selfless ending which makes sense but it isn't the ending that the audience want. The final shot is almost a direct replica of a shot he used in many of his films but most notably The Tramp and Modern Times. For me The Circus is a joyous 70 minutes of comic gold and quite rightly ranks alongside the likes of City Lights and The Gold Rush as Chaplin's greatest films.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

Was the ending a result of the problems that Chaplin had in making the film, or a product of his personal problems, or the inevitable ending prefigured from the tramp's first falling in love? He looks at the paper star left over from just-departed circus wagons, then waddles off as an iris close ends the film. Before that, Chaplin shows his genius (not an overused term for him!) in a beautifully timed house of mirrors sequence, a riotous destruction of a magician's disappearance-trick (Charley, hiding from the police, is already in the compartment in which the beautiful girl is supposed to materialize), and an even funnier sequence in which Charley releases rabbits, piglets, and pigeons from the magician's table. Perhaps the funniest moment is Charley's ascent to the high-wire platform -- he is being yanked up, a la Peter Pan, but pretends to be going hand over hand. The best example of superb timing is when Charley pulls a chair out for himself and replaces it just in time for the circus manager to sit down in. The film also raises the issue of spontaneity vs. meticulous rehearsal. It favors the former, but is clearly a product of the latter. This turns dark and perhaps the darkness is implicit in the persona of the tramp and the venue of the circus, but it also has some breathtaking and very funny sequences before that final third. Thanks TCM for bringing this one to the tube! It is one of the last examples of how great silent films could be.",

Well, aside from some very funny slapstick moments, there is, once again, a lot of \"schmaltzy\" moments and the film is jam-packed with pathos. In other words, the movie tries VERY VERY VERY hard to be poignant and touching--and I am the type of person that prefers a little more humor and a little less of the sappy hero. I know this ISN'T the opinion of everyone--so if you LIKE when he tugs at your heartstrings and helps a damsel in distress (yet again), then you'll be thrilled. I just thought I'd seen this theme one time too many.BY THE WAY--Chaplin was well-known for being very obsessive-compulsive about his films--doing scenes again and again to get it \"just right\". Well, he made a big blunder here and I was surprised it wasn't caught. While doing the very funny high-wire act, his right pant leg came off while he was holding on to the pole for balance and monkeys were climbing all on and around him. Then, when the shot cut back, the pants leg was back ON!! Oops. This doesn't spoil the movie at all--it's just a funny little mistake. Or, maybe, one of the cute monkeys crawling all over him during this scene put his pants leg back on him!PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies. After each one, my appreciation for his talents increased. In hindsight, I think a score of 8 is more in order. While it's true I'm not much for pathos, I must acknowledge his amazing talents.",

His early Essanay works I didn't like at all, full of gratuitous, senseless violence masking as comedy (people knocking the crap out each other for no apparent reason)but Dictator, and Circus touch the heart as no others do! The film, as a whole, is rather drab & slow, Chaplin playing the Tramp as a circus act, (not discounting his own tightrope work), but the closing scene, as the circus moves on and he's left alone, with only a picture of his love, and his Tramp walk into the sunset, makes it an emotionally powerful piece to watch, giving us glimpse of Chaplin's inner self, not to be found anywhere else, but hidden beneath his character. A must-see for those who enjoy a heartwarming story!",

These are both characteristic of Chaplin, walking around in a tramp's outfit on his own Hollywood studio, also the two opposite roles in \"Dictator.\" The production difficulties are notorious, and Chaplin cleverly adds a tyrannical stage-master into the mix. But still what resonates most with me is an example of Chaplin's ideas that great art and, consequently great humour, comes more out of desperation and ignorance, if accompanied with a good heart, than talent and coldly calculated intellect.That and I consistently laugh during this film more than any other Chaplin.4 out of 5 - An excellent film",

Directed by, written by, and starring Charlie Chaplin himself, this comedy follows the ups and downs of the accidental hit of the show, the Tramp. Chaplin delivers in this role. His slap- stick comedy routines are present throughout the film and the plot was never dry or hard to understand, there was never a dull moment. He is a natural talent and is an absolute delight to watch on screen. The music within the scenes makes it very interesting and easy to follow along with. It intertwines the acting and the scenes together in a very smooth manner. In all honesty, the movie would have been equally as good even if there were fewer blips of \"dialogue\" popping up. I was really impressed by the editing in the middle of the film, especially for this time period. In the scene where the Merna and Rex are exchanging words, Chaplin envisions himself getting up, walking away from his body, and beating up Rex. The amount of time it must have to took to edit that in is unthinkable and it made for a really interesting and relatable scene. I also really enjoyed the mirror maze scene. The underlying theme of making other people happy hits close to home as well. Although, Chaplin's character wants to be with Merna at a time, he realizes it may not have been what was best and, by making a few sacrifices, he makes multiple people happy (Merna's father, Rex, and Merna). However, Chaplin's character still seemed lively, happy, and confident in himself as the film closed. I really enjoyed this film. It definitely introduced me to a whole new cinematic world.",

            "content": "Oh how coy you were Charles Chaplin, and how daft you made us to be.One thing you cannot take away from Chaplin is that he was was adept with film, but so was Marcel L'Herbier, many times over in fact, and who knows him? No, we know and love him because he made us laugh and gave us fake comfort. He told us that all would be fine in the end and that is something we still like to hear. For most people, Chaplin is the little man on screen who grimaced in the face of mishap and got the girl in the end. Remember the finale of The Gold Rush, where she practically fell on his lap onboard that ship?Of course for more learned folks, he's also the man pulling the strings of that image that was his own, and I suppose by now we can get to note the many interesting ways he animated that self on screen to know him as one of the first great masters of the medium. He unraveled a self the way people wanted to see, poor and downtrodden, and became one of the first Hollywood moguls for doing so, a man with sharp acumen for the business of entertainment.So in both respects this is a pivotal work in getting to know the maker behind the popular image. More obviously it is about a hapless schmuck getting to play himself on a big stage before an audience. This is important to note. There is no acting or pretension, it's all real from his end. There's a skit that coasts on just this, him not being able to tell it is all make-believe. When he becomes a hit and main attraction of the show, it's kept a secret from him. But what to make of the fact that we're shown it all starts with him basically wanting to get a bite and instead being stuffed with money in his pockets? There is love involved, safe, bland love as usual, but with a twist. She falls not for our lovable rascal but the suave tightrope-walker of the company, a man of manners and danger. He breaks down, as he did in real life while filming this.This is resolved in a more bittersweet way this go round. He finally goes it alone. But once again there is something unbearably patronizing in how he pushes the two lovers close together and gives his blessing. As though this is only possible because he's big enough to let go. There is no defeat here, none of Keaton's mute expression in the face of callous fate.This is what is ultimately so disingenuous about Chaplin, the fates he presents as taking care of the whole thing. They toy but only in whimsical ways. It doesn't matter where a stage begins or ends, a whole life being a natural performance. The tightrope-walking skit he performs in the rival's place happens helter skelter up in the air, but from down below seems like the real thing. The audience claps fiercely.But of course we know that he was a control freak and hard worker to make it all happen. That tightrope skit he rehearsed for weeks before shooting, staging it to make it seem helter skelter. In his films, hard work is never a value, it all coasts on stupid luck and benevolent fate. It just doesn't work like that. We have accepted him because we like to believe it does, but I maintain that film can be more than diversion; it can reveal the mechanisms that give shape to life around us.",

You got to give a lot of credit to Chaplin in this film, though. Despite everything wrong that seemed to happen to him at the time of the movie's production (a studio fire, his divorce, and his mother's death), Chaplin still goes on with the show. He stays in his Tramp character, with the same good-natured, gentlemen-like behavior he was known to act as, regardless of the disasters occurring in his real life. This kind of acting is one I've rarely seen, but I'm convinced that it was tough trying to stay in character with all this stress going on.

At points, I was so engrossed that the post-production sound track was distracting. To me, silent movie viewing is more reminiscent of reading a book than watching a contemporary movie in which every sound is enhanced and massaged to magnify its own importance and the importance of surrounding events If he were born a few decades later, Charlie Chaplin may not have reached the heights of popularity he attained in the infancy of the art form, but he is definitely worthy of recognition as a fine entertainer. While I am generally not a fan of slapstick style comedy, he was quite funny, especially when acting with animals (the donkey scenes were hilarious). The theme was modern feeling and even included a bit of a twist at the end. The scene where he imagines a fight with a co-entertainer was unexpected in a film from that time and added a new dimension to the movie. I was uncomfortable at points with all the character's acceptance of the casual physical abuse of the leading lady by her father (perhaps that was accurately indicative of the times?).

            "content": "\"The Circus\" is an American black-and-white film from 1928, so this one had its 90th anniversary last year, although it is almost 2020 now, but who cares. Of course, the man completely in charge of literally everything related to this movie was Charlie Chaplin and he was getting closer to the age of 40 when he made this movie, which means that it was one of his later films, but not latest. I guess you could say it liked that, even if it feels weird because he still made films decades after this one. This one runs for under 75 minutes, so it is nowhere near Chaplin's shortest or longest works. Well, he is writer, director, producer and lead actor in here. Enough said. And not just that. Apparently, the song you hear at the very beginning of this film was also performed by him and that did impress me because the singing was really good and I never pictured him as a talented singer. Okay, so of course this is a black-and-white silent film, even if there is a soundtrack to it obviously. I already mentioned Chaplin singing, but this is really just the very beginning, afterwards it is all instrumental the way it is basically always with Chaplin.In the title of this film you can already read the location where this film is set from beginning to end really. Or almost until the end. Chaplin shows up at a circus just to be a guest it seems and is immediately involved in chaos, some of it caused by himself, other stuff through unlucky coincidence. With the \"caused by himself\" I am for example talking about how he steals food from a little kid early on, even if this does not have any major consequences. What does is when the police officers catch a crook and think the purse he stole actually belong to the Tramp (Chaplin). The latter does not tell the truth, but takes the money and is quickly targeted by police as well when the truth comes out. The result is a great deal of chase sequences and the highlight for me and also everybody at my showing I believe was when he imitates this mechanical statue and moves like a robot. This was really funny, especially when he tries to get away and the cop looks again, so he has to get back to his spot and also eventually another guy joins him and also has to pretend to be one of these robots. So there are some funny sequences here early on too, but then afterwards the story really moves on to the circus. There is a story with the Tramp falling for an acrobat girl, him giving her food when she is not allowed to eat by the owner (rough times and measures back then), him eventually turning into the big star of the circus, even if he is not treated accordingly, but also falling out of love when the girl falls for another man and eventually marries him. But Charlie is a good sport and even throws rice on the two. So this is basically the key story. It sounds like a lot, but it really did not feel like it and instead it felt much more about all the slapstick action in between like I also wrote in the title of my review. Still I want to mention one moment in particular that showed us how great of a dramatic actor Chaplin also was, namely when he hears his crush talking in the next room and saying that she is in love with somebody else. Now it was impossible to not feel bad for the Tramp that moment. Such a strong performance by Chaplin in that moment. And in general too.So yeah, like I just said I think really the individual sketches here that did not always feel like they had much of a connection with each other dominated this movie. It surprised me a bit because I watched The Kid exactly one week ago and that one was 20 minutes shorter or so and included more as a story the way it felt to me at least. Most of the jokes here are really about Chaplin interactin ith all kinds of people and animals that belong to the circus. As for the people, this includes the owner who gets a pie in his face in a really messy clown sequence. But also there are scenes with the other clowns, on several occasions, especially the really big one. Then there is the new artist the girl falls for, although Chaplin does not share the screen too often with him, the guys whoch watch the donkeys etc. But the more I think about it, the more it is really about the animals I guess. The donkeys (or horses) that follow him as a bit of a running gag were good. The most memorable scene, however, was the one with the lion's cage obviously. I don't want to say much about it in detail, but it was really good and really tense even. There you could also see how giften Chaplin was. Usually his comedy is him moving around wildly and this one is obviously given the location the complete opposite. And yet it is maybe the best five minutes of the entire film. Also hilarious how the girl collapses when asked for help. Or the tigers next door. And it was even realistic with the lion waking up, but apparently not being hungry. And the farewell scene when the Tramp acts cocky towards the lions before getting out and then runs so fast and climbs even high up on something because he was so scared. Or the reference with the little black kitten not much later. Towards the end, monkeys take over animal-wise. I must say the scene with him up there did not do too much for me, even if the moment when he realizes that his safety rope is gone is pretty hilarious. And the previously mentioned monkyes in his face are pretty funny too. But in terms of Chaplin, there I was not entirely impressed. I mean it was obviously not bad, but as it seemed a bit like the highlight of the film also because of how spectacular it was, I wanted better action somehow. There were many better moments before that long scene. However, that is just personal taste obviously. It's a good movie for sure, but I'd say except Chaplin's performance and maybe the lion scene not a great movie. Also needed a little bit to really draw me in. Still it shows how big Chaplin still is long long after his death because there were hundreds of people in my showing today and that is a huge amount for a film that started past midnight, even if tickets were free. So yeah, if you get the chance to watch this one on the big screen take it. Or also see it on a small screen, it is good enough there as well. And if you ever run into a starving girl make sure you have some bread with you to share with her. Or even better an egg to give her. She will really adore you for it, even if she may not fall in love. Finally a \"rest in peace\" to everybody working on this one and thanks for giving it to us back then, especially to Chaplin, but also to Merna Kennedy, who is referenced in this film in the intertitles with her real first name, which was still nothing unusual back then. She was just 20 when this filmw as made and pretty attractive and sadly died way bafore her 40th birthday already, only days after her (second) wedding. But she left us this film and I am thank ful for it. Watch.",

Being a silent film, he had a way of easily portraying the mood of the story to his audience. It was easy to follow, you could feel the emotions he was feeling as the story developed. At the start, stealing food, making funny faces at the baby and running from police was incredibly humorous. There was honestly a part in the film that was hard to understand of to follow along. The things he did to impress the woman were very clumsy, and awkward, I could almost relate to it. It was not all fun and games though. When he gave up the woman he wanted just so that she could escape the abuse from the Circus master, it was touching. You could almost feel his disappointment and sadness. Very easy and enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "I first have to commend and praise its humor and overall humanity, even though the story itself is somewhat depressing on its own, Charlie Chaplin with his supernatural powers makes it enjoyable, warm, comic and hopeful. Now one obviously did not become a clown throughout the early 20th century for the sake of donning embarrassing makeup and contorting ones facial features in laughable ways and making a fool of themselves, nor did one train animals and spend precious hours in the coordination of all the performances simply because they enjoyed it, one did it for none other than the money and when money is in the balance greed, inhumanity and the feeling of hopelessness soon follow as is the case with the evil circus master who has a dictatorial command over his entire troupe and especially his daughter. I don't want to go into meaningful or preacher mode and I realize that it's a movie but I'd argue that money is the lions taming whip or underlying force if you will in this film from the very beginning, if it weren't for the greenbacks our sad-fated tramp would not have fallen into this mess, it's worth acknowledging as you watch the film unfold and see how Charlie Chaplin treats this subject, one might if observant enough call it a communist comedy. The scene in the mirror maze is one of my favorite scenes in which we see the tramp, policeman and the thief bumping into one another and into their own reflections all confused and disarrayed. The men crashing into their own reflections is in my opinion metaphorical and can be interpreted in many different ways depending on the viewer, which is what makes it so wonderful. It's worth remembering that Chaplin came from a poverty-ridden background himself. The way he's discovered and the way he falls into this way of life in the film is rather strange and sad, seeing how whimsical and consequential it is, a poor guy starving and desperate running from the law, thrown into the circus out of sheer need. The chemistry between Chaplin and Merna Kennedy is brilliant and the scene in which they share bread is beautifully acted, timed and shot. I felt like each scene was so well setup and scripted that they all felt like films within films or little vignettes. It's rare but heavenly when a film completely sucks you into each scene throughout the entirety of a movie, where you are practically hypnotized by the film and this one remarkably accomplished that. The comedy is rich and sophisticated and naturally has the Chaplin touch and flair to it, the tryout scene comes to mind, I doubt anyone could watch it straight faced except the evil circus master. It's easy to see why Chaplin was a phenomenon and hardly needs to be argued that he's for all time.",

I particularly enjoyed the music being used in the film, as I felt it just added to the emotion in the film. Music and facial expressions are what the audience of a silent film really have to go off of, and Chaplin nailed the facial expressions. The expressions of the actors made their actions all the more funny in my opinion. I loved when \"Tramp\" and the girl were sharing food because the girl made the best facial expressions I had seen in the film. The tightrope scene was also very cool in my opinion because it really grabbed a viewer;s attention. All in all, I think that to have a good silent film, there needs to be music that helps portray the actors emotions, and the actors really have to express themselves via their facial expressions, because other than those two aspects, the only other thing a view has to go off of is the parts where a few words summarizing the dialogue every now and then throughout the film. This film was very well done in my opinion.",

However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I went into it more skeptical than excited. I did not anticipate enjoying it nearly as much as I did. Chaplin is delightful and funny in ways that are so rare in this day and age. His style of comedy is so pure and child-like. It's a type of physical comedy that everyone can enjoy.For me, the most enjoyable part of the concept of a silent film is the allowance of imagination for the audience. With such restricted dialogue, the plot unfolds based mostly on body language, which is generally read the same way but can be perceived slightly differently by each viewer. The \"tramp\" accidentally stumbled into the lady's life and fell for her very quickly. He seemed very sympathetic and sad for the way she was being treated by her father. He was constantly trying to help her avoid his wrath. At the end of the story, when it seemed like all he wanted to do was be with the lady and would do anything to do so, he turned her away. He brought her back to the tightrope walker and happily sent them off to be married. He did the most noble thing a man could do; gave the woman he loved a better life, regardless of his own desires. He knew she would have the life she deserved with him, and her life would only stay the same with the \"tramp\".",

From issues with the budget, the shooting schedule, and having the set catch on fire and almost losing half his cast and crew, the Circus was pretty much a circus of a production. One of Chaplin's funnier films, it makes the top ten, but does not make his top ten. Chaplin was said to have hated this movie. It not only killed him, but was \"snubbed\" at the 1st Academy Awards that year. Since then, Chaplin stuck to making good movies instead of making movies that the Academy would find worthy. The Lion Cage scene mirrors the entire movie. The Tramp finds himself in one situation after another. Whether on the tight rope with monkeys after him, or running from the boy friend of the girl of his dreams, The Tramp is always on the go. Although the Tramp can get the girl, he knows she is not in love with him, so he makes her dream of love come true, as he remains the Loner he has always been. The final scene is the typical classic Chaplin of the Tramp leaving one adventure for another. As the little man lives on to fight another day, the Tramp gives the Circus a kick and heads off into the sun-set to star in the next movie.",

I've never thought very highly of it and I never understood the appeal of something like the Three Stooges that relies on it for laughs. However, this was my opinion before having seen Charlie Chaplin in action.The first thing I noticed about Charlie Chaplin is that he was just such a class act and exuded such an infectious charm that it was impossible not to give him your attention. I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I started the movie, but Charlie's performance made it fun and remarkably easy to watch. He had not only such a striking talent but you could tell in some of the gags that he commanded so much skill, too. When his character was pretending to be animatronic I was actually taken aback by how precise and robotic he was able to make his motions. Looking beyond just Chaplin's performance, the movie as a whole was also surprisingly enjoyable. The pacing was excellent, especially by today's standards. Rather than overstaying its welcome, the film left me wishing there was more to see. There weren't any real, hearty laughs, but there were plenty of genuine chuckles. And lastly, I was surprised by how well the actors and actresses were able to convey so much meaning without speaking. The relationship between Charlie and his lead actress is very compelling, even by today's standards, and this gives the very heartfelt ending a whole lot of impact. I'm glad this film was my introduction to silent-era slapstick and I can't really see anyone not having a good time watching it.",

From the cop chase in the mirror maze to the famous lion cage sequence to the climactic and tense tightrope scene, there are many big laughs piling atop one another throughout the film.  Like many of Chaplin's greatest films, 'The Circus' also has a rather sweet and tender side to it. Few silent comedies function without a love interest, and 'The Circus' is no exception; however, it is well worth noting that I feel Chaplin really, in the end, does something unique and beautifully bittersweet with the love interest in this film. The way everything turns out is not exactly what I have come to expect, and it left an interesting impact on me, particularly in its final few shots that communicate an unspoken sadness that rises with a sense of hope for the future of The Tramp's charming excursions.",

Even though it was made almost 100 years ago, I still got the jokes.Finally, I noticed that in the early days, comedies relied on body language and facial expressions. Chaplin had to use his whole body and even his walk, to convey humor. He used broad gestures, exaggerated expressions, and even interacted a lot with the setting to be funny because there was no dialogue. This seems very different from the comedy we are used to today, where dialogue and verbal humor are often the basis of the comedy. Seems to me that Chaplin had to work very hard to be funny, but he still managed to make it look effortless.",

In Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, in 1972, there was a retrospective of Chaplin's work, and I chose to watch two movies, my favorite Chaplins ever since: THE CIRCUS and MODERN TIMES.THE CIRCUS obviates Chaplin's incredibly athletic abilities, and his ballet-like sense of the comic. The scene where he mimics a clockwork figure that keeps hitting one of Chaplin's pursuers and laughing as part of the mimicry, all to fool a watching policeman, is one of the most brilliant comedy pieces ever, and I shall always feel humbled by the genius that pervades that sequence. The Tramp is the ultimate survivor and he picks up his paycheck by tending to animals and engaging in circus acts, all rather mechanically, until he meets the female lead played by Merna Kennedy, and suddenly he finds a meaning to things, and develops the type of generosity toward a fellow human being that love alone can generate.In between, there are many wonderful moments to enjoy, as Chaplin's acting and directorial skills have seldom been more inspired. Unfortunately, the film ends all too soon but - its ending is one of the most truthful I have ever seen - and Chaplin's reaction perhaps the greatest closing shot ever.At the time of writing this review, THE CIRCUS is about to turn 90 years old, but its themes, views, and comic touches remain fresh, thought-provoking, and a pleasure to return to.

Like theatre, which uses \"big\" reactions to imply significance to certain scenes, silent films, like \"The Circus\", use exaggerated expressions in the same manner. But, unlike theatre, which uses oral dialogue, silent films rely entirely on the impact of the actor's expressions.

I had been skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy silents as I generally view dialogue and language as the key elements to a good film but I was pleasantly surprised at Chaplin's as well as his fellow actors' ability to express real and heartfelt emotions without the use of words or sounds. The film produced tons of laughs with Chaplin's trademark physical comedy, funny faces and crazy antics but the story of the tramp's unrequited love for the Circus owner's abused and degraded daughter was really very touching. The love story was surprisingly complex and very well expressed without the use of words as the tramp falls for the girl but the girl is convinced that she is to fall in love with a tall, dark stranger. The tramp's decision to forgo his own feelings of love for the sake of saving the girl from the abuse and torment of the father shows amazing depth of character and morality that was unexpected but absolutely delightful. The tramp may perform as a clown in the circus but inside of the clown's chest there beats the heart of the most chivalrous knight. Pairing the delightfully complex love story with terrific physically comic performances and impressive visual effects for the time really makes The Circus(1928) an outstanding introduction to the world of silent film. The score that was added to the film some decades later is a wonderful accompaniment to the emotions, performances and visuals of the film and absolutely enhances the complex tone of the picture.",

He becomes a huge star but is too dumb to realize it so he's slaving to the owner while at the same time falling in love with his abused step-daughter (Merna Kennedy). THE CIRCUS has sadly been overlooked over time and I'd say the biggest reason why is that it fell in between THE GOLD RUSH and CITY LIGHTS. Anything sandwiched between those two films is bound to be overlooked and it's a shame because there are some very funny moments to be had here. I think the film gets off to a roaring start with a couple hilarious comic pieces. The first has the Tramp eating the hot dog a young kid who is on his father's shoulder. The timing Chaplin uses for this sequence is something that should be studied in film schools because it's done to perfection. We get another scene soon after where the Tramp is escaping from the police and ends up in a mirror room where he and the cop have trouble trying to get out. Again, the technical quality of the timing here is just something truly amazing to watch. As with most of Chaplin's work there's some drama thrown in for good measure. I think the melodrama here might be the weakest aspect of the film because the love story between the two never really takes off. It's certainly good but it's just not great enough to really make up for the fact that you're losing some comic stuff. Chaplin, as you'd expect, does a terrific job in regards to his performance. It's really amazing to see how well this guy could fit into the role of a poor man but he does it perfectly. Kennedy is pretty good in her role as the love interest and Al Ernest Garcia is a major plus as the ring master. At just 71-minutes the film goes by at a very quick pace with the majority of the gags working extremely well. While this is never going to be held in such high esteem as something like CITY LIGHTS or MODERN TIMES, the film is certainly a minor classic and deserves more attention.",

Yet, critics, fans of Chaplin, and even Chaplin himself, long overlooked this great film. The reason has more to do with the highly publicized divorce trial from Lita Grey that Chaplin endured while filming the feature over two years, as well as a host of other production disasters. Chaplin was so paranoid he felt his wife would try to steal the film, so hid the negatives. The film was not even mentioned in Chaplin's autobiography, nor was it screened in the years after its release, until, in 1970, Chaplin rereleased it with a new score that he composed.As a Chaplin aficionado, I can state that no Chaplin film goes as long- 69 minutes, with such sustained laughter. There are more memorable gags in this one film than in any other film he made- or perhaps anyone has made since, and it deservedly won him his first Academy Award at the first ceremony in 1929. It was a special award for Versatility And Genius In Writing, Acting, Directing, And Producing. Obviously, these were the days before schlock like Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Monster, and Titanic were considered 'great films,' worthy of such awards. Yet, even had Chaplin not buried the film in his vault for decades, the very fact that it was made between two of his greatest critical and financial successes, The Gold Rush and City Lights, two indisputable silent film era masterpieces, may have fated the film to its nearly forgotten status anyway.As pure comedy, perhaps the only film that has as ceaseless a run of comic gags that all work is the 1960s all-star comedy classic It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but that film could lay no claim to great nor higher art. Perhaps the only downside to The Circus- or rather the DVD, is that it does not offer the original film from 1928, replete with a silent film organ score- say by the great silent organist Rosa Rio? Instead, we only have the overwrought, and didactic musical score Chaplin composed in 1970. His opening rendition of the saccharine Swing Little Girl, sung over the opening titles, is plain bad- both as music and as sung, but thankfully passes quickly. As with his unfortunate 1942 reissue of The Gold Rush- with added narration, this music guides the audience too much, although the film's main theme, I must admit, wins you over at the end. Fortunately, that film's DVD comes with both the 1942 reissue and the 1925 original- which is superior. Some artists never know when to leave greatness alone. Even so, The Circus is the purest and least flawed Chaplin feature film ever made, in that it distills every single aspect of his greatness and, yes, even that grossly overused term- genius. For anyone with a love of pure cinema, silent cinema, and its history, this film and DVD is a must to see and own. But, if you have heart problems, I advise you to be wary, because it is so funny it could literally hurt you\u0085.but wouldn't that be the best way to go?",

Fantastic performances by Chaplin and co-star Merna Kennedy bring the perfect amount of emotion and laughter to a very simple story. What stood out most to me about the film was how incredibly modern it felt. It had always been a misunderstanding of mine that most silent films (with many exceptions) would seem boring or outdated. \"The Circus\" demonstrates that that is not the case. Aside from being one of the most genuinely funny comedies I have seen in years, the film is a perfect example of how early American films did not need enormous budgets or groundbreaking visual effects to captivate an audience. I highly recommend anyone with a serious love for film to see \"The Circus\". I have a feeling it will become one of my favorites over the years.",

The hitch -- he doesn't know he's a star, because he's never trying to be funny (he's just going about his prop man duties), and the circus owner will go to great lengths to prevent him from finding out how much the audience loves him for fear that he'll lose his touch.There are too many funny moments in this film to single out any one in particular. Chaplin was originally nominated in the categories of Best Director (Comedy Picture), Best Actor and Best Writing (Original Story) at the very first Academy Awards in 1927/28 for this picture, but his nominations were withdrawn and he was given a special award instead, ostensibly because he belonged in \"a class by himself\" but really because the Hollywood execs who ran the Oscars wanted to punish him for being difficult. I've seen most of the major films that were in contention that first year, and aside from F.W. Murnau's \"Sunrise,\" which is a whole different movie experience anyway, I haven't seen one that competes with \"The Circus.\" Grade: A+",

No. Befitting and completing the emotional tenor of the tramp, all he desired was an egg. So rewarded, he doffs his hat to the offscreen chicken. A fair exchange thus completed.I can hardly believe that in 50 or so comments, no one has mentioned the introduction of Merna to Charlie. When she reveals that indeed she is a performer in the circus, charlie glances at the poster-bill behind them both advertising the \"Sword Swallower\" With a mischievous grin and lilting eyes, he inquires as to whether this is HER role in the show. When she corrects him, \"No, I ride the horses.\" he is so sweetly embarrassed by his misconstrual of her talents. A very sexually subversive, risqu\u00e9 gag for 1928.There's dozens more just like this within this film and if you haven't seen it, it is so worth the investment of 70 minutes of your entertainment time. It has heart, nobility, zany humor and madcap comedic antics rolled into one concise ball; not unlike the ball of paper made by the crumpled circus star, that the tramp kicks away in the end.a wonderful piece of film-making.pax vk",

His slapstick comedy transcends pretty much all barriers to entry, such as language, age or politics (unless we're talking about 'The Great Dictator (1941)', which is practically rooted in politics). 'The Circus (1928)' is no exception; I can imagine it being enjoyed by all. Though it is nearly a hundred years old, its energy radiates from between the film grain and ensures it holds up to this very day. It's a fast-paced, good-natured, rib-tickling experience that has almost as much heart as it has humour. Seriously, some of its gags are side-splitting - not to mention dangerous - and it's pleasant to watch even when it isn't making you laugh out loud.

But even from early on we see thought going into such things as visual effects and space such as in the mirror fun house scenes and the time when Charlie sits in front of the poster of Stella and then references the poster later on in the scene goes to show they were thinking about composition. Also music is a key component of the movie, here we have a work that can only be communicated limitedly through inter titles and actors expression and movement but the music expands and allows for another dimension of understanding. The inter titles almost act in place of an establishing shot for when they want to shift gears to another key point of the plot about to take place. Chalpin's ability to emote as well as any other silent film stars are also large components of what makes this movie so charming, endearing, and a pervading classic.

            "content": "All the eloquence of the world couldn't translate with words the brilliance of Chaplin's comical power, a gift whose paroxysm was \u2013in my opinion- reached with \"The Circus\", his movie from 1928. Yes, for me, not only is \"The Circus\" one of the funniest movies ever made, but it's also one of the greatest introspections into the power of making people laugh, Vis Comica, as the Romans said. And in this department, Chaplin was not just a genius, he was a God. I seriously don't know where to start, or how I should review this masterpiece. On one hand, it's one of the deepest and most intelligent comedies, and the most fascinating aspect is that it comes from a silent film, as if the most meaningful things hardly needed words to be understood. And this is why I used the word 'genius', because there are so many levels of greatness jointed in this comedy, that the comical elements are not only universal, but they also transcend generations and time barriers, delivering an important message about the difficulty and the guts it takes to make people laugh, or just to try to. And on the other hand, it's just so damn funny, I ca'tn count how many times, I burst out laughing while rediscovering the magic of my childhood.Let's explore the intelligence of the film, there's something almost pretentious in the way Chaplin denounces the cheap laughs some people throw to audiences as if it was just pieces of bread to satisfy an occasional appetite. And he's lucid enough to concede that himself could be legitimately perceived as a simple clown, but we know he's better than that. For some reason, I thought of the film \"Goodfellas\", when Joe Pesci said \"How am I funny? You mean like a clown, do I amuse you?\" This sentence rang a bell for me, because I understood that it didn't take to be a clown to amuse ... not that I ignored it, but the way Chaplin portrays clowns in the film is so ridiculous and pathetic, you laugh not with them, but at them. But it's still laughs, because after all, the movie is still a comedy. The way, the Master of the Ring looks at them after their pathetic number, says it all: \"And you're supposed to be funny?\" It's hilarious how they're unfunny. And when the Tramp finishes his unintentional successful number, the way the clowns come back \u0085 I don't think they could have been more pathetic \u0085 and yet, absurdly funny. In fact, the clowns are not funny by trying to be, yet their ridiculousness was the only thing that could provide laughs, because it's deliberate, Chaplin wanted us to laugh at them. While the Tramp is genuinely comic, in the way he acts, moves, and the situations he puts himself in : from the hilarious mirror maze scene and his demonic laugh while mechanically hitting the pickpocket guy's head pretending to be a dummy to the running gag with the mule, from his interactions with the beautiful acrobat Merna, especially the hiccup scene, Chaplin's body language was incredible because you really understand what he says without a word spoken, to the lion's cage scene etc etc ... Not to mention, what is probably my most hilarious Chaplin's movie moment, ten seconds, and one line, \"Be funny!\" The antagonistic Master of the Ring after realizing that the Tramp was genuinely funny, kept him as the unknowing hit of the show and asked him to improvise something funny. The result is hilarious beyond words. Chaplin childishly moves his body as a trying to imitate his own legendary demeanor; again, it's so unfunny it IS funny. And again, beyond the laughter, I couldn't help but being amazed by the relevance of the story, Chaplin presents the risk of losing the comical touch sooner or later but reassures us that he still got it. He assesses his comical power by mocking his own representation. See? Try to analyze its brilliance, you end up praising its slapstick and vice versa \u0085And here, he's in a circus, the best setting to explore various comedic situations, but if the circus is just the setting, the heart of the story, is the little acrobat Merna, who will govern all the Tramp's actions, like \"City Lights\"' blind girl. The Tramp is the quintessential romantic comedy's character, because it's always love that provokes his funniest moments. But he's also a character condemned to loneliness, probably the only thing he has in common with the clowns. Or maybe, he's precisely the purest incarnation of the clown-figure, with no make-up, just a genuine intention to make us laugh. Buster was the everyday man, Chaplin the clown. This is the bittersweet feeling that gives this movie enough maturity to stand the test of time and not to be just a succession of gags. As soon as the tall dark tightrope walker comes, you know this won't be a happy ending for Chaplin. But he made his point in this film, where he explored all the mechanisms that makes comedy work : a mix of spontaneity, zaniness and a profound respect to the audience's intelligence and a definite self-confidence, this feeling is what Chaplin expresses his best. He knows his comical value enough to take risks, to make fun of himself directly and indirectly through the clown figure, until we understand he'll be forever the quintessential clown.And as a great comedy couldn't afford an ordinary ending, this one had the most iconic we could ever dream, the Tramp having finally offered happiness to the girl he loved by letting her with the charming Prince, preferred to let the troop leave and not joining it. Then he walks into the sunset, in one of the most memorable ending sequences that would become one of Chaplin's most unforgettable trademarks",

This isn't one of Charlie Chaplin's most famous films, but definitely deserves to be mentioned. This may in fact focus on comedy more than any other film he made at the time. The only spoken audio is some recorded voice at the beginning. It was made one year after the first talkie \"The Jazz Singer\". Boy, did it take a short time to every movie to have sound! The best parts are probably the opening bits. You can get so much humor out of the bizarre funhouse the Tramp is caught in. The best part is easily when he imitates an animatronic and then hits a guy with a billy club over and over. This is comedy that holds up. Another great part is near the end with the tightrope walking. It's great to see how this scene escalates in slapstick. For such a goofy movie, it actually does have a pretty heartfelt ending. The story makes sense too.I was watching this film hoping to see this scene where a woman is using a large machine that some people thought was a cell phone, meaning that the woman was a time traveler. It turns out this was only in the DVD version. I only saw the TCM one. This probably sets a record for oldest video used as an Internet meme.

            "review_title": "The Clown's House of Mirrors",
            "content": "Although \"The Circus\" is rightly, I think, often considered a second-tier Chaplin film-ranking below his generally more-acclaimed features of \"The Kid\" (1921), \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), \"City Lights\" (1931), \"Modern Times\" (1936) and \"The Great Dictator\" (1940)-it still deserved plenty of recognition from the 1st Academy Awards (ultimately, its nominations were removed in favor of honoring Chaplin with a special award for \"versatility and genius in writing, acting, directing and producing 'The Circus'\"), as even a second-tier Chaplin film is better than most other films. With the circus setting, it's one of his most reflexive performances next to \"Limelight\" (1952), where Chaplin also mirrors reality by playing a performer.A notorious perfectionist by this point, years passing between finished features, taking numerous retakes to work out gags, Chaplin in \"The Circus,\" ironically, plays his usual Tramp persona as a clown who is only funny unintentionally. The Tramp first enters the circus tent during a rendition of the common slapstick routine of being chased by cops. The circus crowd roars with laughter as the Tramp makes a mess of the circus performers' prepared acts. During the chase sequence, there's also a house of mirrors gag, which seems to intentionally call attention to the meta content of the film reflecting its own production. Art reflecting and distorting life. A later scene, where the Tramp experiences an out-of-body fantasy, works on a similar level of doubling and dreams. The ringmaster deceptively hires the Tramp in the props department to exploit his talent for unintentional comedy, but once the Tramp learns he's the star of the show, he ceases to be funny. Indeed, the film's comedic finale of the Tramp walking the tightrope only becomes funny when it, too, doesn't go according to plan--just monkeying around.Decidedly unfunny was the film's actual production, which was reportedly the most frustrating of Chaplin's career. A scratched negative ruining original takes, a studio fire burning sets, Chaplin's scandalous second divorce to a teenage wife and problems with the IRS held up the production and release for months. Parallels between the comedic mess the Tramp makes of productions within the film and the dramatic mess of the film's actual production are easy to make. More interesting regarding cinema appreciation, methinks, however, is the twist of the Tramp's persona as an unintentional clown, which is contrary to the deliberate practices of the film's maker and clown, Charlie Chaplin.Perhaps, the major weakness of \"The Circus\" is the other two legs of its love triangle involving the Tramp. The girl, despite the drama of her abusive relationship with her stepfather ringmaster, and Rex, the tightrope walker, aren't as compelling as some of the supporting characters in other Chaplin features, and their romantic relationship is underdeveloped. Nobody seems to even care about the unexplained disappearance and reappearance of Rex that's crucial to the final act.Jeffrey Vance sees a parallel between the ending, with the circus moving on without the Tramp, and the rise of talking pictures leaving Chaplin's style of silent artistry behind. One could further compare the demise in the popularity of the circus and related theatrical acts due in part to the rise of motion pictures and, within motion pictures, the end of the silent era due to the talkies. Vance specifically cites that the last scene began shooting four days after the premiere of \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), and that the 1928 score for \"The Circus\" concludes with Irving Berlin's \"Blue Skies,\" which was also song by Al Jolson in \"The Jazz Singer.\" Today, most people who've seen \"The Circus,\" including me, have only heard Chaplin's 1969 original rescoring, and it's a lovely score. I doubt \"Blue Skies\" worked better than Chaplin's music for the poignant end. Another standout of the score is the by-then-elderly Chaplin singing \"Swing Little Girl\" over the new opening credits sequence of Merna Kennedy swinging.",

To hell with all those critics lists, IMDb lists, Rotten Tomatoes lists and any other Lists of Greatest Films of All Time who doesn't include The Circus in it. I don't give a damn to all those cheap lists and i don't even wanna spit on them only to waste my time. The Circus is a legendary comedy film and if that's not enough then it has the best logical climax for any comedy film made by its time and possibly all time. The Circus is about a Tramp finds work and the girl of his dreams at a circus and becomes a hit of the show. This Chaplin comedy has left uncountable influences for many great comedy films made over the years. Many scenes from this film has been copied but were never able to match the quality even though those remade scenes have been enjoyed by audiences. May be this brief review isn't enough to explain the timeless impact of the film and it may take an essay writing services to explain it perfectly with all the influenced stuff and the comparisons. Anyways, let's stick to the original. The Circus is freaking amazing comedy. It's a riot. The 70 minutes of hilariousness that you'll never experience again and then the haunting climax will leave you speechless. The fundamental, logical and ethical understanding Chaplin shows in the ending scene just can't be defeated by any comedy film. Remember the similar climax we saw in Masterpiece Casablanca? Yes, this was 14 years before that. The last 10 minutes of this film are undoubtedly one of the best last 10 minutes in motion pictures history without the help of any dialogues, grandeur and visual appeal. That's life on screen, i guess. The way he walks with his back towards the screen.. that frame will stay with me for long time.

This one came three years after \"The Gold Rush\" and three years before \"City Lights.\" While it is not as good as those two, which are among his best, it does provide a nice blend of comedy and pathos. Unlike his best films, the laughs are neither sustained nor raised to peaks of hilarity. Also, the circus owner's treatment of his daughter is rather disturbing. Nevertheless, even second tier Chaplin is worth watching and this one has its moments. Highlights include Charlie being chased by cops and later by a deranged donkey, as well as being locked in a cage with a sleeping lion.",

Not taking anything away from the production. The production was great for 1928. It is just tough for me to go from movies like today with sarcastic funny speaking attitudes, to a movie with no sound and what I think is corny acting. Anyone who likes todays movies with sound and funny sarcastic comedy may think this movie is a little corny. Worth giving it a shot tho!",

It was beautifully filmed and portrays the significance of being \"rich at heart\". The tramp \"Chaplin\" is such a relatable character and this film is hilarious and intriguing from start to finish. What really worked in this film was chaplin's short sketches, which where of the tramp and his risky little close calls, and shenanigans. They where effortlessly amusing and surprisingly unpredictable. This kind of humor pieces the film together in such a unique and clever way. Like no other film I've ever had the pleasure to watch.

            "content": "\"The Circus\" is probably Charlie Chaplin's least known and appreciated feature film coming as it does between two classics, \"The Gold Rush\" (1925) and \"City Lights: (1931). However, it is a very funny film filled with hilarious sequences.Charlie, The Little Tramp gets involved with a pickpocket (Steve Murphy) who tries to hide a stolen wallet on Charlie's person to avoid a cop. When the cop sees the pickpocket trying to retrieve the wallet, he assumes that it is Charlie being robbed and returns the wallet to him. Thinking that he has lucked in, Charlie begins to plan to spend his windfall when the man from whom the wallet was originally stolen, grabs it back leaving Charlie broke once again.The pickpocket, thinking Charlie still has the wallet chases after him. Charlie is chased into a circus that just happens to be playing and creates a sensation when he gets involved with the circus performers including the clowns and a magic act. The Ring Master (Allen Garcia) is impressed and offers Charlie a job.The old clown (Henry Bergman) tries to teach Charlie their act but Charlie is unable to blend in. You see, Charlie's humor is spontaneous and un-rehearsed.\nThe Ring Master, who is also the owner, decides to keep Charlie on knowing his value to the circus, but as a property man. The owner just also happens to have a young step daughter (Merna Kennedy) whom Charlie takes under his wing.Charlie continues to wow the audiences until one day Rex the high wire act (Harry Crocker) arrives. The step daughter falls in love with him much to poor Charlie's chagrin. Charlie's performances begin to suffer as a result causing him to be fired. Charlie leaves the circus but the young woman follows him and........................................Some of the other highlights include the fun house/hall of mirrors sequence, the part where Charlie gets locked in the lion cage, Charlie being chased by a mule and his attempt at the high wire act.You really have to appreciate Chaplin's genius while watching this film. He did everything from producing, directing and starring in it. At the same time, he was undergoing personal problems off screen including a nasty divorce and trouble with the tax man. Still, he managed to survive a nervous breakdown and complete what must be included as one of his greatest films.A true genius, the likes of which we will never see again.",

            "content": "Considering silent films are the original models of the type of films that entertain us today, I'd say The Circus reflects a lot of trends that are still prevalent in the cinema industry. The movie features the silly, underdog-type character (Charlie Chaplin), the gorgeous damsel in distress character (Merna Kennedy), the oppressor (Al Ernst Garcia), and the strapping, masculine, and skillful character (Harry Crocker). As in a lot of films familiar to us today in The Circus we have the underdog and the damsel in distress brought together by there ill-treatment they receive from the oppressor. As in most cases the underdog falls for the damsel and later when the masculine ideal man comes into the picture the underdog attempts to compete with him. unlike more modern films in The Circus the underdog does not win the girl over instead she falls for the more masculine character. The significance in the circus is its success likely help ignite this trend that we still see in films today. The subject matter of it is versatile and can be used in anything from comedies to horror films.",

            "content": "'The Circus (1928)' was one of the few Charles Chaplin features that I was yet to see, but that wasn't from lack of trying. I first attempted to watch the film mid-way through last year, but, being terribly ill at the time, and having to wake up relatively early the following morning, I barely got half-way through the Tramp's antics before I had to turn off the DVD and go to sleep. For some reason that I can't quite explain, it took until yesterday for me to finally commit to another try, and it was a pleasant and entertaining experience. Though certainly one of Chaplin's lesser efforts, 'The Circus' is an enjoyable and imaginative thread of slapstick gags, with the occasional hint of pathos, though not to the extent of many of the Tramp's other feature-length outings. The circus setting provides an ideal collection of props and scenarios for Chaplin to explore, and many of the film's laughs are derived from his character's hopeless attempts at being a clown, performing magic and tight-rope walking.We first find the Tramp {whom Chaplin liked to call the \"little fellow\"} at a carnival, completely devoid of money, where a devious pickpocket (Steve Murphy) has stashed his winnings into the Tramp's trouser pocket. As he tries to pickpocket his money back, a policeman catches him, and, completely befuddled, the Tramp finds himself graciously thanking the officer for returning the money that he never knew he had. Needless to say, it doesn't take long before both the Tramp and the pickpocket find themselves frantically fleeing the authorities, and Chaplin takes refuge in a maze of mirrors, where the policemen can certainly see their quarry, but can't decide which of the dozen reflections is real. Following a hot pursuit, the Tramp finds himself scuttling through a circus tent in the middle of a performance, and the audience is left in hysterics by his inadvertently hilarious antics. The The Circus Proprietor (Al Ernest Garcia), desperate for anyone who might save his floundering show, hires the Tramp immediately, but deliberately neglects to inform him that he is the star attraction.As was typical in most of Chaplin's pictures, there is also a love interest that forms the story's emotional heart. Merna Kennedy plays one of the circus performers, the ill-treated step-daughter of the show's proprietor. When they first meet, the Tramp scolds the hungered girl for stealing his meagre breakfast, but quickly takes pity on her, and eventually falls in love. Realising that he lacks the means to provide any respectable life for the women he loves, the Tramp graciously surrenders any notions of marrying her, instead convincing Rex (Harry Crocker), a handsome and upright tight-rope walker, to take her hand in marriage. The film's final image, of Chaplin sitting alone in the newly-deserted field where the circus once resided, is almost achingly poignant, a perfect illustration of the lonely lifestyle that he must lead each day. It was Charles Chaplin, in even his early films, who discovered that tragedy and comedy were never too far apart: though 'The Circus' doesn't quite balance the two as evenly as his various masterpieces, such as 'Modern Times (1936)' and 'The Great Dictator (1940),' it remains a joyous slapstick romp, with more than enough heart to go around.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp joins the Big Top in this often overlooked silent classic, made between 'The Gold Rush' and 'City Lights' and, in retrospect, unable to avoid unflattering (and unfair) comparisons to those two masterpieces. It's certainly the comedian's most problematic feature, suffering from (among other things) forced plotting and a confused, self-conscious evaluation of his own humor. The Little Tramp is hired as an apprentice clown, but is oblivious to his own success in the center ring, which puts Chaplin in a quandary: are we to believe the Little Fellow isn't a natural comedian, and how do we laugh at him when Chaplin makes a joke out of his not being funny?But while it may not be a tour de force the film nevertheless features several incidental comic routines which surely rank among Chaplin's best: the pursuit through the carnival midway, the encounter in the lion's cage, and (best of all) the climactic tightrope act, with the Tramp and several mad monkeys sharing the same high wire. What the film doesn't have is the distinctive unity of some of his other, better remembered features: the episodic storyline is clearly a result of creative frustration, and the bittersweet romance with the ringmaster's battered niece is, at best, little more than a cursory subplot, with Chaplin regressing to dated Victorian sentiment when he forces his lovelorn Tramp into the ill-fitting role of the selfless matchmaker. Chaplin's awareness of his own mythic image might also have become a distraction. By 1928 the Tramp was perhaps the most recognizable figure in the entire world and, try as he might to make him appear otherwise, Chaplin's Little Fellow was no longer so little.",

The story is pretty simple with The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time taking a stage hand job at a circus where he unwittingly becomes the star of the show with his antics. The best moments of the film are the expertly choreographed comic routines. The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction. The unrequited love story adds some much needed depth to the film, giving it that bittersweet quality that any good comedy needs to be effective.

However, they alone are already enough to convince me that Chaplin was a genius, and a very funny man. Here he plays his famous tramp character, who is first involved in a hilarious chase sequence with the cops throughout the circus. When his physical antics prove funnier to the paying crowd than the clowns already acting in the show, the mean and abusive ringmaster hires Chaplin as a funnyman for the circus. There are consistent funnies all along the way, but also an endearing story of his affection for a female horse rider from the show, who's sweet on someone else.I often say that silent films are not my favorite type, and I don't care for the silent Laurel and Hardy films like I do their early talkies, because I love hearing their verbal exchanges (especially Hardy's). But when it comes to Charlie Chaplin I can't imagine his work being as entertaining any other way than silent, with him relying on pantomime over voice.

Chaplin is famous for being able to create a likable main character, here is no exception.

The Presentation of the film is stupendous, no scene is there as filler, all of it is designed to have purpose, a role if you will. I've held off on discussing the plot in detail to prevent spoilers of the film, but the film will leave you with some thoughts running through your head, after a more than fair share of hysterically hilarious moments.

            "content": "The Circus was a big hit at the time of its release, reputedly the fourth most commercially successful of all Chaplin's films (after Limelight, The Great Dictator and The Gold Rush) and the recipient of a special Oscar at the very first Academy Awards. Yet today it's possibly the least critically-regarded of his silent features.It's a shame, because it's one of Chaplin's funniest movies, with plenty of invention. Forget the tightrope walk with the monkeys, around which the entire film was based \u2013 look out for the scene where Chaplin, on the run, has to imitate a sideshow automaton, his entire body language changing to accommodate the illusion. Then there's visually inventive sequences, such as his imaginary double leaving his body to administer a jealous beating of a love rival, or the twin boxers, played by a single actor via split screen, in a deleted scene.All humour is, of course, subjective, but it's doubtful that a Chaplin movie would produce the gales of laughter it did at the time if seen by modern audiences. Yet with Chaplin, this isn't really the point. His works have come to be regarded as art, however much he himself may have despised the term. The Kid isn't a particularly funny picture in 2012. It can be cloying, treacly sentimental and self-aware. But the mise-en- scene is sublime, and the socio-political elements rewarding. The Circus is the funnier movie, but it has little or nothing to say about the human condition.Produced under extremely stressful conditions, there are times in The Circus where Chaplin does look tired. Themes of a man only being funny when he doesn't try, and a star making unbending financial demands are both perhaps unconscious reflections of his own state of mind. Yet there's a myth surrounding The Circus that it doesn't get mentioned in Chaplin's autobiography. This is possibly due to it not featuring in the book's index (at least in the copy I read), as well as being stated in the book's introduction and the related edition of \"Chaplin Today\". But there is a fleeting reference to the making of the film in chapter eighteen, out of chronological context, where he marries the memory of the film's creation with the death of his mother. Add to this his second divorce, studio fires, tax issues and a rumoured nervous breakdown and it's little wonder that it's a venture Chaplin perhaps wanted to gloss over, if not quite forget. Yet he returned to the film some five years after his autobiography was published, creating a new score and song for its re-release. Ultimately The Circus is one of the most lightweight yet funniest of Chaplin's features; considering the circumstances in which it was made this is doubly surprising.",

            "content": "A rather tight, simple premise that blossoms under the influence of Charlie Chaplin's expert touch, like a majority of his timeless classics. This go-around, he happens upon a traveling circus, inadvertently stumbles his way into becoming a star attraction, falls for the trapeze girl and finds trouble with her father, the ringmaster. Sprinkled along the way are frequent doses of brilliant physical comedy, inventive and original as ever, which playfully goof around with the trappings of daily life around the carnival grounds. Chaplin suffered several personal hardships during filming - a messy public divorce, a ruinous studio fire, the death of a parent - and tucked in amidst all the hijinx and gags I found a tinge of quiet sadness and reflection. Particularly late in the picture, when the plucky Tramp falls into the friend zone and struggles with jealousy over his girl's new fling, he emits an air of desperation, then acceptance, that organically develops into a sweet, unexpected climax. It's easy to get the sense that he worked through quite a bit with this picture, both behind the camera and before it, which elevates the product from a very good silent comedy into something more significant, something lasting. The parting shot, in which the show noisily rides off to the next town while Chaplin is left in the dust, serves as a potent metaphor for his fears over the steamrolling arrival of sound cinema (The Jazz Singer opened a mere three months before The Circus) and adds yet another layer to the complex emotional undercurrent. A phenomenal, and oft-overlooked, bit of understated work from one of Hollywood's brightest stars.",

The mental crisis, sentimentality and the grief can all be seen in the result. It's no coincidence Chaplin decided to bring his specified 'tramp' character to the merciless and artificial milieu of circus. When the tramp unintentionally runs into the circus he happens to get more laughs than all the performers put together. When he asks for a job and salary from the owner of the circus, his comedy suddenly doesn't work any more - intentional comedy is much harder than one would think. A side plot of The Circus is the young woman, who admires the tramp. Soon the tramp falls in love with her, but will be disappointed when a dark handsome tight-rope walker enters the circus.On one level The Circus is an autobiographical film and about the thoughts of an entertainer - the demarcation of show and reality are themes modern cinema often leaves alone, but with what some have dared to deal with. For instance Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's masterpiece He Who Gets Slapped (1924). The Circus is a film about the ruthless world of circus and about the meaning of being a performer.On the other hand The Circus tells us about society, art, love and loneliness. It's perhaps the most sentimental film by Chaplin. The picture of the lonely tramp, who had to let the girl go and sadly accept the love of her and the tight-rope walker, is unforgettable and a very important moment when building the artist image of Chaplin.",

Despite the wealth accumulated in life, Charlie is always the battler in film, which make the themes - the hardships of a capitalist society, and the strange things we find ourselves doing in order to earn a buck - the same here as the others, and therefore no less 'weighty', as some may have you believe.Besides, who turns to Chaplin films for social commentary? He was always at his best looking for the best gag in any given location, and in 'The Circus', the laughs never stop coming, and the plot never loses track. It is cleverly self-referential, as Charlie is forced to audition for the role of a clown. He knew what he was and did it better than most others, and those audition scenes, along with the mirror sequences, the lion sequence, and the tight-rope sequence, are some of the best of his career. It also highlights the pressure on the star to continue to be funny, something he no doubt experienced often through his own career. Achieving this is no easy feat, yet he managed it in countless films, and is here as confident as ever. He makes it look effortless.",

Naturally I didn't enjoy this as much as the other Chaplin films we've watched. I did enjoy the high wire sequence; you can't go wrong with monkeys.

In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.",

I was familiar with The Tramp, having seen the classic The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times (yeah I still have to see The Kid), and many of the shorts featuring that beloved character.It was a wonderful experience. Overall I don't rank it up there with the previous mentioned films, but still it was superb. The plot has the Tramp getting work at a circus, run by a very angry owner.There are many terrific scenes, but two I'll mention here are the baby pancake scene and the tightrope scene. For the former, just watch the Tramp's expression as he eats the kid's pancake, looking around to see if anyone is looking at him as he eats. Hilarious! How he smiles at the kid and makes like the kid is offering him the food and the kid wasn't! The tightrope scene with the Tramp subbing for the missing aerialist is by far the best thing in the movie. Balancing with help from a support belt.....with disastrous results! Throw in a few pesky monkeys and you'll be rolling on the floor!!!! You read this far, search out the film! It was on TCM very recently. Charlie Chaplin rocks, that's all there is to it!",

His movies presented the perfect combination of comedy and emotion. The Circus is his most underrated movie. It's hilarious and full of some amazing technical wizardry. However, Chaplin's not afraid to make us feel and cry.A little tramp comes upon a circus and falls in love with the ringmaster's daughter. But the ringmaster is a tyrant. He's impressed with the tramp's comedy and hires him. But the tramp's only funny when he's not trying to be. It's a simple narrative for a mostly simple movie. But under the surface, it's a poignant story of unrequited love.Everything Chaplin touched was gold. It's a film where you come for the wacky comedy but stay for the characters and story. I truly believe anyone who wants to make a comedy needs to study Chaplin and how he constructed his films.The final minute or so is seriously one of the best scenes ever committed to film. It's the perfect crescendo to a near perfect movie.",

This movie seems to be the kind of hidden treasure of which only a few TRUE Chaplin's fans know about. The relative obscurity is partially in the fault of Chaplin rarely and scarcely ever mentioned it. That is pitty because 'The Circus' is in no way inferior to Chaplin's other silent features from that period. Quite the contrary - this might be his finest besides 'Modern Times' and 'City Lights'. The production (and Chaplin's private life) was plagued with problems and shooting had to be halted many times, thus the movie took nearly two years to finish. Still, the movie is nothing less than brilliant. Many inventive sequences move the story along but also work perfectly as stand alone sketches. The film is hilarious - laugh after laugh, but like always in his best works, Chaplin manages to blend in some feelings, but without being forcefully touching. A lot of laughs, no tears but there might be a bit of melancholy.",

            "content": "An 87 year old film must be viewed with some perspective of time, yet a blank pass cannot be given simply for age. The Circus is a comedy not unlike one from today; Physical gags are prevalent and at the end of the story not much has changed. I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion yet some of the jokes went on for too long and became boresome. I'll attribute most of this to the art still being in its infancy, but it cannot go unnoticed. The acting is unparalleled, even in comparison to contemporary comedians. By not relying on funny voices or noises, Chaplin is able to perfect his comedic timing. The film is well edited, however I found myself wondering why certain pieces of dialog were given intertitles while others were not. Overall I enjoyed The Circus very much, it holds up well despite its age and glut. A lesson that comedies of today can learn from is that humor is timeless and with the right storyteller a simple tale can live forever.Read my complete review (w/ possible spoilers) at CD1083.com",

I don't think this movie is necessarily one of his best. This movie was all about Chaplin playing a character who's natural humor is his only style of being funny. He's funny when he's not trying. His clumsiness and goofy attitude is what makes him funny. He get's hired on a circus team with a cruel owner. Personally I feel this movie lacked a lot of Chaplin's simple humor, you'd find in a lot of his other masterpiece's. It was a very interesting story, but the film lacked the simple humor. I think it focused a little to much on story and not humor. Their were funny parts, but not as many as in his others. Also some of the cuts in the movie didn't flow very well. I also had a hard time finding my place in the invisibility of the film, so in other words it really didn't entertain me enough personally to get into the story and forget I'm watching a movie.",

Surprisingly, I was fully awake through the entire movie and actually ended up really enjoying it. I love how simple it was and with that it was easy for everyone to laugh through out the film. I love how exaggerated Charlie Chaplins acting was, since there is no sound or verbal jokes to make you laugh, you laugh at his facial expression, the way he walks and moves about. My two favorite scenes in the movie were when he is being chased in the fun house and when he hears that Merna is in love, and assumes its him she loves. I was surprised at how it ended but also pleased. I thought he was going to chase the train down so he would still have a job. Instead he walks away from it and moves on with his life.",

Having a slapstick comedy take place at a circus is a comedic goldmine, because the possibilities are endless. What I love most about this film is how it basically points out why silent comedies are so hilarious. In the film, the ringmaster wants to hire Chaplin because he's a \"funny man\", but the ringmaster doesn't realize Chaplin's character is only funny by accident. That's the best thing about silent comedies, how the characters aren't going out of their way to make you laugh, they're just living their lives, and happen to have the bad luck of ending up in these comedic situations. To me, that is a silent comedy. The last thing I must mention is the ending. I won't spoil it by saying what happens; but let's just say it isn't the traditional kind of ending audiences think of when they think of a light hearted comedy from this era. It might throw people off because they're probably expecting another kind of ending, but it's one of the most mature endings to a movie from this time period I've ever seen. \"The Circus\" (to me) isn't as good as \"The Gold Rush\", \"City Lights\", or \"Modern Times\", but it's still Chaplin at his best, and it makes me laugh (out loud) every time I see it.",

For 1928 the editing and photography of the film was excellent, far above what I expected. In one scene Chaplin is seen twice in two places in the same frame, I had no idea how they did this back in 1928 because this was filmed far before the use of editing software and green screens that are used to create similar scenes today! Another great aspect of the film was the added soundtrack which really intensified the experience and added to the hilarity of the film (if watching the original no soundtrack will exist). Charlie Chaplin truly is what makes the film so enjoyable mostly because his 'little tramp' character is genius. The way the tramp walks, uses his facial expressions, and uses his props just makes you forget that you're even viewing a silent film, it's almost as if you can tell what Chaplin is saying during the film.This film is excellent and a must-see for any movie buff. What's nice about any classic film as well is that it's in the age group such that many senior citizens may have viewed the film and can relate with it if you talk to them about it (I have a soft side for any senior).

I was amazed at how easy it was to follow a the story without any words! A few years ago I had taken a Piano Workshop with Donald Sosin, an internationally known pianist who (along with his wife) specializes in creating the music for today's silent films. From that, I thought I knew what to look for: music that speeds up with anticipation for the exciting parts, and the slow melodic tunes to signify lower moods. However, watching \"The Circus\" gave me a whole new appreciation for the silent film era. The facial expressions, exaggerated movements, and a tramp running away from a donkey- this movie kept me (and my friends) laughing the whole way through. Since then, I've told everyone that will listen (ha) that this film that reminds us that life always has a plan for us, even if at the time we're not quite sure what it is, is definitely one to check out on a lazy Sunday when your typical chic-flick just won't do!",

            "content": "The Circus, starring Charlie Chaplin, is a silent comedy that tells a story of a man who accidentally becomes the hit of the circus. The facial expressions of the main characters (Charlie Chaplin, Merna Kennedy, and Al Garcia) all contribute to the humor in this movie. For example when the pickpocket stuck the stolen wallet in Charlies back pocket you could tell by his facial expression that he was up to no good. When Charlie pulled the wallet out of his back pocket he looked shocked but also happy which makes the viewer laugh because they know something funny is going to happen as the result of this. Another example of when facial expressions contribute to the humor in the movie would be when the horse chases Charlie around continuously. When the scene changes to a horse you almost automatically know from the way Charlie acts and his facial expressions that the horse is ready to chase Charlie. Charlie's slapstick comedy lets the viewer know that this chase is going to be funny.Another feature that makes this movie funny is the body language that the characters show. For a viewer new to silent films, watching this body language helps to tell the story that would otherwise be told in words. You can tell Charlie's character likes Merna Kennedy by the way he looks at her. The way he stares, along with the music lets the viewer know that he's falling in love. Another example of why the body language makes this movie funny is when Charlie finds out he is the center of the act and asks for a raise. When he gets his raise you know his reasons for asking for it. For a person new to silent films this was the perfect film to grab my interest. I actually laughed when I didn't think I would. For someone used to action films this type of film was actually very entertaining. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys silent films or comedies.",

I understand now why Charlie Chaplin was so well known and praised for his movies. The beginning automatically grabbed my attention and was very funny when Chaplin was taking the food from the baby when no one was looking because he didn't have enough money to buy his own and then got mistaken for stealing money from a man which lead him to run from the police where he ultimately ended up at the circus that happened to be in town. He accidentally became a hit at the circus when he accidentally ran out in the ring and got the crowd laughing. He was offered a job which he gladly took because he needed the money and because he liked a girl that was also in the circus. He continued to be a hit at the circus and liked the girl more and more. However, people eventually stop laughing at his act and the girl that he was interested in became interested in a new man who joined the circus too. The new man and girl eventually got married even with the help of Chaplin who wishes he was the one marrying the girl instead. He did the right thing for the girl even though that's not necessarily what he wanted. Chaplin ended up staying behind when the circus left town again. The Circus was very entertaining and never really had any boring parts. It combined comedy with a little bit of romance which is something that I really enjoyed.

The Tramp's comedic episodes were innovative and fast paced, I wasn't bored for a second. Although the circumstances seemed a little extreme, the Tramp managed to be a relatable character who could resonate with the audience. Overall the cuts were smooth and made character actions look continuous and fluid. The unexpected twist at the end really solidified the Tramp as a layered character who was more than just a funny face. Chaplin managed to take some rather somber elements and place them in the lighthearted setting of the circus, resulting in an excellent comedy with perhaps a more serious implicit meaning.",

I think the musical accompaniment was definitely a help to the film and without its presence I wouldn't have been so interested and been paying attention for that long. The occasional cue card that came up to clarify what was happening in the film was definitely an asset to the film and something that the director did well. I found that they did not overuse these cue cards to distract from the overall art of silent filmmaking. I have ranked this film high because I thought it was very well done and after watching it I am surprised to say that I look forward to watching more silent films in the future!",

The story is very simple. It centers on a down on his luck Tramp, played by Chaplin. Chaplin's nameless character is hired by the circus because of his unintentional ability to make the audience roar with laughter. The story follows the Tramps experience in the circus, which includes a love interest, performance issues, and a lot of hilarious twists and turns. The strength of the film is quite simply Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin has the rare ability to make you laugh out loud repeatedly with a schtick that you have surely seen hundreds of times before. Simply put, Chaplin is masterful in this film and his timeless performance is a treat. Despite the simplicity of the plot by today's film standards, \"The Circus\" is a fun film to watch thanks to Charlie Chaplin's comedic genius.",

The movie does not disappoint with plenty of funny and tense moments throughout the film that keep you interested all the way through. The most suspenseful point of the movie for me was around the half way point where Charlie is confronted with one big cat. The movies music and characters expression fill the movie with plenty of emotion.The movie is a great inspiration for hope and happiness, something furthered by Charlie's final selfless act that brings happiness and content to everybody in the movie. Lastly my favorite part of the movie was the feeling of desperately wanting to see the end conclusion to the movies characters, Merna the abusive Ringmasters daughter being a prime example.",

However, I was quickly thrown into a black and white world reminiscent of the Three Stooges. The old fashioned slap stick comedy shows the audience that a movie does not need state of the art technology or witty and sarcastic dialogue to entertain an audience and make them laugh. In a world of much violence and unrest, and in a world that contains movies that center much around violence and unneeded drama, it was nice to see a simple and fun movie from the true days of Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin truly embodies a character that is timeless and memorable. The plot, as well as the comedy is simple, leaving more room to appreciate the comedy itself. The background music added to the comedy and all the comedic timing was incredibly perfect.

The cleverness and timing of Chaplins slapstick comedy and jokes where enough to enlightened the bitterest of teens.

This was the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen in my life, and I look forward to viewing more of them.

Though one reviewer pointed out that we are laughing at a man at his worst, he is homeless and alone. I think Chaplin is sending a message that even when one is at an all time low you can still enjoy life and move forward.

I love when someone stars in the movie they write and direct because it seems like he/she puts more effort into playing that part than if it was someone else.

The chase scene in the very beginning of the film was also great. It was a great introduction into the comedy of the movie, highlighted by Chaplin's robotic movements whilst pretending to be part of a giant cuckoo clock.The plot in this movie is not to be ignored. The Circus ended with a great moral and theme when Chaplin let the girl be with the tightrope walker because he knew he couldn't make her happy. The use of music in the movie was also great. Whenever the girl came on screen the music changed to a certain romantic tune. Also during the lion scene, the music got loud whenever the lion opened his mouth or roared. This subtle change in music really helped the overall feel of the movie and made it feel more clean and smooth.",

However, after viewing The Circus, such a drop in morale was severely misplaced. As a child of the internet, IPOD, and \"technology\" generation, a silent film from three quarters of a generation ago would hardly seem to be much of raving crowd-pleaser. Nonetheless, from Chaplin's voice singing the films opening song, to the stereotypical, yet surprising ending, this movie delivers all the way through. The fact that this movie was made in a period following a world war, with a depression seemingly around the corner, and a whole generation considered \"lost\", it would certainly be easy for the Hollywood of the time to touch on such pertinent issues. The fact that such a great comedy was made during this tumultuous time speaks volumes to the lengths that Chaplin would go to bring joy to others. It is clear to see why this movie was the 7th highest grossing silent film of all time.Chaplin is funny, yet extremely relate able in his role of the \"tramp\", something he is obviously well known and admired for. His comedic timing is spot on, as is his ability to effectively convey emotion, which is what ultimately draws the audience in. This movie opened my eyes to another whole genre of film, one that if given the chance, i am sure would receive rave reviews among my peer demographic. Admittedly, my initial skepticism kept me from becoming fully engrossed in the film at first, however, by the time Chaplin first debuts his \"talent\" upon showing up the circus, I was hooked.",

Silent filming needs to keep the audience captivated, and through many actions substituted for words, \"The Circus\" does this excellently. In particular, the \"mirror maze\" scene with Chaplin and the officer, the pirate ship, and the special effect used for Chaplin's double, were three scenes that amazed me.Silent films were once a bore but are now entertaining. It amazed me how actors, in this case Chaplin, could keep the film entertaining and moving along despite the silence.

Somehow, people would also find it funny when Chaplin would pretend he was technologically animated like some of the other dummies on the ship, because he was trying to escape from the police.I love what happens during this film, because there are a lot of funny elements in this one. The comedic elements are really good, because they are not done on purpose, and the audience in the tent loved almost everything about that. Even though the Ringmaster didn't really believe he was funny, he kept him in the circus for accidental comedy. This film happens to be Charlie Chaplin's best silent film ever made, because he was really funny, and the romance relationship with Merna and Tramp, and then Merna and Rex, really stand out when they're together.",

The very end of this film proves this goodness for certain, despite the fact that it is a surprisingly sad end for a film that's so often funny.

Once the film was over I ran home and told everyone about it. It's weird but I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is interested. It's worth the watch.",

With clean production and easy transitions between shots the movie is a technical masterpiece of the silent era. Early on in the movie multiple scenes involving fun house mirrors showcase Chaplins talent as both an actor and director. With a stellar performance by Chaplin and a solid supporting cast including the debut of actress Merna Kennedy the movie is easily one of Chaplin's greatest movies and one of the most accessible of silent films. Made toward the end of the \"Roaring Twenties\" the movie is fantastic and full of energy from the times.",

On command Charles character isn't funny, but is hysterical by just being himself. He ends up falling for the ringleaders daughter and you just have to watch to find out what happens between Charles and the ringleaders daughter. Charles brings a presence on stage that makes you keep your eyes glued to the screen. His facial expressions and reactions to situations are on point and knows how to bring out a punch line with just his body tone and facial expressions. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, and plan on watching more Charles Chaplin movies in the future.",

            "content": "I remembered viewing this movie a few years ago when I was away for the summer at a college program camp. I was 16 at the time and I recently went with my \"classmates\" to an old theater that played silent films and used a live orchestra for the sound. I remember really enjoying it and it was so much fun for me. After the night was over, I went back to our little dorms and, since we had wifi, I went on YouTube to look up more of Chaplin's work. I watched this one.That being said, it brought back so many good memories watching this lovely movie again. The second time around is better than I ever thought possible, especially for the time period this came from. I love how Chaplin is able to capture our hearts almost instantly, even if you didn't even know he existed beforehand. I can tell that a lot of care and attention was put into this movie, and it shows by how symbolic it can be. The time period this came from was from an era where women were just receiving rights, and to see Chaplin give respect to women when others abuse her is a major plus; it might also have to do with his divorce during its production, so I like how he brought his personal life to work with him, so to speak. I think it captures what kind of character Chaplin was, as well as in real life. It's a warm feeling that you don't experience when watching movies anymore, and it's almost nostalgic despite not being born in the late 1920's.Overall (I don't want to drag on), I found this movie to be highly enjoyable yet mature in its overall message-especially the ending. The Circus isn't sophisticated by any means, but I think what made it so popular was its ability to grip us at a human level, including myself as some 20-something. It made me fall in love with Charlie Chaplin all over again. \u2764 ~ Vicky",

Many comedies don't have a strong foundation and are only viewed to simply get a quick laugh. However, this movie is different. This film contains comedy, love, jealousy, corruption, etc. And this is why this film is so significant. Throughout the film, Charlie Chaplin can't seem to catch a break. From being chased by police officers and even circus animals, to losing his love to another man, Chaplin always seems to be keeping a positive attitude. Even when he is tricked into doing manual labor for the circus, he continues to work hard and sticks up for his love. As the movie goes on, Chaplin becomes the laughing stock of seemingly everyone. The fans laugh him for his goofiness and the staff doesn't show him the gratitude that he deserves. (Due to the fact that he is only funny when he isn't trying to be). But Charlie always seems to put others before him and that's what I admire most about him. From performing a stunt he had never attempted to the fans, to letting his love walk away, he continues to be selfless and this is not seen in many movies.",

Chaplin illicits many emotions and feelings through his gestures, the way he walks, and his slapstick comedy bits. From the very beginning, Charlie's character is very likable and you can't help but hope that everything goes his way. The films comedic values are also top notch for its time and even today.

It helped the audience connect with the actors even though there was no dialogue. I even felt a twinge of sadness at the end of the movie when Charlie let Merna marry the tight rope walker, putting her happiness before his own. It was the only bit of seriousness in the entire film, and that made it feel more real- rather than it just being a silly movie about a man at the circus, there was actual substance and emotions brought out, other than those of laughter.",

Chaplin's character is always highly expressive throughout, as are his costars. We really do not need sound to appreciate this movie. I actually would argue that it would take away from this film's true inner meaning. The music aids in engaging the viewer, amplifying the emotive acting by all. The camera direction is also a key player in this with it's many, many jump cuts. The first 5 minutes of the film sets up the audience perfectly for the rhythm of the rest of the film. Even if Chaplin isn't moving very much (such as the scene where he pretends to be robotic for a minute within the first 3 minutes. So not a spoiler! Haha), even if the overall mood is depressive, the world of The Circus never loses it's overflowing emotion that seamlessly flows into the audience nor does it ever lose our eager eyes. We're hungry for more and more of this world, the verisimilitude striking as the implicit and explicit meaning correlate to life so very frequently. The choice between what is right and what we want/what would directly benefit us or bring us immediate joy. Which are not always the same thing. At least initially. This is well communicated without the use of words, the film speaks volumes on it's own. A+ Charlie Chaplin!!",

I also found the directing in this movie to be outstanding. In the beginning of the movie there are some chase scenes with police that were done so well that it puts the best movies from more than 80 years later to shame. It's no wonder that Charlie Chaplin was one of the most famous people in the world while he was alive, it's only a shame that I am seeing one of his movies for the first time almost a century later.",

What I found remarkable about the acting, was that it was genuine. The facial expressions were great and generally you could get a laugh out of the most silly thing. It was realistic in a way that everyone knows the typical love triangle. Boy likes girl, girl falls in love with another boy and the love-struck boy has to make a choice.

We understand only what we see, so acting, facial expressions, camera shots, symbols, and implications are all really important. Chaplin does an excellent job of this, to the point where the intertitles are barely needed. Creating a film (even with a simple plot line) that makes sense, and connects with the audience on an emotional level without using dialogue as a crutch, is hard! I speak from experience. Silent films, especially ones that effectively convey their purpose, deserve more credit. This film shouldn't be contrasted or judged based on modern films. It's not a good film for its time period; it's just a good film. Technological limitations shouldn't influence whether it works or not.

The Circus is one of Chaplin's greatest movies, and it's not only underrated in this category but in the entire genre.

The actors had to have great use of facial expressions and body language to be able to convey the message they were trying to portray. The camera work was very creative. There were a lot of scenes where things would be sped during chases. This film has humor that is ageless. It is very universal. This film has captured audiences for generations and is still able to convey it's important messages through comedy. A must see to really appreciate the art of film.",

Never really having ever sat down and watched a full feature Silent Film, I didn't really know what to expect. There was fast paced music when there was something fast paced going on,for example when Charlie is being chased by the police in the fairgrounds area, and this music is also seen in the room of mirror scene, where the officer is chasing Charlie to capture him and it is a nice 5 minute stereo-typical slap-stick humor scene that you would have expected from Chaplin. Chaplin makes it so that you don't really realize that you are watching a Silent Film, unless you catch yourself thinking about it. I didn't expect the ending to be that of a happy one, containing a marriage between him and the woman that he saved from a life of abuse, but, I guess that's what makes it a typical Charlie Chaplin classic!",

I wasn't expecting it to be as a funny as it was because I'm used to the type of comedy today. The comedy was similar to the 3 Stooges where the characters were doing funny things like running into each other and then what I thought was the funniest was the mirror scene. Charlie was trying to get away from the cop and the mirrors made everything confusing to both. It made it even funnier because of how hard it was to get out. It was simple comedy that just isn't really around nowadays. The title goes perfectly with the movie because Circuses are supposed to be enjoyable and funny. Everything about this movie was funny and enjoyable. Everything that Charlie Chaplin did was humorous. He became the center of the show without even knowing it. He took the job to be around the circus leader's daughter. He just happened to be really funny doing his normal routines. The movie had a little bit of romance in it and some decisions Charlie had to make with the daughter, but for the most part it was comedy movie.",

It just proves Chaplin's true abilities because he didn't need a script to make a movie great. His actions and facial expressions tell the story. The soundtrack that Chaplin later wrote for the movie only adds to the effects of the film. There are a few different things happening at the same time, with the girl struggling with her abusive father, The Tramp struggling to get a job with the circus, and the woman the Tramp loves falling in love with another man, yet the audience is easily able to keep track of the story.",

The acting between Charlie Chaplin and Merna Kennedy was especially well played.

Some people think The Tramp was more \"unlikeable\" in his earlier days because he was more aggressive and wouldn't hesitate to fight back any opponent, but there were several moments throughout here that I'd wished for \"that\" Tramp to come back and kick more butt! In any case, another masterpiece by Chaplin the master. :-)BTW - I'm pleasantly surprised to read how many reviewers finally saw the light and were \"converted\" to the opinion that silent films could be and were great! (No) thanks to poor quality copies and improper running speeds, the silents developed a bad reputation among the later generations. However, thanks to modern restoration techniques, discoveries of better quality prints, and more public interest, we can see these old treasures for the priceless art that they are.If anyone besides me also thinks that most of today's movies are just cookie-cutter crap, but aren't familiar with silent films, then I know of a pleasant surprise that just may be in store for them! Well-done silents like \"The Circus\" are indeed a welcome relief from a simpler time but when quality DID matter! Back then and through the golden age of Hollywood, stories were told without CGI, inane dialogue, explicit nudity and violence, nihilistic world views, tasteless, gross-out sophomoric humor, etc... all the easy ways out filmmakers use today to get a reaction out of jaded audiences. Well, I say let what's old be new again and let fans see how well the old movies did a rather difficult thing, and that is entertain without all the empty sensationalism so prevalent today. :-)",

One thing about chaplin is that you can really feel the depth of the scene and the character's feelings just by his acting skills. His facial expressions are top tier in every single one of his film's including the circus. Another thing about his acting skills is that he every expression and act that he does is so organic that it is as if he is unintentionally funny. One scene specifically in \"the circus\" was when the ringmaster told charlie to be funny he was put on the spot but the minute that he was just \"being himself\" the scene was incredibly funny. He seemed lost and confused and trying so hard yet failing to do so which made everything funnier.",

The Circus was a pleasure to watch, it was upbeat and fast paced, constantly keeping the audience entertained. The humor used in the movie was quick and required little to no thought to understand, slapstick humor.Charlie Chaplin was fun to watch as he progressed through the movie, developing his character as the happy go lucky guy that stumbles into crazy situations, this time finding himself as an act in the circus. Not only does he find himself being the main attraction but he also finds himself attracted to the ringmaster's stepdaughter. The story continues as Chaplin finds himself in one gag after the next, until it ends with Chaplin leaving the circus and walks off to see what the world has next in stored for him. I consider this movie timeless; Charlie Chaplin perfects comedic timing bringing laughter to audiences in the 1920s and to present day.",

This is what I feel gives this film a special meaning. Yes, the plot is fairly basic: the Tramp falls in love with a girl he just met, but this does not make the plot lose any significance. What i found to be spectacular, however, has nothing to do with the plot. Being able to reflect emotions without sound is not easy, but you can clearly see a variety. Whether it is love, anger, confusion, it does not matter. Being able to show these emotions in a limited capacity is the most important factor when trying to convey the film's content. Slapstick comedy, of course, plays a large role in bringing the comedy to this film, and I am a huge fan of it. Overall, if you are unfamiliar with silent films, and just how well they can be made, I would highly suggest this film.",

Attending circuses from a young age, I knew in my head what type of music was being played while the clowns where up opposed to the quietness of when a performer is walking on a tightrope.

I can't say I was bored, but more so impatient or maybe even eager. Yeah, I was eager because what would the main character do next? What other kind of freak accident would occur now? Every joke, every trip or slip up, anything really, all of it was wonderful-- mostly due to the timing. The timing was AMAZING, especially with the animals. The fact that the animals did their part so perfectly surprised me. It's a lot easier to get them to work with you these days, with technology and all. But considering that the times were certainly different back then, I have to say, I'm deeply impressed. Slapstick humor is the best kind to be honest.What took me by surprise was the ending. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who thought the main character was going to run off with the girl and live happily ever after. Clich\u00e9, I know, but I think he deserved it after all the Hell he ran into throughout the entire film. When he decided to have her marry the other man the girl did fall for, it broke my heart. It really did catch me off guard, and maybe some other person in the classroom heard me go, \"Whoa, what, why!?\" Sounds kind of lame, but it made shed a tear or two.

My only conclusion would be that I saw it at the wrong time, as it's taxing for me to uncover its blemishes. The tight rope scene stalls a bit, and...um...well that's all.A feeling of sheer and absolute elation overwhelms me whenever I set my eyes upon that (unreasonably) hoity-toity, jealous, hopeful, and altruistic little tramp. And my heart, it shatters(!) the moment I see him in pain; when I see him constrained, watching the dropped-from-heaven sole bright spot of his life, being taken from him; or when he cowers away, out of fear of being seen for what he actually is; or when he's lonely. Which brings me to what I wanted to discuss \u2014 I wish I could say it was Chaplin, but I can only stretch out the compliments \"he's funny\" and \"his physical comedy is the best I've seen, bar none\" (Keaton has him beat in the gag department though) so far \u2014 the ending.Conflicted, conflicted, conflicted am I. One hand: I LOVE different. I was actually thinking about this days before; about how most of the silent comedies I've seen end with their protagonist, figuratively or literally, in the arms of a woman \u2014 and if not that, at least on a happy note. Which is why I appreciate The Circus' ending. To an extent. Because, on the other hand: I want the character, that I love so dearly, to be happy. I was teary-eyed at the sight of him all alone in that abandoned circle. I mentioned that I've seen this once before, and halfway through, while filled with joy, I was reminded of the not-so- happy ending that awaited me...and I didn't want it to be true. I hoped that I was mistaken, or that there was a clue, that I had previously missed, insinuating that he wouldn't be so alone. But, unfortunately...you know.

Not knowing much about Charlie Chaplin, nor seeing any of his other films, he was definitely enjoyable and comedic. (Now I understand why he was such a success during his career) I was very impressed to see just how much can be expressed both with facial expressions and full body gestures, when there are no words. Its amazing how many sounds our brain recognizes and is aloud to fill in the blanks. For example: the sound of a pie being thrown in someones face, or the roar of the lion in the cage. Also, as funny as this film was, it contained a contrasting amount of suspense. For example again, when Chaplin is stuck in the cage with the lion or his balancing on the high wire. \"The Circus\" was an over all success. It was a very fun film to watch and produced many good laughs.",

Two good parts are when he's auditioning for roles in the circus and failing miserably; and when he takes the tight rope walker's position and nearly kills himself. Charlie Chaplin does a good job of expressing what is going on regardless of the silence, and the song he sings at the beginning and end of the film is a nice touch.

I thought that a silent and very early film would lack some of the depth and action more modern films can capture, but The Circus managed to bring forth a different style of filming and more importantly acting, that made me feel perfectly content even though there was hardly any dialogue present. The style of acting that Chaplin employs with his very exaggerated facial expressions and physical movements and gags made me realize there doesn't need to be speech in order for there to be depth, comedy, and an interesting story. The attention to physical comedy is an old fashioned comedic routine, but it still proved hilarious even though it's something I typically viewed as being crude and childish beforehand. In addition to the comedy, there was a level of depth and feeling reached in this film, seen especially at the end when the \"Tramp\" lets go of the woman he loves and is left all alone in the field, that surprised me for such a comedic and seemingly whimsical movie.",

Chaplin's character goes through a great arc, and the how he ultimately ends the same way he started seems appropriate. He overcomes what he wants for the happiness of others. One thing I have against the film is how shallow the characters are. The father is very demanding, the girl is being held back, the boyfriend is nice, but each one of them do not have a backstory. The clowns seem generic, but I think they are somewhat interesting in that they aren't very good, but they are desperate for some kind of job, and so this is their job.Many of the humorous scenes were rightly called for by the plot, however others just felt unneeded, and done only for some cheap laughs.

His acting was so good, that dialogue was never truly needed to get some points across, it's all there. The music also aided him in moving the plot along and it made you excited, or made you feel his sadness when he finds out the girl he had his eye on is interested in someone else. The classic physical comedy that surpasses generations is all there in the police chase and when they run into the circus tent or even with the lion scene, there is no way to not find humor in this movie.

It has the makeup of a modern day movie, but also has the twists and turns necessary for an entertaining film of any generation. Upon further reflection, its poignant end makes the film seem more than it appears. All of the fluff of the 'bonked on the head' comedy can easily be stripped away to reveal a meaningful plot line. The slapstick comedy may not be everyone's taste, but it's important to keep in mind while watching silent films is that sharp wit cannot be easily attained without the spoken word. I'm not particularly fond of slapstick comedy, but although it wasn't laugh out loud for me, I still found it entertaining. If you're going to watch a silent film for the acknowledgment of its genre, this is definitely a go- to.",

His eccentric tramp character accompanied by ridiculous situations and over the top clumsiness provide for an hour of almost uninterrupted laughs. Now normally I would agree that sound makes for a better movie but here it would only damper Chaplin's film. The only sounds needed here are the films soundtrack and accompanying sound effects. The silence of the characters surrounding noise really accentuates when there's a loud bang or crash; making the moment when Chaplin falls into a barrel or trips over a hay bale all the more funny. This movie is a perfect example of why these slapstick films were the kings of the silent film era. In many silent films you may have a scene stopping almost every 10 seconds so you may read what the characters are saying or your scratching your head wondering whats going on waiting till the moment the dialog or explanation flashes up on the screen. With slapstick films you barley have any dialog or explanatory slides because it's made up of physical comedy so you must simply watch the over exaggerated movements of the characters and wacky shenanigans going on and you instantly are sucked in to whats going on.

Perhaps most notable about The Circus is Chaplin's emphatic use of body language and facial expressions, both of which aid the audience in understanding the happenings of the film and provide the storyline with fluidity. Also helpful in setting the tone of the film was the score, which I was not surprised to learn was added about forty years later.

The music is also spot on, especially in scenes with The Tramp and his love interest \"Merna\", played by Merna Kennedy. Musical backing meshes beautifully with Chaplin's already astounding performance and takes it to the next level.

I can't say I have really sat down and watched a silent film... the only silent film I can remember watching had the actress Norma Desmond in it. In The Circus starring Charlie as \"the tramp\" I found to be hysterical. I could not stop laughing and I was completely lost in the film. I didn't even realize the words were missing. Granted it was a little odd to have to read, but it's similar to subtitles, so it wasn't uncomfortable nor did it take away from the film. The Tramp played by Charlie was only accidentally funny. The fact that he didn't realize his own miss- hap's made him such a big hit! I kept waiting for the tramp to realize that he was the hit, but he never did until he was informed. The pickpocket scene is hysterical and I couldn't stop laughing. The facial expressions mixed with the music gave it a really nice flow and kept you guessing what's coming next. I also enjoyed the part where the tramp and the original pickpocket guy are pretending to be the machine characters. I also enjoyed how he was so awkward with the circus rider (the Ring Master's daughter). I love the scene where she hasn't eaten in days and starts eating his slice of bread. When goes to sit next to the tramp (Charlie) and he decides to share his slice and every time he turns around she is shoveling down the bread. No matter how he try's to slow her down she finishes even before he can take a bite. The film had a really nice flow to it and everything made sense. I did find it sad, but sweet that in the end the tramp (Charlie) let's the ring master's daughter go and marry the tight rope walker because he is better off than him. It was a funny movie with a slightly depressing ending, but I enjoyed every moment of it!",

Being a silent film and all, I didn't know how a 70 minute silent comedy would appeal to me - but in all honesty I couldn't have been more impressed.Though it was made in 1928, it seemed as though it was much ahead of its time. The brilliant mind of Charlie Chaplin worked wonders with this film, though apparently it wasn't one of his more popular ones (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times). The amazing camera direction was present throughout the film (especially the House of Mirrors sequence) and Chaplin's quirky and awkward expressions made the film highly enjoyable. I almost felt a sense of pity for Chaplin at times over the duration of the film. Nonetheless, I was entertained throughout. Once many viewers hear that a film is black and white, they are immediately turned off. And once it's mentioned that it's a silent film nonetheless, its likely that they won't even give the film a chance. But give this a chance. It's a classic comedic film by arguably one of the greatest cinematic performers of all time. Bravo, Mr. Chaplin.",

Charlie Caplin not only directs this movie but he also stars in it, which I feel helps give his sense of personality and comedy. I was surprised as to how funny the movie actually was, even without any sound. I was able to follow the story line very without any difficulty.The way Charlie opens the film, with Merna Kennedy swinging on rings, and then having that part repeat later on in the movie was clever but also gave me a feeling in the beginning that it was going to be a serious and gloomy film, which it is not at all.The Circus is a different type of comedy then we, in society now, are used to. You aren't laughing at what anyone says, you are laughing at the whole story line together and the characters actions. Charlie Chaplin also surprised us at the end by not having the main character, being him, get the girl. We are used to films having happy endings, which in not saying this one didn't, but usually we are rooting for the main character who we've gotten to know so well to get what he deserves (usually the girl).",

Whether it is running from the police or failing to impress the ringmaster, these are converted into undeniable humor with the physical comedic timing of Chaplin and his costars. Upon my first viewing I was struck by the diversity of the inter-titles. Though these were clearly widely used in silent movies, those in The Circus designated not only setting, but also lines of dialogue and even moods. The simplicity of one, \"Hungry.\", in between shots of the ringmaster's daughter (Merna Kennedy), has particularly stuck with me. The addition of the soundtrack in 1969 definitely adds to the experience. As we don't generally have showings with live pianists this became common practice (and thank you to the composers and musicians who have spent decades arranging this music) for obvious reasons. The novelty of having Charlie Chaplin sing the opening number (\"Swing Little Girl\") added to the novelty of seeing my first silent film.",

Remember it is still an old film so you will see some fast-forward running for comedy but still fits. Just like Charlie running away from the police or a donkey chasing him the seen may be seen faster than what really happened. As the slapstick comedy continues Charlie finds more problems other than getting money or keeping a job. He finds a nice woman in his life but of course finds more problems with that.All together the film was great and really should have been more popular than it was for Chaplin's films.

This movie didn't have those issues. I don't know what was considered \"special effects\" in the late 20s, but it must've been different from what we have now, because I didn't notice any of the usual issues I have with older effects, I.e. being obviously fake. There were some editing cuts that had characters moving to where they weren't before, but it was almost unnoticeable. As for the other issue, this movie doesn't have any spoken dialogue. When the cards tell us what the characters are saying however, the dialogue is generic enough that it doesn't feel so out of place from what I might say today. But even if I couldn't hear the dialogue, this movie's comedy relies on the physical, and it delivers perfectly. A problem I have with newer movies is that some of the comedy may be crude, but here the comedy was enjoyable and kid friendly. All in all, this movie has shown me that older movies aren't always worse than their newer, more sleek counterparts.",

This type of comedy would be propelled through time to shows like \"The Three Stooges\" which aired its television appearance for the first time 2 decades later in 1949.

The Circus serves as sure evidence for this, from its start (the opening title cards are accompanied by Chaplin's own soulful strains, reminiscent of Al Jolson in his later years) to the especially poignant finale. This episode finds the Tramp pursued, as ever, by ill fate, finding refuge in the chaos of a classic 20th century circus. This time, however, the Tramp finds himself an often adoring audience, although their delight in his antics is limited by their total lack of appreciation for his actual attempts to entertain them. Only when swept up in the moment, reacting rather than calculating, does he receive applause. It seems more than likely that Chaplin wrote a great portion of his own experience into the picture; the film ends with the Tramp left behind, the circus packed up and rolling on, much as film studios did with silent film and its stars following the release of The Jazz Singer the same year. The writer and the viewer can however take some measured comfort in the message of the film: no matter the calamities and indignities of life, authentic acts of compassion and creation are more meaningful, more enduring, than the crowd's applause.",

We are spoon fed so much when it comes to entertainment, it was nice to allow my imagination to wonder just a little bit.

The one scene that I can't seem to get over is the mirror maze, for even though I watched it several times, I don't see any hint of the camera in the mirrors and I'm fascinated that they were able to manage that without the advanced film editing we have now. The most touching thing about this movie for me was actually the part that did not accompany the original release, the soundtrack. According to the Trivia section here and also to the Wikipedia site for the movie, Chaplin went back later to record the track that plays over the title and credits and also composed the music to accompany the entire movie. He manages to maintain the feeling of a circus through the music alone, and while I wouldn't watch it again, I would listen to the music again.",

He shows comedy through accidents that the \"Little Tramp\" does without realizing people are watching for their own amusement. The irony within the Circus is the actual performances before the \"Little Tramp\" entered the film were not funny to the audience. Chaplin also shows a meaning of how unexpected occurrences can turn into beneficial things. For example the way the \"Little Tramp\" was brought into the circus crew. As many of you know during the making of this particular film Chaplin experienced many obstacles that would in some cases make people quit what they are doing but he proceeded in making The Circus which later became one of his well known films. In the film I feel there is a meaning that shows even though bad things may occur it can lead to something good and well worth going through those obstacles to achieve the end result.

As my first silent film ever, I was shocked to find myself laughing at many parts out loud. One scene that seemed to stick with me, was the one in which Chaplin washes fish within a fish bowl, with a rag. It was simple physical comedy that took you by surprise. Elegant in an almost mathematical way...like the quick est path to make you laugh. This is a film that has fared extremely well, considering much of the class I was viewing it with was laughing...LAUGHING...at a movie made for people almost 100 years ago. Somehow Chaplin's pantomimes, creative visual comedy, amazing back up cast that got their characters across beautifully with little to no dialogue, and simple shooting ideas (such as the room with mirrors and one camera) that produced a complex and entertaining shot, all combined to create a film that could stand the test of time.",

The film is composed of many great scenes such as the \"house of mirrors\" and the \"barber shop\" bits which are strokes of genius. I think one of my favorite scenes has to be the \"tight rope scene\" which is very well done and entertaining to watch. The plot for a comedy, has surprising depth towards the end.

It's too bad that the main character doesn't get the girl in the end. However, it was very comical to see how he becomes a huge celebrity quite by accident.

I brought up in my film class that his facial expressions are excellent. As with any movie where he portrays \"Tramp,\" you understand exactly what he thinking by his facial movements. Most noticeably for me, his eyebrows. In \"The Circus,\" it was very interesting to see the old school, slapstick humor. You don't see that too much these days. The part where Chaplin was auditioning for the role and kept moving the chair from under the Ringleader was a simple way to get the audience to laugh. After doing that a few times he catches himself and keeps the chair where it was, showing a relieved face. As much as I like the 'old school' approach, I enjoyed how relevant the movie actually ended up being. I am a big fan of when a movie does not end up with everyone 'winning.' Tramp didn't really win here; the girl that is. Growing up with mainly movies from the 90's, it was refreshing to have a movie not finish with everyone coming out happy and on top. Saying that, Tramp is seen going on his way after the circus begins to roll out. I thought the movie was a good contrast of what I'd expect from a movie made in 1928 with a surprisingly modern touch.",

He managed to balance riotous humor and an interesting, well-written love story into one feature length film without cheapening either, and he did it all without sound. It's incredible to me that Chaplin is able to lend (almost 100% slapstick) humor to practically every scene while still maintaining verisimilitude, and without interrupting the pacing of the movie. It's hard for me to think of comedies on an even level with more serious-minded films, and, despite that, The Circus and many of Chaplin's other films brush aside my internal stigmatization. If more modern comedies had that kind of vitality, maybe I would laugh with them instead of at them.",

The Circus was a new experience for me as it was the first silent movie that i have ever seen. Chaplin uses this to his advantage in the movie, sometimes it makes scenes funnier because it allows for ones imagination to take play with the visuals on the screen. The humor of The Circus is a more slapstick like style, but i'm not 100% sure how to classify it. In terms of meaning, The Circus has messages of love, wanting, and learning the appreciation of others wants as well as your own. In the movie, the tramp falls in love with a woman, but she falls for another man (many believe this is a reference to Chaplins failed marriage that was ending as this movie was being produced), and the tramp has to eventually let go of her and let her be happy. The tramp's arch comes full circle when he gets the girl and her love interest to marry each other. He realizes that the happiness of those he cares about is just as important, maybe more important that his own happiness. Overall, this is an awesome movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to start watching silent movies, as this is a great jumping point. 8/10",

The little tramp can only be funny spontaneously, and all the ring master's attempts at training him to be a clown fail, so the boss hires the tramp on as a janitor, whom he finds ways to put out in front of the crowd at showtime. Of course the ring master has a beautiful step-daughter (Merna Kennedy). The tramp falls in love with her and tries to win her affection. The Circus does deviate in the end from other standard, and it's final scene is quite effective. Overall, a sweet comedy that I rate an 8 out of 10.",

Charlie Chaplins ability to mix comedy and tragedy flawlessly never ceases to amaze me. His ability to convey emotions based solely on non-verbal communication is legendary in its ability to affect people. I found this movie to be very entertaining in many aspects. The comedy found in this movie remains funny to this day, which in my opinion cant usually be said about many classic comedies from the silent film era. Its been said that Mr. Chaplin was a perfectionist and would shoot his takes over and over and over until he was one hundred percent satisfied with the outcome. I find that you can see this perfectionist attitude in everything from the way the scenes were shot to every little nuance in the characters movements and facial expressions. Charlie's energy is unfailingly invigorating in all of his comedy scenes and his ability to capture an emotion based solely on facial expressions and body language was so keen that even a class full of people who usually cant drag themselves away from their cell phones for 10 minutes and usually cant enjoy a movie unless its full of stunning visual effects and unnecessary 3D scenes to hold their attention found themselves immersed and completely involved in the characters and the twists and turns of the plot. I think the ending of the movie was my favorite part as it didn't follow the usual cookie cutter happy ending that many movies tend to go for and was very unexpected and strangely satisfying. When the circus was moving away and Chaplin was left standing in the empty area, presumably thinking about all of the experiences he had at the circus and about the love which he had knowingly given away for the sake of his loves happiness the sadness and disappointment were so thick in the air you could cut it with a knife.As one of my first silent film experiences The Circus has left me with a very good impression and has made me want to explore this genre of movies that I had up until watching this film considered somewhat inferior to modern films. In fact after viewing how genuine and original this film felt as compared to the many movies which come out today and all seem to follow the same basic plot I almost feel that the age of silent films may have significantly more substance and emotional content than the modern movie scene.",

Not to undermine the creativity of a cinematic genius such as Mr. Chaplin, but the movie rode on the necessities of life. For example, in the beginning of the movie Chaplin finds himself a menace with no meaning, alluding to the restless attempt of minors to find a direction for life. Being chased by officers and comedically guided to his lost purpose, entertainment. From that to being wowed with Merna Kennedy. He already moved on to the ideals of settling down, also discovering the problems that come with such as the tightrope walker. And being a novice to the film world I don't know the terminology for these occurrences but the movie stays light throughout. With classical scenes such as the sped up running sequence. And the famous god complex of the audience knows Chaplin to be hidden among the live action figures while the police officers remain looking for him. Sense such as these offer comedic relief to the viewer by removing some of the hard hitting realistic issues they are connecting to Chaplin with.The end of the movie although sad remains airy and not dense with the realities of Chaplin's sorrow, seeing as the love of his life and her new husband have left the town and he stayed behind unbeknownst to their bargaining with the ring master to keep him on regardless of all the messes that he's created in the short time he's worked with them. He sadly sits in the outline that once symbolically held his purpose. Now the dialogue slides, they presented the minimum needed descriptors to make the movie understandable yet not too much as to keep the audience's mind engaged with their own presumptions and understanding. And to be honest that's what was needed at the time because not a phone in sight and the entire world looked as happy as could be. Which brings me back to my original point of simplicity lived during the time of the movie and the ability of portraying much deeper meaning to movies than what meets the eye. All thanks to the great mind of Charlie Chaplin.",

Even though it was a comedy there were some dramatic moments that felt sincere and moving and the actors had no trouble playing it a bit more serious when needed. For being made in 1928 the movie seems extremely advanced. There were some stunts and effects such as the room of mirrors and The Tramp walking the tightrope that were just absolutely amazing. This movie is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "I never thought I would ever take much interest in silent films, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found this movie to be funny, adorable, entertaining, impressive, and overall very likable. The man portrayed by Charlie Chaplin progressively became a very lovable character and as the film reached an end, I managed to love him even more. With a lack of voice, there was a need to exaggerate comical gestures and expressions, and I think that's what made me like this movie from the start. However the movie did lack some emotional depth but honestly I didn't think that mattered. This movie is something I would watch just to cheer myself up on a bad day, knowing it will always put a smile on my face. Seeing this film has changed my opinion on silent movies and hopefully opens a doorway to even more classic wonders.",

Chaplin's sequencing was fabulous. He could tell a story without sound like no other. This film had some great acting all throughout with very little room for error. You as a viewer can tell that Chaplin wants his films to be of the highest quality and he pulled through very well on this. Giving characters layers is something I thought was going to be brought into films later on when you have sound and better quality, but Chaplin pulled through very well. While I would love to see what he could do with sound and a bigger budget, he made a very well rounded film. He was the master of silent films. And this didn't disappoint.",

            "content": "The Circus was one of a handful of Chaplin movies I hadn't yet seen, and it displays his romantic and social justice hallmarks in spades. Though he plays around with a distinctly American version of perseverance, and asks a timeless question of what humor is, it's hard to imagine a movie like this being bankrolled today. Poverty doesn't seem to be nearly as \"virtuous\" or relatable in our world anymore, at least not within the confines of a comedy. If there's a message movie here, however, it's buried in enough gags and heartstring tugs that the progressive message within doesn't ever beat you over the head, and might even sail right by. Chaplin knows that you can't fake funny, exemplified in perhaps my favorite scene -- his audition. In his way, he might even be critiquing the producers and money men who bankrolled his stuff, maybe some of his audience too. There is a pervasive vibe throughout the movie, a battle between what people expect and what is delivered, what people think they want and what they actually might prefer. I loved it. A lot of Chaplin's movies can get bogged down in the Message, but this was airy and light and capable. There were really adorable piglets and squirrel monkeys also, so if you enjoy either of those critters (and want a genuine romance thrown in too) you could do worse than spending an hour with this movie!",

The movie never quite captured me fully allowing me to forget that i was watching a movie.a huge problem with this is it tries to be something it's not.This is a Comedy and it tries to be a romance.The Outlandish humor of this movie is its largest redeeming quality.

It's easy to get caught up in the absurd moments, however there is a deeper message. The Tramp, while outwardly appears as just a rascal with a gift for comedy, he displays a depth of character that is missed in some movies of today. The amount of work Chapman must have put into this production is astounding, not to mention the fact that he wrote, directed and performed. Underlying the theme of humor, is the suggestion that the best thing to do in life is to make sure the ones you care about are happy. The film was very touching, and is absolutely a must see for movie fans",

            "content": "I want to start of this review by saying that I am not a major silent film buff. With that said I do want to say that this is also my first silent film that I have ever watched in my life even though I do consider myself a pretty big film buff. So with all those factors to consider I hope you can understand my 5 rating. I gave this movie a 5 because it is not awful to watch and there was a good amount of time in this movie were I enjoyed myself but I honestly do not think that I would ever re-watch this movie ever again. There was tons of times in this movie were I was to be honest bored out of my mind and even just looked at my phone a few time which is something that I almost never do when watching a film. Now this is not because it is a boring movie but mainly because even in bad movies with sound where there is noise coming from the screen from someones mouth even if I don't care about what they are saying or if it is bad acting I am still usually watching the movie but in this movie when characters are talking to each other and there is no sound I just end up losing interest. I hope that last part was not to confusing to people but it was kind of hard to put it to words but basically when there would normal be sound coming from characters and its not in this movie was usually boring except in its comedic parts. This brings me to the good of this movie. Most of this review has been negative but I don't want you to this I am hating on this movie because I do realize that Chaplin was a amazing filmmaker and his movies are amazing for the technology that they had at the time. The best part of this movie definitely has to be its comedic parts. If this movie had no comedy in it I would give it a 0/10 that's how impotent the comedy in this movie is to me. This movie had a ton of comedic parts to it and they did a great job at making this movie funny even with the inability to use jokes that most movies rely on today like people saying stupid stuff and dick jokes. With all that said if you are a fan of silent films you will most likely love this movie and if you want to watch your first silent movie then this would be a great start, but I will most likely never re-watch this movie and although there were enjoyable moments in this movie it was not good enough for me to say that I would re-watch it which is a very important quality in a movie that I look for because if a movie is good enough to watch multiple times then I can consider it one of my favorite or just a really good movie.",

For a silent film, it stands strong against some of the great sound films, and for coming out around the same time as sound was introduced in films, this movie can definitely hold its own. This is a film not easily forgotten. Chaplin's brand of comedy; as seen through the Tramp kept me in stitches. The chemistry between all the characters was well perceived too. They all formed a nice cohesive and believable Circus Troupe. This film is a must for any and all that enjoy a nice laugh without the complex and intricate jokes.",

In my opinion Charlie Chaplin is the KING of it. When he was eating the donut out of the kids hand, or when he is getting chased by the horse throughout the movie. It's the little things that keep you interested throughout the film when you feel that the plot may be getting too serious, or too dragged out. However, it was definitely worth watching.",

One thing that really stood out to me in this film was the way everyones emotions and reactions looked. You can clearly tell just by the facial gestures and motions whenever someone looked happy, sad, angry, or surprised. I don't even think the dialouge boxes were not even that necessary to see figure out what was going on, or what was about to happen. Another thing I liked about this movie was the music that was played throughout the film. To me it seems like music in films also tends to help play moods within the film out. (For example sad music goes hand in hand with a sad scene or moment.) Overall, great film.",

The end result is a marvelous array of skits and comedic situations that leave the viewer in awe to see that this silent comedy still has its lust after all these years.

I was happily surprised by how entertaining I found the movie. I found what was really humorous was how the character of the tramp was at his funniest when he didn't realize it. He was the funniest at the circus when he was running away from the police and when he was working as a hired hand and fumbling around the circus ring. I found it interesting how during the parts of the movie where the ring master is telling him to \"be funny,\" that's when he wasn't able to.I liked that the movie didn't end in the typical way you would expect. Usually, the main character meets the girl, they fall in love, and if there is any love triangle in the movie, typically the main character is the one who \"ends up with the girl.\" In this movie, it ends with him letting go of his attachments with her and helping her end up with the man that she fell in love with, instead of trying to \"win her back.\" At the end of the movie, the female character rides off with her new husband to her happily ever after, while the tramp is left alone and just sort of drifts off at the end.

Charlie Chaplin plays the role of a pauper aka The Tramp and does a fantastic job of making the audience laugh.

The setting of a circus is perfect for the tramp's goofy antics which are hilarious however as I said it never moves to far past that. That being said as is the case with any Chaplin film The Circus is a great watch and contains some very funny moments. I even believe some of his best pantomime such as the the police chase in the beginning within and outside of the funhouse.
